      This study evaluates the performance of the CorPath 200 System to deliver guide wires and
      balloons to blockages in the arteries of the leg.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CorPath 200 System is currently marketed for remotely delivering guide wires, balloons
      and stents to blockages in the coronary arteries. This study will evaluate the feasibility of
      CorPath 200 System to deliver guide wires and balloons to blockages in non-coronary arteries.

      Guide wires and balloons are delivered to blockages in the lower limbs manually by doctors.If
      this study shows that guide wires and balloons can be safely delivered to blockages in the
      lower limbs, then it will be an alternative for physicians.

          -  General Inclusion

               1. At least 18 years of age;

               2. Symptomatic disease: presence of critical limb ischemia (including tissue loss or
                  rest pain), or lifestyle-limiting claudication requiring intervention in iliac
                  and/or superficial femoral arteries;

               3. The subject or the legally authorized representative has been informed of the
                  nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written
                  informed consent.

          -  Angiographic Inclusion

        Presence of superficial femoral artery and/or iliac stenosis (&gt;50%) or occlusion of up to
        50 mm in length as determined by angiogram prior to index interventional procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  General Exclusion

               1. Failure/inability/unwillingness to provide informed consent;

               2. Target vessel has been previously treated with bypass;

               3. Has an abdominal aortic aneurysm contiguous with the iliac artery target lesion;

               4. Has contraindication to anticoagulation;
