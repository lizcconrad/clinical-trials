      This is a prospective, multicenter phase II trial designed to determine efficacy and safety
      of Bortezomib plus Rituximab plus Bendamustine in patients with relapsed/refractory
      Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.

      The progression free survival (PFS) expected for lymphoplasmacytic/lymphoplasmocytoid
      lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia with the same characteristics indicated into the study
      and treated with standard Rituximab plus chemotherapy may be estimated to be 50% at 18
      months.

      The Investigators would consider a positive result to increase 18 months-PFS rate from 50 to
      65%.

    <description>This is a prospective, multicenter phase II trial designed to determine efficacy and safety of Bortezomib plus Rituximab plus Bendamustine in patients with relapsed/refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Primary Objective is to assess whether the experimental treatment achieves an absolute increase of PFS rate from 50 to 65% at 18 months with respect to the standard treatment. PFS is measured from the beginning of therapy to the date of disease progression, relapse or death from any cause.
Patients without any relapse at the end of the follow-up will be censored at their last assessment date.</description>

    <description>Overall response rate (ORR): a patient is defined as a responder if he has a complete or very good partial or partial response, evaluated in based on Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia consensus recommendations of the 6th International Workshop on Waldestrom's macroglobulinemia.</description>

    <description>Overall survival (OS): measured from the beginning of therapy to the date of death from any cause. Patients alive at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of the last contact. Minimum follow up time required for all patients will be 2 years.</description>
