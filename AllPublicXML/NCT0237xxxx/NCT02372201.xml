      Study objectives: Analysis of consequences of Hydro Colon Therapy plus probiotic intervention
      on GI microbiota and well being.

      Study group: 78 subjects, inclusion criteria: 20-50yrs; under consultation at doctors or
      nutritionists because of claimed food inconveniences or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. exclusion
      criteria: antibiotics treatment and specified complex diseases.

      Intervention: Hydro colon therapy 2- 5 washes within 3 weeks. probiotic intervention after
      end of Hydro colon therapy for 6 weeks ( DUOLAC® bacterial strains per capsule: Lactobacillus
      plantarum, Streptococcus thermophiles, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus,
      Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Bifidobacterium breve,
      fructooligosaccharides, 200 µg folic acid, 2.50 µg vitamin B12 and 55 µg selenium (all
      amounts corresponding to 100% of daily requirement). Control group: Vitamin B complex: 10µg
      cobalamin, 450µg folic acid, and 55 µg selenium.

      Sample collection: standardized Feces collection, T1, before colon hydrotherapy, T2,
      immediately after colon hydrotherapy 2-5 washes of fasting ; T3, after six weeks of probiotic
      or Control intervention Analysis: standardizes food frequency questionnaire before and after
      intervention.

      Feces analysis based on 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) PCR DGGE and quantitative PCR (qPCR) and
      bioinformatic analysis.
