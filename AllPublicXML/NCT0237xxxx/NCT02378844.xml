      The study period will begin with a four week run-in period, during which there is no
      investigational treatment. The purpose of the run-in period will be observation for baseline
      comparison.

      The run-in period will be, followed by a 12 week randomized period when the subjects will be
      randomized (1:1) to either active treatment or sham (inactive) treatment.

      The randomized period will be followed by a 24 week open label period, where the subjects in
      the sham treatment group will switch in treatment assignment and receive a gammaCore®-R and
      the gammaCore®-R will continue to receive an active treatment.
