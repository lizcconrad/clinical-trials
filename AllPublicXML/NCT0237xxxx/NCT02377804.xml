  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability due to the presence of spasticity.
      Different needling techniques, including Botulinum Toxin A are proposed for management of
      spasticity; however results are conflicting. The presence of spasticity in the upper
      extremity implies several impairments for daily life activities. No study has investigated
      the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature of the
      shoulder region in patients who had suffered a stroke. The investigators will conduct a
      randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of the inclusion of deep dry needling
      into a rehabilitation program over the musculature of the shoulder region, pressure pain
      hyperalgesia and range of motion in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators
      hypothesize that patients receiving dry needling into the spastic shoulder musculature would
      exhibit greater improvements in spasticity, pressure sensitivity and range of motion than
      those who will not receive the intervention.

    <description>Spasticity in the affected ankle joint will be evaluated with the Modified Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS). The examiner passively moved the upper extremity in a stretching direction of each muscle (shoulder depression, shoulder external rotation, shoulder internal rotation, and shoulder abduction 90º combined with external rotation, respectively), back and forth at least 5 times and evaluated the degree of resistance to the movement on a scale from 0-4</description>

    <description>The experimental intervention will consist of 3 sessions, one per week, of 45min of physical therapy including mobilizations of the scapular region, manual therapies targeted to decrease muscle tone, neuromodulatory techniques for spasticity and proprioceptive exercises for the upper extremity. In addition, during this intervention patients will also receive deep dry needling with disposable stainless steel needles (0.3mm x 50mm) that will be inserted into the skin over taut bands of the spastic musculature of the shoulder area: upper trapezius, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and pectoralis mayor</description>
