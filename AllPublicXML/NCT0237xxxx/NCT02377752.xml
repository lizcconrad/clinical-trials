    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). The main purpose of Part A is to evaluate
      safety and side effects of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin in Japanese
      participants with a group of rare cancers (advanced solid tumors, especially advanced soft
      tissue sarcoma [STS].) The main purpose of Part B is to evaluate how much olaratumab gets
      into the blood stream of Japanese participants with advanced solid tumors and how long it
      takes the body to get rid of it.

             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Have unstable angina pectoris, angioplasty, cardiac stenting, or myocardial infarction

          -  Have a known allergy to any of the treatment components.

          -  Have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of chemical or biologic
             composition similar to that of olaratumab.

          -  Have a known active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection

          -  Have a corrected QT interval of greater than 470 milliseconds (msec) on screening
             electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that, in the judgment of the investigator and
             sponsor, may affect the interpretation of results.
