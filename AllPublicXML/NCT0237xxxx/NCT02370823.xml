      The primary objective of this study is to determine the levels of proteins and/or cellular
      components of the synovial fluid that are indicative of microenvironment phenotypes of the
      osteoarthritic knee compared to unilateral unaffected joints pre-injection to 6 weeks
      post-Regenexx速 SD treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the levels of proteins and/or cellular
      components of the synovial fluid that are indicative of microenvironment phenotypes of the
      osteoarthritic knee compared to unilateral unaffected joints pre-injection to 6 weeks
      post-Regenexx SD treatment (day 0).

      Secondary objective is an evaluation of possible direct and/or indirect associations between
      the measured levels of proteins and/or cellular components of the synovial fluid in the
      osteoarthritic knee joint with the administration of the Regenexx SD treatment. The secondary
      objective will include MRI evidence of cartilage repair; incidence of post-operative
      complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention; change in pain score
      and use of pain medications.

    <description>20 subjects with unilateral knee osteoarthritis. Collection of synovial fluid from both knees will serve as the experimental condition, i.e. the osteoarthritic knee, and the matched control, i.e. the knee not demonstrating signs of osteoarthritis. Alterations in the concentration of the synovial fluid proteins and cellular components will be evaluated up to 6 weeks post-Regenexx速 SD - Same Day Bone Marrow Concentrate Injection treatment.</description>
