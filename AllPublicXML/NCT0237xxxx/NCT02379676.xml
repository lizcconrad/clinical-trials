  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on
      endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation

      Ticagrelor will lead to beneficial pleiotropic effects compared with treatment with
      clopidogrel in patients receiving a drug-eluting stents (DES) during percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) for non-ST-segment acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) beyond 1 month after
      the index event. Ticagrelor treatment will improve percent flow-mediated dilation (FMD)
      values and reduces inflammatory gene expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

      The primary objective of this study lies in whether ticagrelor improves endothelial
      dysfunction compared to clopidogrel, measured by endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation
      (FMD). The secondary objective is to demonstrate whether ticagrelor has an
      anti-atherosclerotic effect compared to clopidogrel in terms of reducing systemic low-grade
      inflammation. Endpoints are 1) difference of flow-mediated dilation values, and 2) messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression measured by quantitative real-time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of inflammation-associated key genes in
      circulation monocytes between non-ST-segment acute coronary syndrome patients treated with
      ticagrelor and clopidogrel.

      Patients who agree to participate study are screened at Visit 1 (30 ~ 365 days after index
      percutaneous coronary intervention). Patients with endothelial dysfunction defined as
      screening flow-mediated dilation are randomly assigned at Visit 2 (0~7 days after screening
      test). And then, patients should receive study drugs according to allocated groups from the
      day of randomization. Ticagrelor 90mg twice daily or clopidogrel 75mg daily will be
      maintained for 30 days. Flow-mediated dilation are performed at screening and at Visit 3 (day
      30 from the treatment of study drugs) and blood sampling are performed before the first dose
      of study drugs at Visit 2 and at Visit 3.
