          -  measurable disease.

          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (Section 8.1).

          -  Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority GOG protocol, if one exists. In
             general, this would refer to any active GOG Phase III protocol.

          -  GOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients should be free of active infection requiring antibiotics (with the exception
             of uncomplicated UTI).

          -  Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one
             week prior to registration. Hormonal therapy will not count as a prior regimen (either
             cytotoxic or non-cytotoxic).

          -  Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy and
             immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least three weeks prior to registration.

          -  Any prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 2 weeks prior to registration.

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed since the patient underwent any major surgery (for
             example, hysterectomy, resection of a metastatic nodule); placement of a central
             venous catheter is considered minor, not major and thus time from a minor procedure
             until treatment on study may be shorter than 4 weeks.

          -  Patients must have had at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for management of
             leiomyosarcoma.

             leiomyosarcoma, for a total of two prior lines of therapy.

          -  Patients must have NOT received any non-cytotoxic (biologic or targeted) agents as
             part of their primary treatment or for management of recurrent or persistent disease.
             (Patients who were previously treated on GOG 0250, a randomized trial of
             gemcitabine-docetaxel plus bevacizumab or placebo, are eligible, provided that the
             patient is known to have been treated on the placebo-containing arm and did not
             receive prior bevacizumab)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl (1.5 x 109/L).

             transfusion within 7 days of screening assessment.

          -  Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL (133 umol/L) or, if &gt;1.5 mg/dl, then
             calculated creatinine clearance must be greater than or equal to 30 mL/min.

          -  Hepatic function:

               -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN (subjects with Gilbert's syndrome and
                  elevations of indirect bilirubin only are eligible).

                  equal to 2.5 x ULN.

               -  Subjects who have BOTH bilirubin greater than ULN and AST/ALT greater than ULN
                  are not eligible. (Specifically, if bilirubin is greater than 1 x ULN but less
                  than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, THEN the AST and ALT must be less than or equal to
                  ULN for patient to be eligible. If AST and /or ALT are greater than 1 x ULN but
                  less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN, THEN the bilirubin must be less than or equal to
                  ULN for patient to be eligible.)

          -  Any concomitant medications that are associated with a risk of QTc prolongation and/or
             Torsades de Pointes should be discontinued or replaced with drugs that do not carry
             these risks, if possible. Patients who must take medication with a risk of possible
             risk of Torsades de Pointes should be watched carefully for symptoms of QTc
             prolongation, such as syncope. See Appendix III for a list of concomitant medications

             composition to pazopanib.

          -  HIV-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pazopanib. In addition, these
             subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in subjects
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
