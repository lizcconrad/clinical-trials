  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a functionally disabling focal dystonia. Botulinum
      neurotoxin (BoNT) therapy is suboptimal in many BEB patients. Repetitious transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy is a promising noninvasive therapy and has shown positive
      benefits in BEB. rTMS therapy can be easily combined with BoNT injections to enhance the
      effects of BoNT in BEB.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A two week course of rTMS therapy to achieve sustained benefits will be employed. With
      standard BoNT treatment, the peak-dose benefits are seen at about 4-6 weeks after the
      administration of injections. rTMS will be introduced during this peak-dose period (about 6
      weeks after BoNT or T1).The effects of combined therapy at about 10 weeks after BoNT
      injections (T2) and at about 12 weeks after BoNT injections (T3) will be examined along with
      the physiological effects at these time points.

    <measure>Eye Blink Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An eye blink will be defined as any visible, bilateral, and synchronous contraction of the orbicularis oculi (OO muscle), causing eyelid drop. Blink rate will be expressed as blinks per minute and will be determined from a 5 minute video.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of sustained blinks</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained spasms of the OO muscle will counted as sustained blinks. separately and will be determined from a 5 minute video.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of eye closure</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The time (seconds) of eye closure whenever blinks cause prolonged eye closure (eyes shut &gt; 2 seconds) will be recorded with a stopwatch and will be determined from a 5 minute video.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Jankovic rating scale (JRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The JRS is made up of two subscales - severity and frequency - which are 5-point scales ranging from 0 to 4. Zero indicates no symptoms and 4 indicates the most severe or frequent symptoms.The higher the number the more severe the disease.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blepharospasm disability index (BSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BSDI consists of six daily activities each rated on a scale from 0 to 4. Zero indicates no impairment and 4 indicates not possible due to disease, and also includes a &quot;not applicable&quot; option. The higher the number the more severe the disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ-24)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CDQ-24 is a patient-rated health related quality of life (HR-QoL) measure for craniocervical dystonia. The CDQ-24 measures the impact of Craniocervical Dystonia on 5 HR-QoL domains. It is composed of 24 items, forming 5 subscales: stigma, emotional well-being, pain, activities of daily living, and social/ family life. Items are rated on a 5-point scale. Each item consists of five statements representing increasing severity of impairment, scored from 0 to 4. The higher the number the more severe the disease.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression- Subject (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will also rate their symptoms before and after stimulation using a 7-point nominal scale: 1) excellent, 2) very good, 3) good, 4) average, 5) slightly worse than usual, 6) bad or 7) very bad.</description>

    <description>Repetitious transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will be delivered using the Magstim RapidStim2 over each anterior cingulate cortex, using a figure-of-eight coil. The investigators will apply rTMS with 0.2 Hz frequency to the ACC. 180 stimuli will be delivered with a stimulator output of 100% active motor threshold (AMT). AMT will be assessed at the tibialis anterior muscle with the coil. The AMT will be defined as the lowest stimulation intensity required to evoke a 150 Î¼V potential in the target muscle. To determine the stimulation site for ACC, the coil will be placed over Fz and then moved over the midline of the brain in 0.5-cm steps anteriorly, until the point of maximum motor evoked potential in the orbicularis oculi (OO) muscle. The coil position will be marked on the skin. These rTMS sessions will be repeated daily for 10 days.</description>

    <description>During sham repetitious transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), subjects will undergo the same procedure for identifying stimulus location as used in patients receiving real rTMS using the sham Magstim RapidStim2 coil. This coil will be placed on the patient's head in an identical manner however will not be connected to the Magstim device. Instead another coil will be connected to provide stimulation sound. In each stimulation condition, the Magstim will be placed behind the patient and not visible to him or her. Placebo sham coil which produces discharge noise and vibration similar to a real coil without stimulating the cerebral cortex. During rTMS, all patients will continue to wear ear plugs as instructed during the real stimulation sessions.</description>
