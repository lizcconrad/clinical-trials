      The aim of the study was to compare self-management of anticoagulant treatment with
      conventional anticoagulant treatment in Norway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients (n=23) on anticoagulant treatment with warfarin participated in a 27 weeks training
      program where they learned how to analyse International Normalised Ratio (INR) using the
      point-of-care instrument CoaguChek® XS and dose warfarin. The patients had to display their
      skills through a test before considered self-managing. They continued to measure INR weekly
      for 28 weeks. All INR values during the training program and self-control period were
      collected. In addition, the patients were told to notify if they had any complications during
      this period. Ten INR values and complications before enrolment was collected from INR cards
      and/or their general practioner. The participant filled in a quality of life-questioner at
      enrolment and after 28 weeks of self-management.
