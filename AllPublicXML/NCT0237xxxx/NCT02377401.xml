  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zanamivir is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the influenza virus neuraminidase.
      Intravenous (IV) zanamivir is being developed for treatment of hospitalized patients with
      influenza, especially for those patients who may be in greatest need of parenteral influenza
      antiviral agents. This study is a pharmacokinetic (PK) study to evaluate the
      safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of IV zanamivir 300 milligrams (mg) and 600
      mg in Chinese healthy subjects. Subjects will be randomized to receive either 300 mg or 600
      mg IV zanamivir as a single dose followed by repeated dose every 12 hours (h) for 5 days.
      Subjects will be contacted or will return to study center for a follow-up visit, 7 days after
      the last dose or withdrawal from the study. Total number of subjects planned for enrollment
      will be 24 such that approximately 10 subjects complete dosing and critical assessments in
      each dose cohort. The total duration of the study will be approximately 6 weeks from
      screening to follow-up.
