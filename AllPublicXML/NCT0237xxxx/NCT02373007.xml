      The purpose of this study is to show that the modified technique Scopinaro surgery allows a
      better control or reduction of complications often found in nutritional pancreatic and
      biliary derivations, starting from the assumption of a modified technique is as effective as
      Scopinaro classical technique for reducing overweight and control of comorbidities in obese
      patients with grade II and III.

      28 participants Will be recruited and will be divided into 2 groups of 14 subjects each one.
      One group will receive the Classic Scopinaro surgery and the other, Modified Scopinaro
      Surgery. In Scopinaro Surgery Modified will be held with laparotomy and median opening in
      layers. It will also be performed at the manufacturing drifting pancreatic and biliary
      derivations, Roux-en-Y, dividing the small stomach.A communication portal to be implemented
      and calibrated through a nasogastric tube of 10mm where a retaining ring is placed horizontal
      gastroplasty, in order to avoid an expansion of this communication.

      In the Classical Scopinaro surgery will be done the same procedures of Scopinaro Modified
      surgery , but the gastroplasty will be replaced by horizontal gastrectomy.

    <description>Classic Scopinaro Technique is a bariactric surgery that proposes the stomach will be divide in two parts: a proximal part and a distal part for performing horizontal gastrectomy. Differently what will happen in the Modified Scopinaro Surgery that will divide the stomach in two parts: a proximal part and a distal part for performing gastroplasty.</description>
