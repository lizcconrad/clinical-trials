    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of six week dance training, using the Xbox Kinect Just
      Dance 2014 programme, on the agility scores along with general and hamstring flexibility and
      extensibility of the hip flexor. The effects of the dance programme will be compared with
      those of proven agility training techniques (ladder drills).

      A randomised clinical trial will be used consisting of 34 (17 in each group) athletes
      undergoing training. Both groups will undergo one hour of training three times weekly for six
      weeks, with one group doing dance training (DT) using the Xbox Kinect and the other doing
      standard training (ST) using traditional ladder drills. Outcomes will be assessed using the
      Illinois Agility test for agility, sit and reach test for general flexibility, straight leg
      raise test for hamstring flexibility and the Thomas test for hip flexor extensibility.

    <description>The Xbox Kinect Video Gaming System: Just Dance 2014 will be used to train the dance group. The training will last 45 minutes. This will be done three times per week for six weeks. The Xbox system will be connected to a multimedia projector and the participants will follow the dance routine conducted by the avatar that will be seen on a wall about six feet in front of them. Training will be done in an air conditioned room.</description>
