  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is frequently prescribed as a favorable lifestyle intervention to prevent/reverse
      type 2 diabetes. It is also prescribed in addition to concurrent pharmacological treatment,
      such as metformin. Recent data (animal and human) suggest that metformin may attenuate the
      favorable benefits of exercise training. In light of the physiological mechanism of
      Dapagliflozin (sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition), one might speculate that
      rather than inhibit, it will augment the favorable adaptations to exercise training.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, repeated measures study. 30 sedentary
      adults will be recruited for participation and randomly assigned to one of two 12-week
      treatments: 1) supervised endurance exercise training 4 days per week plus daily oral
      administration of Dapagliflozin; 2) supervised endurance exercise training 4 days per week
      plus daily oral administration of placebo. Prior to and following completion of the treatment
      the following dependent variables will be quantified: a) maximal aerobic capacity; b)
      substrate utilization during standardized low-moderate intensity exercise; c) skeletal muscle
      aerobic enzyme activity; d) body composition; and, e) oral glucose tolerance, fasting glucose
      and insulin resistance.

      The dose of Dapagliflozin will begin as 5 mg/day for the first 14-days. In the absence of
      complications, side effects, or unfavorable reactions, the dose will then increase to 10
      mg/day for the remainder of the study.
