      To determine the effect of a policy of early maternal-newborn infant discharge (12-24 hours)
      with a home visit on admission to the Level II/III nursery and hospital admissions and
      readmissions.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the safety of a policy of early
      maternal newborn infant discharge compared to a policy of routine discharge 2 to 3 days after
      delivery. The primary outcome is newborn admissions to the Level II or Level III neonatal
      care unit or hospital within three days of delivery. Secondary outcomes included admissions
      and readmissions at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months following delivery, maternal satisfaction
      with length of stay and overall birthing experience, lactation continuation rates, maternal
      anxiety, depression, confidence and family functioning. We applied the American Academy of
      Pediatrics criteria for early newborn discharge, but planned the analysis by intention to
      treat.
