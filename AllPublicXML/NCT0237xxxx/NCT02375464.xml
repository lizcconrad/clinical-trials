  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallium-68 DOTATOC is a material used to find neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) using positron
      emission tomography (PET scan). The material has already been shown to be better than the
      currently available imaging agents. This study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of
      PET CT scanning using this agent in the evaluation and management of patients with NETs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with NETs will be evaluated by their own physicians. Before doing the PET scan using
      Gallium-68 DOTATOC, the physicians will be asked to describe the type of treatment that they
      would recommend. After the test is performed and the result reviewed, the physician will be
      asked to reevaluate the therapeutic and management options. Data will be analyzed to
      determine the impact of the testing on patient management.

      Gallium-68 has been designated an &quot;orphan drug&quot; due to the relative rarity of NETs. It is
      expected that the data collected from this and other similar trials will be used to provide
      data to the FDA regarding the safety and efficacy of this drug as an imaging agent for NETs
      and ultimately lead to FDA approval.
