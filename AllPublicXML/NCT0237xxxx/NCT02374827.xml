  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the feasibility and surgical outcomes between complete salpingectomy and standard
      postpartum tubal ligation (partial salpingectomy) at the time of cesarean delivery in women
      with undesired future fertility. as a possible ovarian cancer risk-reducing procedure.

    <textblock>
      All pregnant women receiving prenatal care within the UAB Health System, and planning to
      undergo tubal ligation at the time of their scheduled cesarean delivery (primary or repeat)
      will be approached about the study. Patients will be randomized to receive either the
      standard tubal ligation practice at our institution (modified Pomeroy procedure or Parkland)
      or a complete salpingectomy. The objective of this trial is to evaluate if a complete
      salpingectomy can be performed safely and comparable to a standard postpartum tubal ligation.
