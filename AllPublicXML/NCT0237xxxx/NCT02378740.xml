    <textblock>
      Ketamine is an IV anesthetic with non-opioid analgesic properties that has been shown to
      reduce pain while also decreasing intraoperative and postoperative opioid requirements when
      used in subanesthetic doses after a variety of surgical procedures.1 It is a non-competitive
      antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and by this mechanism ketamine is
      believed to block the development of central sensitization and wind-up phenomenon,2,3 which
      may be helpful in preventing acute and chronic pain after repetitive insults. In a systematic
      review of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioid analgesia, low-dose ketamine was found to be a
      useful addition to standard postoperative pain management practice with opioids in 54% of
      studies.1 The studies that did not show a significant effect were in patient populations with
      low opioid requirements. Therefore, it has been suggested that future clinical trials be
      focused on patient populations with significant post-operative pain, such as spine surgery
      and major orthopedic surgery not amenable to regional analgesia, and postoperative pain in
      patients on chronic preoperative opioid therapy.1

      There are few studies examining outcomes after ketamine in the perioperative period after
      spine surgery. Loftus et al randomized patients with a history of chronic preoperative opioid
      use (i.e., daily opiate use for at least 6 weeks) to intraoperative ketamine versus placebo
      and found a 30% reduction in morphine consumption at 48 hours and an approximately 25%
      reduction in visual analog scale (VAS) pain score in the post anesthesia care unit and at 6
      weeks.4 Although this study provided evidence that there may be reduction in long-term
      postoperative pain, additional studies are needed to provide evidence that this effect is
      sustained beyond the 6-week period.

      We are interested in examining ketamine more closely in spine surgery because this patient
      population experiences significant postoperative pain that may be difficult to control due to
      preoperative opioid use (i.e., opioid tolerance). The investigators chose to study ACDF
      patients specifically because it is a common spine procedure throughout the United States and
      the patients have significant opioid requirements postoperatively. In a study examining the
      effects of the low dose ketamine for postoperative IV PCA fentanyl after cervical and lumbar
      surgery, patients in the placebo group (and thus only receiving fentanyl PCA) reported mean
      VAS scores of 4-5 with movement while receiving opioids.5

      Further, while previous studies have shown an opioid-sparing effect of ketamine as measured
      by opioid consumption and a decrease in pain as measured by VAS scores, no study to our
      knowledge has examined quality of recovery after intraoperative ketamine infusion. The
      Quality of recovery (QoR-40) score was developed by Myles et al to assess quality of recovery
      after anesthesia based on forty questions in five dimensions,6 and this score has been shown
      to be a reliable and valid outcome for patients undergoing both spine and cranial surgery.7
      QoR-40 is also of interest because it should be able to provide a global assessment of the
      possible benefit or harm of using ketamine in patients by simultaneously characterizing the
      detrimental side effects as well as the positive benefits of ketamine when used as an
      infusion at subanesthetic levels (studies thus far have shown that there are minimal side
      effects such as hallucinations).1,4

      Significance:

      Previous studies have shown an opioid-sparing effect of ketamine, however further research is
      warranted in patients whose pain may be difficult to control and whether this effect is
      sustained. ACDF patients experience significant pain post-operatively, and ketamine may
      improve their quality of recovery due to its opioid-sparing effects and prevention of chronic
      pain. Further, patient centered outcomes as measured by the QoR-40 have not been reported in
      the literature when ketamine, or other opioid sparing anesthetics, have been administered.
      This study will not only determine if the &quot;moderate&quot; dose of ketamine is beneficial or
      detrimental to the recovery of patients but also whether it can improve long term patient
      function, presumably by decreasing central pain sensitization. In addition, this study will
      set the stage for further RCT's examining other analgesic strategies in cervical spine
      surgery patients (i.e., intraoperative lidocaine infusions, volatile anesthetic vs. propofol
      as the primary hypnotic, COX-2 inhibitors, pregabalin, etc.). The overall goal would be to
      develop a multi-faceted regimen that decreases the postoperative inpatient opioid
      requirements of these patients and may facilitate long term recovery.

      The research questions:Does ketamine improve the quality of recovery at 24 hours after
      anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF)? The hypothesis: the investigators hypothesize
      that ketamine will improve the quality of recovery after ACDF surgery
