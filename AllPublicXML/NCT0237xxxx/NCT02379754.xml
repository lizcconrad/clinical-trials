  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether vestibular and postural compensation
      following schwannoma surgery is improved by ablating remaining vestibular function prior to
      surgery, through gentamicin injections in the middle ear.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The residual function of the vestibular system before surgery differs considerably between
      patients, due to extent and influence of tumor growth, resulting in varying spectra of
      post-surgery illness as well as vestibular symptoms. An acute unilateral vestibular
      deafferentation (uVD) (if significant vestibular function remains prior to surgery)
      invariably results in severe nausea and vertigo. The nausea/vertigo induced by surgery and
      sudden uVD both can impede vestibular compensation processes and in extension, also the need
      for rehabilitation. The vestibular PREHAB protocol was developed in order to address this
      problem and to ensure an enhanced and sufficient rehabilitation. The protocol encompass
      treating patients that have measurable vestibular function before surgery with intratympanic
      gentamicin injections, thus producing gradually a uVD over a period of 3-4 weeks, whilst
      performing daily vestibular exercises before and after the gentamicin treatment. Through this
      procedure the sensory trauma is separated from the surgical trauma, making it possible for
      vestibular compensation to ensue as the vestibular function gradually decline from gentamicin
      toxicity, unencumbered by any depression of central nervous function that might result from
      schwannoma surgery or the acute stages of an uVD.
