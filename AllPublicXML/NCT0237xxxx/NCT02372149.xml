    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is an
      effective intervention for patients with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and demyelination
      on nerve conduction studies. All patients will receive both IVIg and placebo for 3 months
      each, with a 3 month washout period in between.

    <textblock>
      There is a knowledge gap with regards to the appropriate method of detecting and treating
      chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in patients with co-existent
      diabetes. In this pilot study the investigators plan to examine the overlap between diabetic
      polyneuropathy and CIDP by treating patients with diabetes and demyelinating abnormalities
      using IVIg. The investigators will enroll diabetes patients with a broad spectrum of
      demyelinating abnormalities.

      The proposed trial will be an explanatory, blinded, single-centre, superiority, randomized
      controlled cross-over trial. Each patient will receive 3 months of 10% intravenous
      immunoglobulin and 3 months of placebo (0.9% sodium chloride in water) with a 3-month washout
      period. The primary outcome measure is the mean change in ONLS (Overall Neuropathy Limitation
      Scale), a measure of disability in polyneuropathy; however secondary outcome measures will
      consider impairments and quality of life.

          2. Diabetes, as per American Diabetes Association Criteria.

          3. Clinical evidence of polyneuropathy and NCS shows 2 separate motor nerves (median,
             ulnar, tibial, or peroneal) which meet criteria for demyelination, defined as follows:

               2. The changes are not exclusively due to median neuropathy at the wrist, ulnar
                  neuropathy at the elbow, or peroneal neuropathy at the fibular head.

          4. Clinical suspicion of possible demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

          1. Pregnant patients, or those of childbearing potential not using contraception.

          2. Patients &lt;18 years of age.

          3. Presence of an alternative etiology of peripheral neuropathy, such as: hereditary

          5. Presence of serious or unstable medical condition, which may preclude study completion
             or lead to inability to tolerate IVIg. This may include active heart failure,
             uncontrolled hypertension, or severe anemia, among other conditions.

          6. Presence of concomitant neurological illness, which may confound evaluation.
