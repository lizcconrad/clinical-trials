    <textblock>
      Methanol poisoning could result in severe optic neuropathy, profound visual loss and finally
      optic atrophy and permanent, irreversible optic atrophy and visual loss. Erythropoietin (EPO)
      has recently emerged as a drug that may help retinal ganglion cell loss and improve optic
      nerve function in some acquired types of optic neuropathy including traumatic optic
      neuropathy ,ischemic optic neuropathy and optic neuritis .It has been found that EPO offer
      some protection to the optic nerve and retina when they are injured and apoptosis process
      starts in retinal ganglion cells. The standard treatments of methanol poisoning are
      reanimation, metabolic stabilization, and inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase by antagonist
      agents and elimination of toxic metabolites in early phase of toxicity by dialysis. However,
      after established optic neuropathy and visual loss there is little chance, if any, for visual
      recovery and no definitive treatment exist for treatment in these cases. The investigators
      recently reported the investigators preliminary results on 16 cases with methanol poisoning
      and found a beneficial effect of systemic erythropoietin in methanol associated optic
      neuropathy. Now, the investigators aim to investigate the effect of this agent in a clinical
      trial.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if EPO could improves optic nerve function and help
      patients to improve visual recovery after methanol poisoning. Primary outcome measure would
      be best-corrected visual function and secondary outcome measure is ocular coherence
      tomography (OCT) measure of mean peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickness. Results of this
      study could be very valuable in formulating an evidence-based management of Methanol
      Associated Optic Neuropathy(MAON) and provide a high level evidence for changing the practice
      on management of methanol poisoning . Also it could provide valuable data for neuroprotective
      effects of erythropoietin specifically in neuroscience and ophthalmology.

      The EPO-MAON trial is designed as a randomized, controlled, observer, and interpreter blinded
      mono-center pilot trial with two parallel groups and a primary endpoint of best corrected
      visual acuity during 120 days after enrollment into treatment groups.

      All patients with methanol poisoning referred to Farabi hospital will be examined and
      evaluated for best-corrected visual acuity, pupillary light reflexes, relative afferent
      pupillary defect, color vision (Ishihara plates), fundus photography, slit lamp exam of
      anterior segment and fundus exam with 78 D lens.
