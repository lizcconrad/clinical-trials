  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a glioblastoma (GBM) have a poor prognosis with a median survival of 14.6
      months after maximal treatment with a resection and chemoradiation. Since the pivotal trial
      evaluating the effect of temozolomide (TMZ), overall survival has not increased.

      Treatment of GBM xenografts in vivo with chloroquine (CQ), an antimalarial agent, has been
      shown to reduce the hypoxic fraction and sensitizes tumors to radiation. Epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) amplification or mutation is regularly observed GBM and is thought to
      be a major contributor to radioresistance. The most common EGFR mutation in GBM (EGFRvIII) is
      present in 50-60% of patients whose tumor shows amplification of EGFR. EGFR provides cells
      with a survival advantage through autophagy when exposed to stresses such as hypoxia and
      nutrient starvation. This effect is even more pronounced in EGFRvIII overexpressing tumors.
      Previously, the potential effect CQ has been demonstrated in a small randomized controlled
      trial in GBM treated with radiotherapy and carmustine, which showed a trend towards increased
      overall survival. However, as the intracellular effects of chloroquine are dose-dependent the
      maximum tolerated dose for CQ in combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily
      temozolomide needs to be established.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial has been designed as an open label, single center combination phase I trial. The
      primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for chloroquine (CQ) in
      combination with concurrent radiotherapy with daily temozolomide in patients with a newly
      diagnosed GBM.

      Eligible patients will receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy according to standard protocol
      for newly diagnosed GBM. This consists of 33 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy to the tumor and
      surrounding margin in combination with TMZ 75 mg/m² per os daily (po qd) and six adjuvant
      cycles of TMZ 150 - 200 mg/m² po qd. Treatment will be combined with daily intake of
      escalating doses of chloroquine. Chloroquine will start with week before the start of
      radiotherapy and end on the last day of radiotherapy.

      The rate of subject entry and escalation to the next dose level will depend upon assessment
      of the safety profile of patients entered at the previous dose level. Toxicity will be
      evaluated according to the NCI common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE),
      Version 4.0.

      The 3 + 3 cohort method is used. A minimum of three patients will be entered at each dose
      level. All three will be followed during the concomitant radiotherapy and a 4 week
      observation period before escalation to the next dose level.

      The start dose is 200mg chloroquine daily. Before opening the next higher dose level all
      toxic effects at the preceding dose level will be reviewed and expansion or escalation will
      be undertaken as appropriate
