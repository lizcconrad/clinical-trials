  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coverage of HPV vaccination among US teens is low, far below Healthy People 2020 goals. A
      central reason for low coverage is infrequent and inadequate healthcare provider
      recommendation of HPV vaccine. The proposed intervention aims to train clinicians to provide
      effective recommendations for the vaccine using participatory or efficient communication
      strategies.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of two communication trainings to increase HPV
      vaccination coverage among adolescent patients. We will compare HPV vaccination for pediatric
      and family medicine clinics receiving a participatory communication training, efficient
      communication training, or no training. Ten clinics will be randomly assigned to each study
      arm for a total of 30 clinics. The primary outcome of this study is to compare the change in
      clinics' levels of HPV vaccination initiation coverage among 11-12 year old adolescent
      patients from baseline to 6 month follow-up. Secondarily, we will compare the change in HPV
      vaccination initiation coverage in 13-17 year old adolescents.

    <description>The participatory intervention is a 1-hour training to help clinicians improve their ability to make strong and effective recommendations for HPV vaccine, and address parental concerns regarding HPV vaccination. The training includes four components:
Review of information on HPV vaccine, including effectiveness, safety, rationale for targeting adolescents ages 11-12, and low HPV vaccine coverage rates compared to Tdap and meningococcal vaccine
Skills building on how to recommend HPV vaccine using a participatory communication strategy based in shared decision making
Practice using the communication strategy via role play
