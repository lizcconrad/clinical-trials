  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the use of the CAMbridge PROstate Biopsy devicE (CAMPROBE) as a method of
      undertaking prostate biopsy as part of their clinical management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess patient's experience and complications of the CAMPROBE and compare the results with
      known published outcomes from standard transrectal biopsies .

      To use data from the pilot study to determine the feasibility of a randomised trial comparing
      CAMPROBE with the current standard method of prostate biopsies.
