      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and the potential therapeutic effects
      per dose of Cordstem-ST Intravenous Transplantation in Cerebral Infarction subjects comprised
      of 2 treatment cohorts:

      Cohort 1 : Cordstem-ST 2.0 x 10^8 cells or Placebo on day 0

      Cohort 2: Cordstem-ST 2.0 x 10^8 cells or Placebo on day 0 and day 7
