  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications are main cause of overall perioperative morbidity and
      mortality in the patients following general anesthesia. A protective ventilation strategy
      refers to the use of low VT (in the range of 4-8 ml/kg of the predicted body weight) with
      positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), with or without recruitment maneuver. Protective
      ventilation has been considered the optimal practice in patients suffering from the acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, few human studies have assessed how to
      ventilate healthy lungs in patients undergoing general anesthesia, especially in prone
      position. Prior studies reported that in the patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in
      supine position, intraoperative lung protective ventilator settings had the potential to
      protect against pulmonary complications. Therefore, the investigators planned this study to
      better specify the effect of intraoperative protective ventilation in surgical patients in
      the prone position.
