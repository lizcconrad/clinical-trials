  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To pursue this objective, we will be measuring uric acid at baseline and post 14 days of
      twice daily allopurinol therapy in 30 Hmong participants with documented gout or
      hyperuricemia and known genotype for key renal transporters of uric acid.

      Minnesota Hmong are a unique population of individuals of South East Asian descent who have
      been noted to have a higher prevalence of gout and gout related comorbidities compared to
      non-Hmong. Elevated levels of uric acid are thought to be at the root cause of gout. Elevated
      levels of serum uric acid can result from either overproduction and or under-excretion.
      Xanthine oxidase plays a key role in the breakdown of purines to form uric acid. Transporters
      in the kidney also play a key role in excretion and/or re-absorption of uric acid. The
      objective of this study is to explore whether genetic variations in renal transporters may
      influence the disposition of serum uric acid in response to a drug (allopurinol) as well as
      the disposition of its active metabolite (oxipurinol) which may also be a substrate for these
      same transporters responsible for uric acid disposition. Genetic variations unique to the
      Hmong population may explain their increased prevalence in gout and or perceived lack of
      responsiveness to the drug (allopurinol) used to treat the condition.
