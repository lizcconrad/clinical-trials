      A two-arm randomized controlled trial for smokers who are not intent to quit smoking will be
      proposed in outpatient department clinics of People's Liberation Army General Hospital in
      Beijing, China. Smoking reduction intervention arm (SRI) consisting of a very brief
      face-to-face individual smoking reduction intervention lasted about one minute, and five
      follow-up interventions lasted for about minute each. Control arm (EDA) consisting of a very
      brief face-to-face individual exercise and dietetic advices lasted for the same intervention
      time as SRI, and also five follow-up interventions lasted for one minute each with different
      intervention contents.

Finally, all smokers were warned to keep in mind that the current attempt to reduce smoking is an intermediate step before the complete cessation.</description>
