  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DKN-01 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (Mab) with neutralizing activity against Dkk-1 and
      is being developed as an anti-neoplastic agent. This study is designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor activity of DKN-01 in combination with
      gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with carcinoma primary to the intra- or exta-hepatic
      biliary system or gallbladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A, escalating doses of DKN-01 will be administered to different cohorts of patients
      to evaluate safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to establish the maximum tolerated
      dose of DKN-01 when administered in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin.

      Part B is an expansion cohort in which patients are treated at the MTD of DKN-01 (or highest
      dose tested if the MTD is not defined) to further characterize safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy within the defined patient population.
