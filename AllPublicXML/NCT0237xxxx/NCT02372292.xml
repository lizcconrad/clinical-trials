  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the traditional determinant of renal dysfunction in heart failure was suggested as
      decreased cardiac output and renal hypo perfusion, recent studies have demonstrated the
      association of persistent systemic venous congestion and kidney dysfunction. Relief of the
      congestion has demonstrated to improve renal functions in decompensated heart failure. The
      current trial was set up to investigate the changes of renal venous impedance and renal
      arteriolar resistivity indices with diuretic therapy, in patients with congestive renal
      failure. The investigators asked whether measurement of renal venous impedance index or renal
      arteriolar resistivity index can guide the practice of diuretic therapy.
