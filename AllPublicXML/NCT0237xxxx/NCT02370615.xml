      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated-dose administration of
      itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of TAK-272, as well as the effect of repeated-dose
      administration of TAK-272 on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or midazolam in healthy Japanese
      adult males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Cohort 1, the effect of repeated-dose administration of itraconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of TAK-272 was evaluated by comparing between participants receiving TAK-272
      alone and those receiving TAK-272 in combination with itraconazole. In Cohort 2, the effect
      of repeated-dose administration of TAK-272 on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or midazolam
      was evaluated by comparing between participants receiving digoxin or midazolam alone and
      those receiving either of the drugs in combination with TAK-272.
