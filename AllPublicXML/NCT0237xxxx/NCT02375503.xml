  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial is to
      determine the efficacy of a once per day calcium (1000mg) and vitamin D (1000IU) fortified
      food product on bone turnover markers, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
      microarchitecture during Army basic military training (BCT). The investigators hypothesize
      that consumption of a once daily calcium and vitamin D fortified food product will stabilize
      PTH and contribute to improved bone microarchitecture compared to placebo. The results will
      determine the efficacy of daily supplementation with calcium and vitamin D on bone turnover
      markers as well as provide novel data regarding microarchitectural changes during BCT as
      assessed by high resolution peripheral computed tomography (HRpQCT) scanning.

    <textblock>
      Stress fractures may affect up to 2-5% of male and 8-21% of female Soldiers during training,
      resulting in attrition in up to 60% of affected personnel. A recent report indicates that
      supplemental calcium (2000mg) and vitamin D (800-1000IU) stabilizes PTH, increases tibia
      volumetric bone mineral density in male and female recruits undergoing Army BCT, and reduces
      stress fracture incidence by up to 20% in female Nacy recruits. Bone macroarchitecture has
      been measured in response to basic training however, the resolution of standard peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) is insufficient for assessment of microarchitectural
      changes, which may underlie the pathophysiology of stress fracture. With the use of HRpQCT
      this study will allow the investigators to evaluate microarchitectural changes within the
      bone tissue and assess the efficacy of a moderate daily dose of calcium and vitamin D to
      support bone health during BCT.
