  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare patient outcomes following treatment of plantar
      fasciitis with conventional physical therapy (stretching, strengthening, ultrasound, manual
      therapy, and cryotherapy) and conventional physical therapy plus dry needling. Physical
      therapists commonly use conventional physical therapy techniques and dry needling to treat
      plantar fasciitis, and this study is attempting to find out if the addition of dry needling
      to conventional physical therapy is more effective than conventional physical therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with plantar fasciitis will be randomly assigned to receive 1-2 treatments per week
      for 4 weeks of either: (1) Dry Needling and conventional physical therapy, or the (2)
      Conventional physical therapy (stretching, strengthening, ultrasound, manual therapy, and
      cryotherapy)
