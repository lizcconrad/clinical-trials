    <textblock>
      Hand osteoarthritis is a common phenotype of osteoarthritis which affects about 70 % of the
      elderly population. Usually considered as a minor illness, it nevertheless leads to an
      important functional impairment. The mechanism of this disease is still poorly known.
      Furthermore there are 2 different subtypes : erosive and non erosive hand osteoarthritis from
      which mechanisms may differ.

      Methods:

      This is a cross-sectional study recruiting patients with hand osteoarthritis addressed in
      consultation of rheumatology and plastic surgery in Rouen University Hospital.

      Two groups of patients will be studied: 20 patients with non erosive subtype of hand
      osteoarthritis and 20 patients with erosive subtype of hand osteoarthritis.

      A clinical evaluation of hand osteoarthritis will be performed. Blood sample for proteomic
      analysis will be taken. Hand MRI and Bone Mineral Analyser will be performed.
