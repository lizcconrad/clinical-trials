  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired lymphedema is a disease that causes chronic swelling of the limb(s). It is
      frequently under-recognized or misdiagnosed. This study is designed to lead to the
      development of an accurate, noninvasive, blood test to allow testing for lymphedema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The validation of a sensitive and specific biomarker assay for human acquired lymphatic
      vascular insufficiency would represent a highly significant development for the patient
      community. Accurate bioassay for the presence of lymphatic vascular insufficiency should help
      to pave the road for future human clinical trials of experimental drugs and therapies
      designed to treat human lymphatic diseases. Molecular profiling will be performed in human
      tissues (skin) obtained by biopsy. The insights gained from these initial analyses will
      determine the targets for assay in human body fluids (blood).
