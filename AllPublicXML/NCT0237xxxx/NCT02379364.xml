      The aim of the study will be to assess the effectiveness of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis technique
      on pain, range of motion (Patellofemoral joint mobility test and muscle length test),
      strength and function in patients with Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome and muscle shortening.

      Muscle imbalance is one of most important factor associated with Patellofemoral Pain
      Syndrome. Shortening of lateral muscles of the thigh have a close relationship with patella
      position and tracking and patellofemoral pain. The scientific evidence for effectiveness of
      any soft tissue mobilization technique in patellofemoral pain syndrome patients is poor.

      Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is a non-invasive physiotherapeutic technique to release adherences
      and fibrosis between the different musculoskeletal structures. Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is
      applied by a set of metallic hooks having the advantage of allowing a deeper and more precise
      application, which could not be achieved manually.

      The present study evaluates the effectiveness of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis technique applied in
      the soft tissues more related with patellofemoral pain.
