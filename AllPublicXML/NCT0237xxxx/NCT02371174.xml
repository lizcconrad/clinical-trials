      The primary objective of the study is to clarify factors affecting the incidence of
      peripheral neuropathy in patients treated with HALAVEN. A total of 590 patients will be
      enrolled in this study with 295 patients in the treatment group of primary or secondary
      chemotherapy and 295 patients in the treatment group of tertiary or later chemotherapy.
