      The purpose of this research study is to learn about ways to help children and adults with
      sickle cell disease who are taking the medication, hydroxyurea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited chronic multi-organ system disorder that affects
      approximately 100,000 individuals in the United States, mostly belonging to minority,
      under-served populations. SCD is associated with substantial morbidity, premature mortality,
      individual suffering, health care costs and loss of productivity. Hydroxyurea (HU) the only
      disease modifying therapy for SCD is efficacious in reducing complications such as pain
      crisis and acute chest syndrome and improving survival. It is however, vastly underutilized
      and poorly adhered to because of barriers at the health care system, provider, treatment,
      socioeconomic, and patient levels. The investigator's overarching hypothesis is that barriers
      to acceptance and adherence to HU are multi-factorial and that a structured set of
      interventions can lead to improved adherence to medication and patient centered outcomes.

    <description>Change from baseline in MCV will be calculated as the value at 24 months minus the value at baseline. MCV is the average size of the red blood cells expressed in femtoliters. MCV is calculated by dividing the hematocrit (as percent) by the RBC count in millions per microliter of blood, then multiplying by 10.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retrospective chart review at baseline will be conducted to determine medication possession rate (MPR) and then compared to the MPR at 24 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability of intervention and of Hydroxyurea</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be measured by Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication-9 (TSQM-9) The TSQM is a 14-item subject-assessed evaluation of treatment medication including 4 factors, Effectiveness, Side Effects, Convenience, and Global Satisfaction, and it utilizes the following responses on a 7-point Likert scale: 1=Extremely Dissatisfied, 2=Very Dissatisfied, 3=Somewhat Dissatisfied, 4=Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied, 5=Somewhat Satisfied, 6=Very Satisfied, 7=Extremely Satisfied. Scores range from 0-100, with 0 as extremely dissatisfied and 100 as extremely satisfied.</description>
