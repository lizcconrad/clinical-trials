  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hemiparesis is one of the most important sequelae of stroke, and generally have greater
      impairment in the upper limb (UL) contralateral to the brain injury. To obtain greater amount
      of use and most affected UL movement quality, studies have described as a rehabilitation
      technique constraint Induced Therapy (CIT). The objectives of this study will evaluate the
      effect of CIT in severe hemiparetics patients in the quantity and quality of movement UL and
      grip strength, and the relation between the scapular kinematics and trunk with the quality of
      movement measured clinically. Randomized crossover study with systematic reviews in AB mode,
      where A is the baseline to the evaluation of the period of 2 weeks without any intervention
      and B, the two-week period with intervention. One group will start with the intervention
      period (BA) and the other group with the period without intervention (AB). The intervention
      will be for 3 hours / day, 5x / week for two weeks and use of wrist and fingers restriction
      UL unaffected. To evaluate the quality and quantity of UL use in real environment will be
      used to Motor Activity Log (MAL), to quantify the motor skill the Wolf Motor Function Test
      (WMFT), the 3D movement of the scapula and trunk during arm elevation and functional
      activities of the UL will be measured by the electromagnetic tracking system and grip
      strength by hand dynamometer.

      Randomized crossover study with systematic reviews in AB mode, where A is the baseline to the
      evaluation of the period of 2 weeks without any intervention and B, the two-week period with
      intervention, developed in the Evaluation Laboratory and complex intervention of shoulder at
      the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar).

      Patients will be divided into two groups through the online tool www.randomization.com. One
      group will start with the intervention period (BA) and the other group with the period
      without intervention (AB). As the evaluator will not know the distribution of patients in
      groups, will be blinded as to the pre and post intervention.

      The quantity variables, quality of movement, time to perform tasks and grip strength UL
      measures the MAL and WMFT, will be evaluated in five moments: at baseline, at the end of
      phase A, at the end of phase B, and monitoring of 1 and 3 months after the crossover period.
      The evaluation of scapular kinematics and trunk occur only at the beginning and the four-week
      period ends.

      Measures shall be performed by the principal investigator who is a physiotherapist who
      trained for Group Research Therapy Induced by restraining the University of Alabama at
      Birmingham in 2008, headed by Edward Taub (creator of the technique) and David Morris. The
      intervention will be carried out by three other physical therapists with the same training.
      Thus, the protocol will be based on the principles recommended by the Extremity
      Constraint-Induced Therapy Evaluation (EXCITE), a project that involved seven centers of
      North American research.

      The sample size is calculated for the main variables, quality movement measured by LAM. The
      effect size considered to be clinically relevant to the MAL is 1.0 on a scale from 0 to 5.
      The standard deviation of this variable in the population of severe hemiparesis found in
      other studies was. With a power of 80% and an α-probability error of 5% would require 16
      patients in total.

The training will consist of 30 minutes for the transfer package, interview by items of MAL, and 2 hours and 30 minutes with four tasks of Shaping, and Task Practice.
The Transfer Package consists of a compromise agreement, held at the end of the first day of practice, in which the individual undertakes to complete:
The Shaping is a training method that makes it difficult gradually according to the motor capacity of each individual. It will be taken care of including tasks using all joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers), giving priority to the individual in need.
The individual will be instructed not to remove the trunk of the chair, and each task is repeated 10 times in no more than 45s.
The Task Practice promotes increased motor function during functional activities. For all individuals will be held the same function: meal.</description>
