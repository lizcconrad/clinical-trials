    <textblock>
      This study is a 2-part open-label, randomized, crossover, multicenter, non-therapeutic Phase
      II study to investigate the presence of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) in patients
      with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      EPANOVA® (omega-3 carboxylic acids) and omega-3-acid ethyl esters (OMACOR®, Abbott Healthcare
      Products Ltd) following a single oral dose in patients with different degrees of PEI.
