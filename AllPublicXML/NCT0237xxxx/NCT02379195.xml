  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adoptive T cell therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has achieved impressive
      clinical results with durable complete responses in patients with metastatic melanoma. The
      TILs are isolated from the patients own tumor tissue followed by in vitro expansion and
      activation for around 4-6 weeks. Before TIL infusion the patients receive 1 week of
      preconditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. After TIL infusion
      Interleukin-2 are administered to support T cell activation and proliferation in vivo.

      In this trial the therapy is combined with peginterferon (the pegylated form of interferon
      alpha 2b). Interferon alpha has immunomodulatory effects and is known to upregulate HLA
      expression on melanoma cells and are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy.

    <description>All patients receive the same treatment.
All patients are hospitalized during treatment (approximately 3 weeks) and receive treatment only once.
The patients are admitted to hospital day -8 and receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) on day -7 to day -1.
The TILs are infused on day 0 and Interleukin-2 therapy are administered on day 0 to day 5.
Interleukin-2 are administered in an i.v. continuous decrescendo regimen starting approximately 6 hours after TIL infusion with a duration of approximately 5 days
Subcutaneous injections of peginterferon alpha 2b are administered three time (day -2, day 7 and day 14)</description>
