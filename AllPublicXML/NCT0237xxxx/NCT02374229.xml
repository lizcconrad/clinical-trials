  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomized study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      the original ablation procedures ganglion plexus pulmonary artery with simultaneous
      correction of valvular heart disease, complicated by high pulmonary hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension is a serious condition, the severity of which is often underestimated.
      About 10% of significant mitral heart disease complicated by high pulmonary hypertension
      (more than 60 mm Hg). Up to 70% of patients retain this level of pulmonary hypertension after
      successful treatment of heart valve disease.The quality of life of patients with persistent
      high pulmonary hypertension is significantly lower than in patients with mild to moderate
      degree. Risks of recurrent tricuspid insufficiency and right ventricular dysfunction is much
      higher. Despite the use of modern drug therapy of pulmonary hypertension in patients with
      valvular heart disease satisfactory clinical effect is achieved only in a small number of
      patients. Our team proposed a new original method of ablation of the pulmonary artery with
      simultaneous open cardiac surgery correction of mitral heart disease in patients with high
      baseline pulmonary hypertension.

    <description>Procedure: mitral valve surgery, surgical ablation of ganglion plexus pulmonary artery.
Will include 15 patients with mitral stenosis or insufficiency subject to correction, complicated by high pulmonary hypertension. During the operation, a standard surgical procedure for the treatment of heart valve disease will be complemented by the ablation zone of bifurcation of the pulmonary artery, surgical ablation of ganglion plexus pulmonary artery.
For mitral regurgitation or stenosis, the procedures will be a valve repair or mitral valve replacement.
Procedure will be considered effective in the face of declining average pressure in the pulmonary artery for invasive monitoring of 10mm Hg and more.</description>

    <description>Procedure:mitral valve surgery. Will include 15 patients with mitral stenosis or insufficiency subject to correction, complicated by high pulmonary hypertension. Patients will be made standard procedure correction mitral valve disease without pulmonary artery denervation.
