      Recently, a novel assay for detecting heavy/light chain (HLC) ratios has been reported which
      enables improvement in paraprotein detection and monitoring in multiple myeloma and other
      plasma-cell dyscrasias.

      The prognostic and biological role of the HLC assay has as yet not been studied in CLL.

      Aims of the proposed study:

        1. To quantify and analyze the prognostic significance of HLC ratios in the serum of CLL
           patients. (In addition to FLC)

        2. To study the different patterns of Immunoglobulin's subclass antibodies in the serum of
           patients with CLL and compare them to those of to healthy volunteers.

        3. To perform a sub-analysis in patients with CLL who have autoimmune phenomenon (AIHA and
           ITP)

      Analysis of immunoglobulin heavy/light chain pairs In chronic lymphocytic leukemia

      Introduction and Background:

      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia in the western world.
      Median age at diagnosis is 72 years, and the male to female ratio is 2:1. The disease is
      characterized by an accumulation of monoclonal mature B-cells which co-express the T-cell
      antigen CD5, B-cell surface antigens CD19, CD20, and CD23(1) and either kappa or lambda
      immunoglobulin light chains restriction (2). Diagnosis is established based on the IWCLL
      criteria published by Hallek at al in 2008. (1).

      CLL may have a heterogeneous clinical course with a wide spectrum of manifestations ranging
      from long lived asymptomatic patients who never require treatment to those with a more rapid
      clinical course and symptomatic progression. One of the remaining important challenges in CLL
      is to stratify patients into different prognostic categories, so as to plan appropriate
      targeted therapy when necessary . The most important prognostic factor in CLL relates to the
      presence of typical genomic aberrations in the leukemic cell (3). Other essential prognostic
      parameters include: CD38 expression, the presence of ZAP-70, immunoglobulin heavy chain
      mutational status, and beta 2 microglobulin (B2MG) levels. (1).

      Patients with CLL, have a 10 % risk of developing autoimmune complications mostly auto-immune
      hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (4-6). The pathogenesis for these
      autoimmune cytopenias is linked to the production of polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG)
      antibodies (less frequently IgM) directed against a variety of red blood cell or platelet
      antigens. (4-6).

      The use of serum free light chain (FLC) levels as an important prognostic tool in different
      plasma cell dyscrasias is already well established (75) while the prognostic significance of
      FLC in CLL has only been reported more recently by few publications (8-10). Furthermore, Tsai
      et al, have also described that serum FLC abnormalities may precede diagnosis in 38 % of
      patients with CLL (11).

      Recently, a novel assay for detecting heavy/light chain (HLC) ratios has been reported which
      enables improvement in paraprotein detection and monitoring in multiple myeloma and other
      plasma-cell dyscrasias. (12-13).

      The prognostic and biological role of the HLC assay has as yet not been studied in CLL.

      Aims of the proposed study:

        1. To quantify and analyze the prognostic significance of HLC ratios in the serum of CLL
           patients. (In addition to FLC)

        2. To study the different patterns of Immunoglobulin's subclass antibodies in the serum of
           patients with CLL and compare them to those of to healthy volunteers.

        3. To perform a sub-analysis in patients with CLL who have autoimmune phenomenon (AIHA and
           ITP)

      Materials and methods:

      The study will be performed in collaboration with the Israeli CLL Study Group.

      All patients included will have complete clinical database available and medical records
      summarized.

      Baseline laboratory parameters to be examined will include: complete blood count, Coombs
      test, serum B2MG and LDH, Immunoglobulin levels,, flow-cytometry including CD38 expression
      and ZAP70 and urine Bence Jones protein.

      Frozen serum samples from CLL patients will be analyzed for levels of:

        -  Free light chain: kappa/lambda, ratio of K/L and total sum of K+L.

        -  IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4.

        -  Isoforms of heavy/light chain of IgG kappa, IgG lambda, IgA kappa, IgA lambda, IgM
           kappa, IgM lambda
