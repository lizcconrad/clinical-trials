  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of the pain is a constant care concern in neonatal and maternity units. Many
      studies show an interest in the use of sugar solutions to reduce nociception during painful
      events in infants. However, these studies are based mainly on behavioral observation of the
      newborn but intrinsic mechanisms of analgesic power are not clearly understood for sucrose
      solutions.

      Our hypothesis is that the analgesic mechanism of sucrose solutions in infants involves a
      subcortical reactivity notably by action via the brain stem. To explore the intensity of pain
      and evaluate the subcortical activity, we will use 1) the analysis of heart rate variability
      (frequency indices whose HFnu) as a peripheral witness of subcortical functioning of the
      autonomic nervous system 2) electroacoustic analysis of the intensity of crying baby, 3) a
      composite pain score (DAN score).

      The investigators want to show that the short term autonomic nervous system (ANS) response,
      after a nociceptive action in the new-born in maternity depends on whether it is preceded by
      non-nutritive sucking and / or sucrose administration.
