      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the utility of left ventricular strain as part of
      the assessment of patients in the emergency department with acute heart failure (HF). The
      central hypothesis of the investigation is that left ventricular strain will prove to be a
      treatment response variable in patients with acute HF. Patients who are being treated for
      acute HF with intravenous (IV) vasoactive medications (diuretics, vasodilators, inotropes)
      will be eligible for enrollment. Patients who give written consent will receive a focused
      bedside echocardiogram within 30 minutes of the initiation of therapy for acute HF. Images
      that are captured during this echocardiogram will be interpreted by a blinded cardiologist
      offline. 23 hours after this initial focused echocardiogram a member of the study team will
      perform a follow-up focused echocardiogram, capturing the same images that will then be
      interpreted by a blinded cardiologist offline.

      Offline analysis will be performed using a proprietary software package from General Electric
      called Automated Function Imaging (AFI). The AFI software will be used to calculate
      longitudinal strain of the left ventricle (LV). Regional and global strain values will be
      calculated for each focused echocardiogram for each subject. It is our hypothesis that LV
      strain will demonstrate improvements from the initial echocardiogram to the follow-up
      echocardiogram, unlike other echocardiographic indices in HF such as LV ejection fraction.

        Eligible subjects will be recruited in the emergency department (ED) of Detroit Receiving
        Hospital (DRH). The DRH ED has research team coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and
        existing research personnel will be specifically trained to assist with subject
        identification for this protocol. We will also utilize resident physicians who are on ED
        based ultrasound and critical care rotations to help identify potential subjects and ensure
        that participants are captured early in their course and prior to initial treatment for
        acute HF. The ED will have 2 emergency ultrasound fellows beginning in July 2014 who will
        also assist with patient recruitment and performance of bedside echocardiograms for
        purposes of the study.
