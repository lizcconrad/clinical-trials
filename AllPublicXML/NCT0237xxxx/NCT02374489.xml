      Primary objective:

      To investigate the objective response rate in patients with ROS1 or ALK over-expressed
      locally advanced, or metastatic intrahepatic or hilar cholangiocarcinoma receiving LDK378
      Secondary objectives:The progression-free survival ,The disease control rate ,The overall
      survival ,The toxicity profiles , The correlation between clinical outcomes and the potential
      predictive biomarker for tumor response

      Sample size: LDK378 will be considered as an active agent and deserved for further
      development. Considering 10% dropout rate, total 34 patients will be included.

      Step 1: LDK378 in suitable patients:

      Collect tumor tissue for immunohistochemistry staining to confirm the status of ROS1 or ALK
      expression. If the patient fits all criteria, LDK378 750 mg ( p.o.) daily, with 3 week as a
      treatment cycle.

      Step 2: Evaluation of tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 version

        1. Evaluation will be done at baseline and every 6 weeks

        2. Evaluation will be performed with CT or MRI and the response is defined as follows:

             -  Complete response - the disappearance of all target lesions.

             -  Partial response - at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of
                target lesions compared to the baseline sum longest diameter.

             -  Progressive disease - at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of
                target lesions compared to the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the
                treatment started or the appearance of one, or more new lesions, or reappearance of
                any lesion that had disappeared, or clear worsening of any assessable disease, or
                appearance of any new lesion or site.

             -  Stable disease - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor
                sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, compared to the smallest
                sum longest diameter since the treatment started

             effective contraception methods include:Total abstinence (when this is in line with
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.

        Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
        hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case
        of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by
        follow up hormone level assessment.

        Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening) with the appropriate
        post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. For female subjects
        on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject.

        Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):

          1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other forms of
             hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example
             hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

          2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

          3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault
             caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

        In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a
        minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

        13.Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and
        for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients for 3 months should not
        father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in
        order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
