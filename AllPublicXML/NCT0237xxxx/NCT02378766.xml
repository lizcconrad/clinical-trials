  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a web-based tailored intervention to
      support persons living with HIV (PLHIV) manage the demands inherent to their health
      condition, particularly as regards to the adoption of health behaviours such as being
      physically active, following a healthy diet and quitting smoking.

      This randomized controlled trial is currently conducted entirely online at
      www.lhivehealthy.ca

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This online randomized controlled trial with parallel-groups is conducted across Canada.
      Interested participants are invited to visit the study's Website at www.lhivehealthy.ca

      The study's Website contains video clips explaining the study. After accepting the conditions
      and consenting, participants will enroll in the study by providing an email address and a
      pseudonym. Each participant will be validated through an email address check. After their
      enrolment, participants will receive a hyperlink via email to invite them to complete a
      baseline questionnaire.

      After completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned by the
      computer system either to an experimental group (TAVIE en santé) or to a control group (list
      of 5 websites).

      Three and six months after the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete the online
      questionnaires again.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tobacco smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with a single question: &quot;In the past 7 days, have you had a smoke or even just a single puff? (0=no/1=yes)&quot;. Compared to biochemical verification (urinary cotinine test), this self-report measure has a sensitivity of 96.9% and a specificity of 93.4% (Noonan, Jiang et al. 2013) and it correlates well with biochemical validation (Velicer, Prochaska et al. 1992).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The level of physical activity will be measured through the adaptation of a procedure elaborated and validated by Godin and al. (1985, 1986). Participants will indicate, during a typical week and for each level of intensity (high, moderate, low), the frequency and the mean duration of physical activity practice.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in diet quality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured with the brief tool Starting The Conversation an 8-item simplified food frequency instrument (Paxton, Strycker et al. 2011) derived from a validated 54-item instrument (Jilcott, Keyserling et al. 2007). Item scores are tallied for an overall score (range of 0-16). STC is stable over time and sensitive to treatment/intervention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Intention regarding the adoption of the chosen health behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intention is assessed by three items: 1) &quot;I intend to (a: stop smoking, b: do more physical activity, c: make better choices regarding fat in my diet)&quot; rated on a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree; 2) &quot;I will (a, b or c)&quot; rated on a scale from 1 = very unlikely to 5 = very likely; 3) &quot;the chances that I will (a, b or c) are…&quot; rated on a scale from 1 = very low to 5 = very high. Intention item scores are tallied for an overall score (range of 3-15).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived control regarding the adoption of the chosen health behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived control is assessed by three items : 1) &quot;I feel that I will be able to (a: stop smoking, b: do more physical activity, c: make better choices regarding fat in my diet)&quot; rated on a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree; 2) &quot;I am confident that I will succeed in (a, b or c)&quot; rated on a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree; 3) &quot;how much control do you have over (a, b or c)?&quot; rated on a scale from 1 = strongly uncontrollable to 5 = strongly controllable. Perceived control item scores are tallied for an overall score (range of 3-15).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attitude regarding the adoption of the chosen health behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Attitude is measured by asking participants to respond—using five 5-point adjective pairs (unpleasant/pleasant, useless/useful, bad/good, unsatisfying/satisfying, boring/interesting) to the statement linked to their chosen behavior, &quot;Smoking cessation would be for me…&quot; or &quot;Doing more physical activity would be for me…&quot; or &quot;Making better choices regarding fat in my diet would be for me…&quot;. Attitude item scores are tallied for an overall score (range of 5-25).</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to this arm will be invited to complete a web-based tailored intervention called TAVIE en santé (TAVIE : Traitement, Assistance Virtuelle Infirmière et Enseignement).
TAVIE en santé is a web-based tailored multicomponent intervention addressing smoking cessation, physical activity and healthy eating. Each component consists of seven interactive computer sessions lasting 5-10 minutes. The sessions, hosted by a virtual nurse, aims to develop and strengthen skills required for behavior change.</description>
