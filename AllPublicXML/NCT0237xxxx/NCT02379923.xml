      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate confirmation of placement of any guidewire
      beyond the chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the true vessel lumen in patients in which at
      least one Asahi series of guidewires and/or Corsair microcatheter were used.

      Procedure success will be defined as angiographic visualization of any guidewire in a
      position either distal or proximal to the occlusion depending on the route of access and the
      absence of in-hospital MACE incorporating the MI Task Force Third Universal Definition of
      Myocardial Infarction.

    <description>This is a single arm intent to treat study. A subject is considered enrolled when the subject has given informed consent and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, including angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria, which includes an attempt to cross the target lesion with an investigational device (Asahi Guidewire or Corsair Microcatheter). Clinical evaluation up to 24 hours post procedure will be conducted on all enrolled subjects. The purpose of the clinical follow-up is to determine if the subject has experienced or is experiencing any adverse events. All protocol required information from each visit will be recorded on case report forms.</description>

                  has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the
                  current study endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, intravascular
                  ultrasound (IVUS), or other coronary artery imaging procedures

                  Angiographic Exclusion Criteria:

              17. Previous stenting (drug-eluting or bare metal) in the target vessel unless the
                  following conditions are met:

                    -  It has been at least 9 months since the previous stenting

                    -  That target lesion is at least 15 mm away from the previously placed stent

                    -  The previously stented segment (stent plus 5 mm on either side) has no more
                       than 40% diameter stenosis, based on visual estimate

              18. The target vessel has other lesions proximal to the total occlusion identified
                  with greater than 75% diameter stenosis based on visual estimate. However,
                  planned stenting of the lesion in target vessel which is proximal to the target
                  lesion and can be covered by a single stent (i.e., tandem lesions) are
                  acceptable.
