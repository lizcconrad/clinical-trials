    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this exploratory imaging study is to further characterize [18F]T807,
      an investigational PET radioligand for imaging Tau (thought to be a downstream biomarker
      indicative of neurodegeneration in conditions such as AD).

             least 1 year or, if they are of childbearing potential, must commit to the use of two
             effective contraception methods for the duration of the study.

          -  Male subjects/volunteers and their partners of childbearing potential must commit to
             the use of two effective methods of contraception, one of which should be a barrier
             method for male subjects.

          -  Males and females aged between 50 and 90 years.

          -  Study partner has noticed a recent gradual decrease in the subject's memory (e.g.,
             over the prior 12 months), which the subject may or may not be aware of.

          -  For prodromal subjects, abnormal memory function at screening or 4 weeks prior to

             Disorders Association and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
             Version 5, criteria. This evidence may be compiled during screening but must be fully
             documented in the subject's study file before the baseline visit.

          -  Have an Amyvid (florbetapir F 18 injection) scan at screening that demonstrates
             amyloid binding based on qualitative analysis (visual read) that meets the criteria
             for AD.

          -  Modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale (Moroney et al. 1997) score of ≤ 4.

          -  A neuroimaging evaluation of the brain by MRI that supports a diagnosis of AD with no
             evidence of focal disease to account for dementia or MRI exclusion criteria.

          -  Medications taken for symptomatic treatment of AD must be maintained on a stable
             dosage regimen for at least 4 weeks before the [18F]T807 imaging visit.

             have a high probability of completing the study.

        Healthy Volunteers

          -  Males and females aged between 20 and 90 years. Younger healthy controls will be aged
             20-49 and older healthy controls will be aged 50-90.

          -  Healthy volunteers with no clinically relevant findings on physical examination at
             screening and upon reporting for the [18F]T807 imaging visit.
