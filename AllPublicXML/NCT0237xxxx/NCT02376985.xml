      To examine whether the occurrence of oral mucositis can be reduced by dental oral management
      in patients by comparing the use of dental oral management through instruction by dental and
      oral surgeons (dental oral management group) and an observation group (brushing instruction
      only group) in a randomized, controlled study in females that are using everolimus for

      To examine whether the occurrence of oral mucositis can be reduced by dental oral management
      in patients by comparing the use of dental oral management through instruction by dental
      surgeons or oral surgeons (hereafter referred to as, &quot;dental and oral surgeons&quot;) and an
      observation group in a randomized, controlled study in females that are using everolimus for
      estrogen receptor-positive, hormone therapy-resistant refractory breast cancer.

      The objectives of this study are as described below.

        1. To examine whether the occurrence of oral mucositis can be reduced by implementing
           dental oral management prior to everolimus treatment.

        2. To examine whether the frequency and duration of oral mucositis can be reduced and
           reductions in the dose of everolimus can be reduced by implementing dental oral
           management prior to everolimus treatment.

        3. To examine whether treatment of oral mucositis of over Grade 1 with dexaltin ointment as
           dental oral management can reduce the occurrence of Grade 2 oral mucositis.

        4. To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a group that implements dental
           oral management prior to everolimus treatment and a group that does not.

        5. To establish and strengthen cooperation and organize and expand and information
           distribution network through the participation of oncologists and specialists in breast
           cancer treatment (hereafter referred to as, &quot;oncologists&quot;) and dental and oral surgeons
           in clinical studies.
