    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of nutritional supplementation during
      hemodialysis treatment on beat-to-beat hemodynamics and treatment efficiency in a crossover
      design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of food or nutritional supplements during hemodialysis treatment has been
      shown to improve nutritional status, improve quality of life, and reduce mortality.

      Despite these observations, allowing patients to eat food during hemodialysis treatment is
      sometimes restricted in the United States. The reasons for this restrictive policy are
      multi-factorial, but include concerns related to drops in blood pressure BP or a reduced
      efficiency of solute removal following eating during HD treatment. An alternative to eating
      solid food is to provide patients with liquid nutritional supplements. Clinics in the US are
      more likely to allow the consumption of liquid nutritional supplements, however, little is
      known about the effect that liquid supplements have on blood pressure or treatment
      efficiency. Therefore, the investigators plan to examine the effect of nutritional
      supplementation during hemodialysis treatment on hemodynamics and treatment efficiency in a
      crossover design.
