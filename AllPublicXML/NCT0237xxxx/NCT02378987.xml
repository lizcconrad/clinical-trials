      The aims of this study:

        1. to investigate the difference in motor speech functions among children with cerebral
           palsy (CP) of different motor severities.

        2. to investigate the longitudinal in motor speech functions at 6 months follow-up phase
           among children with CP of different motor severities.

        3. the correlation between motor severity, personal factors, family factors, language
           ability and motor speech in children with CP.

        4. to identify the variables that can predict motor speech functions in children with CP.

      Mental impairment, language and speech disorders are the common associated problems in
      children with CP. Previous studies focus on language and motor speech dysfunctions in
      children with CP at school-age child, adolescents and adults. Few literatures identify the
      determinants for predicted the motor speech performance in these children. It is important
      issue to follow-up the language and motor speech functions in children with CP. These data
      will provide clinicians for outcome prediction and goal setting.The aims of this study: (1)
      to investigate the difference in motor speech functions among children with CP of different
      motor severities, and(2) to investigate the longitudinal in motor speech functions at 6
      months follow-up phase among children with CP of different motor severities, and(3) the
      correlation between motor severity, personal factors, family factors, language ability and
      motor speech in children with CP, and(4) to identify the variables that can predict motor
      speech functions in children with CP.
