  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are dangerous leading to injuries and even death. The VA has made fall prevention a
      priority, but effective programs only reduce falls by 30%. Tai Chi, a standing exercise
      program, has been effective at improving balance but may not prevent falls. Most falls occur
      during walking when an individual experiences a slip or a trip. Programs that focus on
      walking, stepping, and recovery from a slip may be more effective at fall reduction. This
      study will compare Tai Chi to a novel multimodal balance intervention (MMBI). MMBI focuses on
      standing balance, walking, stepping, strength training, and recovery from a slip. The
      Investigators believe that the MMBI program will be more effective than Tai Chi at improving
      balance and preventing falls in older Veterans and the Investigators will use the results of
      this study to develop a larger study on fall prevention in older Veterans.

    <textblock>
      Background: Falls are currently the leading cause of injurious death and non-fatal injuries
      for adults over the age of 65. Older Veterans may be at greater risk for falls due to their
      high burden of medical co-morbidity. The VA has made research into fall prevention a high
      priority. Falls are complex with numerous deficits including impaired balance, decreased
      postural control, muscle weakness, and an inability to successfully negotiate environmental
      hazards. Tai Chi is currently considered to be one of the most effective fall prevention
      exercise interventions, with an endorsement from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) which widely influences health care policy. However, there are few studies
      comparing Tai Chi with another active intervention. Tai Chi may generally improve balance,
      decrease fall risk, and provides a general lower body strengthening. However, Tai Chi may not
      sufficiently improve gait and dynamic mobility and does little to target obstacle
      negotiation, one of the largest contributors to a fall. The majority of falls occur during
      walking, with slips and trips being the most common causes and targeted interventions focused
      on improving stepping and walking ability may be even more effective at improving balance and
      reducing falls.

      The Investigators plan to enroll 56 older (age &gt; 65 years) community dwelling Veterans with a
      history of a fall in the last year who are at high risk for a recurrent fall. After baseline
      testing participants will be randomized to either MMBI or a Tai Chi intervention modeled
      after the Tai Chi Moving for Better Balance Program. All participants will participate in a
      group exercise class in their assigned intervention for 1 hour, 3 times per week for 24
      weeks. After the completion of 24 weeks of exercise group changes will be compared for 1)
      balance (4-square step test), 2) mobility and fall risk (functional gait assessment, clinical
      gait assessment and gait variability on a GAITrite), 4) questionnaires (falls efficacy and
      ABC) 5) lower extremity isometric strength testing (biodex), 6) a whole body dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and CT scan of the abdomen, hips and thighs for determination of
      lower extremity and core muscle composition. The investigators also plan for follow all
      participants for 6 months after completion of the intervention to examine differences in fall
      rates after the cessation of the program between the groups.

      Impact: This research directly benefits Veterans as it may lead to new and effective
      interventions that could reduce fall risk, injury-related hospitalization and death in older
      Veterans. MMBI is also readily exportable to the community and with minimal resources could
      be widely implemented at other VAs as part of standard of care, similar to MOVE!. Results
      from this SPIRE grant will be used to power a larger randomized clinical trial that will
      examine the effectiveness of the two interventions to reduce rate of falls and risk of
      falling in older Veterans at high risk for falls.

    <description>Multimodality Balance Intervention (MMBI): The Investigator's MMBI class will be held 3-times a week for an hour and will consist of a group dynamic balance class (30 minutes), a supervised obstacle course (10 minutes), and lower extremity and core strengthening (20 minutes). The group exercise classes will focus on dynamic weight shifts with an emphasis on the lateral and diagonal directions. Over the 6 months of class, the exercises will gradually increase in difficulty to challenge balance. A skilled instructor will lead each class and 1-2 assistants will be present to assist with fall risk prevention. The supervised obstacle course will focus on obstacle negotiation, gait over challenging surfaces, and moving in lateral, diagonal, and backward directions. Finally, strength training of the lower extremities and core will focus on strengthening major muscles of the lower extremity and core utilizing commonly available gym equipment, ankle weights and body weight.</description>

The emphasis during the class will be on standing movements, body alignment, weight shift and changes of direction. Movements will be adapted as the class progresses to increase the difficulty of weight shift and change in direction over time so that participants balance is continually challenged throughout the 6 months. Chairs or hand rails will be available for the participants to use as needed for balance recovery.</description>
