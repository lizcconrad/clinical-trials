      This study will evaluate the effect of GS-6615 in adults with chronic stable angina and
      coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving a stable daily dose of up to 2 antianginal
      medications. The study will consist of two periods: a 1 to 3 week Qualifying Period and a
      Treatment Period lasting 13 days (± 3 days). During the Qualifying Period and at the end of
      the Treatment Period, participants will undergo exercise tolerance testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to perform a standardized treadmill exercise protocol

          -  At least a 3 month history of chronic stable angina triggered by physical effort and
             relieved by rest and/or short-acting nitroglycerin

          -  Coronary artery disease (CAD) documented by one or more of the following:

               -  Angiographic evidence (either invasive or noninvasive) of ≥ 50% stenosis of one
                  or more major coronary arteries

               -  History of myocardial infarction (MI) documented by positive creatine
                  kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) enzymes, troponins, or electrocardiogram (ECG)
                  changes

               -  Noninvasive imaging stress test diagnostic of CAD (eg, nuclear perfusion scan,
                  stress echocardiogram, stress cardiac magnetic resonance scan)

          -  Stable antianginal treatment with up to 2 antianginal agents

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to exercise or having exercise limitation due to other co-morbidities that
             may interfere with ability to perform required exercise tolerance testing (ETT)

          -  Presence of electrocardiographic or other abnormalities that interfere with ECG
             interpretation or may cause a false positive stress test

          -  History of heart failure as defined by New York Heart Association Class III-IV and/or
             known left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 45%

          -  History of severe disabling angina as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class
             IV

          -  Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization within 3
             months prior to screening, or planned coronary revascularization during the study
             period

          -  Stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Chronic persistent atrial fibrillation

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (seated systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 160 mm Hg or
             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 110 mm Hg)

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 36 kg/m^2
