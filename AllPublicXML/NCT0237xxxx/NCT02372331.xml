  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) is not the program that aim to reduce postoperative
      hospital stay, but the multimodal strategies that aim to attenuate the loss of, and improve
      the restoration of,functional capacity after surgery on evidence-based medicine. The benefits
      of ERAS is proved in many surgical procedures, such as upper gastrointestinal surgery and
      colorectal surgery. However, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD, Whipple's operation) is still one
      of most complex abdominal surgery, and there is no evidence that ERAS is beneficial on PD.

      This study investigate the clinical effectiveness of ERAS on PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This study conduct totally 276 patients who underwent PD with borderline or malignant
           periampullary tumor. The patients divided into two groups. One group take conventional,
           experienced-based perioperative management, the other group take perioperative
           management based on ERAS protocol. Applied ERAS protocol is based on &quot;Guidelines for
           Perioperative Care for Pancreaticoduodenectomy: Ehanced Recovery After Surgery Society
           Recommendations.

        -  The outcomes are analyzed for short-term surgical outcomes including operative factors,
           nutritional status, morbidity, mortality, length of stay, readmission, etc.

        -  Among all subjects who were randomized and started any study intervention (ERAS or
           standard perioperative management), the patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy
           were included as the Full analysis set (FAS). All subjects who didn't undergo
           pancreaticoduodenectomy were excluded from this study.

        -  Besides, as all subjects who were randomized and received any study intervention were
           obliged to follow the study protocol and monitored for best compliance, per-protocol set
           or safety set were not defined differently
