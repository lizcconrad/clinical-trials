      The purpose of this pivotal study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the CompuFlo®
      Epidural Computer Controlled System (referred to hereafter as CompuFlo® Epidural) for the
      epidural space verification.

      The CompuFlo® Epidural System is limited by federal law for investigational use only in
      United States of America and has received CE mark in European Union.

    <description>Primary study endpoint is successful performance of lumbar epidural procedure indicated by loss to temperature sensation bilateral either 1) (i) in at least one dermatome for the non-labor procedures procedures or (ii) in at least two dermatomes for women in labor two dermatomes*, based on a maximum of 3 attempts at epidural space identificationor 2) by correct spread of dye in the epidural space as observed by fluoroscopy for those patients for whom fluoroscopy is performed as a standard medical procedure to identify the exact spine level (landmarking) along with confirmatory contrast dye, based on a maximum of 3 attempts at epidural space identification This is a binary categorical (yes/no) endpoint.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The Subject is at least 18 years of age at screening, but has not had their 91st
             birthday.

          2. The Subject is required to have epidural procedure implemented as part of their
             standard medical treatment according to Principal Investigator assessment.

          3. The Subject is willing to undergo the Informed Consent process prior to enrollment
             into this study.

          4. The Subject is willing to participate in this study for at least 30 days after the
             epidural procedure implementation.

          5. The Subject is willing to participate in this study for at least 3 days after the
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications for epidural procedure / anesthesia (circumstances where the risks
             associated with epidural procedures are higher than usual. These circumstances
             include, but are not limited to anatomical abnormalities, such as spina bifida or
             scoliosis, infection at or near the site of insertion, allergy to the anesthetic or
             intended drug, uncorrected hypovolemia, increased intracranial pressure etc.).

          2. Patients presenting for emergency c-section or other emergencies.

          3. Exclusive use of other treatments such as intravenous analgesia with opioids.

          4. Prior back surgery in lumbar area that would prevent epidural access.

          5. Preexisting neurological deficit that would interfere with dermatome identification.

          6. The Subject observed seizure within 7 days prior to study enrollment.

          7. Presumed and/or confirmed septic embolus.

          8. The Subject has a skin condition (i.e., hemangioma, scleroderma, psoriasis, rash, open
             wound or tattoo) in their lumbar region greater than 4 cm2.

          9. The Subject previously participated in another investigational drug or device trial
             within the preceding 4 weeks.

         10. Severe co-existing or terminal systemic disease that limits life expectancy or may
             interfere with study procedures.

         11. The Subject is otherwise determined by the Investigator to be medically unsuitable for
             participation in this study.
