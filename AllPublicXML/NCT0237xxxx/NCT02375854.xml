  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to investigate the impact of prematurity, with or without
      associated acute kidney injury (AKI), on the future risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by
      establishing a patient registry and biorepository. Serum and urine samples will be collected
      serially from premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Albert
      Einstein College of Medicine/Weiler Hospital and subsequently followed in the NICU follow-up
      and pediatric nephrology ambulatory subspecialty clinics. The biorepository will be linked to
      a comprehensive clinical database.

      This is an observational pilot study to enhance understanding of the pathophysiology and
      epidemiology associated with effects of AKI in premature infants and the role that neonatal
      AKI plays in future development of CKD. In eligible preterm infants, blood and urine samples
      will be collected at pre-specified time points during hospitalization and at outpatient
      follow-up appointments at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years of age and stored in the
      biorepository. Blood pressure will be measured and recorded at NICU discharge and at all
      follow-up visits. A renal ultrasound will be performed to monitor renal growth at 2 and 5
      years of age. All data will be entered into a comprehensive clinical database, including
      laboratory results.
