    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Scale Based on 28 Joint Count Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [ESR]) at Week 4, 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28: measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-4 (ESR) was calculated from number of swollen joints (SJC) and tender joints (TJC ) using the 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (millimeter per hour [mm/hour]) and participant's general health visual analog scale assessment (scores: 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicate worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (ESR) score: 0 (none) to 10 (extreme disease activity), higher scores indicate more disease activity. DAS28-4 (ESR) less than (&lt;) 2.6= remission, &lt;3.2= low disease activity, greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.2 to 5.1= moderate disease activity and &gt;5.1= high disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints using the 28 joints count, C-Reactive protein (milligram per liter [mg/L]) and participant's general health visual analog scale assessment (scores ranging 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad], higher scores indicate worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (CRP) score range: 0 (none) to 10 (extreme disease activity), higher scores indicate more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 2.6= remission, &lt;3.2= low disease activity, greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3.2 to 5.1= moderate disease activity and &gt;5.1= high disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 4, 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0 (least difficulty) and 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicate more difficulty while performing daily living activities.</description>

        <description>ACR70 responder: participants with 70% improvement in tender and swollen 28-joint counts and 70% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 measures: participant global assessment of arthritis (PtGA), physician global assessment of arthritis (PGA), participant pain visual analogue scale (Pain-VAS), health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI) and C-reactive protein. PtGA: participant assessed overall disease activity, score: 0 (no arthritis) to 10 (extreme arthritis), higher score=more arthritis. PGA: physician judged participant’s overall disease activity, score: 0 (no arthritis) to 10 (extreme arthritis), higher score=more arthritis. Pain-VAS: participant assessed arthritis pain by 100 millimeter (mm) VAS, score: 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (extreme pain), higher score=more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (extreme difficulty), higher score=more disability.
