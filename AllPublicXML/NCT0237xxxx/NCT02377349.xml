    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of Boostrix™ when
      compared to a placebo given during 27-36 weeks of gestation in healthy women aged 18-45
      years. Infants born to mothers enrolled in this study will be followed-up in two separate
      clinical studies: 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI] and 201334 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-049 BST: 048].

      The protocol was amended to include Spain in the study. The reasons for the Spain-specific
      amendment are listed below:

        -  Based on the feedback from the Spanish Ethics Committee, the evaluation related to the
           acceptance of cocooning was added in the protocol.

        -  The objectives and endpoints to include cocooning were added in the protocol.

        -  The eligibility criteria for participation of household contacts were defined in the
           protocol.

        -  The study procedures for household contacts were included.
