      Human Breast milk in young children with Norovirus Infection

    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that children with clinically significant norovirus infection
      of the gut who receive enteral human milk will more successfully clear the virus or
      experience improved symptoms compared to children not receiving human milk.

    <description>Donated human milk is subjected to pasteurization prior to use. Milk consumption is to be overseen by a Registered Dietician. Oral or enteral milk feeding will begin at 180 ml/day and will be advanced as quickly as tolerated to a goal of 360 ml/day for 6 weeks. If symptoms and stool tests for norovirus do not improve after 6 weeks, milk administration may continue for an additional 6 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with at least two stool samples taken at least 7 days apart that are positive
             for norovirus

          -  Child has an underlying disease or has received immunosuppressive medication or
             chemotherapy such that clearance of norovirus is expected to be impaired.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of other pathogens causing diarrhea that have specific treatments does
             not preclude enrollment. However, specific treatment should be offered in addition to
             human milk.
