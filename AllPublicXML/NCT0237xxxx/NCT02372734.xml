      The research study will investigate the longitudinal cognitive outcomes in subjects admitted
      as children diagnosed with sepsis who may have had acute kidney injury. Each subject will be
      contacted 2-15 years after their incident admission in order to solicit responses to a
      functional and cognitive quality of life survey. Children admitted during the same time frame
      that did not have kidney injury will also be surveyed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      250 subjects with a prior admission for pediatric sepsis will be contacted 2-15 years
      following the incident admission in order to complete a survey to assess their overall
      quality of life. Children will be administered the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) survey
      with a parental section to allow for parental response. Adult subjects will take the adult
      version of the PedsQL.
