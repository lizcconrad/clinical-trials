  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a combination of four drugs -- lenalidomide, bortezomib,
      dexamethasone and elotuzumab -- as therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of an
      investigational drug (in this case elotuzumab) in combination with lenalidomide, bortezomib
      and dexamethasone to learn more about the side effects of this regimen and whether it is
      effective in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug elotuzumab and the combination of this agent with
      lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone are being studied. It also means that the the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved elotuzumab for the treatment of
      cancer. The drugs, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone are approved by the FDA.
      Participants in this trial will have the option to undergo autologous stem cell
      transplantation (ASCT) following initial therapy with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib,
      and dexamethasone. ASCT is a standard of care in the treatment of multiple myeloma. All
      participants, including those who undergo ASCT and those who choose not to, will receive what
      is referred to as &quot;maintenance therapy&quot; - or continuous treatment - after the initial cycles
      of treatment with elotuzumab, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone. The specific
      maintenance regimen will be determined by risk category.

    <description>Participants will receive therapy with the combination of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone and elotuzumab (E-RVD). Induction cycles (1 to 8) are 21-day cycles.
Elotuzumab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion
Bortezomib as a subcutaneous injection
Lenalidomide single daily oral dose
Dexamethasone as oral tablets and IV infusion
Stem cell mobilization will be performed for all subjects at the end of Cycle 4.
Subjects may elect to stop E-RVD Cycle 4 and proceed to autologous SCT. Subjects who do not proceed to SCT may receive 8 cycles of induction therapy.
- The maintenance schedule (28 days) will start after 8 cycles of induction regimen for subjects not proceeding with SCT, or after recovery from SCT for subjects proceeding with it.
Maintenance therapy with E-RVD will be administered to all patients, with the specific maintenance regimen determined by risk category.</description>
