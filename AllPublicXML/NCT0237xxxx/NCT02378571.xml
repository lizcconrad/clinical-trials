  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility of conducting a large
      scale randomized clinical trial that compares remote monitoring of adherence to loop
      diuretics using a wireless electronic pillcap with usual care among recently hospitalized
      heart failure patients. The long-term goal of this program of research is to determine the
      effect of the adherence telemonitoring intervention on medication adherence and hospital
      readmissions among recently hospitalized heart failure patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one in four patients hospitalized with heart failure is readmitted within 30
      days of discharge and more than 50% are readmitted within 6 months of discharge. Heart
      failure admissions are a major contributor to the enormous health care costs associated with
      heart failure. Thus far, the identification of effective interventions that prevent
      unnecessary readmissions has remained elusive. As a result, there is a pressing need to
      identify novel, cost-effective approaches to reducing heart failure readmissions. A growing
      body of research suggests that poor adherence to heart failure medications is a major reason
      for preventable heart failure readmissions. In particular, loop diuretic medications are
      essential to preventing the cardiopulmonary system from becoming overloaded. Patients who
      have been recently hospitalized may be especially vulnerable to adherence problems as a
      result of the stress of the recent hospitalization which commonly induces sleep deprivation,
      nutritional deficiency, physical deconditioning, cognitive impairment, and even delirium.
      Recent advances in wireless health now enable us to remotely, unobtrusively, and objectively
      monitor adherence to heart failure medications in the post-discharge period. Early
      identification of non-adherence to loop diuretic medications has the prevention to prevent a
      volume overloaded state that leads to a heart failure readmission. As patients who are
      non-adherent to their loop diuretics may also be non-adherent to other recommended
      self-management behaviors, early identification of medication nonadherence may provide the
      context to identify other gaps in self-management. To test our hypothesis that it is feasible
      to conduct a randomized trial of wireless, medication adherence monitoring with feedback to
      patients and clinicians, the investigators will enroll 40 patients who are hospitalized for
      heart failure and discharged on a diuretic medication. Patients will be randomized to 1)
      usual heart failure care + telemonitoring adherence to diuretic medications (INT); N=20 or 2)
      usual heart failure care (CTR); N=20. All patients will be asked to take their diuretic
      medication from a standard pill bottle covered by an electronic pill cap (GlowCap), but only
      patients assigned to the intervention arm will have their adherence telemonitored by a study
      clinician in real-time. Patients will have their adherence to medications measured in this
      fashion for 30 days after discharge. Patients will be contacted at 30 days to determine if
      they have been hospitalized and to collect other self-reported outcomes data.

    <description>Loop diuretic adherence: Adherence to the diuretic medication will be electronically measured using GlowCaps (Vitality Inc.) in the 30 days after hospitalization. Medication adherence will be calculated as the percent of days participants take the correct number of doses of their diuretic. Days when participants are incapable of taking their medication from the GlowCap bottle (e.g., while hospitalized) will be censored from calculations.</description>

Hospital records will be reviewed to confirm readmissions, to determine the reason for readmission or emergency room visit (heart failure versus other), and to determine whether it was related to medication nonadherence.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to usual care will also be provided with a GlowCap prior to discharge and will be instructed to take their loop diuretic from this bottle and to notify the study team about prescribed dose changes. This information, however, will solely be used to measure medication adherence and will not be provided to a member of the study team nor to any of the participants' health care providers until the completion of the study period, at least 1 month later. Participants will not be provided with any advice on heart failure adherence.</description>

    <description>At discharge, participants in the intervention group will be instructed to take their loop diuretic exclusively from the GlowCap in the manner prescribed by their physician. A study team member will review the adherence data on a daily basis (except holidays and weekends) during the first 7 days after discharge, and then on, at minimum, a weekly basis. The study team member will respond to adherence data using clinical judgment as they would if the information was obtained during clinical care. Specifically, when contacting nonadherent participants, the member of the study team will provide participants with feedback on their electronic adherence; will inquire about potential consequences of missed doses; and will assess and respond to reasons for missed doses.</description>
