    <textblock>
      To assess incidence of adverse drug reactions and use pattern of topical steroids among
      patients who are prescribed or purchase over the counter (OTC) topical steroids for skin
      conditions in Korea

      -  Active collection of safety data, systemic and local adverse events.

        -  In addition to spontaneous adverse event reports, patients will be asked on occurrence
           of adverse events upon use of topical steroids at 1 month, 2 month, and 6 month after
           study enrollment by e-mail or phone call

        -  Causality of adverse events will be assessed by independent two professionals

        -  Document the utility pattern of topical steroid, misuse (inappropriate indication) or
           overuse (in terms of application frequency or treatment duration)

        -  Collection of information related with adverse event management
