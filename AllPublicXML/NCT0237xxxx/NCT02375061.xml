  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to test the efficacy of a Positive Psychology Intervention (Best Possible
      Self, BPS) over optimism, future expectancies and positive affect at mid-term, in comparison
      to a control group, in fibromyalgia patients. The principal hypothesis is that the BPS
      intervention will enhance significantly the levels of optimism, positive future expectancies
      and positive affect in comparison to the Control group at short and mid-term.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of positive psychological factors in pain
      adjustment. Specially, optimism has been linked to lower pain sensitivity, better physical
      functioning, less psychological distress and pain catastrophizing. Until recently, the
      beneficial effects of optimism on pain have been studied mostly in correlational studies or
      in experimental interventions in laboratory settings. To address the gap between research and
      clinical practice, the aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the Best Possible Self
      intervention (BPS) using Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with fibromyalgia
      patients.

      BPS is a guided imagery exercise that requires participants to envision themselves in the
      future, achieving desired goals in different areas of their lives. This exercise has shown
      efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect compared to a control
      condition, in general population (Meevissen, Peters &amp; Alberts, 2011; Sheldon &amp;Lyubomirsky,
      2012; Peters, Flink, Boersma &amp; Linton, 2010). Taking into account the prior literature, the
      aim of the present study is to carry out a randomized controlled study in order to replicate
      the findings about the effects of BPS on optimism, mood and affect in a chronic pain
      population. The exercise will be applied through a Positive Technology system and the effects
      will be analyzed during four months. The design employed in this study is similar to the used
      in other studies (Meevissen et al, 2011; Renner, Schwarz, Peters &amp; Huibers, 2014; Sheldon &amp;
      Lyubomirsky, 2006).

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory II</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is one of the most widely questionnaires used to evaluate severity of depression in pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. The instrument has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.76 to 0.95) and test-retest reliability of around 0.8. The Spanish version of this instrument has also shown a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.87) for both the general and the clinical population (Cronbach's alpha of 0.89). Summed to obtain the total score, which can be a maximum of 63 points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS instructions ask participants to reflect on past painful experiences, and to indicate the degree to which they experienced each of 13 thoughts or feelings when experiencing pain, on 5-point scales with the end points (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS yields a total score and three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. The PCS has been shown to have adequate to excellent 6 internal consistency (coefficient alphas: total PCS = 0.87, rumination = 0.87, magnification = 0.66, and helplessness = 0.78).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure analyzes the levels of positive (PA) and negative affect (NA). The instrument consists of 20 items, 10 for each level of affect. Participants rate on a 5-point scale (Not at all - Extremely). The Spanish version has demonstrated high internal consistency (0.89 to 0.91 for PA and NA in women and 0.87 for AP and 0.89 for AN in men) in college students.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Orientation Test</measure>

It consists of 20 statements referring to negative expectancies and 10 statements referring to positive expectancies. Participants answer on a 7-point scale (Not at all likely to occur - Extremely likely to occur). Some studies have found an appropriate levels of internal consistency for positive and negative expectancies (α=0.80-0.82 and 0.91, respectively).</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to write and imagine about a future in which they have reached all their goals in four different domains: personal, professional, social and health domain. They carry out the exercise in a Positive Technology System called the &quot;Book of Life&quot;, which has shown efficacy in the enhancement of positive mood (Baños, Etchemendy, Farfallini, García-Palacios, Quero &amp; Botella, 2014). This application looks like a personal diary, where participants can write all that they want and these essays are supported by multimedia content (pictures, songs and videos). Additionally, they can continue doing the exercise in a web platform (TEO-Emotional Therapy Online) in which they can visualize all the content they had developed previously.</description>
