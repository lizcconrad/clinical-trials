      Gestational diabetes is the development of diabetes during pregnancy. Left untreated,
      gestational diabetes and preeclampsia can lead to serious -- or even fatal -- complications
      for both mother and child. Some evidence suggesting omega-3 fatty acids might help protect
      women from two serious pregnancy complications -- gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.
      Omega-3 fatty acids, in particular Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), help a pregnant woman give her
      developing baby every advantage in life starting in-utero. Recent studies suggested that the
      biologic processes underlying the observed associations may involve epigenetic changes,
      specifically DNA methylation. In this study the investigators aimed to examine the effect of
      fish oil supplementation in women with gestational diabetes mellitus on newborn outcomes and
      insulin like growth factor 1 DNA methylation.

    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes is the development of diabetes during pregnancy. According to the
      National Institutes of Health, gestational diabetes occurs in about 5 percent of all
      pregnancies in the United States, resulting in about 200,000 cases a year. Treatment involves
      dietary measures, exercise and, in some cases, insulin injections. All pregnant women should
      be taking a prescribed pre-natal vitamin, and should also supplement with fish oil or another
      source of omega-3 fatty acids to help support the nervous system of their developing child.

      Left untreated, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia can lead to serious -- or even fatal --
      complications for both mother and child. In diabetic pregnancies there is an increased risk
      of birth defects. Some evidence suggesting omega-3 fatty acids might help protect women from
      two serious pregnancy complications -- gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Omega-3 fatty
      acids, in particular Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), help a pregnant woman give her developing
      baby every advantage in life starting in-utero. In general the omega-3 fatty acids found in
      fish help the cardiovascular system, the brain (including moods), and even the brain and eyes
      of a developing baby. The risk of pre-term delivery and low birth weight is three and a half
      times higher when mothers are deficient in DHA. Recent studies suggested that the biologic
      processes underlying the observed associations may involve epigenetic changes, specifically
      DNA methylation. In this study the investigators aimed to examine the effect of fish oil
      supplementation in women with gestational diabetes mellitus on newborn outcomes and insulin
      like growth factor 1 DNA methylation.
