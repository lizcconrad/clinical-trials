  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature data show that long-term monitoring has an effect on weight loss, comorbidity
      and on improving the quality of life. However, there are still no studies on monitoring obese
      patients after taking initial multidisciplinary approach. The recommendations of the HAS 2011
      advocated &quot;continuous monitoring needed to prevent weight regain, monitor the consequences of
      overweight and treat comorbidities. This requires a long-term support. &quot;The frequency of
      follow-up consultations is not specified and &quot;must be adapted to achieve a weight loss target
      and maintain.&quot; Having no specific recommendations on the frequency of monitoring, the
      investigators chose to experiment closer monitoring than our current monitoring to assess
      what is the best frequency monitoring, in terms of: weight loss, quality of life, feeding
      behavior, changes in physical abilities, evolution of comorbidities associated with obesity.
      The recommendations of the HAS 2011 advocate support of a multidisciplinary obesity for
      weight loss of 5% to 10 %, which, if maintained, can reduce comorbidities associated with
      obesity (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, pain associated with osteoarthritis).

      2 groups of randomized patients will be followed:

        -  The control group will follow the current center: every four months for a year, combined
           with monitoring by email or regular mail during the year.

        -  The experimental group will be a follow-up every two months for one year HDJ more of the
           same followed by email or postal mail.

      Follow by email or mail is identical to the control group, as well as HDJ 12 months.
