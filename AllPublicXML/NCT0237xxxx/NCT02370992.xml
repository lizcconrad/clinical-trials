  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low dose rate brachytherapy using iodine 125 is well established as a treatment for low and
      intermediate risk prostate cancer. Currently there is uncertainty as to the safety of this
      technique in patients who have had a previous transurethral resection of the prostate gland
      (TURP) for obstruction of the urine flow through the prostatic urethra. Early experience when
      the technique was being developed in the 1980s suggested that there was a higher incidence of
      urinary incontinence after brachytherapy if there had been a previous TURP. It is however
      clear that with increasing experience many centres offer this treatment to patients who have
      had previous TURP, using various parameters to select patients including time from the TURP
      and persence or absence of a significant cavity within the gland on MRI scanning. There has
      been no systematic study of I125 brachytherapy after TURP in the current era which might
      address and inform the practice for future patient. Hence this study is designed to formally
      assess the safety of I125 brachytherapy after previous TURP.
