  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if lumpectomy followed by Intraoperative Electron
      Radiation Therapy (IOeRT) as a single, full dose partial breast irradiation will have as good
      or better results in preventing recurrence of local breast cancer, cosmetic appearance and
      early and late side effects.

      See points VIII inclusion/exclusion criteria

      Operation:

        -  Lumpectomy, steninal node biopsy

        -  IOeRT

      After Surgery:

        -  Meet with a medical oncologist and discuss if chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy is
           recommended as part of your treatment course. In some cases, pathology results may
           indicate the need for removal of additional lymph nodes. The doctor will review
           pathology and discuss if additional surgery is required.

        -  Chemotherapy (if indicated)

        -  Hormone therapy (if indicated)

      Follow-Up

        -  Visits will be completed with the surgeon, radiation oncologist and research staff as
           the protocol indicates.

        -  Assessements of acute toxicity according to CTC-toxicity scoring system

        -  Assessments of late toxicity according to LENT-SOMA scoring systems

        -  Assessment of cosmetic outcome according to scoring system and photo documentation in
           standardized positions.

We will use a 20% toxicity cutoff, the protocol would be stopped if 2/10 were determined to have developed significant toxicities, grade 3 or greater, at the first 6-month follow-up visit. 2/10 patients at 6-months follow-up, 4/20 patients at 1-year follow-up, 6/30 at 18-months follow-up, 8/40 at 24-months follow-up, 10/50 at 30-months follow-up, 12/60 at 36-months follow-up, 14/70 at 42-months follow-up, 16/80 at 48-months follow-up, 18/90 at 54-months and 20/100 at 60-months follow-up.
Cosmetic evaluations will be completed by the patient and radiation oncologist an via breast exams, questionnaires and breast photo documentation.</description>
