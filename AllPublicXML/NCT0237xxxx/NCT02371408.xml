             barrier method.

          6. Patients for Group 1 must be treatment-naïve - i.e., they have never received any
             antiviral treatment for their HCV infection, including interferon, pegylated
             interferon, ribavirin, or other regulatory-approved or investigational HCV antiviral
             therapies.

          7. Patients for Groups 2 and 3 must have previously failed treatment with an
             interferon-based therapy - i.e., interferon or pegylated interferon, with or without
             ribavirin, with no other previous HCV antiviral therapies.

             Patients for Group 2 must be non-cirrhotic diagnosed on screening visit by both
             Fibroscan™ liver stiffness measurement &lt; 12.5 kPa and FIB-4 score &lt; 3.25 if the

             detection of cirrhosis. In case that the liver biopsy is not applicable, hepatic
             imaging or ultrasound reports could be used for determination of cirrhosis.

             Patients for Group 3 must have underlying cirrhosis diagnosed on screening visit by
             both Fibroscan liver stiffness measurement &gt; 12.5 kPa and FIB-4 score &gt; 3.25, if the
             results of Fibroscan and FIB-4 score are not matching liver biopsy will be used for
             detection of cirrhosis. In case that the liver biopsy is not applicable, hepatic

             Screening, shows no evidence of potential hepatocellular cancer.

          5. History of treatment with any investigational or regulatory-approved direct-acting
             antiviral (DAA) agent for HCV infection - nucleos(t)ide or non-nucleosidic HCV
             polymerase inhibitor, HCV protease inhibitor, NS5A inhibitor, or other antiviral agent
             for HCV infection other than pegylated -interferon and/or ribavirin Previous pegylated
             interferon and/or ribavirin treatment is allowed for Groups 2 and 3 but prohibited for
