  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates the performance of a new dialyzer (Theranova 400) containing a
      membrane with increased pore sizes. The performance will be determined by the removal of
      middle molecules (with different molecular size) from the blood compartment. Three different
      Theranova 400 prototypes (AA, BB and CC) operated in hemodialysis mode will be compared with
      a Cordiax FX-80 dialyzer, operated in hemodialysis mode. Safety events and albumin loss into
      the dialysate will be monitored

             condition)

             Investigator, potentially conflict with the study purpose or procedures (eg, severe
             hypoalbuminemia or anemia)

         10. Patient has a known significant psychiatric disorder or mental disability that could
             interfere with the patient's ability to provide informed consent and/or comply with
             protocol procedures

         11. Patient has a history of non-compliance with the dialysis prescription, as assessed by
             the Investigator

         12. Patient has participated in another interventional clinical study in the past 3
             months, or is currently participating in another interventional clinical study
