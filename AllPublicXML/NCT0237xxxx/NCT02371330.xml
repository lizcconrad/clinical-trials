  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective longitudinal study that evaluates Platelet Function Analyzer-100
      (PFA-100) CT-ADPs (closure time-ADP) and incidence of bleeding using the Neonatal Bleeding
      Assessment Tool - Neo-BAT in preterm neonates &lt;32 weeks gestational age or with a birth
      weight &lt;1500 grams and with different degrees of thrombocytopenia.

      The investigators hypothesized that PFA-100 CT-ADP, a global in vitro test of primary
      hemostasis, will be a better predictor of clinical bleeding in neonates than platelet count
      alone. A bleeding risk assessment marker could help physicians more accurately determine the
      risk/benefit ratio of platelet transfusions, guiding platelet transfusion decisions in
      neonates with thrombocytopenia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &lt;32 weeks gestation or with a birth weight &lt;1500 grams;

          -  Have confirmed moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count
             &lt;100x109/L;

          -  Have a parent/guardian willing to comply with the protocol and provide written
             informed consent.

          -  Are not expected to survive by the Attending Neonatologist;

          -  Are thought to have a congenital thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction, based on
             family history or clinical presentation (e.g. associated congenital malformations,
             platelet morphology);

          -  Have a major chromosomal anomaly such as Trisomy 13, 18, or 21.
