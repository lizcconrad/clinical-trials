    <textblock>
      Continuous Veno-Veinous Hemofiltration (CVVH) is a frequently used renal replacement therapy
      in intensive care units for patients with acute renal failure. In theory, this therapy should
      be continuous, 24 hours/day.

      However, it is wellknown that actual duration of CVVH sessions is much lower than scheduled,
      with frequent &quot;circuit down-times&quot; (between 1 to 6 hours/day). There are many reasons for
      premature ending of CVVH sessions (i.e. catheter dysfunction, wrong settings, low
      anticoagulation…), but early detection of any dysfunction may prevent (at least in part) the
      CVVH circuit coagulation. ICU Nurses are on the first line to manage CVVH sessions,
      particularly in case of alarms.

      High-fidelity simulation has been recently proposed for health care provider education. It
      has been consistently associated with large effects for outcomes of knowledge, skills, and
      behaviors but with moderate effects for patient related outcomes. Indeed, few studies have
      assess the impact of simulation on patient outcome following complexe procedures, that
      implies team work in addition to individual skills.

      In our 12-bed surgical ICU, investigators have decided to implement CVVH technics (in
      addition to the dialysis that we already used). Before implementing this new technic in the
      ICU, investigators designed this study in order assess wether a high-fidelity based
      ICU-nurses education program would improve the outcome of CVVH sessions, compared to the
      conventional education program, proposed by the CVVH manufacturer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All nurses of our 12-beds surgical ICU were randomized to one of the two arms for CVVH
      training (ie &quot;conventional&quot;, the control arm, or &quot;conventional + high-fidelity simulation&quot;,
      the intervention arm). Randomization was stratified according to nurse's experience with
      dialysis (i.e. defined as novice, standard or expert).

      Then, all CVVH sessions performed in the ICU, were randomized to be supervised by nurses of
      one of the two arms only. The nurse in charge of the patient could thus be changed, depending
      on his/her group (note that the usual ratio is 1 nurse for 2.5 patients). Investigators use a
      minimization algorithm for this randomization, that take into account the presence of shock,
      counter-indication for heparin use, patient's agitation, site of dialysis catheter insertion
      (ie. Internal jugular or femoral) and previous early ending of the session. Prescription of
      CVVH was standardized (ie. Objective of 35 ml/kg/h of ultrafiltrate, with 1/3 in predilution
      and 2/3 post-dilution), and used unfractionated heparin.

      All CVVH parameters (i.e. pressures, flow, alarms…) were recorded continuously, using a
      computer. In addition, hemodynamic parameters and biological parameters were prospectively
      recorded every 3 hours.

      Prescription of CVVH ending should be timely written by the doctors. Nurses were asked to
      clearly record the time of CVVH session ending. An ending appearing less than 4 hours before
      the scheduled arrest of the session is considered as a &quot;prematurely ending&quot;. Total and
      effective duration of each session were also recorded , as well as the total volume of
      ultrafiltrate.

    <description>All nurses received a 4 hours formation, called &quot;conventional formation&quot;, given by a professional trainer, that included 2 hours of theorical formation and 2 hours of practical training, based on CVVH generator demonstration. In addition, the trainer was present in the ICU during the first week of CVVH implementation, to answer any questions and to help nurses with their first CVVH sessions</description>

    <description>Nurses received, in addition to the conventional formation (as in the control arm), a set of 3 high-fidelity simulation sessions. Each session lasted 1 to 2 hours, used high fidelity mannequin and CVVH generator and took place in an ICU room environment. For each session, a specific scenario was designed, the session began with a briefing and ended with a debriefing, based on video recording.</description>
