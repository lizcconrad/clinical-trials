      Aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of new anti-CD20 antibody (GA101) in association
      with DHAP as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy BEAM with ASCT in patients with
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial in young patients (18-65
      years) affected by relapsed/refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) at
      diagnosis,eligible to high-dose therapy.

      Aim of the study is to assess whether the addition of GA101 to DHAP is more promising than
      standard R-DHAP, as induction therapy before high dose chemotherapy BEAM with ASCT with
      respect to response.

      The study is designed primarily to evaluate the efficacy of GA101-DHAP in patients with DLBCL
      who have relapsed or are refractory to one chemotherapy regimen and secondarily to assess
      safety and capability to mobilize peripheral stem cells The study is designed with two stages
      and with stopping rules after the first stage. In particular, at the end of the first stage,
      the study will be stopped if the efficacy is too low or if the toxicity, measured during the
      drug administration period, is too high with respect to pre-defined thresholds. .
