  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to determine whether the addition of inspiratory hold (breath holding)
      can decrease the radiation dose that the heart and lung receive for patients being treated
      for left sided breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a standard of care CT simulation, which includes an additional breath hold CT.
      Inspiratory gated breath-hold will be used. Two radiation plans will be generated: one for
      the CT scan performed free breathing, and one for the CT scan performed with inspiratory
      gated breath hold. The cardiac and lung doses will be determined. At the discretion of the
      treating physician, the plan with the lower cardiac and lung dose may be used to treat the
      patient.
