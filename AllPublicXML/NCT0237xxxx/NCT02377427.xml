  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that exhibits
      dose proportional and time-independent pharmacokinetics. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts. Part A: it will be pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) study conducted to
      support the use of mepolizumab in children aged 6 to 11 years with severe eosinophilic asthma
      and characterize the PK/PD of mepolizumab 40 milligrams (mg) or 100 mg administered
      subcutaneously depending on participant body weight. Part B: It is a long-term safety /
      pharmacodynamic phase in which extended treatment for a further 52 weeks will be offered on
      an optional basis to those subjects eligible for continued treatment. Participants with
      bodyweight &lt;40 kilogram (kg) will be dosed with mepolizumab 40 mg and participants with body
      weight &gt;=40 kg will be dosed with mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneously in upper arm or thigh at
      Visit 2 (Week 0). Approximately 40 male or female participants aged 6 to 11 years will be
      screened to achieve approximately 28 eligible participants entering the treatment phase to
      allow availability of 20 evaluable participants, with a minimum of six participants enrolled
      in the &lt;40 kg bodyweight group. The total duration of the study will be 22 weeks and will
      include a run-in period of 1-2 weeks, a treatment period of 12 weeks and a follow-up phase of
      8 weeks. A participant will be considered having completed the study if the participant
      completes all phases of the study including the follow-up phase (Week 20 [visit 8]).

    <measure>Body Weight-adjusted Apparent Clearance of Mepolizumab for Part A</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, 8, 9, 12, 16 and 20</time_frame>
    <description>PK samples were collected at pre-dose on Week 4 and 8; and at Week 9, 12, 16 and 20. The body weight-adjusted apparent clearance was compared between adults and participants aged 6 to 11 years old with severe eosinophilic asthma when mepolizumab was administered subcutaneously. Point estimate and 90% CI for participants aged 6 to 11 years (centred to a mean bodyweight of 70kg) was compared with the historic adult estimated body-weight adjusted clearance of 0.22 Liter (L)/day, around which a proposed 80-125% interval was applied i.e. 0.18-0.28 L/day. Assuming an absolute bioavailability of 75% this corresponds to an apparent clearance of 0.29 L/day with the proposed 80% to 125% interval of 0.23 to 0.36 L/day. Note the average bodyweight of 70kg (mean body weight observed in adults) was not observed in the study.</description>

        <title>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Mepolizumab for Part A</title>
        <description>PK of mepolizumab was evaluated in participants using Cmax. PK samples were collected at pre-dose on Week 4 and 8; and at Week 9, 12, 16 and 20. Cmax was evaluated by population PK methods and mean and standard error from the final model has been tabulated. Estimates have been presented from the final model centred to mean bodyweights of 27kg, 50kg and 70kg. Note the average bodyweight of 70kg (mean body weight observed in adults) was not investigated in the study. PK Population included all participants receiving at least one dose of mepolizumab beginning at Visit 2 (Week 0) and having at least one blood sample taken at Visit 3 (Week 4) or thereafter with measurable mepolizumab plasma concentration.</description>

        <title>Ratio to Baseline in Absolute Blood Eosinophil Count at Week 12 for Part A</title>
        <description>PD of mepolizumab was evaluated in participants using ratio to Baseline in absolute blood eosinophil count. Blood samples were collected at Screening and at Week 0, 4, 8, 9, 12, 16 and 20. Baseline was defined as the latest value recorded prior to the first dose of mepolizumab. Ratio to Baseline was calculated as post-dose visit value/Baseline value. It was evaluated by Pharmacodynamic Eosinophils (PDe) Population which included all participants receiving at least one dose of mepolizumab beginning at Visit 2 (Week 0) and having at least one Part A blood sample evaluable for blood eosinophil count.</description>

        <title>Body Weight-adjusted Apparent Clearance of Mepolizumab for Part A</title>
        <description>PK samples were collected at pre-dose on Week 4 and 8; and at Week 9, 12, 16 and 20. The body weight-adjusted apparent clearance was compared between adults and participants aged 6 to 11 years old with severe eosinophilic asthma when mepolizumab was administered subcutaneously. Point estimate and 90% CI for participants aged 6 to 11 years (centred to a mean bodyweight of 70kg) was compared with the historic adult estimated body-weight adjusted clearance of 0.22 Liter (L)/day, around which a proposed 80-125% interval was applied i.e. 0.18-0.28 L/day. Assuming an absolute bioavailability of 75% this corresponds to an apparent clearance of 0.29 L/day with the proposed 80% to 125% interval of 0.23 to 0.36 L/day. Note the average bodyweight of 70kg (mean body weight observed in adults) was not observed in the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) at Week 12 in Part A</title>
        <description>ACQ-7 is a simple questionnaire to measure the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or a result of treatment. The ACQ-7 uses a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum impairment for symptoms and rescue use; and 7 categories for forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]%). The instrument has a reported high test-retest reproducibility with an intraclass correlation coefficient =0.90. The minimally important change in score is 0.5. Baseline was defined as the latest value recorded prior to the first dose of mepolizumab. Change from Baseline was calculated as score obtained at Week 12 minus Baseline Score. Pharmacodynamic Outcome (PDo) Population included all participants who received at least one dose of mepolizumab beginning at Visit 2 and having at least one Part A assessment of pharmacodynamic outcomes.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) at Week 12 for Part A</title>
        <description>The C-ACT assesses asthma control in children 4-11 years of age. The C-ACT is a 7-question, 2-part questionnaire, with items one through 4 were completed by the child (with assistance from a caregiver, as needed) and items 5 to 7 were completed by the caregiver. A total sum score based upon responses to all items was calculated to provide an overall measure of asthma control. The derived C-ACT score ranges from 0 (maximum impairment) to 27 (no impairment), where higher scores represent a better outcome. Baseline was defined as the latest value recorded prior to the first dose of mepolizumab. Change from Baseline was calculated as score obtained at Week 12 minus Baseline Score.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Time Change From Baseline Relative to Normal Range in Clinical Chemistry Parameters in Part A</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening and at Week 4, 8, 12 and 20 in Part A to perform alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), albumin, protein, total billirubin, creatinine, direct billirubin, urate, calcium, carbon dioxide (CO2), chloride, glucose, potassium, sodium and urea. The Baseline was defined as the latest value recorded prior to the first dose of mepolizumab. Any time post Baseline = all visits (including scheduled and unscheduled) post Baseline was considered for this visit derivation. If participant had at least one value for categories &quot;To Low&quot; and/or &quot;To High&quot; along with &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; then participant was counted under &quot;To Low&quot; and/or &quot;To High&quot;. If participant had values which belong only to &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; then participant was counted under &quot;To Normal or No Change&quot; only.</description>

        <description>Blood sample for immunogenicity was collected for anti-mepolizumab binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies response in Part A at Week 0, 16 and 20 prior to study treatment administration. Number of participants with positive anti-mepolizumab binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies response was summarized. Participant was considered 'Positive' if they had at least one positive post-baseline assay result. Any Time Post Baseline has been presented, which included all visits (including scheduled and unscheduled) post-baseline was considered for this visit derivation. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>
