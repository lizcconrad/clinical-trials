  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, three-arm, open-label, blinded analysis. Patients
      admitted with stroke diagnosis and with suspected dysphagia that meet the initial inclusion
      and exclusion criteria will be consented into the clinical investigation. Patients who meet
      the second set of inclusion criteria (dysphagia confirmed by VFS) will be randomized to
      either active (motor or sensory) or standard treatment (control group) arms.

      Subjects included in this clinical investigation will be evaluated at screening, 1-week,
      3-months and at 12-months post treatment.

      The main aim of the study will be to assess the effect of VitalStim therapy on improving the
      safety of swallow according to the VFS, after the treatment and at 1-year follow up, on
      patients with chronic post-stroke OD.

    <description>Will not receive any treatment procedure. Patients allocated in the control group will be treated according to the standard clinical care of patients with dysphagia at our center, that includes: adaptation of fluids, diet and oral hygiene recommendations, and postural and swallowing maneuvers training if necessary.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients allocated in the sensory group will be treated with transcutaneous electrical stimulation at sensory level. In addition, they will receive the standard clinical care described in the control group. The treatment procedure will consist of the application, at rest, of 80 Hz of transcutaneous electrical stimulus (biphasic, 700 µs) using VitalStim device (Chattanooga Group, Hixson, TN, USA), 2 sessions of 1 hour per day the first week, and 1 hour per day the next week. Sessions will be applied for two weeks. Treatment intensity will be set to 75% of motor threshold and electrode placement, thyro-hyoid (placement 3a described in the VitalStim Certification Program). The motor threshold will be determined by triplicate, as the intensity level at which the patient reports a grabbing or pulling sensation and confirmed by the clinician. Every 10 min, the patient will be asked if the initial sensation is maintained and, if necessary, treatment intensity will be re-adjusted.</description>

Sessions will be applied from Monday to Friday for two weeks. Treatment intensity will be set to the motor threshold and electrode placement, supra-hyoid. The motor threshold will be determined by triplicate, as the intensity level at which the patient reports a grabbing or pulling sensation and confirmed by the clinician. Every 10 min, the patient will be asked if the initial sensation is maintained and, if necessary, treatment intensity will be re-adjusted.</description>
