    <textblock>
      Echocardiography parameters for cardiac dyssynchrony had no predictive value in current
      multicentric prospective studies concerning cardiac resynchronization therapy. Comprehensive
      echocardiography and new parameters as 2D and 3D strain, as well as 3D echo have been
      analyzed, but their definite value has not been proven yet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with severe heart failure, delays in the conduction system can result in
      asynchronous contraction impairing cardiac function. By implantation of pacemaker systems
      with three leads located in atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus, tracing back this
      deranged contraction closer to the physiological excitation propagation is aimed (cardial
      resynchronization therapy [CRT]). Despite patient selection according to the guidelines
      nearly one-third of the patients do not profit, neither clinically nor echocardiographically,
      from an implanted CRT-device. In addition, recent studies have shown that no reliable
      prediction may be achieved with the known echocardiographic parameters of dyssynchrony,
      regarding the response to such therapy. The aim of this study is therefore to assess new
      echocardiographic parameters, which may allow to better predict CRT response.
