  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Ebola virus has infected and killed people, mostly in Africa. In 2014, the Ebola virus has
      affected several thousand people. There is no approved effective way to treat or prevent
      Ebola. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine for it.

      Objectives:

      To study the anti-Ebola vaccine VSV ZEBOV (BPSC1001) to see if it is safe. Also, to see how
      it affects people's immune system.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy men and women ages 18-65. They must not have a chronic medical condition that
      requires medicine. They must not be a healthcare worker, an animal care worker, or a
      childcare worker, and they must not have a household contact that has a compromised immune
      system, is pregnant, or is under the age of 5 years.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to get the vaccine or the placebo.

        -  At visit 1 (vaccination), vital signs will be taken and blood will be drawn. The vaccine
           or placebo will be injected into the upper arm muscle.

        -  Participants will return to the clinic 11 times over the next 6 months. Participants
           will have blood drawn at every study visit. Their mouth will be swabbed and urine tested
           at least four times after vaccination.

        -  For 14 days after vaccination, participants will write down their temperature, any
           symptoms, and any redness at the injection site. They will bring the booklet to each
           study visit.

      All visits take place at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology, Dalhousie University/IWK Health
      Centre, Halifax, NS.
