      This is a pilot study examining the effect of dietary supplements that contain soy products.
      The purpose of this study to find out if soy supplementation can help to reduce the storage
      of a certain kind of fat on the body, visceral fat. Visceral fat is fat found deep in the
      abdomen; it has the potential to increase the risk of certain health problems.

      Obesity is a leading risk factor for many chronic diseases in the USA. Abdominal fat,
      specifically visceral fat is metabolically active and can be detrimental to health. Abdominal
      obesity is especially high in postmenopausal women (prevalence rates 50- 70%) in whom
      estrogen deficiency may lead to accumulation of excess visceral fat. Although estrogen
      replacement therapy is effective in preventing visceral fat accumulation, its adverse effects
      warrant a search for a safer phytochemical that exerts estrogenic properties. Soy, containing
      isoflavones (estrogen-like compounds), is a promising dietary component in reducing abdominal
      obesity in menopausal women. The favorable effects of isoflavones were already demonstrated
      in animal studies.The effects of soy compounds as a dietary component in preventing and
      reducing abdominal obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities will be examined among
      menopausal Women. We will use quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging (qMRS/I)
      to determine dose and effects of soy supplementation for preventing and treating abdominal
      adiposity. The results from this study will shed light on the application of soy as a novel
      dietary approach in preventing and managing abdominal obesity among peri- and early
      menopausal women.

    <description>Isoflavones will be in the form of capsule (80 mg /capsule). Placebo capsule will be filled with cellulose. These capsules will be identical in size and color. Soy protein will be prepared in the form of powder, containing 25 g of soy protein per package. Placebo powder will contain 25 g whole milk protein. Both powders will be available in vanilla and chocolate flavors, and look and taste similar. They could be mixed with water, milk and other beverages. Subjects will be asked to consume 2 capsules and 1 powder packet daily, preferably at breakfast for 6 months.
Subjects failing to show up at the monthly visit for refilling supplement will be contacted by research staff via email or phone.</description>
