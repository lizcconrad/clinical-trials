    <measure>The Numbers of Neutrophils in Induced Sputum-Absolute Neutrophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -9 to -7, Day 1, Day 12 and follow-up (Day 24-28)</time_frame>
    <description>The neutrophils play an important role in participants with more severe asthma. The reduction in number of neutrophils in induced sputum was evaluated to study the effect of treatment with repeat oral doses of GSK2190915, in asthma participants. Sputum samples were evaluated at central laboratory. The samples were rejected, if the weight was less than 100 grams (g), or if excessive cell degeneration or due to excessive squamous cells and insufficient inflammatory cells. The total cell count of neutrophil was reported as total cell count × 10^6 /g.</description>

    <time_frame>Visit 2 (Day 1), visit 3 (Day 5 to 7) and visit 4 (Day 12)</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From visit 1 (Day -7 to Day -9) to upto follow-up (upto Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or a drug-induced liver injury.</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline Urine LTE4 Biomarker</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>The urine spot samples were collected from the participants at pre-dose on day 1 and trough day 12 for evaluation of LTE4 biomarker. This evaluated the level of inflammation in the airways of the asthma participants. The percentage change from baseline was calculated by dividing the post randomization change by the baseline value from the individual and multiplying by a 100. If either the baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from baseline is set to missing. Baseline was defined as Day 1(pre-dose).</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change From Baseline of LTB4 Biomarker in Plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma samples were evaluated for presence of LTB4 biomarkers. The percentage change from baseline was calculated by dividing the post-randomization change by the baseline value from the individual and multiplying by a 100. If either the baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from baseline is set to missing. Baseline was defined as Day 1(pre-dose).</description>

    <measure>Concentration of LTB4 in Sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 12</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration of Interleukin (IL)-17 and High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (hsCRP) in Blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>The blood samples were collected to evaluate the concentration of IL-17 and hsCRP in blood. However due to early termination of the study, the data was not collected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Established Markers of Anti-inflammatory Activity in Sputum: the Measurements Will Include IL-17, Neutrophil Elastase, Myeloperoxidase and IL-8</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>During the study conduct it was observed that the levels of IL-17, measured in both blood and sputum were below limit of quantification; for neutrophil elastase, in sputum no inference could be made as most levels were above the limit of quantification. Thus due to limited amount of data the analysis was not summarized.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1, Day 5 to 7 and Day 12</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ measures the adequacy of asthma control. It includes 5 questions about symptoms of asthma, 1 question about the rescue medication used and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). This is a 7-item scale where the items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items which ranges from 0 to 6. 0= Well controlled and 6=extremely poorly controlled. Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Thus for ACQ a higher score indicates severe disease and a low score indicative of less severe disease.</description>

        <title>The Numbers of Neutrophils in Induced Sputum-Absolute Neutrophil Count</title>
        <description>The neutrophils play an important role in participants with more severe asthma. The reduction in number of neutrophils in induced sputum was evaluated to study the effect of treatment with repeat oral doses of GSK2190915, in asthma participants. Sputum samples were evaluated at central laboratory. The samples were rejected, if the weight was less than 100 grams (g), or if excessive cell degeneration or due to excessive squamous cells and insufficient inflammatory cells. The total cell count of neutrophil was reported as total cell count × 10^6 /g.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Neutrophils in Induced Sputum</title>
        <description>The neutrophils play an important role in participants with more severe asthma. The reduction in number of neutrophils in induced sputum was evaluated to study the effect of treatment with repeat oral doses of GSK2190915, in asthma participants. Sputum samples were evaluated at central laboratory. The samples were rejected, if the weight was less than 100 g, or if excessive cell degeneration or due to excessive squamous cells and insufficient inflammatory cells. The total cell count of neutrophil was reported as percentage of cells.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical events that jeopardize the participants or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition, or a drug-induced liver injury.</description>

This evaluated the level of inflammation in the airways of the asthma participants. The percentage change from baseline was calculated by dividing the post randomization change by the baseline value from the individual and multiplying by a 100. If either the baseline or post-randomization value is missing, the change from baseline is set to missing. Baseline was defined as Day 1(pre-dose).</description>

        <title>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Assessment</title>
        <description>ACQ measures the adequacy of asthma control. It includes 5 questions about symptoms of asthma, 1 question about the rescue medication used and 1 about lung function (FEV1% predicted). This is a 7-item scale where the items are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of 7 items which ranges from 0 to 6. 0= Well controlled and 6=extremely poorly controlled. Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt; 1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;= 1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Thus for ACQ a higher score indicates severe disease and a low score indicative of less severe disease.</description>
