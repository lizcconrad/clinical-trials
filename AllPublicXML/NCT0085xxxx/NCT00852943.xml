  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Mast cells are responsible for most symptoms of allergic reactions. In some allergic
           diseases, it is unusually easy to cause mast cells to release their contents and cause
           allergic reactions. In other cases, mast cells grow abnormally and, in rare cases, can
           result in tumors. Mast cells also control other parts of the immune system.

        -  Understanding why mast cells behave abnormally in allergic diseases is important to
           finding better ways for diagnosing and treating these potentially life-threatening
           disorders.

      Objectives:

        -  To screen mast cells at the genetic and functional levels to characterize abnormalities,
           identify mutations, detect carrier states, and/or develop therapies for such disorders.

        -  To create a library of information about inherited diseases of mast cell homeostasis and
           activation, including piebaldism (problems with skin and hair pigmentation), anaphylaxis
           (severe allergic reaction), allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic
           rhinitis ( hay fever ), food allergies, urticaria/angioedema (hives/swelling),
           immunodeficiency diseases, and autoimmune diseases.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients between the ages of 1 and 80 years who have been referred by a physician and
           are known to have or be suspected of having an inherited disorder of mast cells, in
           particular patients (and their relatives) with piebaldism, allergies, or anaphylaxis
           that is not caused by allergies.

      Design:

        -  Study population will consist of up to 1000 participants in a 5-year period. One third
           of the study population will consist of patients; the other two thirds will consist of
           biological relatives.

        -  Evaluation is limited to testing on blood specimens; no treatment will be provided.

        -  Clinical and research laboratory evaluations of patients will include the following:

        -  Clinical evaluation and previous laboratory tests as documented in outside medical
           records by health care providers. A standard questionnaire will also be administered at
           the time of subject enrollment.

        -  Blood collection for clinical laboratory testing, tailored to each subject s clinical
           evaluation where appropriate (5 ml).

        -  Blood collection for research laboratory testing, tailored to each subject s clinical
           evaluation including genetic screening and assessment of mast cell growth and
           functioning and storage of additional frozen blood specimens for future studies (up to
           an additional 30 ml).

        -  Evaluations of blood relatives will include the following:

        -  Clinical evaluation as documented from outside medical records by health care providers
           and administration of a standard questionnaire.

        -  Blood collection where indicated for diagnostic or research purposes.

        -  After 12 consecutive months on the study, results from initial evaluation will be
           reviewed. Subjects with findings deemed to be of continued interest will be contacted
           and invited to remain as active participants to this protocol for another year, provided
           that they renew their consent to participate.

      This protocol is designed to screen subjects (and some family members) with suspected or
      identified genetic diseases of allergic inflammation or mast cell homeostasis and activation.
      Patients determined by clinical history and initial outside evaluation by their referring
      physician to be of interest will be consented and enrolled into this study. Blood specimens
      stored blood products and derivatives, saliva, hair, finger nail clippings, cord blood,
      umbilical cord, and/or buccal swabs from such patients and/or their family members will be
      obtained for research studies related to understanding the genetic and biochemical bases of
      these diseases. Outside medical records may be obtained for chart review to correlate
      clinical history to research laboratory testing results. Results will be relayed to the
      referring physicians and, where applicable, patients will be referred to other appropriate
      National Institutes of Health protocols for additional clinical evaluation and treatment. The
      study will enroll up to 1000 subjects and family members.

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subjects, ages birth to 999 years old, known to have or suspected of having an
             inherited disorder of allergic inflammation or mast cell homeostasis or activation,
             will be eligible for enrollment. Because of the intensive time and labor required for
             research laboratory testing, subjects will be enrolled only if in the opinion of the
             investigator (based on discussions with the patient s private physician) there is a
             high index of suspicion of a genetic disease of allergic inflammation. Blood relatives
             of enrolled subjects will be eligible for enrollment. There will be no discrimination
             as to age, gender, race, or disability.

          -  Subjects must have a health care provider outside of the NIH.

          -  Subjects/guardians must be willing and able to give informed consent.

          -  Subjects must agree to have their blood stored for future studies of the immune system
             and/or other medical conditions.

          -  Women will be included in the study, including those who are lactating or may be
             pregnant.

          -  Children will be included in the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        - The presence of an acquired abnormality of the immune system, such as cytotoxic
        chemotherapy or malignancy, may be grounds for possible exclusion if, in the opinion of the
        investigator, the presence of such a disease process would interfere with evaluation.
