  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the digibind drug on hemodialysis
      patients with high blood pressure. Digibind is used to treat toxicity from digoxin and
      digoxin-like molecules which may contribute to high blood pressure.

    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is a very common problem in patients with kidney disease. Researchers
      have noted that there are certain molecules in the blood of these patients that may be
      contributing to the high blood pressure. In particular these molecules have been labeled as
      &quot;digoxin-like substances.&quot; Digoxin is a drug made from a certain plant that may contribute to
      high blood pressure. In research animals with kidney failure, it has been noted that the use
      of Digibind helps to lower the blood pressure in these animals. Digibind is a drug made from
      sheep that is used to treat the toxicity from digoxin as well as toxicity from molecules
      similar to digoxin.

      In this study, volunteers that are on hemodialysis and have high blood pressure will be given
      a placebo or the digibind drug intravenously on two separate visits. The volunteers will then
      wear a 24-hour blood pressure monitor and return the following day. Volunteers will receive
      the Digibind at one visit during the study, and the placebo on the other visit.
