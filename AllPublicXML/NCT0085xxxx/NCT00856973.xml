    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PDSS is a validated measure of excessive sleepiness specifically designed for use in school aged children. The scale allowed for measurement of sleepiness across several relatively sedentary activities and provided a means to unmask sleepiness that may not be recognized during more active situations. It consisted of 8 items that assessed the frequency of a sleep related behavior (eg, how often do you fall asleep or get drowsy during class periods; are you usually alert most of the day; how often do you think you need more sleep) using a 5-point Likert type scale (0 = never, 4 = always). All items were summed to obtain the PDSS total score. PDSS data were used for efficacy evaluation as well as for the evaluation of residual effects.The overall PDSS scores range from a low of 0 where the individual is endorsing each item at the lowest level of sleepiness to a high of 32 where the individual is endorsing each item at the highest level of sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Coding Copy Subtest / Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) Scaled Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>These tests are standardized information processing tasks to assess recognition and recoding of sensory information. The subject was given 90 seconds to complete as many substitutions of symbols as possible according to a code provided on top of the sheet. The Coding Copy Subtest A was used for subjects 6-7 years of age and the Coding Copy Subtest B was used for subjects 8-16 years of age, and the DSST was used for subjects 17 years of age. The score is the number of squares filled in correctly. Individuals are measured against their own pre-treatment baseline to determine levels of impairment using the scaled score. Higher scores mean less impairment (or potentially improvement) as the number of correct substitutions generally improves as cognition improves. Scaled scores are used to account for age differences among test takers. Scaled scores range from 1 to 19, and higher scores indicate higher cognitive function.</description>

        <description>A central scoring facility was used to derive the PSG sleep parameters Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS) from the epochs and stages collected via the PSG recordings. Each epoch is 30 seconds. The PSG parameters provided an objective assessment of the subject’s sleep on a given night. Change from BL at Week 12 in LPS was derived from Week 12 LPS subtracted by BL LPS. Latency to persistent sleep (LPS; minutes): time from lights out to the first of 20 consecutive epochs (10 minutes) of non-wake, as determined by PSG recordings.</description>

        <description>A central scoring facility was used to derive the PSG sleep parameters Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO) from the epochs and stages collected via the PSG recordings. Each epoch is 30 seconds. The PSG parameters provided an objective assessment of the subject’s sleep on a given night. Change from BL at Week 12 in WASO was derived from Week 12 WASO subtracted by BL WASO. Wake time after sleep onset (WASO; minutes): The number of wake epochs after the onset of persistent sleep to the end of the recording, divided by 2.</description>

        <description>A central scoring facility was used to derive the PSG sleep parameter of Sleep Efficiency (SE) from the epochs and stages collected via the PSG recordings. The PSG parameters provided an objective assessment of the subject’s sleep on a given night. Sleep efficiency: (total sleep time)/(total recording time) x 100. For this endpoint, total sleep time was defined as the number of non-wake epochs from the beginning of recording to the end of recording divided by 2. If total recording time was greater than 960 epochs (480 minutes), total sleep time was calculated from the PSG truncated at 480 minutes.</description>

        <description>A central scoring facility was used to derive the PSG sleep parameter of Number of Awakenings after Sleep Onset (NAASO). The PSG parameters provided an objective assessment of the subject’s sleep on a given night. Number of awakenings: The number of times, after onset of persistent sleep, that there was a wake entry of at least one-minute duration. Each awakening must have been separated by an epoch of non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stage 2, 3/4, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) Total Score.</title>
        <description>The PDSS is a validated measure of excessive sleepiness specifically designed for use in school aged children. The scale allowed for measurement of sleepiness across several relatively sedentary activities and provided a means to unmask sleepiness that may not be recognized during more active situations. It consisted of 8 items that assessed the frequency of a sleep related behavior (eg, how often do you fall asleep or get drowsy during class periods; are you usually alert most of the day; how often do you think you need more sleep) using a 5-point Likert type scale (0 = never, 4 = always). All items were summed to obtain the PDSS total score. PDSS data were used for efficacy evaluation as well as for the evaluation of residual effects.The overall PDSS scores range from a low of 0 where the individual is endorsing each item at the lowest level of sleepiness to a high of 32 where the individual is endorsing each item at the highest level of sleepiness.</description>

        <description>These tests are standardized information processing tasks to assess recognition and recoding of sensory information. The subject was given 90 seconds to complete as many substitutions of symbols as possible according to a code provided on top of the sheet. The Coding Copy Subtest A was used for subjects 6-7 years of age and the Coding Copy Subtest B was used for subjects 8-16 years of age, and the DSST was used for subjects 17 years of age. The score is the number of squares filled in correctly. Individuals are measured against their own pre-treatment baseline to determine levels of impairment using the scaled score. Higher scores mean less impairment (or potentially improvement) as the number of correct substitutions generally improves as cognition improves. Scaled scores are used to account for age differences among test takers. Scaled scores range from 1 to 19, and higher scores indicate higher cognitive function.</description>
