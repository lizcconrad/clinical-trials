        HIV-positive and negative patients with a recent screen for MRSA colonization or a history
        of MRSA infection will be asked to participate. Participants will be recruited by providers
        within the infectious disease clinics at the sites. In addtion, MRSA isolates will be
        monitored at the central laboratory and providers of patients with MRSA will be notified
        and asked to notify their patients of the opportunity to participate in this study.
