  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are inviting individuals such as yourself, who have diaphyseal fracture (broken bone) with
      a non union to participate in this research study. A non-union is a lack of bone healing
      (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The
      diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture
      occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg),
      femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these
      types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to
      decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing
      after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more
      quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves
      over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.

      &quot;Infuse&quot; is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your
      bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. &quot;Infuse&quot; may be the first
      commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long
      bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.

      Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous
      pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the
      power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long
      bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects
      of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries
      required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.

      Given this, the orthopaedic community has planned this study in order to scientifically
      establish the most effective treatment method to restore function after this type of injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a multi-centre Canadian randomized Study wherein 80 patients are randomized (put
      in groups by no standard pattern ie. flipping a coin) to receive both autograft (sample of
      your own bone: iliac crest) and allograft (bone chips from bone bank) or &quot;infuse&quot; (synthetic
      bone morphogenic protein) and allograft using locked plates. Locked plates are surgical
      plates placed on the fracture in which the screws lock into the plate when they have been
      completely screwed into the bone through holes on the plate. Our objective is to assess the
      total cost of the patients treated in both study group and the benefits of the Infuse by
      comparing the new bone formation in the fracture site.

      We will monitor critical aspects of operative care and rehabilitation at regular intervals,
      up to 2 year after surgery. We will independently monitor revision surgery (surgeries to
      repair a previous surgery) rates. We will also assess patients for functional health and
      quality of life outcomes.
