      This clinical trial studies imaging markers in planning radiation therapy in patients with
      lung cancer. Implanting markers in the tumor that can be seen using imaging procedures during
      radiation therapy may allow x-rays to be sent directly to the tumor and cause less damage to
      normal tissue.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To acquire experience in the marker implantation process for mediastinal lymph nodes and
           primary lung tumors in patients with stage I-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  To characterize the potential side effects involved in the use of markers in these
           patients.

        -  To analyze the positional stability of lung markers in these patients over a
           radiotherapy series.

        -  To acquire experience in the use of markers for treatment planning and radiotherapy in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo implantation of ≥ 1 small radio-opaque Visicoil™ marker into or
      close to the primary lesion and affected lymph nodes by bronchoscopy. Patients then undergo
      x-rays to document marker location, detect potentially dropped markers, and diagnose
      operation-related side effects (i.e., pneumothorax). After marker implantation, patients
      undergo stereotactic or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for 30-33 daily fractions.

    <description>Patients undergo implantation of radio-opaque markers into the primary lesion and affected lymph nodes by bronchoscopy. Patients then undergo routine 4D CT, 4D CBCT, fluoroscopy, and x-ray imaging during standard stereotactic radiation therapy (early stage tumors) or conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (advanced stage tumors).</description>
