      This interdisciplinary international research collaboration will test effects of Choice, a
      computer-assisted, interactive support system designed to help cancer patients communicate
      their symptoms and preferences, and clinicians in incorporating this information into patient
      care. In this pretest-post test clinical trial with 200 leukemia and lymphoma patients we
      will: 1) Test effects of Choice when integrated into routine clinical practice on:
      patient-provider communication, documented patient care, anxiety and patient satisfaction; 2)
      analyze relationships among the above variables and explore differences in these
      relationships between groups; 3) analyze group differences in communication style in terms of
      instrumental and affective behavior, content, participation, initiative and person addressed;
      and 4) investigate the extent of the time requirements when using Choice in clinical
      practice, perceived usefulness and ease of use.

    <textblock>
      Improving shared decision making (SDM), patient-provider communication and incorporating
      patients' illness experiences and preferences into patient care are high priority health
      policy goals. However, this is difficult to accomplish without methods and systems that
      assist patients in sharing their illness experiences and clinicians in integrating this
      information into patient care. Choice is a computer-assisted, interactive communication and
      support system for cancer patients designed for this purpose. This interdisciplinary,
      international research collaboration will test effects of Choice in a pretest-post test
      clinical trial with 200 leukemia and lymphoma patients. We hypothesize that when patients use
      Choice for symptom and preference assessments and this information is provided to their
      clinicians to support consultations in routine practice, (1) patient-provider communication
      will be more patient-centered; (2) documented care will be more congruent with patients'
      reported symptoms and preferences; (3) patients will experience lower levels of anxiety and
      stress during consultations; and (4) they will be more satisfied with the consultation than
      the &quot;usual care&quot; control group. To better understand the mechanisms by which these effects
      occur, we will investigate relationships between communication style, documented patient
      care, anxiety and satisfaction; and explore time requirements, perceived usefulness and ease
      of use of Choice by patients and clinicians. Controlling for gender, age, diagnosis and
      type/stage of treatment, analyses of covariance and repeated measurement models will be
      primarily used for hypotheses testing, correlations and descriptive statistics to answer
      research questions. This study will contribute to new technologies to support SDM and
      patient-provider partnerships in health care that can significantly improve patient-provider
      communication, patient-centered care and physical, emotional and psycho-social well-being of
      cancer patients.
