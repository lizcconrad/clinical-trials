        <description>The UCLA-RAND Incontinence Index is from a section within the RAND 36-item Health Survey v2 (SF-36 v2) and UCLA Prostate Cancer Index and measures a patient’s urinary habits over the 4 weeks prior to questionnaire completion and consists of 6 questions. Two scores are produced, the Urinary Bother and Urinary Function scores. The Urinary Bother score ranges from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicating worse symptoms of urinary bother. The Urinary Function score ranges from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicating worse urinary function.</description>

        <population>There are 97 subjects with outcome 7 (Urinary function at baseline). Of the 98 subjects implanted, 1 is missing the baseline Urinary Function assessment.</population>
