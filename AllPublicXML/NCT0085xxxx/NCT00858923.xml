      Tulane University Health Sciences Center/Louisiana Community AIDS Research

      Center Program, New Orleans, LA is seeking patients for an HIV study. The

      purpose of the study is to test the safety and effectiveness of an

      experimental ultra-violet light device designed to reduce virus in your blood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of HIV-1 has been confirmed positive by ELISA and by Western Blot

          -  Subject is not yet eligible for HAART

          -  Subject's viral count at pre-baseline measured by RT-PCR is

               -  10,000 copies /ml

          -  Subject has a CD4+ count â‰¥ 400 cells/mm3

          -  Subject's pre-screen EIA and RIBA test has proven negative for Hepatitis C virus

          -  Female subjects with reproductive potential (and any male sexual partners) must agree
             to use a barrier device with spermicide (e.g., condoms, cervical cap, diaphragm) as
             the primary form of contraception, in addition to any other methods used, during
             treatment and until the end of the study to prevent pregnancy

          -  Subject has taken no other anti-viral device or pharmacologic treatments in the 2
             months prior to the first scheduled Hemo-Modulator study treatment

          -  Subject agrees not to receive any other anti-viral device or anti-viral pharmacologic
             treatment (including herbal remedies) throughout the 21-week study period

          -  Subject weighs at least 90 lbs (40.9 kg) at study initiation

          -  Subject agrees to comply with study protocol requirements including all follow up
             visits through Day 60 of study duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any other major illness (e.g., malignancy, renal failure, tuberculosis,
             porphyria, severe cardiac disease, severe neurological disease, or Hepatitis C) that
             would prevent completion of the study or bias efficacy assessments

          -  Subjects with any other medical condition that the Investigator believes would make
             the patient unable to safely tolerate the extracorporeal blood volume required during
             the procedure [e.g., severe cardiovascular disease, history of congestive heart
             failure, or severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L)]

          -  Subject with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), since PCT is associated with increased
             sensitivity to light and skin reactions such redness, pain, swelling and blistering
             after exposure to ultraviolet light

          -  Subject has clinically abnormal hemotologic or chemistry laboratory values, defined as
             any parameter for these tests that exceeds Grade 1 (DAIDS Table for Grading the
             Severity of Adult Adverse Events, December 2004)

          -  Subject has taken a steroid drug (other than Estrogen or Progesterone) within 7 days

             enrollment or is likely to require such immunization during the course of study
             participation

          -  Subject is currently participating in another clinical investigation of a medical
             device, drug or biologic, or has participated in such a study within the 3 months
             prior to study enrollment

          -  Subject is pregnant or plans on becoming pregnant within the next twelve months; or is
             lactating
