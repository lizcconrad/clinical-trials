      Pfizer decided to stop this trial early upon Stage 1 completion due to change in PF-00489791
      development and not as a result of safety concerns for PF-00489791. Date of termination
      (LSLV) occurred on July 28, 2010.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI) Over 4 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>PVRI was calculated as: PVRI (in Wood units*meter^2 [m^2]) = pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) multiplied by body surface area (BSA). PVR (in Wood units) = (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mean PAP] minus pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]) divided by cardiac output (CO, taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). BSA (m^2) = (0.007184) multiplied by (height in centimeters [cm])^0.725 multiplied by (weight in kilograms [kg])^0.425. PVRI values were converted to dyne*second (s)*m^2/centimeter (cm)^5 from Woods units by multiplying by a factor of 79.9. The change from baseline in PVRI over 4-hour interval was calculated as the average of the change from baseline values at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post dose on Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Greatest Reduction From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI) and Systemic Vascular Resistance Index (SVRI) Over 4 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 4 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>PVRI was calculated as: PVRI (in Wood units*m^2) = PVR multiplied by BSA. PVR (in Wood units) = (mean PAP minus PCWP) divided by CO (taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). SVRI was calculated as: SVRI (Wood units*m^2) = systemic vascular resistance (SVR) multiplied by BSA. SVR (Wood units) = (mean systemic arterial pressure [mean SAP] minus right atrial pressure [RAP]) divided by CO (taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). BSA (m^2) = (0.007184) multiplied by (height in cm)^0.725 multiplied by (weight in kg)^0.425. PVRI and SVRI values were converted to dyne*s*m^2/cm^5 from Woods units by multiplying by a factor of 79.9. For each participant the greatest reduction (GR) from baseline in PVRI and SVRI over 4-hour interval was defined as the maximum reduction (greatest decrease or smallest increase) observed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post dose on Day 1.</description>

    <description>PVRI was calculated as: PVR multiplied by BSA. PVR = (mean PAP minus PCWP) divided by CO (taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). BSA (m^2) = 0.007184 times height (cm)^0.725 times weight (kilogram)^0.425. Wood unit equals to 79.9 dyne*second/cm^5. Hourly changes from baseline in PVRI was reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI) Over 4 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>PVRI was calculated as: PVRI (in Wood units*meter^2 [m^2]) = pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) multiplied by body surface area (BSA). PVR (in Wood units) = (mean pulmonary artery pressure [mean PAP] minus pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP]) divided by cardiac output (CO, taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). BSA (m^2) = (0.007184) multiplied by (height in centimeters [cm])^0.725 multiplied by (weight in kilograms [kg])^0.425. PVRI values were converted to dyne*second (s)*m^2/centimeter (cm)^5 from Woods units by multiplying by a factor of 79.9. The change from baseline in PVRI over 4-hour interval was calculated as the average of the change from baseline values at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post dose on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Greatest Reduction From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRI) and Systemic Vascular Resistance Index (SVRI) Over 4 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>PVRI was calculated as: PVRI (in Wood units*m^2) = PVR multiplied by BSA. PVR (in Wood units) = (mean PAP minus PCWP) divided by CO (taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). SVRI was calculated as: SVRI (Wood units*m^2) = systemic vascular resistance (SVR) multiplied by BSA. SVR (Wood units) = (mean systemic arterial pressure [mean SAP] minus right atrial pressure [RAP]) divided by CO (taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). BSA (m^2) = (0.007184) multiplied by (height in cm)^0.725 multiplied by (weight in kg)^0.425. PVRI and SVRI values were converted to dyne*s*m^2/cm^5 from Woods units by multiplying by a factor of 79.9. For each participant the greatest reduction (GR) from baseline in PVRI and SVRI over 4-hour interval was defined as the maximum reduction (greatest decrease or smallest increase) observed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post dose on Day 1.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Systemic Vascular Resistance Index (SVRI) Over 4 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>SVRI was calculated as: SVRI (Wood units*m^2) = SVR multiplied by BSA. SVR (Wood units) = (mean SAP minus RAP) divided by CO (taken as the average of the triplicate measurements). BSA (m^2) = (0.007184) multiplied by (height in cm)^0.725 multiplied by (weight in kg)^0.425. SVRI values were converted to dyne*s*m^2/cm^5 from Woods units by multiplying by a factor of 79.9. The change from baseline in SVRI over 4-hour interval was calculated as the average of the change from baseline values at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours post dose on Day 1.</description>

        <description>Hourly changes from baseline in hemodynamic parameters were reported. Hemodynamic parameters including mPAP, sPAP, dPAP and RAP were measured using a pressure transducer positioned at the mid-axillary line with the participant in the supine position. All hemodynamic pressure measurements were performed as triplicate measurements and average was used.</description>

        <description>Hourly changes from baseline in hemodynamic parameters were reported. Hemodynamic parameters including PCWP, SAP, sSAP and dSAP were measured using a pressure transducer positioned at the mid-axillary line with the participant in the supine position. All hemodynamic pressure measurements (except PCWP for which 1 measurement is sufficient) were performed as triplicate measurements and average was used.</description>
