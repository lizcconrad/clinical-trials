    <textblock>
      The objective of this open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study was to compare the
      oral bioavailability of a Mallinckrodt test tablet formulation of oxycodone 30 mg to an
      equivalent oral dose of a commercially available oxycodone tablet (Roxicodone™ 30 mg, Roxane
      Laboratories, Inc.) in a test group of healthy subjects under fasting conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, 18 years of age or older.

          2. Female subjects must be postmenopausal for at least one year, or surgically sterile,
             or practicing adequate non-hormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to and
             for the duration of study participation. All female subjects will undergo a pregnancy
             test at screening and at check-in to the clinical study site for every dosing period.
             The results of the test must be negative for continued participation.

          3. Weight must be within 15% of the ideal weight for height and frame, as adopted by the
             Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1993.

          4. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by a
             screening medical history obtained within 30 days prior to study start. Subjects
             should not present with a history of significant past illness expected to affect the
             investigation.

          5. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:

               1. Laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, urinalysis)

               2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, alcohol, and &quot;drugs of abuse&quot;
                  testing will be done for screening purposes only. Results of the HIV, hepatitis,
                  and &quot;drugs of abuse&quot; tests must be negative or non-reactive for subjects to
                  qualify for the study.

               3. Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all
                  subjects. This ECG must be interpreted by appropriately trained and experienced
                  medical personnel. A subject with an ECG that is not within normal range does not
                  qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the investigator.

          6. Subjects must be able to provide written consent and agree to abide by the study
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of alcohol, drug, or narcotic abuse or dependence.

          2. Chronic use of tranquilizers, sedatives, aspirin, antibiotics, or other medications.

          3. History or presence of major organ dysfunction.

          4. History of cardiac disorder, malignancy, stroke, or diabetes; renal, liver, pulmonary,
             or severe gastrointestinal disease; or other serious illness.

          5. History of anxiety, tension, severe agitation, psychosis, or mental depression.

          6. Family history or diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder.

          7. History of acute abdominal conditions.

          8. History of conditions that might contraindicate or require caution be used in the
             administration of oxycodone including: renal impairment, hepatobiliary or pancreatic
             disease, GI obstruction, cardiac disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or
             severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, elevated intracranial pressure, depleted blood
             volume, paralytic ileus, or allergy to oxycodone or any opiate agonists.

          9. Administration of any other investigational drug during the 30 days prior to
             enrollment into the study.

         10. Subjects who smoke or have a history of smoking, or use nicotine-containing products.

         11. Subjects who have donated blood within 30 days prior to study entry, including that
             withdrawn during the conduct of any other clinical study.

         12. Subjects presenting with acute illness.

         13. Subjects who have taken prescription drugs within 14 days or over-the-counter
             medications (including herbal preparations) within 7 days prior to dosing except for
             standard daily dose multivitamins.
