             to the first vaccination and throughout the study until Visit 5 (V5).

          -  Post organ transplant subjects whether or not receiving chronic immunosuppressive
             therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled serious infection, i.e. not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

          -  History of any serious medical condition, which in the opinion of the investigator
             would compromise the safety of the subject or prevent the subject from complying with
             study requirements.

          -  History of or active autoimmune disease, e.g. Type I diabetes. Persons with vitiligo
             or thyroid disease taking thyroid hormone replacement are not excluded.

             component of the vaccine, e.g. tris(hydroxymethyl)-amino methane, chicken embryo
             fibroblast proteins, aminoglycosides (gentamycin).

          -  History of anaphylactic shock or any severe allergic reaction to a vaccine requiring

          -  Having received any vaccinations or planned vaccinations with a killed vaccine within
             14 days prior to or after study vaccination.

          -  Administration or planned administration of immuno-globulins and/or any blood products
             during a period starting from three months prior to administration of the vaccine and
             ending at study conclusion.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine other than the study
             vaccine within 30 days preceding the first dose of the study vaccine or planned

          -  Temperature ≥ 100.4°F (38.0°C) at the time of enrollment.
