  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cough lasting more than 2 months is known as a chronic cough, affecting 12-23% of the adult
      non-smoking population. Chronic cough has many associated complications including
      incontinence, muscular chest pains, blackouts and depression. Current treatment is often
      ineffective in these patients. To develop new medications the investigators need to
      understand more about the mechanisms that can lead to excessive coughing.

      This study plans to compare a group of 12 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with a chronic
      cough. The investigators hypothesise that that chronic cough patients have a more sensitive
      cough reflex as a result central nervous system hyper-excitability (central sensitisation).
      The investigators will measure cough reflex sensitivity before and after administration of
      ketamine, a medication that blocks an important receptor in the central nervous system.
