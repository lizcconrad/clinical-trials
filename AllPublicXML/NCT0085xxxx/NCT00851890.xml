  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      antiviral activity of ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) in treatment-naïve, hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-infected participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2a, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in hepatitis C
      virus (HCV)-infected adults with 2 planned sequential evaluations, Part 1 and Part 2. The
      study evaluated the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity, and pharmacokinetics of ABT-333
      or placebo monotherapy, followed by 26 days of ABT-333 or placebo with pegylated interferon
      a-2a (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. Review of safety and efficacy in Part
      1 of the study showed similar response rates across ABT-333 doses so Part 2 of the study was
      not performed. The study also assessed emergence of resistant HCV in conjunction with
      kinetics of viral load decay and rebound in treatment-naïve, HCV-infected participants.

    <measure>Mean Maximal Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) Levels During ABT-333 Monotherapy Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Prior to the first dose on Day 1 to before first dose on Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The baseline value was the HCV RNA measurement before the first dose of ABT-333 on Day 1. The maximal change during monotherapy was nadir minus the baseline log10 HCV RNA level. Nadir was defined as the lowest log10 HCV RNA level any time after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 3. Data are reported as the least squares mean change from nadir ± standard error.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ABT-333</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours post-dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2. The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-333 using validated analytical methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; measured in ng/mL) is the highest concentration that a drug achieves in the blood after administration in a dosing interval. The Cmax of ABT-333 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2. The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-333 using validated analytical methods. The time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax; measured in hours) is the time it takes for a drug to achieve Cmax. The Tmax of ABT-333 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2. The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-333 using validated analytical methods. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC; measured in ng*hr/mL) measures the total exposure of a drug in blood plasma. The AUC12 of ABT-333 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected prior to the morning dose on Day 3; 4 hours after the morning dose on Day 3; prior to the morning dose on Days 4 and 5; and single samples were collected on Days 10, 17, 24, and 28.

    <measure>Number of Participants Having Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were collected from the time of study drug administration to 30 days after last dose of study drug (8 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence that did not have a causal relationship with treatment. An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) was any noxious and undesired reaction related to the experimental drug or experiment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in congenital anomaly, was persistent or caused significant disability/incapacity, spontaneous or elective abortion, or required intervention to prevent a serious outcome. AEs were rated for severity as either:
Mild - transient and easily tolerated;
Moderate - caused discomfort and interrupted usual activities;
Severe - caused considerable interference with usual activities, may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
AEs related to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) were assessed as being either probably or possibly related by the investigator.</description>

    <description>Samples from Days 1, 5, 10, 17, 24 and 28 were analyzed for the presence of resistance-associated amino acids using population sequencing and compared to the baseline non-structural viral protein 5B (NS5B) sequence to assess amino acid changes.

        <title>Mean Maximal Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) Levels During ABT-333 Monotherapy Treatment</title>
        <description>Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The baseline value was the HCV RNA measurement before the first dose of ABT-333 on Day 1. The maximal change during monotherapy was nadir minus the baseline log10 HCV RNA level. Nadir was defined as the lowest log10 HCV RNA level any time after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of study drug on Day 3. Data are reported as the least squares mean change from nadir ± standard error.</description>

        <title>Mean Maximal Change From Baseline in Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV RNA) Levels Through Day 28</title>
        <description>Serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels (reported as log10 IU/mL) were determined for each sample using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The baseline value was the HCV RNA measurement before the first dose of ABT-333 on Day 1. The maximal change during treatment was nadir minus the baseline log10 HCV RNA level. Nadir was defined as the lowest log10 HCV RNA level any time after the first dose of study drug on Day 1 through the last log10 HCV RNA level on Day 28. Data are reported as the least squares mean change from nadir ± standard error.</description>

          <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to 12 Hours Post-dose (AUC12) of ABT-333</title>
          <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0 hours); 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 hours after the morning dose on Day 1; and pre-dose on Day 2. The samples were analyzed for the concentration of ABT-333 using validated analytical methods. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC; measured in ng*hr/mL) measures the total exposure of a drug in blood plasma. The AUC12 of ABT-333 was estimated using non-compartmental methods and data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Having Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence that did not have a causal relationship with treatment. An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) was any noxious and undesired reaction related to the experimental drug or experiment. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in congenital anomaly, was persistent or caused significant disability/incapacity, spontaneous or elective abortion, or required intervention to prevent a serious outcome. AEs were rated for severity as either:
Mild - transient and easily tolerated;
Moderate - caused discomfort and interrupted usual activities;
Severe - caused considerable interference with usual activities, may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
AEs related to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) were assessed as being either probably or possibly related by the investigator.</description>
        <time_frame>AEs were collected from the time of study drug administration to 30 days after last dose of study drug (8 Weeks)</time_frame>
