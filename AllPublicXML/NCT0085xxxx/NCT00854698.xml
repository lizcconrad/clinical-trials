    <textblock>
      The real impact of the existence of an aortic valve mismatch after aortic valve replacement
      in various studies conducted so far is a source of controversy. There is currently no
      long-term impact of the aortic valve mismatch on the reversal of left ventricular remodeling
      and its impact functional.To evaluate these effects of aortic valve mismatch on abilities to
      the effort, the quality of life and the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy long term
      after a aortic valve replacement, conducting a new study is fundamental. This study is even
      more essential in patients with a young life expectancy theoretical long and physical
      activity.Our study aims to determine whether the existence of an aortic valve mismatch has an
      influence on: The functional capacity to the effort by measuring the maximum oxygen
      consumption during a stress test (VO2 max) The reversal of left ventricular remodeling
      (cardiac ultrasound doppler), diastolic dysfunction (cardiac ultrasound and Doppler
      measurement Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). This study will analyse these data in patients
      who received youth a VAN by mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.
