    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average AM and PM Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) Over the Two-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -6 to 0) and Days 1-15 (2-week Treatment Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) over the past 12 hours twice daily (AM &amp; PM) using the following scale:
0=absent (no sign/symptom); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (awareness of sign/symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (sign/symptoms hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities and/or sleeping).
The total nasal symptom score (sum of the 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average AM and PM Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) Over the Two Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -6 to 0) and Days 1-15 (2-week Treatment Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) over the 10 minutes prior to the assessment, twice daily (AM &amp; PM) using the following scale:
0=absent (no sign/symptom); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (awareness of symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (symptoms hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities and/or sleeping). The total nasal symptom score (sum of 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) Over the Two-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -6 to 0) and Days 1-15 (2-week Treatment Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in the morning patient-reported instantaneous TNSS. Participants recorded the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) over the past 10 minutes (prior to the assessment) in the morning on a scale from 0 (mild symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The total nasal symptom score (sum of the 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The adult RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional). Participants were asked to recall their experiences during the previous week and to give their responses on a 7-point scale (0 = Least severe to 6 = Extremely severe). The overall RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses, and ranges from 0 to 7. A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning 24-hour Reflective Ocular Symptom Score Over the Two-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -6 to 0) and Days 1-15 (2-week Treatment Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the severity of their symptoms (itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes and redness of eyes) for the past 24 hours each morning using the following scale:
0=absent (no sign/symptoms); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, minimal awareness, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (awareness of sign/symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (sign/symptom hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities or sleeping).
The total ocular symptom score (sum of 3 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 9 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning 24-hour Reflective Non-nasal Symptom Score Over the Two-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -6 to 0) and Days 1-15 (2-week Treatment Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the severity of their symptoms (itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes and itching of ears or palate) for the past 24 hours each morning using the following scale:
0=absent (no sign/symptom); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (awareness of sign/symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (symptoms hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities or sleeping).
Total non-nasal symptom score (sum of 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients 12 years of age and older, as of the Screening Visit (SV).

          -  General good health, and free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that could
             interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study
             observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the study.

          -  A history of SAR to relevant seasonal allergen (tree/grass pollen) for a minimum of
             two years immediately preceding the study Screening Visit (SV). The SAR must have been
             of sufficient severity to have required treatment (either continuous or intermittent)
             in the past and in the investigator's judgment is expected to be exposed to the
             allergen and require treatment throughout the entire study period.

          -  A demonstrated sensitivity to relevant tree/grass pollen known to produce SAR through
             a standard skin prick test. A positive test is defined as a wheal diameter at least 3
             mm larger than the control wheal for the skin prick test. Documentation of a positive
             result within 12 months prior to Screening Visit (SV) is acceptable.

          -  Other criteria apply

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study within the 30 days preceding the
             Screening Visit (SV) or planned participation in another investigational drug study at
             any time during this study.

          -  History of physical findings of nasal pathology, including nasal polyps or other
             clinically significant respiratory tract malformations, recent nasal biopsy, nasal
             trauma or surgery, atrophic rhinitis, or rhinitis medicamentosa (all within the last
             60 days prior to the SV).

          -  History of a respiratory infection or disorder [including, but not limited to
             bronchitis, pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome
             (SARS)] within the 14 days preceding the Screening Visit (SV), or development of a
             respiratory infection during the Run-in Period.

          -  Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the prescribed (per protocol)
             time since the last dosing period prior to the Screening Visit (SV) and/or plans for
             use during the entire treatment duration.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average AM and PM Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) Over the Two-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) over the past 12 hours twice daily (AM &amp; PM) using the following scale:
0=absent (no sign/symptom); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (awareness of sign/symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (sign/symptoms hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities and/or sleeping).
The total nasal symptom score (sum of the 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Morning Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) Over the Two-week Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Change from Baseline in the morning patient-reported instantaneous TNSS. Participants recorded the severity of their nasal symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) over the past 10 minutes (prior to the assessment) in the morning on a scale from 0 (mild symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). The total nasal symptom score (sum of the 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>

        <description>The adult RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional). Participants were asked to recall their experiences during the previous week and to give their responses on a 7-point scale (0 = Least severe to 6 = Extremely severe). The overall RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses, and ranges from 0 to 7. A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Morning 24-hour Reflective Non-nasal Symptom Score Over the Two-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of their symptoms (itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, redness of eyes and itching of ears or palate) for the past 24 hours each morning using the following scale:
0=absent (no sign/symptom); 1=mild (sign/symptom present, easily tolerated); 2=moderate (awareness of sign/symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3=severe (symptoms hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities or sleeping).
Total non-nasal symptom score (sum of 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 to 12 (worst symptoms). A negative change from Baseline score indicates symptom improvement.</description>
