  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a national epidemic with multiple causes and complex solutions. Research in both
      animals and humans has suggested that the inclusion of dairy foods into a moderate calorie
      restricted diet can increase weight loss and fat loss. Our proposed project extends these
      prior findings by determining, for the first time, how inclusion of dairy in a
      calorie-restricted diet changes the amount of visceral adiposity in overweight and obese
      subjects. The investigators also propose unique studies to evaluate the potential
      mechanism(s) by which dairy promotes weight and fat loss during dieting, through an
      examination of adipocyte size, gene expression, and inflammatory markers. The hypotheses
      under investigation are (1) that inclusion of dairy foods in a modest energy restricted diet
      will significantly increase body fat loss compared to a control diet; (2) that dairy products
      in a modest energy restricted diet will result in greater fat loss from intra-abdominal
      adipose tissue compared to the control, 3) components of dairy products up- or down-regulate
      the secretion of metabolically-relevant hormones during the postprandial and inter-meal
      periods, 4) dairy products will promote satiety and/or satiation, 5) dairy foods reduce
      adipocyte differentiation and/or enhance adipocyte apoptosis, leading to concomitant white
      adipose tissue (WAT) expression changes for genes playing a role in these processes, 6) dairy
      foods will reduce adipocyte lipid storage and enhance pathways associated with thermogenesis
      and mitochondrial function in WAT, as reflected in gene expression changes and reduced
      adipocyte size, and 7) dairy foods included in a modest energy restricted diet will decrease
      inflammation in WAT and other tissues, thus decreasing circulating cytokines, increasing zinc
      status, decreasing expression of inflammatory markers in WAT, and reducing WAT macrophage
      infiltration.

      84 overweight and overweight and obese adult males and females will be recruited from the
      faculty, staff, and student populations at UC-Davis as well as the greater Davis and
      Sacramento communities. Each intervention arm will require 42 adults; 35 for statistical
      power on weight loss + 14 more for attrition during the weight loss intervention. Statistical
      power for fat loss requires only 20 subjects/treatment arm. Subjects will be enrolled in 7
      cohorts of 12 each and will be randomly assigned to either control or dairy diets. Subjects
      will meet the following additional inclusion and exclusion criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) 28 -3 4.9 kg/m2

          -  Age 25-45 years

          -  Low calcium diet (determined by food frequency and diet history): &lt; 1 serving of dairy
             foods and total dietary Ca intake from all sources not to exceed 600 mg/d .

          -  No more than 3 kg weight loss during past three months

          -  Negative pregnancy test at entry prior to DXA and abdominal CT scan; pregnancy testing
             will be repeated done at 6 weeks of diet intervention to insure that women do not
             become pregnant during the energy restriction period. Should a woman become pregnant
             she will be dismissed from the protocol. Pregnancy testing will also be done at the
             end of the study prior to DXA and abdominal CT scans

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI&lt;28or&gt;37. BMI greater than 37 indicates another level of obesity and the potential
             for numerous obesity related endocrine changes and substrate utilization
             abnormalities.

               -  Type II diabetes requiring the use of any oral anti-diabetic agent and/or insulin
                  (because of confounding effects on body weight regulation).

               -  Fasting glucose &gt; 110 mg/dl.

               -  Adverse response to study foods (lactose intolerance, dairy intolerance, dairy
                  allergy; this will be determined by self-report.

               -  High calcium diet (determined by food frequency and diet history): Greater than
                  600 mg calcium per day from all sources (Ca supplements, dairy foods and other
                  dietary sources).

               -  History or presence of significant metabolic disease which could impact on the
                  results of the study (i.e. endocrine, hepatic, renal disease).

               -  Use of hypertension or lipid altering medications.

               -  Resting blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mg/Hg

               -  Total cholesterol &gt; 300mg/dl or triglyceride value &gt; 400 mg/dl or LDL &gt; 160
                  mg/dl.

               -  History of eating disorder

               -  Presence of active gastrointestinal disorders such as malabsorption syndromes

               -  Pregnancy or lactation

               -  Use of obesity pharmacotherapeutic agents within the last 12 weeks

                  phenylpropanalamine, ephedrine and/or caffeine) within the last 12 weeks

               -  Use of calcium supplements in the past 12 weeks

               -  Recent (past four weeks) initiation of an exercise program

               -  Recent (past twelve weeks) initiation of hormonal birth control or change in
                  hormonal birth control regimen

               -  Use of tobacco products.

               -  Exercise more than 30 minutes/day - greater than this may influence substrate
                  utilization.
