    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see what changes happen to the tumors while taking the
      axitinib and after it is stopped (during the scheduled breaks), and what changes in the tumor
      may be responsible for this growth. This will be done by using a special kind of scan called
      an 18F-FLT PET/CT.

      In addition, the investigators want to find out how the drugs are processed and distributed
      in the human body. The investigators will also look at how different types of cancer are
      affected by axitinib. The investigators will also correlate vasculature kinetics extracted
      from the dynamic FLT PET/CT imaging with the vasculature kinetics extracted from DCE-CT.
