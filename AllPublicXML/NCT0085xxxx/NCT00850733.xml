      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of each of 2 dosages of
      BOTOX® (200 U or 300 U) compared to placebo injected into the detrusor for the treatment of
      urinary incontinence caused by neurogenic detrusor overactivity in patients who have not been
      adequately managed with anticholinergic therapy.

        The study will recruit 260 patients nationwide with an expected recruitment of 6 patients
        at the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Patients must be between 18-80 years of age and will
        include patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity as a result of spinal cord injury or
        multiple sclerosis, with urinary incontinence, who have not been adequately managed with
        anticholinergic therapy. 50% of the patients randomized will be of spinal cord injury
        etiology and 50% of multiple sclerosis etiology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is male or female, aged 18 to 80 years old.

          2. Patient weighs ≥ 50 kg (110 lb).

          3. Patient has urinary incontinence as a result of neurogenic detrusor overactivity for a
             period of at least 3 months prior to screening as a result of spinal cord injury or
             multiple sclerosis, determined by documented patient history. In addition:

               -  Spinal cord injury patients must have a stable neurological injury level at T1 or
                  below (cervical injuries are excluded) occurring ≥ 6 months prior to screening.

               -  Multiple sclerosis patients must be clinically stable in the investigator's
                  opinion for ≥ 3 months prior to screening and have an Expanded Disability Status
                  Scale score ≤ 6.5.

          4. Patient has detrusor overactivity (defined as a phasic rise in bladder pressure during
             the filling phase determined by urodynamics) demonstrated during the screening period
             or Day 1 (prior to randomization).

          5. Patient is able to complete study requirements including bladder diary completion and
             attend all study visits (telephone and clinic), in the opinion of the investigator.

          6. Patient has not been adequately managed with one or more anticholinergics for their
             urinary incontinence, in the opinion of the investigator. Not adequately managed is
             defined as an inadequate response or intolerable side effects after at least one month
             of anticholinergic therapy on an optimized dose.

          7. For patients taking anticholinergic medication for their neurogenic overactive
             bladder, dose is stable and patient is willing to maintain same dosing during study
             participation.

          8. Patient has a negative pregnancy result if female and of childbearing potential.

             The following criteria are also required for entry into the study at Randomization/Day
             1:

          9. Patient experiences ≥ 14 episodes of urinary incontinence per week with no more than 2
             incontinent-free days determined by completion of patient bladder diary during the
             screening period.

         10. Patient currently uses or is willing to use clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)
             to empty the bladder (indwelling catheter is not permitted). Patients currently on CIC
             should be willing to maintain an established CIC frequency throughout the study.
             Caregiver may perform CIC.

         11. Patients with a negative urine culture result must take an antibiotic medication for 3
             days immediately prior to Randomization/Day 1 and agree to continue antibiotic
             medication for at least 3 days following treatment. Patients with a positive urine
             culture result indicating urinary tract infection (UTI) must take an antibiotic to
             which the identified organism is sensitive for at least 5 days immediately prior to
             Randomization/Day 1 and continue for 3 days following the procedure (or longer as
             needed) and patient is asymptomatic for UTI on day of treatment. A UTI is defined as
             either a positive urine culture result with a bacteriuria count of &gt; 105 CFU/mL
             conjoint with a leukocyturia &gt; 5/hpf at screening or a positive urine culture that, in
             the investigator's opinion, requires antibiotic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has history or evidence of any pelvic or urological abnormalities including
             but not limited to the following:

               -  elevated serum creatinine &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal (reference range)

               -  history of or current hematuria, 1) if the hematuria is determined to be a
                  pathologic condition or 2) is uninvestigated

               -  interstitial cystitis in the opinion of the investigator

               -  bladder stones within 6 months of screening

               -  surgery or bladder disease other than detrusor overactivity that may impact
                  bladder function with the exception of surgeries for bladder stones (&gt; 6 months)
                  and stress incontinence, uterine prolapse, rectocele, or cystocele (&gt;1 year) from
                  screening

          2. Patient has had previous or current botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype for any
             urological condition or, treatment within 3 months of Randomization/Day 1 for any
             other condition or use.

          3. Patient has been immunized for any botulinum toxin serotype.

          4. Patient discontinued anticholinergic medication for overactive bladder &lt; 21 days prior
             to Randomization/Day 1.

          5. Patient has a history or current diagnosis of bladder cancer or has urine cytology
             results which may indicate bladder cancer not ruled out by investigator at
             Randomization/Day 1. Suspicious urine cytology abnormalities require the
             investigator's assessment to ensure that the findings are not indicative of
             malignancy.

          6. Patient is male with previous or current diagnosis of prostate cancer. Patients with a
             PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL will require a biopsy to rule out prostate cancer,
             unless a prostatic biopsy has been performed on the patient within the past 12 months.

          7. Patient has 24 hour total volume voided &gt; 3000 mL of urine determined by completion of
             patient bladder diary collected over one consecutive 24 hour period during the 7 day
             diary collection period prior to Randomization/Day1.

          8. Patient has a post void residual volume above 200 mL for patients who micturate or
             have a mixed catheterization/spontaneous micturition pattern.

             or within 4 weeks prior to screening.

         10. Patient uses any anti-platelet or anticoagulant therapy or is using medications with
             anti-coagulative effects within 3 days prior to treatment. Some medications may need
             to be withheld for &gt; 3 days per clinical judgment of the investigator (refer to
             Section 8.2.2 Prohibited Medications/Treatments for details).

         11. Patient has hemophilia or other clotting factor deficiencies or disorders that cause
             bleeding diatheses.

         12. Patient has had concurrent treatment or treatment within 6 months of Randomization/Day
             1 with capsaicin or resiniferatoxin.

         13. Patient is currently using or plans to use an implanted or non-implantable
             electrostimulation/neuromodulation device for treatment of overactive bladder.

         14. Patient has a known allergy or sensitivity to any components of the study medication,
             anesthetics or antibiotics or any other products associated with the treatment and
             general study procedures.

         15. Patient has any medical condition that may put the patient at increased risk with
             exposure to BOTOX® including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome or
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

         16. Patient is female and pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study, or
             of childbearing potential and unable or unwilling to use a reliable form of
             contraception during the study.

         17. Patient is currently or has previously participated in another therapeutic or device
             study within 30 days of screening.

         18. Patient has any condition or situation, which, in the investigator's opinion, puts the
             patient at significant risk, could confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the patient's participation in the study.
