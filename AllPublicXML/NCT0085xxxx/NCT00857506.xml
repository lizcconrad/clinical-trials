  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to determine if brain amyloid imaged with
      florbetapir F 18 (18F-AV-45) PET scans is predictive of progressive cognitive impairment
      during the subsequent 36 months for groups of: normal controls, mild cognitive impairment and
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Hypothesis 1: The probability a subject will experience progressive cognitive impairment
      within 36 months of imaging will be greater in subjects whose 18F-AV-45 PET scan was rated
      amyloid positive compared to subjects whose PET scan was rated amyloid negative.

      The secondary objective is to determine the stability, over 36 months of a clinical
      diagnosis, of AD in patients with an amyloid positive 18F-AV-45 PET.

      Hypothesis 2: The diagnosis of AD will remain unchanged in patients whose PET scan were rated
      as amyloid positive.

      Study AV-45-A11 is designed to determine if brain amyloid aggregation imaged on 18F-AV-45 PET
      scans is predictive of progression of cognitive impairment during the subsequent 36 months.
      Approximately 180 subjects enrolled in a prior clinical study (AV-45-A05[NCT00702143]) will
      be offered an opportunity to be studied under this protocol. The initial visit will occur as
      soon as possible following the AV-45-A05(NCT00702143) imaging day. Subjects who qualify for
      the study and their caregiver/partners will be contacted approximately 6,12,18,24 and 36
      months after PET imaging in study AV-45-A05(NCT00702143), and will undergo a standardized
      functional and psychometric evaluation.

      NOTE: This study is a clinical follow-up of subjects previously enrolled in trial
      18F-AV-45-A05(NCT00702143). No new patients are being enrolled in this trial.

    <measure>Change in ADAS-Cog for MCI Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis was the comparison in the magnitude of change from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) between Aβ+ and Aβ- subjects in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) population at 36 months adjusting for baseline test score and age at informed consent. ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of 11 cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. Change in ADAS-Cog scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (last observation carried forward [LOCF]). A change in ADAS-Cog greater than 0 indicates a deterioration in cognitive performance whereas a change in ADAS-Cog less than 0 indicates improved cognitive performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Decline in MCI Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The key secondary analyses compared the number of Aβ+ and Aβ- subjects in the MCI population with clinically significant deterioration in ADAS-Cog (≥4) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score (≥0.5) and conversion in diagnosis from MCI at baseline to AD or Cognitively Normal (CN) at 36 months. ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of 11 cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. CDR scores (range 0-3) quantify the severity of the symptoms of dementia where 0 indicates no cognitive impairment and 3 indicates severe dementia. Changes in ADAS-Cog and CDR scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (LOCF).</description>

    <measure>Covariate Adjusted Psychometric Score Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline by diagnostic group in covariate-adjusted psychometric assessment scores at month 36 (LOCF). Assessments included Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Logical Memory Scale (WLMS) delayed and immediate recall, Category Verbal Fluency (CVF) animals and vegetables, Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Studies Consortium Activities of Daily Living (ADCS ADL) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The ranges for these scales are as follows: DSS (0-93), CDR-SOB (0-18), MMSE (0-30), WLMS delayed and immediate recall (0-25), CVF animals and vegetables (0-total number of relevant items named in 60 seconds), ADCS ADL (0-78) and GDS (0-15). For all scales except CDR-SOB and GDS a higher score indicates greater cognitive function. For CDR-SOB and GDS a higher score indicates increased dementia or depression, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of Change in ADAS-Cog and SUVR</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between change from baseline to 36 month ADAS-Cog score and baseline global average SUVR by diagnostic group is provided below. ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of 11 cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. Change in ADAS-Cog scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (LOCF). A change in ADAS-Cog greater than 0 indicates a deterioration in cognitive performance whereas a change in ADAS-Cog less than 0 indicates improved cognitive performance. Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) is the ratio of tracer uptake in the cortex and cerebellum. SUVR values higher than 1 indicate greater amyloid burden in the cortex as compared to the cerebellum whereas scores less than 1 indicate the opposite.</description>

        <title>Change in ADAS-Cog for MCI Subjects</title>
        <description>The primary analysis was the comparison in the magnitude of change from baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) between Aβ+ and Aβ- subjects in the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) population at 36 months adjusting for baseline test score and age at informed consent. ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of 11 cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. Change in ADAS-Cog scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (last observation carried forward [LOCF]). A change in ADAS-Cog greater than 0 indicates a deterioration in cognitive performance whereas a change in ADAS-Cog less than 0 indicates improved cognitive performance.</description>

        <title>Covariate Adjusted Psychometric Score Change</title>
        <description>Change from baseline by diagnostic group in covariate-adjusted psychometric assessment scores at month 36 (LOCF). Assessments included Digit Symbol Substitution (DSS), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Wechsler Logical Memory Scale (WLMS) delayed and immediate recall, Category Verbal Fluency (CVF) animals and vegetables, Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Studies Consortium Activities of Daily Living (ADCS ADL) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The ranges for these scales are as follows: DSS (0-93), CDR-SOB (0-18), MMSE (0-30), WLMS delayed and immediate recall (0-25), CVF animals and vegetables (0-total number of relevant items named in 60 seconds), ADCS ADL (0-78) and GDS (0-15). For all scales except CDR-SOB and GDS a higher score indicates greater cognitive function. For CDR-SOB and GDS a higher score indicates increased dementia or depression, respectively.</description>

        <title>Correlation of Change in ADAS-Cog and SUVR</title>
        <description>Correlation between change from baseline to 36 month ADAS-Cog score and baseline global average SUVR by diagnostic group is provided below. ADAS-Cog scores (range 0-70) indicate performance on a series of 11 cognitive tasks where 0 indicates the highest level of cognitive performance and 70 indicates the lowest level of cognitive performance. Change in ADAS-Cog scores were calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the 36 month score (LOCF). A change in ADAS-Cog greater than 0 indicates a deterioration in cognitive performance whereas a change in ADAS-Cog less than 0 indicates improved cognitive performance. Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) is the ratio of tracer uptake in the cortex and cerebellum. SUVR values higher than 1 indicate greater amyloid burden in the cortex as compared to the cerebellum whereas scores less than 1 indicate the opposite.</description>
