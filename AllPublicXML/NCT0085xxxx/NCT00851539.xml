  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to test the effectiveness of a
      post-test behavioral video in educating adolescents about HIV transmission and affecting
      their intentions to engage in risk-reduction behavior.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are at risk for HIV because of their engagement in high risk sexual activity.
      This study seeks to determine effective ways to educate teens about HIV and how to protect
      themselves by use of multimedia. All eligible participants who agree to enroll in this trial
      will be randomized into two arms: the behavioral intervention video (intervention group) or
      meeting with an in-person counselor (control group) as they wait for their rapid HIV results.
      The goals of the RCT involve establishing the feasibility of using touch-screen technology
      for teenagers in the ED; establishing the receptivity of teens to HIV rapid testing in the
      ED; providing data on rates, and obtaining preliminary data on the effectiveness of the video
      in changing condom efficacy, condom outcome expectancies and condom use intention. Consenting
      to rapid HIV testing is a secondary outcome.
