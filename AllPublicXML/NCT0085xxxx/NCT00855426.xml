    <textblock>
      Nondisplaced hip fractures may be radiographically occult and require MRI or single photon
      emission CT bone scintigraphy for accurate diagnosis. Both examinations are expensive and are
      not readily available in many hospitals. Ultrasound (US) examination is relatively
      inexpensive and preliminary data had demonstrated its efficacy in detecting occult fractures
      in other sites. Our objective is to evaluate US examination as a screening tool for occult
      hip fractures in posttraumatic painful hips in the elderly.
