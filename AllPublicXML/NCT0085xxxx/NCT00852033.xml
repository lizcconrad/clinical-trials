  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse among college students is a significant and long-standing public health issue.
      The transition into college is marked by substantial increases in alcohol abuse and problems,
      suggesting the importance of interventions that take place prior to and immediately following
      matriculation. To date, early interventions with this population have yielded modest results
      with very little evidence identifying either the factors that are responsible for observed
      effects or specific individual or situational factors that qualify intervention efficacy.
      There is preliminary evidence for the efficacy of individualized feedback (IF) in reducing
      college student alcohol abuse. Additionally, a sizeable body of research with early
      adolescents and emerging work with college students point to the utility of parent-based
      interventions (PBI). The major aim of this research is to provide the first test of the
      unique and combined efficacy of these two successful interventions in reducing alcohol abuse
      among matriculating college students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a 2 X 2 IF (yes; no) X PBI (yes; no) factorial design, this study will determine
      whether IF and PBI with &quot;boosters&quot; are effective in reducing alcohol abuse among incoming
      college students. It is hypothesized that groups receiving IF and PBI will demonstrate lower
      levels of alcohol abuse over the first two years of college than those not receiving these
      interventions and that the effects of combining these interventions will be additive
      (Specific Aim 1). Structural equation modeling techniques will be used to conduct mediational
      analyses investigating theoretically derived hypotheses about the processes by which
      intervention factors influence alcohol use and problems (Specific Aim 2). Hierarchical
      multiple regression analyses will examine hypothesized individual and situational moderators
      of intervention efficacy (Specific Aim 3). The use of a factorial design and explicit
      mediational analyses will allow for very strong inferences regarding the &quot;active ingredients&quot;
      of intervention efficacy. The long-term objectives of this research are to improve the
      efficacy of early interventions and to inform research and theory on the etiology of
      alcoholism. More effective interventions, particularly those that target students during a
      developmental transition of enhanced risk, will result in fewer injuries from acute
      intoxication, enhance retention and learning, and lessen the development of alcoholism as a
      result of chronic alcohol abuse.

    <description>Students met with trained interventionists. The initial BMI took place during the fall semester of the freshmen year for approximately 45 minutes. Individualized feedback was used to guide the BMI sessions. The feedback data were gathered through an online survey completed within two weeks of the scheduled appointment to ensure the use of proximal feedback reflecting current drinking. Feedback was tailored so that drinkers received information on their personal drinking patterns, heavy episodic drinking, and alcohol-related consequences, and abstainers received feedback on their perceived barriers for maintaining abstinence, the safety and health benefits of their choice not to drink, and their experience with second-hand effects of alcohol use. In the spring of the freshmen year, students received a BMI 'booster' session. Individualized feedback was created from the original online survey and the 10 month follow-up assessment.</description>
