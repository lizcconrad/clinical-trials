  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the impact of folate and L-methylfolate on the
      progression of Parkinson's. The investigators are specifically looking for the effect of
      these nutritional supplements in Parkinson's patients who have an antibody that effects their
      body's utilization of folate. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system
      to recognize foreign substances. Normally, people do not have an antibody that prevents
      folate from working properly in the brain but it appears that some people may have such an
      antibody. Folate is an important vitamin that takes part in many critical cell functions so
      an antibody that prevented it from entering the brain properly could cause or worsen certain
      neurological disorders like Parkinson's. The results of this preliminary study will help
      determine whether it is reasonable to proceed with further study of any of these supplements
      for the treatment of Parkinson's. Patients interested in participating will have a blood test
      to see if they have folate antibodies. Patients with the antibody will be eligible to further
      participate in the study. The investigators will measure the effects of folate and
      L-methylfolate on Parkinson's disease by measuring the change in your Parkinson's disease
      symptoms over three months of treatment. The investigators will also be looking at the blood
      of some individuals who do not have Parkinson's. This is called a control group and will
      allow us to compare how common the folate antibody is in the general population compared with
      the Parkinson's population.
