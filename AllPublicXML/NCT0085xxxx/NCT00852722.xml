  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if following a specific low fat diet will improve
      the brain damage as seen by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to decrease the progression
      of multiple sclerosis (MS) as evidenced by clinical evaluation and symptoms.

      This research project has significance for its potential to develop a new therapeutic
      approach to MS. Current treatments in MS include disease modifying therapies such as human
      recombinant interferon beta, glatiramer acetate and natalizumab. However, these are only
      partially effective, cannot be taken orally, have side-effects and are very expensive.
      Developing treatment that can be combined with current disease modifying agent remains an
      important goal for improving the care of people with MS.

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The regular diet arm will be a wait-listed group that will receive no training in diet and will be advised to continue their regular (usual) diet as was prior to entry into the study, for the duration of the study. They will have a similar clinic follow up schedule as the treatment group. The regular diet group will be given identical instructions to exercise regularly similar to the treatment group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Low fat study diet</intervention_name>
    <description>The low fat study diet is a very low-saturated-fat, plant food based diet. It will be approximately 10% fat, 14% protein and 76% carbohydrate.The diet is is starched based and also contains fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables and there is no animal meat used, including no use of fish. This diet is very low in saturated fats and enriched in unsaturated fats. Subjects do not take dietary supplements.</description>
