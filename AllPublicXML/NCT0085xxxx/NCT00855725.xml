      The goal of this study is to determine whether there are unique markers on neuroimaging that
      are associated with depression in epilepsy.

    <textblock>
      Symptoms of depression is commonly seen in patients with epilepsy. There are similarities and
      differences between depressive symptoms in epilepsy when compared with primary depression.
      Through the use of fMRI (Functional MRI), we hope to determine whether there are unique
      markers on neuroimaging that are associated with depression in epilepsy.
