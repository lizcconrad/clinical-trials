      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less
      damage to normal tissue. It may also help patients with spinal metastases live more
      comfortably.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic
      radiosurgery in treating patients with spinal metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To implement CyberKnife® technology for improving palliation in patients with spinal
           metastases.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of CyberKnife® hypofractionated stereotactic
           radiosurgery in these patients.

        -  To evaluate functional and diffusion MRI parameters in the spinal cord and tumor after
           treatment with Cyberknife® radiosurgery.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of gold fiducial markers at the time of open surgical
      resection or percutaneous needle biopsy. Patients then undergo CyberKnife® hypofractionated
      stereotactic radiosurgery over 30-90 minutes daily for 2-3 days.

      Patients undergo functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging at baseline and then at 6 weeks
      and 6 months after completion of treatment. Patients also complete a pain questionnaire at
      baseline and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after completion of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
