    <description>Patients will start induction treatment with a standard dose of MP and escalating doses of Vorinostat:
Melphalan 0.18 mg/Kg for 4 days; Prednisone 1.5 mg/Kg for 4 days. Each cycle will be repeated every 28 days for a total of 6 courses
In the first part of the study, the standard oral MP will be combined with escalating doses of Vorinostat.
Level -1 Vorinostat = 100 mg daily on days 1-21 Melphalan = 0.18 mg/kg on days 1 - 4 Prednisone = 1.5 mg/kg on days 1 - 4
Level 0 Vorinostat = 200 mg daily on days 1-21 Melphalan = 0.18 mg/kg on days 1 - 4 Prednisone = 1.5 mg/kg on days 1 - 4
Level +1 Vorinostat = 300 mg daily on days 1-21 Melphalan = 0.18 mg/kg on days 1 - 4 Prednisone = 1.5 mg/kg on days 1 - 4
Level +2 Vorinostat = 400 mg daily on days 1-21 Melphalan = 0.18 mg/kg on days 1 - 4 Prednisone = 1.5 mg/kg on days 1 - 4</description>

             protocol requirements.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study
             related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent
             may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future medical
             care.

          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal for 24 consecutive months or surgically
             sterilized or agree to continuous abstinence from heterosexual sexual contact or
             willing to use effective contraception for 4 weeks prior to beginning study drug
             therapy, during study drug therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after
             discontinuation of therapy; female patients not pregnant or nursing; female with a
             negative pregnancy test.

          -  Male patient agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception during study drug
             therapy (including dose interruption) and for 4 weeks after discontinuation of
             Vorinostat therapy.

          -  Patient was previously diagnosed with symptomatic MM based on standard criteria, and
             has measurable disease.

          -  Patient is relapsed or refractory after a minimum of 3 weeks from prior therapies
             (patients must have recovered from toxicities related to prior therapies).

          -  Patient has a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%.

          -  Patient has a life-expectancy &gt; 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness or
             social situation that would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form
             or limit the compliance with study medications and requirements.

          -  Pregnant or beast feeding females.

          -  Use of any other concomitant standard/experimental anti-myeloma drug or therapy.

          -  Known positive for HIV or active infectious hepatitis, type B or C.

          -  Known congenital long QT syndrome.

          -  Ongoing therapy with anti-arrhythmic drugs or other medicinal products which led to QT
             prolongation and cumulative high dose of anthracycline.

          -  Any clinically significant illness that would, in the investigator's opinion, increase
             the patient's risk for toxicity. Patients has not plasmacell leukaemia defined as the
             presence of more than 20% plasma cells in the peripheral blood and an absolute plasma
             cell count of at least 2000/uL.

          -  Patients has not a currently active malignancy, except non melanoma skin cancer and
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients should not be considered to have a currently
             active second malignancy if they have completed therapy for a prior malignancy and are
             disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years and are considered by their
             physicians to be at less then 30% risk of relapse

          -  History of allergic reactions related to study drugs.

          -  Prior exposure to HDACi. Patients exposed to valproic acid could be eligible with a
             wash out period of at least 30 days.

          -  Patients scheduled to undergo autologous or allogenic bone marrow transplant within 4
             week of the initiation of Vorinostat administration.
