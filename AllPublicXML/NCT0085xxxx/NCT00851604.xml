      The purpose of this study is to determine whether monitoring of levels of Serological Markers
      ProGRP, CgA, NSE and Pyruvate Kinase M2 are effective in the Evaluation of Diagnosis,
      Monitoring Therapeutic Effects and Predicting response to somatostatin analogues in Patients
      with Malignant Neuroendocrine Tumors.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of the anatomical spread and disease progression in neuroendocrine tumor patients
      has become an essential part of disease management, but sometimes in many patients difficult
      to be measured. Therefore, the evaluation of serum markers could represent a useful tool for
      monitoring the course of the disease and the response of patients to therapy or palliative
      treatment.Clinical data considers CgA and NSE as available today blood biomarkers for
      neuroendocrine tumors.Until now the usefulness of serum ProGRP as a clinical tumor marker has
      been evaluated mainly in Small Cell Lung Carcinoma, while its role in the management of NE
      tumors has not been elucidated.Available in the literature limited data suggests that ProGRP
      may be a potential tumor marker in NE tumors.

      Pyruvate kinase type M2 is the key glycolytic regulator in tumor cells.It catalyzes the
      dephosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate with ATP production.The dimeric form of
      this enzyme (TUM2-PK) has been detected in the blood of patients with different cancers.High
      TUM2-PK expression was suggested to be an important element of tumor cell metabolism
      adaptation to an inadequate oxygen and nutrient supply.Recently, it has been shown that
      somatostatin and its structural analogues pass through cell membrane and actively bind to
      cytosolic TUM2-PK. In response to this binding TUM2-PK translocates into the nucleus and
      induce programmed cell death. It is suggested that TUM2-PK enzyme may contribute
      significantly to response of neuroendocrine tumors to somatostatin analogues.
