  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major challenge of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy is the development of glucose-sparing
      strategies able to provide an efficacious ultrafiltration (UF) profile. Study hypothesis is
      to evaluate the possibility to formulate PD solutions containing xylitol and L-carnitine as
      osmotic agents to partially replace glucose.

          -  Stable clinical condition within four weeks before screening period, certified by
             medical/surgical history, physical examination and laboratory exploration;

          -  Hemoglobin level ≥9g/dL;

          -  Residual diuresis ≤800mL;

          -  Absence of acute peritonitis and/or peritoneal catheter infection (either exit site or

          -  Stable peritoneal permeability, as confirmed by a PET between 0.50 and 0.81 during
             previous three months and at day 0 of the screening period;

          -  Total urea Kt/V &gt;1.5 per week at a control during previous three months and at day 0
             of the screening period and/or minimal total creatinine clearance of 45 liter/week at
             a control during previous three months and at day 0 of the screening period; 1- To
             understand and sign an informed consent form.

        For patients who will be included in Group B, the following criteria must be fulfilled too:

          -  Be treated with Extraneal (nocturnal exchange bag solution) for at least 1 month

          -  Be treated with 2 or 3 diurnal exchange bag solutions (solution bags with 1.36% or

             study;

          -  Androgen therapy in the last six months before selection;

          -  Active infections;

          -  History of congestive heart failure stage III and IV NYHA;

             an effective method of contraception;

          -  Presence of relevant chronic medical conditions that could suggest exclusion of
             patient from the study or could interfere with assessment of study parameters,
             especially if the life expectation is less then one year;

          -  Participation in another clinical study within the past month;

          -  Known or supposed allergic reactions to L-carnitine or xylitol.
