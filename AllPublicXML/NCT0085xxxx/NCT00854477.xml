      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of adjuvant capecitabine
      in patients who have undergone proximal pancreatico-duodenectomy.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To establish the pharmacokinetics (PK) of capecitabine in patients who have undergone
           proximal pancreatico-duodenectomy.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To establish the toxicity profile of capecitabine in these patients and to identify any
           dose limiting toxicities (DLT).

        -  To ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to previous studies using
           patients who have not undergone such surgery.

      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of adjuvant capecitabine in
      patients who have undergone proximal pancreatico-duodenectomy. The study also aims to
      establish the toxicity profile of capecitabine in these patients, to identify any dose
      limiting toxicities (DLT), and to ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure when compared to
      previous studies using patients who have not undergone such surgery. Screening tests will
      consist of demographic details, complete medical history, physical exam, vital signs, tumour
      serum markers, haematology and biochemistry tests. There will also be an ECG, faecal elastase
      measurement and a serum or urine pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential).
      Haematology and Biochemistry (including CA19.9) will be repeated prior to each study drug
      administration. All patients will receive 8 cycles of oral capecitabine chemotherapy at a
      dose of 1250 mg/m2, administered twice daily at 12 hourly intervals for 14 consecutive days
      out of a 21 day cycle. Total proposed duration of therapy is 24 weeks, assuming patients
      commence all cycles without delay. Capecitabine and its metabolites (DFCR, DFUR and 5-FU)
      plasma levels will be measured during the 1st and 3rd cycles in all patients. Treatment
      should continue for 8 cycles unless there is evidence of disease progression, or unacceptable
      toxicity.
