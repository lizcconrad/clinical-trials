  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to provide a definitive test of the hypothesis that elevating
      sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor for several key brain enzymes)concentrations in
      the CNS will result in measurable improvements in core symptoms of autism in young
      individuals, under age 6 years. The study will entail a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      16-week intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 20 years, several studies have suggested that sapropterin (tetrahydrobiopterin)
      might ameliorate core symptoms of autism at least in young (under age 6) subjects. However,
      those studies had somewhat questionable methodologies, a major one being that the doses of
      sapropterin used were roughly one tenth that thought to be needed to provide physiologically
      meaningful increases of sapropterin in the central nervous system (CNS). This study will look
      at the impact of a sustained exposure to this higher dose in well-diagnosed young children
      with autism.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression -- Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 4 weeks, then monthly, with 16-week end point. Primary outcome assessment used two time points, baseline and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I assessed the number of participants showing much or very much improvement on the CGI-I scale. This is a summary judgment made by a trained clinician based on observed and reported behaviors of the child compared to baseline. It is a 7-point scale from very much worse (1) to very much improved (7). Chi-square analyses were used to assess change in CHI-I scores (by group, post-test). Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. We used random intercept and trend modeling that accounts for each individual's initial level of symptom severity/functioning and rate of change/time</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression -- Severity (CGI-S) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Primary outcome assessment used 2 time points, baseline and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S assessed the number of participants with improved severity illness on the CGI-S scale. This is a summary judgment made by a trained clinician of symptom severity. It is a 7-point scale that rates the severity of the patient's illness at time of assessment with 1 - normal, not at all, to 7 - extremely ill. Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. We used random intercept and trend modeling that accounts for each individual's initial level of symptom severity/functioning and rate of change/time</description>

    <measure>Preschool Language Scale-Fourth Edition (PLS-4). Assesses Expressive and Receptive Language Skills in Ages Birth Through 6 Years, 11 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary outcome assessment examined the difference in scores between baseline and week 16.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures expressive &amp; receptive language and total scores in ages birth to 6 years 11 months. The scales generate raw, standard, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores for the total scale were selected for use in this study. Total is average of subscales. Minimum raw score = 0, maximum = 130. Higher scores indicate better language abilities. Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. For the outcome effect, the difference between baseline and 16 weeks was determined as an indicator for change.</description>

    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale-II.</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary outcome assessment used two time points, baseline and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>the Vineland-2 is a semi-structured interview designed to assess communicatino, daily living, socialization and motor skills. The Vineland-2 is comprised of a total Adaptive Composite scale; we chose to use 10 subscales that specifically address functional domains relevant for a young ASD sample - Receptive Communication, Expressive Communication, Personal Daily Living Skills, Domestic Daily Living Skills, Community Daily Living Skills, Interpersonal Relations, Play Skills, Coping Skills, Gross Motor Skills, Fine Motor Skills. Scales generate raw or sum, V-, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores were selected for use in the study. Raw score ranges from 0 to 108 depending on the scale. Total raw scale range is from 0 to 766. Subscale scores are averaged to create the total adaptive behavior composite. Higher subscale scores indicate more skills. Difference between baseline and week 16 was used as an indicator of change.</description>

    <measure>Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The C-YBOCS is a scale is designed to rate the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years. It can be administered by a clinican or trained interviewer in a semi-structured fashion. In general, the ratings depend on the child's and parent's report; however, the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. Rate the characteristics of each item over the prior week up until, and including, the time of the interview. Scores should reflect the average of each item for the entire week, unless otherwise specified.</description>

    <measure>Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) - Inappropriate Speech</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary outcome assessment used two time points, baseline and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Subscale assessing echolalia &amp; other odd speech. Higher subscale scores indicate more symptoms. 4 items comprise the subscale, with range of scores from 0-4. Total score range on this subscale is 0 to 16. Scores are averaged to compute overall score. Difference in scores between baseline and week 16 were used as indicator of change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Primary outcome assessment used two time points, baseline and 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The SRS is a 65-item scale used to measure the severity of symptoms in ASD as they occur in natural social settings. The SRS is comprised of 1 Total scale and 5 subscales that generate raw scores that can be converted to standard T-scores (with mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) for gender and rater type; standard scores were selected for use in this study. A total T-score of 76 or higher is considered severe and strongly associated with a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder. A t-score of 60-75 is in the mild to moderate range and considered typical for children with mild or 'high-functioning' ASD, while a T-score of 59 or less suggests an absence of ASD symptoms. A total raw score of &gt;75 were associated with a sensitivity value of .85 and a specificity value of .75 for ASD. Difference in scores between baseline and week 16 were used as an indicator of change.</description>

        <title>Clinical Global Impression -- Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</title>
        <description>The CGI-I assessed the number of participants showing much or very much improvement on the CGI-I scale. This is a summary judgment made by a trained clinician based on observed and reported behaviors of the child compared to baseline. It is a 7-point scale from very much worse (1) to very much improved (7). Chi-square analyses were used to assess change in CHI-I scores (by group, post-test). Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. We used random intercept and trend modeling that accounts for each individual's initial level of symptom severity/functioning and rate of change/time</description>

        <description>Measures expressive &amp; receptive language and total scores in ages birth to 6 years 11 months. The scales generate raw, standard, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores for the total scale were selected for use in this study. Total is average of subscales. Minimum raw score = 0, maximum = 130. Higher scores indicate better language abilities. Mixed-effects regression models via SPSS MIXED determined the main effects attributed to differences by group (BH4 and placebo), time (treated as categorical at levels baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks) and the group-by-time interaction. For the outcome effect, the difference between baseline and 16 weeks was determined as an indicator for change.</description>

Scales generate raw or sum, V-, and age-equivalent scores; raw scores were selected for use in the study. Raw score ranges from 0 to 108 depending on the scale. Total raw scale range is from 0 to 766. Subscale scores are averaged to create the total adaptive behavior composite. Higher subscale scores indicate more skills.

        <description>The C-YBOCS is a scale is designed to rate the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years. It can be administered by a clinican or trained interviewer in a semi-structured fashion. In general, the ratings depend on the child's and parent's report; however, the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. Rate the characteristics of each item over the prior week up until, and including, the time of the interview. Scores should reflect the average of each item for the entire week, unless otherwise specified.</description>

Placebo: Patients will receive a placebo identical in form and dosage to the active drug daily for 16 weeks.</description>

          <title>Children's Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C-YBOCS)</title>
          <description>The C-YBOCS is a scale is designed to rate the severity of obsessive and compulsive symptoms in children and adolescents, ages 6 to 17 years. It can be administered by a clinican or trained interviewer in a semi-structured fashion. In general, the ratings depend on the child's and parent's report; however, the final rating is based on the clinical judgement of the interviewer. Rate the characteristics of each item over the prior week up until, and including, the time of the interview. Scores should reflect the average of each item for the entire week, unless otherwise specified.</description>
          <population>The data was not analyzed secondary to lack of significant findings in the primary outcome measure. Also, limited data collected secondary to the age range of the children we saw.The data cannot now be provided as the research team has since disbanded and it is not possible to reanalyze the data at this time.</population>

        <title>Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)</title>
        <description>The SRS is a 65-item scale used to measure the severity of symptoms in ASD as they occur in natural social settings. The SRS is comprised of 1 Total scale and 5 subscales that generate raw scores that can be converted to standard T-scores (with mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10) for gender and rater type; standard scores were selected for use in this study. A total T-score of 76 or higher is considered severe and strongly associated with a clinical diagnosis of autistic disorder. A t-score of 60-75 is in the mild to moderate range and considered typical for children with mild or 'high-functioning' ASD, while a T-score of 59 or less suggests an absence of ASD symptoms. A total raw score of &gt;75 were associated with a sensitivity value of .85 and a specificity value of .75 for ASD. Difference in scores between baseline and week 16 were used as an indicator of change.</description>
