  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The discontinuation of mechanical ventilation (MV) and the recovery of spontaneous breathing
      can lead to important cardiovascular alterations due to changes in the intrathoracic
      pressure. The autonomic modulation assessed through heart rate variability (HRV) during
      weaning from MV and its impact on cardiorespiratory variables has not been well elucidated
      yet. To evaluate the effect of T-tube (TT) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) during
      weaning from MV on cardiorespiratory variables and heart rate variability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients who had received MV for ≥ 48 hours and who met the criteria for weaning were
      assessed. Two different weaning methods were used and randomization was performed to choose
      one of the following sequences (baseline, PSV, rest, TT; or baseline, TT, rest, PSV). HRV was
      assessed by heart rate spectral analysis during MV, PSV, and TT. Each intervention lasted 30
      minutes and there was a 30-minute rest period between the interventions. At the end of each
      period of time, the following cardiorespiratory variables were analyzed: respiratory rate
      (f), minute ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT),
      peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR) and blood pressure. In the HRV, the
      total spectral power (TP), the low frequency (LF) and the high frequency (HF) components, and
      the ratio between the low/high frequency (LF/HF) components were calculated.
