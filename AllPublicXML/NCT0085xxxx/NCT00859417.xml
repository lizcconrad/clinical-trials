  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The classical surgical treatment of an anterior prolapse is the use of autologous tissue. In
      front of the high rate of recurrences with this technique, the use of synthetic prosthesis
      made their appearance. But the drawback of the use of prosthesis is their tolerability. The
      system Perigee®, a prosthetic kit by trans-obturator way, was designed to obtain high
      efficiency in the correction of the prolapse while reducing the risk of complications. The
      lack of prospective and randomized studies makes difficult to assess the interest. The
      investigators, therefore, have put in place a randomized prospective study seeking the
      evaluation of the system Perigee® compared to the conventional surgical technique.
