      The purpose of this study is to scientifically evaluate the effects (good and bad) of a new
      type of radiation treatment in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after prior
      radiotherapy. The treatment is known as prostate radiosurgery, and is distinguished from
      traditional radiotherapy by the application of smaller, more precisely controlled margins
      around the area targeted for full dose radiation, and far fewer treatments, using a much
      larger dose per treatment.

      This research is being done to see what advantages, if any, prostate radiosurgery may have
      over other salvage treatment methods, including brachytherapy, cryosurgery, high intensity
      focused ultrasound (HIFU), hormonal therapy and radical prostatectomy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1 -
             T3 (AJCC 6th Edition, see Appendix II), NX/N0, M0, following prior prostate
             radiotherapy.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;80.

          -  Greater than 5 year life expectancy

          -  Greater than 2 years since the original course of radiotherapy.

          -  Absence of distant metastases by radiologic or pathologic assessment.

          -  Absence of lymph node involvement by radiologic or pathologic assessment.

          -  Patients must sign a study-specific informed consent form prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Stage T4 disease (AJCC 6th Edition, see Appendix II).

          -  Less than 2 years since the original course of radiotherapy.

          -  Lymph node involvement (N1).

          -  Evidence of distant metastases (M1).

          -  Radical surgery for carcinoma of the prostate

          -  Previous or concurrent cancers other than basal, in situ, or squamous cell skin
             cancers unless disease-free for â‰¥ 5 years.

          -  Major medical or psychiatric illness, which in the investigator's opinion, would
             prevent completion of treatment and would interfere with follow-up.
