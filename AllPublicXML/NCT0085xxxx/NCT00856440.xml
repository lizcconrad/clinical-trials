    <textblock>
      Periodic screening for colon cancer has become the standard of care in individuals over the
      age of 50. In this context, it is generally accepted that colonoscopy is the most sensitive
      modality for the detection of colon cancer and/or pre malignant colon pathology. As currently
      performed, however, colonoscopy requires that stool be eliminated from the colon before the
      examination. If stool remains in the colon, visualization of the bowel will be partially or
      completely impaired and limits the effectiveness of the screening. A number of methods are
      employed for purging the bowel of waste material but they generally involve either
      administration of a lavage (like a flush) solution (such as Colyte or Golytely) or of an
      osmotic laxative (such as sodium phosphate or magnesium citrate). Neither of these approaches
      is uniformly effective in all individuals and neither is without potential complications,
      especially on the kidneys. It is the intent of the proposed research to study the relative
      efficacy and safety of these preparations in both able-bodied individuals as well as people
      with spinal cord injury. To this end, we will randomize these groups to a lavage solution, a
      laxative or a combination of the two prior to a routine, clinically indicated colonoscopy.
      The quality of the preparation will be directly assessed during the colonoscopy and the
      effect of these preparations on kidney function will be determined. We suspect that when it
      comes to preparation for colonoscopy, one shoe does not fit all sizes. The proposed research
      should allow us to determine which form of preparation is least harmful while achieving
      optimal effectiveness.

      Colonoscopy is a routine evaluation for screening of colorectal cancer in people over 50 and
      for those at increased genetic risk. Despite the large number of individuals requiring such
      screening, there has been little randomized, controlled research to determine the relative
      renal safety of oral colon preparation solutions that are used to evacuate the bowel in
      patients with &quot;normal&quot; kidney function, the best frequency of laxative dosing (e.g. 1 day vs.
      2 day), and the quality of the colon cleansing that results from these different approaches.
      Reports of acute renal failure, secondary to nephrocalcinosis, following the commonly used
      oral phosphosoda preparation are increasingly recognized. It is our belief that this project
      will yield clinically relevant information that would have immediate clinical application for
      all persons receiving a colonoscopy. Since preparation for screening colonoscopy involves
      vigorous purging of stool from individuals without GI complaints, it also represents an
      opportunity to study the prevalence of clostridium difficile (C. diff) in this population.
      This may reveal important information regarding the epidemiology of this increasingly
      virulent and common enteric pathogen. A pilot screening program for asymptomatic C. diff, a
      common nosocomial pathogen, may reveal findings of clinical importance for preventing spread
      of this infection, and allow use of presumptive treatment during periods of increased risk.
