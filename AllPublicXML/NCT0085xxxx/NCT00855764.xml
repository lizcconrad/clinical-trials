        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Give written and voluntary informed consent.

          -  Patients with cytologically or histopathologically confirmed head and neck cancer
             (except for thyroid cancer)

          -  Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer pretreated with surgery and/or
             radiotherapy (plus or minus one chemotherapy regimen) and not suitable for further
             radical local treatment or patients with distant metastases who may have received no
             or one chemotherapy regimen

          -  Patients must have measurable disease (lesion(s) with largest diameter of 10 mm or
             more)

          -  Patients with 4 weeks or longer interval from completion of previous therapy. (2 weeks
             for anti-metabolites, Biological Response Modifiers (BRM), Bisphosphonates and brain
             only or bone irradiation /among radiotherapy/). All reversible residual effects of
             previous therapy should have resolved or stabilized to the best degree, as can be
             reasonably expected.

          -  Performance Status of 0 - 2

          -  Patients with normal major organ functions (hematologic, hepatic and renal, etc.) and
             who met listed below requirements at the time of evaluation done within 2 weeks prior
             to the scheduled first drug administration date

          -  Neutrophil count: ≤ 2,000/uL

          -  Platelet count: ≤ 100,000/uL

          -  Hemoglobin: ≤ 9.0g/dL

          -  AST: &lt; 100 IU/L

          -  ALT:&lt; 100 IU/L

          -  Total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Serum creatinine: ≤ 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Patients with expected survival period of at least 2 months or more from study
             initiation.

          -  Men and Women, with age range of 20 years and older to less than 75 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks
             after the study

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Women with a positive pregnancy test on enrollment or prior to study drug

             associated with surrounding edema on CT scan or MRI, or that require concomitant
             therapy with steroids or anti-convulsants

          -  Patients with active second cancer (synchronous second cancer or the disease-free
             interval from the previous second primary cancer to the current cancer is less than 5
             years)

          -  Patients with serious, uncontrolled medical illness (i.e., serious cerebrovascular
             disorders, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus, severe infections or active
             gastric ulcer, etc.), or acute inflammatory disease, etc.

          -  Patients with interstitial pneumonia or pulmonary fibrosis by chest CT-scan or
             clinical symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath or dyspnea)

          -  Patients with body cavity fluid retention which requires treatment (or an
             intervention). However, those who show no re-accumulation of pleural effusion for 2
             weeks or longer without use of chemotherapy drugs (BRM included) after post
             thoracentesis or a chest tube drainage are eligible for enrollment. In addition, those
             with water suction of pericardial effusion shall be ineligible for enrollment

          -  Patients who meet one of the following criteria;

             [AV] block)

          -  Patients with more than grade 1 peripheral neuropathy as graded by the NCI-CTC version
             2.0 criteria

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity due to administration of drugs containing
             polyoxyethylene castor oil (Cremophor EL) (e.g., cyclosporine), or hardened castor oil
             (e.g., vitamin preparations for injection, etc.)

          -  Patients with previous therapy with taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel)
