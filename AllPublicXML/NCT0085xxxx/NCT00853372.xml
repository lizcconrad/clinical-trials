  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety and tolerability of AMG 386 in combination with Sunitinib in subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability, as measured by the incidence of adverse events, dose interruptions due to adverse events, dose reductions of sunitinib during the first 12 weeks of study treatment and significant laboratory abnormalities.</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months after LSE</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of either a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per modified RECIST criteria (responder). A confirmed CR requires 2 consecutive assessments of CR at least 28 days apart. A confirmed PR requires 2 consecutive assessments at least 28 days apart of PR or CR. All subjects that do not meet the criteria for an objective response by the analysis cutoff date will be considered non responders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months after LSE</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) (calculated only for subjects who had an objective response): The time from first confirmed objective response to disease progression or death due to any cause. Subjects not meeting criteria for progression by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months after LSE</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the percentage of subjects with confirmed CR or PR or have stable disease (SD), as defined by modified RECIST (CRs or PRs will be confirmed at least 28 days after the criteria for response are first met).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months after LSE</time_frame>
    <description>The time from enrollment date to date of disease progression (ie, radiographic progression) per the modified RECIST criteria or death. Subjects not meeting criteria for progression by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. Radiological imaging to assess disease status will be performed until subjects develop disease progression. Events of radiographic progression per RECIST 1.0 with modifications that occur after initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy will not be considered PFS events. Deaths occurring after initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy will be considered PFS events. Further details on events and censoring times of PFS are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months after LSE</time_frame>
