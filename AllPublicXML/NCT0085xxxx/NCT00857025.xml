      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as beta-glucan, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of beta-glucan in
      treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility and toxicity of therapy with beta-glucan MM-10-001 in patients
           with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer for which standard
           curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

      Secondary

        -  To explore analysis of the effect of beta-glucan MM-10-001 on the innate immune
           compartment, in particular natural killer cell activation and effector status.

        -  To perform correlatives (cytokine profiling) that will explore the effects of
           beta-glucan MM-10-001 on the cytokine profile of these patients.

        -  To document all clinical responses of these patients after treatment with beta-glucan
           MM-10-001.

        -  To explore potential beta-glucan MM-10-001 dose effects on the patient-reported
           functional status.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beta-glucan MM-10-001 once or twice daily. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for
      natural killer cell activation and effector status and cytokine profiling by flow cytometry.

      Patient-reported functional status is assessed at baseline and periodically during treatment
      by QOL-FACT-L questionnaire.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
