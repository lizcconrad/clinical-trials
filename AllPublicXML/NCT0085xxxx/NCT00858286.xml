  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose with this study is to describe in detail the control or lack of control of
      asthma, based on two different dosing strategies, regular treatment with SERETIDE in a stable
      dosing with short acting beta-2 agonists as needed, or maintenance treatment with SYMBICORT
      and using the same inhaler with SYMBICORT as needed.

      The purpose with this study is to describe in detail the control or lack of control of
      asthma, based on two different dosing strategies. No therapy intervention is made with
      existing prescribed medications (SERETIDE or SYMBICORT), but evaluations outside standard
      care is made by evluations with diary cards, questionnaires, PEF evaluations and spirometry
      which is regarded as the intervention by the Swedish Authorities.
