      There are two major goals of this project:

        1. Comparison of DXA and QCT for diagnosis of bone loss in CKD-5 patients and determination
           of the prevalence of low bone turnover in CKD-5 patients with bone loss.

        2. Identification of the optimal combination of noninvasive tests for definition of the
           turnover component of ROD.

    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Because each method (QCT or DXA) yields a dichotomous response (bone loss: yes or no), the proportion of patients with a bone loss will be compared between the 2 methods by using the McNemar statistic for correlated proportions.</description>

    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>A stepwise logistic model will be used to determine which combination of PTH and bone markers best predicts low bone turnover.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 years or older;

          -  Chronic maintenance dialysis of at least 3 months' duration;

          -  Mental competence;

          -  Willingness to participate in the study;

          -  Calcidiol levels within normal range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy;

          -  Systemic illnesses or organ diseases that may affect bone (except type 1 or type 2
             diabetes mellitus);

          -  Clinical condition that may limit study participation (e.g., unstable angina,
             respiratory distress, infections).

          -  Chronic alcoholism and/or drug addiction;

          -  Participation in a study of an investigational drug during the past 90 days;

          -  Allergy to tetracycline.

          -  Planning to move out of the area within 2 years of the study;

          -  On active transplant list;

          -  Treatment within last 6 months with drugs that may affect bone metabolism (except for
             treatment with calcitriol, vitamin D analogs and/or calcimimetics).

          -  Calcidiol level below the normal range. The current routine clinical practice in our
             dialysis clinics is to check calcidiol status twice yearly and supplement with vitamin
             D according to serum calcidiol levels. It is therefore unlikely that a substantial
             number of patients will be excluded due to this exclusion criterion.
