  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to build a sustainable,community-based outreach program
      using Korean American community health workers (CHWs) to promote breast and cervical
      screening among Korean American women, thereby reducing related morbidity and mortality. The
      study is designed to determine the effectiveness of a health literacy-focused tailored breast
      and cervical cancer control intervention delivered by CHWs.

      The investigators hypothesized that, compared to KA women in the delayed intervention group,
      KA women who receive a health literacy-focused CHW intervention will demonstrate: (1) higher
      levels of adherence to screening for breast and cervical cancer, (2) greater levels of health
      literacy, (3) higher levels of breast and cervical cancer knowledge, and (4) improve
      decisional balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite considerable progress in U.S. cancer control over the past 20 years, certain ethnic
      minority groups continue to experience significant health disparities. Recent immigrants
      including Korean Americans (KA), face an unequal cancer burden related to the significant
      language and cultural barriers they face in attempting to navigate the U.S. healthcare
      system. KA women have the second highest incidence of cervical cancer nationally and are
      experiencing rapid increases in breast cancer incidence. Not only are their breast and
      cervical cancers diagnosed at significantly later stages than those of whites, but they are
      also the least likely racial/ethnic group to receive early breast and cervical cancer
      screening.

      This community-based behavioral intervention is designed 1) to evaluate, in a randomized
      controlled trial, the effects of our health literacy-focused cancer control intervention,
      delivered by trained CHWs, on the primary outcomes: mammography and Papanicolaou(Pap)test
      screening adherence, in a sample of 360 KA women, 2)to test the effects of the proposed
      intervention on the secondary outcomes: level of health literacy, breast and cervical
      knowledge, and decisional balance, in the KA sample.

    <description>The primary outcome variables are self-reported receipt of, or intention to obtain mammography and/or Pap test. Self-reported intention as an outcome variable has been a common practice in the screening literature, since it has been found to be the best predictor of actual screening behavior.Number of participants who adhere to mammography and Pap test during 6 months period will be the primary outcomes.</description>
