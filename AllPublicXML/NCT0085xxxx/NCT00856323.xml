  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to decrease methamphetamine use and concomitant high-risk sexual behaviors
      among methamphetamine-using men who have sex with men (MSM) by combining a biomedical
      intervention with a behavioral intervention. The behavioral intervention will consist of an
      8-week course of contingency management (CM) through which participants will be reinforced
      for testing negative for methamphetamine metabolites during periodic urine analyses. The
      biomedical intervention involves a 28-day course of an antiretroviral drug (Truvada) to be
      administered after an unanticipated HIV risk exposure (i.e., engaging in either receptive or
      insertive anal sex without a condom with someone who is HIV-positive or of unknown status).
      In combining these two interventions, this study seeks to evaluate the combined
      intervention's effects on sexual risk behaviors and methamphetamine use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the baseline, all eligible participants underwent informed consent; completed baseline
      assessments; received rapid HIV testing; provided specimens for syphilis, gonorrhea and
      chlamydia testing; and received a medical examination. Those who reported a high-risk sexual
      or drug exposure episode with an HIV-positive or serostatus-unknown source within the
      preceding 72 hours immediately initiated postexposure prophylaxis. All other participants
      received a 4-day ''starter pack'' of Truvada to be initiated only in the case of a future
      high-risk exposure to HIV. All participants began the voucher-based CM intervention upon
      study entry. For the initial 8 weeks of study conduct, participants presented to the study
      site three times weekly for a urine drug screen for methamphetamine metabolites. Participants
      who provided urine samples that were negative for methamphetamine metabolites earned
      vouchers, which escalated in value for successive negative urine samples. A participant with
      a missing sample or a sample positive for methamphetamine metabolites did not earn vouchers.
      Accrued vouchers were never forfeited and could be redeemed at any time during the study for
      gift certificates or goods or services that promote healthy, pro-social behaviors; vouchers
      could not be redeemed for cash.
