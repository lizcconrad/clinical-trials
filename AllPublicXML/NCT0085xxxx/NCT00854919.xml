      Objective: Although atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) have been found effective in the
      augmentation of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) for treatment-resistant
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in short terms trials, there are few data on the
      effectiveness and safety of these agents in clinical settings over the long term.

      Method: Subjects (n=46) who responded to selective SRIs (SSRIs) in an initial 12-week trial
      were continued on SRI-monotherapy plus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for one year.
      Subjects (n=44) who failed to respond to SSRIs were randomly assigned to one of 3 AAPDs such
      as risperidone and were consecutively treated using SSRI+AAPD combined with CBT for a year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More recently, second-generation atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPD) that modulate both 5-HT
      and DA function, such as risperidone (RIS), olanzapine (OLZ) and quetiapine (QET), have been
      found effective in the augmentation of SSRIs for treatment-resistant OCD.

      Nevertheless, the AAPDs have been associated with common and serious adverse effects, such as
      body weight (BW) gain and metabolic dysregulation. Metabolic dysregulation includes
      glucoregulatory dysfunction and dyslipidemia. Indeed, studies of some AAPD in SSRI-refractory
      OCD patients have similarly reported significant BW gain. AAPD-induced BW gain may influence
      patients' adherence to medication and places them at risk for a broad range of medical
      problems.

      Most work on AAPDs in treatment-refractory OCD has been conducted in the form of short-term
      efficacy studies. There have been fewer studies of the effectiveness, safety, and
      tolerability of these agents in the context of a clinic where CBT is also provided, and where
      treatment is continued for a significant period of time. In the current effectiveness study,
      we sought to examine the response of SSRI-refractory patients to augmentation with AAPDs,
      comparing adverse events in such compared to a control group of SSRI responders.
