  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase I study aimed at identifying safe doses of DMXAA (now known as ASA404) to be
      used in future combination studies with chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-centre randomized, double blind study to further characterize the effect of
      DMXAA on QTc interval, ophthalmic safety and pharmacodynamic effects on tumour blood flow.

      Patients with refractory tumors were to each undergo six doses of treatment at weekly
      intervals, receiving each of six doses of DMXAA (300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400 and 3000 mg/m2)
