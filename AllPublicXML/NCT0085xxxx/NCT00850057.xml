      Primary Objectives

        -  To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Adenovirus-CD154 (Ad-ISF35)
           when it is injected directly into the lymph nodes of patients with CLL or SLL.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine and monitor clinical and biological responses in patients treated with
           injections of Ad-ISF35.

        -  To determine how ISF35 works in CLL/SLL patients' cells.

               -  Massive lymph nodes or nodal clusters (i.e. &gt; 10 cm in longest diameter), or
                  progressive lymphadenopathy OR

               -  Grade 2 or 3 fatigue OR

               -  Progressive lymphocytosis with an increase of ≥ 50% over a 2-month period or an
                  anticipated doubling time of less than 6 months.

               -  Evidence of progressive marrow failure as manifested by the development of, or
                  worsening of, anemia and / or thrombocytopenia.

               -  Autoimmune anemia and / or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to corticosteroid
