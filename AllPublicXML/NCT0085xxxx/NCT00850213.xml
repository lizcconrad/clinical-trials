    <textblock>
      The Redes registry is set up to document the overall clinical performance and costs of the
      Endeavor Resolute coronary stent in a &quot;real life&quot; subject population of 450 patients that
      require a stent in Spain. Primary objectives are the overall cost for patients during initial
      hospitalization and at 1-year follow-up, as well as the MACE rate at 30 days, 6 months and 12
      months post procedure.

          -  Primary or rescue angioplasty.

          -  Subject has one or more drug-eluting stents other than Endeavor Resolute in other
             lesions.
