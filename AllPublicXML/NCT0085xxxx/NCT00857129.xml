  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include approximately 1000 normal births in a county hospital. The mothers are
      randomly assigned to one of three different maternal wards; one run by midwives, one normally
      equipped according to national standards for a county hospital and one prepared for
      complicated births. Endpoints are number of operative births and complications.

    <description>Low risk women with expected normal birth are being Randomized to The Midwife-led Unit, with low amount of intervention, No epidural is offered, no medical augmentation available, unless for the active phase of the second stage. If extended surveillance is necessary or if the birth no longer is considered to be normal and needs to be taken over by a doctor, the woman will be transferred to either the Normal Unit or the Special Unit</description>

    <description>Low-risk women are randomised to this Low-risk maternal unit, The Normal Unit.The unit is organised for low-risk women with expected normal birth. The unit has access to extended surveillance, epidural and operative vaginal deliveries. If extended surveillance is necessary for a woman randomised to this unit, she does not have to be transferred to a higher level of care. Instrumental vaginal deliveries can be carried out at this unit.</description>

    <description>Women with expected normal births are being randomised to this Special birth unit designed to take care of women before, under and after birth. The Special Unit cares for women with extended need for surveillance, but does also handle low-risk women.</description>
