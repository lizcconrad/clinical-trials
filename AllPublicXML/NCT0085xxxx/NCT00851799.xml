  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) guidelines recommend that HIV-infected
      people who have never received anti-HIV therapy be treated with a triple drug regimen
      (commonly called combination antiretroviral therapy, cART). Since the introduction of cART,
      morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected patients has been dramatically reduced. However,
      metabolic, skeletal, and cardiovascular diseases have been increasingly reported among
      HIV-infected patients and may be attributable, in part, to the direct effects of cART. Much
      of our understanding of the development of these diseases, risk factors, and consequences of
      these disorders has been derived from clinical studies of HIV-infected persons receiving
      older antiretroviral agents.

      A5260s was designed to examine the contributions of HIV-disease related factors and impact of
      newer antiretroviral drugs on the development of metabolic (such as blood vessels, blood
      sugar, cholesterol), skeletal, and cardiovascular diseases in people who have never received
      anti-HIV therapy. A5260s is a prospective substudy of a phase III randomized clinical trial
      A5257 (see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00811954). A5257 was designed to look at
      different combinations of anti-HIV drugs that do not contain the medication efavirenz (EFV)
      and how well these drug combinations work to decrease the amount of HIV in the blood and to
      allow immune system recovery in people who have never received anti-HIV therapy. A5257 also
      examined drug tolerability and safety for the various drug combinations.

      A5260s is the optional, metabolic substudy of a phase III, prospective, randomized clinical
      trial (A5257). For complete details about the parent study A5257, please see
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00811954.

      Some participants in study A5257 were asked to participate in substudy A5260s. Not all
      participants were asked since A5260s only took place at a subset of A5257 sites. Participants
      who agreed to participate in substudy A5260s were enrolled at the same time as their
      enrollment in A5257. No interventions were given as part of A5260s, but all A5260s
      participants underwent blood draws, self-administered questionnaire responses (related to
      physical activity and body image), ultrasound scans to measure the thickness of the carotid
      artery in the neck and brachial artery flow mediated dilation in the arm, and computerized
      topography (CT) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans to measure bone mineral
      density and body fat.

      The duration of A5260s study was between 2 and 3 years (96 and 144 weeks), depending on when
      the participant enrolled. The study was designed to enroll a total of 330 participants with
      at least 110 per a group; each group represented a different randomized drug combination as
      defined and assigned by the main study A5257.

      Cohort A: Atazanavir (ATV) + Ritonavir (RTV) + Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (FTC/TDF)

      Cohort B: Raltegravir (RAL) + FTC/TDF

      Cohort C: Darunavir (DRV) + RTV + FTC/TDF

      All participants were asked to return for A5260s clinic visits at weeks 4, 24, 48 96 and 144
      and participated in all clinical evaluations. No clinical evaluation was restricted to a
      subset of A5260s participants. If a participant chose to discontinue participation in the
      substudy, the participant was able to continue in study A5257. However, a participant
      discontinuing participation from A5257 was also removed from A5260s. Additionally, a
      participant's decision to discontinue or switch study drugs in the main study did not impact
      participation and follow-up clinic visits in A5260s.

          <description>HIV-1 RNA was calculated as the geometric mean of the two most recent HIV-1 RNA (log 10 copies/mL) obtained on or before study entry. In the event that these two values differed by more than 1 log10 copy/mL, the outlying value (based on review of all HIV-1 RNA levels available prior to study entry by the study virologist) was excluded with the baseline level determined by the remaining sample. Note that screening HIV-1 RNA values were not used in the calculation of baseline HIV-1 RNA levels.</description>
