  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study (28851) is a long-term follow-up study of subjects enrolled in ATAMS study 28063
      (NCT00642902). The aim of this study is to monitor the safety and tolerability of atacicept
      administered for up to 5 years to subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS).

      This extension study consists of two parts. Part A will be double blind and Part B will be
      open label. During Part A, subjects initially randomized to atacicept will continue to
      receive the atacicept dose to which they have been randomized in study 28063 (ATAMS) once a
      week subcutaneously (under the skin). Subjects randomized to placebo in ATAMS will receive
      atacicept at 150 mg once a week subcutaneously during Part A. Once the results of ATAMS are
      available and the atacicept dose with the best benefit / risk ratio has been identified, all
      subjects will be switched to this dose and will continue the extension study open-label (Part
      B). Throughout the study, subjects and investigators will remain blinded with respect to
      initial and part A treatment allocation/dose.

    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug administration up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date after or on the date of the first DB treatment injection in ATAMS Extension and that occurred anytime after treatment discontinuation, or up to the day before first Rebif® rescue medication injection in ATAMS Extension. A serious TEAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE severity was graded as per Qualitative Toxicity Scale. Local injection site reactions (injection site: pain, redness, itching and swelling) throughout ATAMS Extension, starting after the first trial medication administration. If the subject experienced 1 or more of the above injection site symptoms, these were reported with the AE verbatim term &quot;injection site reaction&quot;. For all randomized subjects, there was an option of rescue treatment with Rebif® for 1 year beginning with the first injection of Rebif®).</description>

    <description>A clinical attack/relapse was defined as the fulfillment of all the following criteria:
Neurological abnormality, either newly appearing or re-appearing, with abnormality specified by both i) neurological abnormality separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical event, and ii) neurological abnormality lasting for at least 24 hours.
Absence of fever or known infection (fever with temperature (axillary, orally, or intra-auriculary) &gt; 37.5°C/99.5 °Fahrenheit).
Objective neurological impairment, correlating with the subject's reported symptoms, defined as either i) increase in at least 1 of the functional systems of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or ii) increase of the total EDSS score. EDSS overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that qualifies disability in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS). It assesses the 8 functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder, cerebral and other) as well as ambulation. EDSS overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MSFC is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure which consists of three sub-tests; Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3(PASAT-3). The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-Hole Peg Test is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Standardized results (Z-scores) of these sub-tests and the overall MSFC Z-score as an average of these three Z-scores was calculated. Higher Z-scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicates an improvement (range -3 to +3).</description>

        <description>TEAEs were defined as AEs with a start date after or on the date of the first DB treatment injection in ATAMS Extension and that occurred anytime after treatment discontinuation, or up to the day before first Rebif® rescue medication injection in ATAMS Extension. A serious TEAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE severity was graded as per Qualitative Toxicity Scale. Local injection site reactions (injection site: pain, redness, itching and swelling) throughout ATAMS Extension, starting after the first trial medication administration. If the subject experienced 1 or more of the above injection site symptoms, these were reported with the AE verbatim term “injection site reaction”. For all randomized subjects, there was an option of rescue treatment with Rebif® for 1 year beginning with the first injection of Rebif®).</description>

EDSS overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized subjects. &quot;N&quot; signifies (total number of subjects analyzed) the number of evaluable subjects for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The MSFC is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure which consists of three sub-tests; Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3(PASAT-3). The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-Hole Peg Test is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Standardized results (Z-scores) of these sub-tests and the overall MSFC Z-score as an average of these three Z-scores was calculated. Higher Z-scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicates an improvement (range -3 to +3).</description>
