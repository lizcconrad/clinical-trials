  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study of AMG 900 will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and dose
      expansion. The dose escalation part of the study is aimed at evaluating the safety,
      tolerability and PK of oral AMG 900 in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Up to 50 subjects
      may be enrolled in dose escalation. The dose expansion part of the study will consist of 42
      subjects in three taxane-resistant tumor types. The dose of AMG 900 will be dependent upon
      data from the dose escalation part of the study

      that G-CSF must be started at day 5, 1 day after the last day of AMG 900 and be continued
      until neutrophiles are &gt; 1000 or until day 12, meaning 2 days before the reinduction.
