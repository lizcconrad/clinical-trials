  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that symptoms and lung function are not sufficient ways to monitor
      asthma control. Therefore, several objective tests have been developed to help asthma control
      monitoring, each having their own shortcomings. We have developed a new test, the hypertonic
      saline cough challenge. In our previous publication this test has proven useful in diagnosing
      asthma. The present study is planned to investigate whether hypertonic saline cough challenge
      could be used to monitor asthma control. A group of steroid-naive asthmatics will be
      recruited. A treatment with inhaled budesonide is started. Asthma control is monitored at
      regular intervals utilising a validated questionnaire. At the same time points, hypertonic
      saline cough challenges will be performed. We will analyse whether changes in the
      responsiveness to the cough challenge reflects the changes in asthma control

    <description>Budesonide is given via inhalation utilising a dry powder inhaler called Easyhaler. The dosage is 400 ug twice daily. The duration of the study is 12 weeks but very probably the patients continue the usage of this drug as a part of their routine clinical management.</description>
