  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study with the goal of determining the costs of nausea and vomiting
      in ambulatory patients after surgery from the US societal perspective.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The direct cost between the end of outpatient surgery and discharge from the hospital will
      include costs of labors and supplies for any outpatient care, physician visits, laboratory
      tests, and prescribed medications, which may be used to treat operation side effects. Based
      on the time and motion study design, the timing of these healthcare activities will be
      collected. The study coordinator will observe the actual time taken for each activity for
      each patient. The observation period will begin after completion of the outpatient surgery.
      The start and end times for each activity performed will be recorded. Therefore, each
      activity and its duration will be concurrently recorded. We will also query patients daily to
      determine additional costs associated with PONV until the third postoperative morning.
