      The purpose of this study is to examine if exercise helps improve cancer-related fatigue.

      Hypothesis: A structured home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program will
      be efficacious in relieving cancer-related fatigue, preventing aerobic and anaerobic
      deconditioning and skeletal muscle wasting, as well as improving inflammatory cytokine
      profiles in breast cancer survivors as well as those receiving radiation treatment.

    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a frequently reported side effect of cancer treatment. Fatigue related to cancer
      and its treatment is different from fatigue occurring in other situations and its specific
      causes have not been identified. Exercise may or may not improve this type of fatigue. The
      purpose of this study is to examine how cancer treatments impact normal lifestyle physical
      activity patterns and participation in physical activity, as well as the ability of a walking
      and progressive resistance exercise program to reduce cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer
      patients. This study also examines if the walking and progressive resistance exercise program
      improves other factors such as quality of life, depression, anxiety, ability to sleep, self
      esteem, cardiovascular fitness, energy expenditure, muscular strength, muscle mass, and
      immune function (as measured by inflammatory cytokines).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a primary diagnosis of breast cancer,

          -  Have a functional capacity rating of 60 or greater on the Karnofsky Performance Scale,
             when assessed by the oncologist (or physician's designee)

          -  Be breast cancer survivor(e.g., surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone
             therapy). Have a life expectancy of &gt;1 year as determined by the patient's oncologist.

          -  Have the approval of their treating physician, study physician(or physician's
             designee) to participate in sub-maximal physiological fitness testing and a low to
             moderate home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program.

          -  Be able to read English.

          -  Be 21 years of age or older.

          -  Give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have bone metastases that preclude participation in an exercise program either due to
             symptoms such as pain or location of bone metastasis.

          -  Have physical limitations (i.e. cardiorespiratory, orthopedic, central nervous system)
             that contraindicate participation in sub-maximal physiological fitness testing, or a
             low to moderate home-based walking and progressive resistance program, as assessed by
             the PAR-Q and radiation oncologist (or physician's designee)

          -  Be identified as in the Active or Maintenance Stage of exercise behavior as assessed
             by the 1-item Exercise Stages of Change Short Form.
