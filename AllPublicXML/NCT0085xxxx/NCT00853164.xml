    <textblock>
      60 eligible subjects will be randomized into one of three study arms 1) aerobic exercise, 2)
      resistance exercise, or 3) usual care. Baseline measurements will be done on all study
      subjects, these measurements include: height, weight, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      for bone mineral density and lean body mass measurements, blood will be taken to measure
      serum free testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), glucose, and insulin levels.
      Fitness will also be evaluated using a graded exercise test. Questionnaires on health and
      personal history will also be completed. Men randomized to the aerobic exercise treatment arm
      will participate in a walking program three times a week for eight weeks. The participants
      will start at 15 minutes per session and increase to a goal of 60 minutes per session. Men
      randomized to the resistance training treatment arm will participate in an eight-week program
      of eight strength training exercises three times per week. Men in the usual care arm will
      receive written materials from the American Cancer Society about coping with cancer, which
      includes information about participation in physical activity. At the end of the eight week
      intervention participants in all three study arms will complete the same questionnaires and
      measurements they completed at baseline.
