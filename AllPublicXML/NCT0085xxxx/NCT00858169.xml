      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. To investigate the wrist joint synovial blood flow intensity and model by quantitative
           three-dimensional (3D) power Doppler ultrasonography (PDUS) in patients with rheumatoid
           arthritis before and after initiation of a new medicine and compare these data with
           routinely used clinical data and laboratory findings, such as pain score, erythrocyte
           sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)

        2. To investigate the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement of quantitative 3D PDUS
           assessment of the vascularity in wrist joints and knee joints using automatic volume
           scan.
