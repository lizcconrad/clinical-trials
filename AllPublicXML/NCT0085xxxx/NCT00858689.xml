    <textblock>
      Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common known inherited form of mental impairment,
      developmental disability and autism. Minocycline is an antibiotic that has recently been used
      to treat the mouse model for Fragile X, and was found to reverse the structural abnormalities
      that are seen their brain cells. The purpose of this research study is to determine if
      minocycline is an effective treatment for patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS).

    <textblock>
      Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common known inherited form of mental impairment and is
      also associated with a range of learning disabilities, neurological problems, such as
      seizures, and behavioural difficulties. For many individuals with FXS, behavioral
      difficulties result in severe problems within the family and community, particularly in the
      form of agitation, temper outbursts, hyperactivity, and aggression. These problems often
      require a variety of psychopharmacological and behavioural approaches. Although a variety of
      medications can be helpful in FXS there are no targeted interventions based on molecular
      abnormalities that have been studied. Defects in dendritic spine formation have been found in
      the brains of patients with Fragile X, suggesting these structures may represent an
      anatomical and physiological basis for the cognitive deficits associated with this disorder.
      Recent research has suggested that minocycline may have a specific benefit in the treatment
      of FXS. Minocycline is an antibiotic that has been found to inhibit the activity of matrix
      metallo-proteinase-9 (MMP-9), which is up-regulated in the hippocampus of FMR1 KO (Fragile X
      Mental Retardation-1 Knockout) mice and may be responsible for the immature dendritic spine
      profile of hippocampal neurons. Minocycline has recently been used to treat the FXS KO mouse
      model for Fragile X, and was found to rescue this abnormal phenotype by inducing the
      formation of mature dendritic spines in FMR1 KO hippocampal neurons, both in vitro and in
      vivo. Minocycline treated FXS KO mice also performed significantly better in the elevated
      maze, a cognitive performance test that measures activity and anxiety.

      Exciting preclinical effects of minocycline with regard to the FXS disease model have led to
      this pilot proposal, which is designed to generate preliminary data that could be used to
      support a larger clinical trial.

      The overall hypothesis is that minocycline is a specific molecular targeted treatment for FXS
      that will display beneficial effects on disruptive behaviour and possibly other associated
      features of FXS via a reduction in MMP-9 activity.

    <description>The 15-item Irritability Scale includes questions about aggression, self-injury, tantrums, agitation, and unstable mood on a scale of 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating greater severity. This scale has been successfully used in previous medication studies in children with autism and in patients with FXS and in a controlled trial of ampakine CX516 in FXS. All ABC subscales showed good reliability when used by parents and caregivers of individuals with FXS to assess behavior in the CX516 study NCT00054730, and yielded intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of 0.7-0.9.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of FXS by clinical evaluation and confirmed by FMR1-DNA testing with
             presence of full mutation or mosaicism for the full mutation. Prior DNA testing
             reports will be accepted, when available.

          -  Age between 13 to 35 years inclusive at the time of informed consent.

          -  Male or female

          -  CGI-Severity Score of 4 or greater, indicative of moderate or greater severity of
             behavioural problems. This is a 7-point scale of clinical global impression of
             severity that the clinician fills out after considering all the available information
             on the patient, including the parent history, the examination in clinic, reports from
             the school and other sources.

          -  Score of 9 or greater on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist - Irritability Scale (top
             50th %-tile). The ABC is a global behaviour checklist implemented for the measurement
             of drug and other treatment effects in mentally impaired individuals. It is made up of
             5 empirically derived dimensions including irritability, lethargy/withdrawal,
             inappropriate speech, hyperactivity, and stereotypic behaviour based on 58 items that
             describe various behavioural problems.

          -  Availability of parent and/or caregiver for all clinic visits and assessments.

          -  English language fluency and reading level of 6th grade or greater in one caregiver.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to minocycline.

          -  Kidney disease or elevated renal function tests.

          -  Liver disease or elevated liver function tests.

          -  Participants with neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of systemic lupus erythematosus or screening anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titre
             of &gt;1:40, as minocycline may cause a lupus-like reaction.

          -  Individuals who do not have a mother or caregiver who is willing to participate in the
             clinic visits.

          -  Individuals who are pregnant or at risk to become pregnant, specifically sexually
             active females will be excluded.

          -  Presence of persistent psychotic symptoms

          -  Subjects with symptom severity likely judged to endanger personal safety or safety of
             others.

          -  History of systemic lupus erythematosus or screening anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titre
             of &gt;1:40, as minocycline may cause a lupus-like reaction.

        <title>Change From Baseline of ABC Irritability Subtest Score at 8 Weeks</title>
        <description>The 15-item Irritability Scale includes questions about aggression, self-injury, tantrums, agitation, and unstable mood on a scale of 0 to 45 with higher scores indicating greater severity. This scale has been successfully used in previous medication studies in children with autism and in patients with FXS and in a controlled trial of ampakine CX516 in FXS. All ABC subscales showed good reliability when used by parents and caregivers of individuals with FXS to assess behavior in the CX516 study NCT00054730, and yielded intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of 0.7-0.9.</description>
