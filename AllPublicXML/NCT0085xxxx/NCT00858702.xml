    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy and safety of the combination of Calcium
      Channel Blockers (CCBs)(of the dihydropyridine class) or Diuretics (of the thiazide class)
      and olmesartan medoxomil in essential hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is not
      adequately controlled with olmesartan medoxomil alone

    <description>Drug-related adverse events are adverse events(AEs) as determined by the Investigator that can not be denied to be related to the study drugs. The relationship between adverse events and drugs were determined by the Investigator based on his/her clinical judgement. Factors used in determining relatedness included, but are not limited to, the medical history of the participant, use of concomitant medication, and the time course from drug administration to AE occurence.</description>

        <description>Drug-related adverse events are adverse events(AEs) as determined by the Investigator that can not be denied to be related to the study drugs. The relationship between adverse events and drugs were determined by the Investigator based on his/her clinical judgement. Factors used in determining relatedness included, but are not limited to, the medical history of the participant, use of concomitant medication, and the time course from drug administration to AE occurence.</description>
