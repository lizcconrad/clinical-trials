  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of memantine on cognition and
      behavioural symptoms in outpatients with moderate to severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Memantine is a moderate affinity, uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
      antagonist. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that memantine can decrease the neuronal
      toxicity associated with excessive glutamate release and calcium overload in neurons. Results
      from clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have
      demonstrated memantine's efficacy and safety by showing positive treatment effects on
      cognitive, global and functional decline.

      This 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study examines the
      effect of memantine 20 mg, administered once daily, on cognitive and behavioural symptoms in
      outpatients diagnosed with moderate to severe AD and significant psychopathology.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Memantine on Behavioural Symptoms in Outpatients With Moderate to Severe Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type Using the NPI - 12 Items Version Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score.
NPI is a validated scale that assesses behavioural disturbances in patients with dementia. The 12 item version consists of 10 behavioural and 2 neurovegetative areas. It provides both a total score as well as scores for a number of sub-scales. The frequency, severity and caregiver distress for each domain are measured. The NPI is based upon responses obtained from the caregiver. The total score is from 0 to 144. A higher score reflects more frequency and severity of the disturbances.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Memantine on Cognition in Outpatients With Moderate to Severe Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type Using the SIB Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) total score.
SIB is a validated scale used to assess cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Items are single words or one-step commands combined with gestures. Nine domains are assessed, and the total score is between 0 and 100. A lower total score reflects the loss of cognitive function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Memantine on Global Condition Using CIBIC-plus.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus Version (CIBIC-plus). Improvement evaluated with reference to Baseline.
CIBIC-plus is a global rating that is derived through an independent, comprehensive interview with the patient and caregiver by a rater who is barred from knowledge of all other psychometric test scores conducted as part of this protocol as well as from reported safety data. The rating is made on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = marked improvement&quot; to &quot;7 = marked worsening&quot;. A score of &quot;4&quot; indicates no change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Memantine on Functioning Using ADCS-ADL - 19 Items Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) 19-item version total score.
ADCS-ADL- 19 items version for moderate to severe AD will measure patient's functioning. This battery of ADL questions is used here to measure the functional capabilities of patients with dementia. The inventory is done by interviewing a person in close contact with the patient and covers the most usual and consistent performance of the patient over the preceding 4 weeks. Total score is from 0 to 54. The higher score, the lower impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Memantine on Functioning Using CMAI - Long Form Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) - Long Form total score.
CMAI - Long Form looks specifically at agitated behaviour in patients with cognitive impairment. It is a seven-point rating scale assessing the frequency of up to 29 agitated behaviours, ranging from &quot;1 = Never&quot; to &quot;7 = Several times an hour&quot;. Rating is based on responses obtained from interviews with the caregiver. The total score ranges from 29 to 203, with a higher score reflecting more frequent behavioural disturbances.</description>

          <title>NPI: Baseline Total Score</title>
          <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a validated scale that assesses behavioural disturbances in patients with dementia. The 12 item version consists of 10 behavioural and 2 neurovegetative areas. It provides both a total score as well as scores for a number of sub-scales. The frequency, severity and caregiver distress for each domain are measured. The NPI is based upon responses obtained from the caregiver. The total score is from 0 to 144. A higher score reflects more frequency and severity of the disturbances.</description>

        <title>Efficacy of Memantine on Global Condition Using CIBIC-plus.</title>
        <description>Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus Version (CIBIC-plus). Improvement evaluated with reference to Baseline.
CIBIC-plus is a global rating that is derived through an independent, comprehensive interview with the patient and caregiver by a rater who is barred from knowledge of all other psychometric test scores conducted as part of this protocol as well as from reported safety data. The rating is made on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = marked improvement&quot; to &quot;7 = marked worsening&quot;. A score of &quot;4&quot; indicates no change.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) 19-item version total score.
ADCS-ADL- 19 items version for moderate to severe AD will measure patient's functioning. This battery of ADL questions is used here to measure the functional capabilities of patients with dementia. The inventory is done by interviewing a person in close contact with the patient and covers the most usual and consistent performance of the patient over the preceding 4 weeks. Total score is from 0 to 54. The higher score, the lower impairment.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline on the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) - Long Form total score.
CMAI - Long Form looks specifically at agitated behaviour in patients with cognitive impairment. It is a seven-point rating scale assessing the frequency of up to 29 agitated behaviours, ranging from &quot;1 = Never&quot; to &quot;7 = Several times an hour&quot;. Rating is based on responses obtained from interviews with the caregiver. The total score ranges from 29 to 203, with a higher score reflecting more frequent behavioural disturbances.</description>
