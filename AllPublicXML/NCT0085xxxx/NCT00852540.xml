  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide further evidence of the clinical and bacteriological
      efficacy of retapamulin in the treatment of subjects with SITL or impetigo due to MRSA.
      Subjects aged 2 months and older will be treated with either topical retapamulin for 5 days
      or oral linezolid for 10 days. The primary endpoint is the clinical response at follow-up
      (7-9 days after the end of therapy) in subjects who have a MRSA infection at baseline. The
      primary population is the per-protocol MRSA population. It is anticipated that approximately
      500 subjects may be enrolled in order to obtain approximately 105 subjects who have a
      baseline MRSA infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, multicenter, comparative study
      in subjects 2 months of age and older with SITL (including secondarily-infected lacerations,
      sutured wounds and abrasions) or impetigo (bullous and non-bullous) due to MRSA. A laceration
      or sutured wound cannot exceed 10 cm in length with surrounding erythema not extending more
      than 2 cm from the edge of the lesion. Abrasions cannot exceed 100 cm2 in total area, or up
      to a maximum of 2% total body surface area for subjects &lt;18 years of age, with surrounding
      erythema not extending more than 2 cm from the edge of the abrasion. Subjects with impetigo
      can have up to 10 lesions and the infected lesion(s) must not be more than 100 cm2 in area
      (or up to a maximum of 2% total body surface area for subjects &lt;18 years of age), must not
      require surgical intervention and must be able to be appropriately treated with a topical
      antibiotic.

      There are five study visits occurring over a 17-19 day period. At the baseline visit (Visit
      1, day 1), subjects will be randomized to receive retapamulin (plus oral placebo) or
      linezolid (plus placebo ointment) in a 2:1 ratio. Retapamulin is applied twice daily for 5
      days, and linezolid is dosed, depending on subject age, either twice or three times daily for
      10 days. The on-therapy, end of therapy and follow-up visits are staggered due to the
      difference in duration of the treatment regimens. Subjects will be monitored and clinically
      evaluated at all postbaseline visits.

      Randomization will be center-based and stratified by age (&lt;5 years, ≥5 to &lt;12 years, ≥12
      years), performed using an appropriate Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS), an automated
      telephone system. The block size will remain confidential. Subjects are considered to have
      completed the study if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, are considered compliant
      with study medication, and attend all study visits as defined by the protocol.

          <title>Retapamulin Ointment, 1% (Weight/Weight) Plus Oral Placebo</title>
          <description>Retapamulin ointment was administered topically twice daily (BID) for 5 days. The ointment formulation was to be applied to the infected lesion(s) at a dose of approximately 10 milligrams (mg) per centimeter squared (cm^2). Placebo was to be dosed, depending on participant age, either BID or three times a day (TID) for 10 days. Placebo oral suspension and oral tablet were formulated to appear identical to the linezolid formulations. Adolescent and adult participants (&gt;=12 years of age) were dosed BID with 600 mg placebo tablets, pediatric participants 5 to 11 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 milliliters (ml)/kilogram (kg) BID, and pediatric participants less than 5 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 ml/kg TID.</description>

        <description>Eradication is the elimination of BL pathogens. Presumed eradication and presumed improvement are clinical outcomes of success or improvement, respectively, such that no culture was obtained due to lack of culturable material, secondary to adequate clinical response, and is documented in the electronic Case Report Form. Persistence is defined as BL pathogens still being present. Presumed persistence is defined as a participant that is a clinical failure with no obtained culture. &quot;Unable to determine&quot; was used if no determination of BL pathogen microbiological response could be made.</description>

The ointment formulation was to be applied to the infected lesion(s) at a dose of approximately 10 milligrams (mg) per centimeter squared (cm^2). Placebo was to be dosed, depending on participant age, either BID or three times a day (TID) for 10 days. Placebo oral suspension and oral tablet were formulated to appear identical to the linezolid formulations. Adolescent and adult participants (&gt;=12 years of age) were dosed BID with 600 mg placebo tablets, pediatric participants 5 to 11 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 milliliters (ml)/kilogram (kg) BID, and pediatric participants less than 5 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 ml/kg TID.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Therapeutic Response at Follow-up</title>
          <description>Therapeutic response is defined as the combined clinical and microbiological response. Therapeutic response iss a measure of the overall efficacy response, and a therapeutic success refers to participants who had been deemed both a “clinical success” and a “microbiological success.&quot; All other combinations (other than “clinical success” + “microbiological success”) were deemed failures for therapeutic response.</description>

        <description>The investigator evaluated skin infections by grading the infected lesion for exudate (a fluid that leaks out of blood vessels into surrounding tissue)/pus, crusting, erythema (redness of the skin)/ inflammation (E/I), tissue warmth, tissue edema (swelling), itching, and pain, according to the Skin Infection Rating Scale. All parameters were graded on a scale of 0 (absent) to 6 (severe). The total score is calculated by summing the individual scores from the 7 parameters; the total score ranges from 0 to 42.</description>

            <description>Retapamulin ointment was administered topically twice daily (BID) for 5 days. The ointment formulation was to be applied to the infected lesion(s) at a dose of approximately 10 milligrams (mg) per centimeter squared (cm^2). Placebo was to be dosed, depending on participant age, either BID or three times a day (TID) for 10 days. Placebo oral suspension and oral tablet were formulated to appear identical to the linezolid formulations. Adolescent and adult participants (&gt;=12 years of age) were dosed BID with 600 mg placebo tablets, pediatric participants 5 to 11 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 milliliters (ml)/kilogram (kg) BID, and pediatric participants less than 5 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 ml/kg TID.</description>

          <title>Retapamulin Ointment, 1% (Weight/Weight) Plus Oral Placebo</title>
          <description>Retapamulin ointment was administered topically twice daily (BID) for 5 days. The ointment formulation was to be applied to the infected lesion(s) at a dose of approximately 10 milligrams (mg) per centimeter squared (cm^2). Placebo was to be dosed, depending on participant age, either BID or three times a day (TID) for 10 days. Placebo oral suspension and oral tablet were formulated to appear identical to the linezolid formulations. Adolescent and adult participants (&gt;=12 years of age) were dosed BID with 600 mg placebo tablets, pediatric participants 5 to 11 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 milliliters (ml)/kilogram (kg) BID, and pediatric participants less than 5 years of age were dosed with oral suspension at 0.5 ml/kg TID.</description>
