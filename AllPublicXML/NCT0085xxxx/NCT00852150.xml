    <textblock>
      The modified Lanza scale (Lanza FL, 1984) has been widely utilized to grade the degree of
      gastritis and duodenitis. However, the inter-rater or intra-rater reproducibility of this
      scale has never been validated. As a quality improvement program, it is important to study
      the reproducibility of the scale between different operators and the operators himself.

      Method: During upper endoscopic examinations, one investigator performed the procedure and
      the second investigator look at the endoscopic image. The degree of gastritis and duodenitis
      is graded. The results of the grading are blinded to the other investigator.

      The endoscopic video is stored for reassessment to determine the intra-rater reliability. The
      patient identifier is stored in serial number. The investigator will not retrieve the report
      of the first assessment during the second assessment.
