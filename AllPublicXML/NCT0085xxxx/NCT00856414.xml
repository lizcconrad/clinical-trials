    <measure>The First Visit Onset of Efficacy as Measured by Physician Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The first visit onset of efficacy as measured by physician assessment. Onset is determined by a yes/no answer to the question &quot;Since injecting the patient, have you noticed any effect on the appearance of the patient's frown lines (lines between the eyebrows)?&quot; at days 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14.</description>

    <measure>Average Subject Assessment Score in Improvement of Appearance of Frown Lines</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Average subject assessment score in improvement of appearance of frown lines (lines between the eyebrows) as measured by a 7-point scale (1=very much improved and 7=very much worse)on a daily basis. The average scores over the 1st diary week (1-7 days) and the 2nd diary week (8-14 days) are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Satisfaction as Measured by Facial Line Outcome (FLO) Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in patient satisfaction as measured by FLO questionnaire comprised of 11 items that assess subject's perceptions about specific aspects of their facial lines for the previous 7 days. Each question is scored on a 11-point scale (0=not at all, 5=somewhat, 10=very much) and the sums are converted to the total FLO score. The minimum total FLO score is 0 (worst) and the maximum total FLO score is 100 (best). The total FLO score was calculated at baseline and Day 14. A positive number change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Reporting Self-Perception of Age (SPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients reporting their SPA. SPA is measured by a questionnaire. Patients were asked to compare their facial appearance to their current age. Response options were &quot;Looking younger&quot;, &quot;Looking current age&quot;, and &quot;Looking older&quot;. Results for each response are presented for Baseline and Day 14.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Satisfaction as Measured by Facial Line Outcome (FLO) Questionnaire Score</title>
        <description>Change from baseline in patient satisfaction as measured by FLO questionnaire comprised of 11 items that assess subject's perceptions about specific aspects of their facial lines for the previous 7 days. Each question is scored on a 11-point scale (0=not at all, 5=somewhat, 10=very much) and the sums are converted to the total FLO score. The minimum total FLO score is 0 (worst) and the maximum total FLO score is 100 (best). The total FLO score was calculated at baseline and Day 14. A positive number change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
