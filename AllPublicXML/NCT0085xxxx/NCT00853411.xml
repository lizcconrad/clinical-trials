  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a clinical syndrome that is well recognized by health care practitioners, yet
      asthma pathogenesis still remains poorly understood. Asthma affects approximately 20 million
      Americans, who suffer around 5,000 deaths annually. More than 70% of people with asthma also
      suffer from allergies. Although many advances in understanding the pathophysiology of asthma
      have been made in the past few decades, more studies are necessary to achieve a more thorough
      understanding of asthma at the cellular and molecular level.

      The majority of murine models suggest asthma and &quot;allergic&quot; responses involve activation of
      Th2 cytokine pathways, including IL-4 and -13. Similarly in humans, several lines of evidence
      support a large role for Th2 adaptive immunity. These include the large majority of asthmatic
      patients with atopy; the measurement of increased amounts of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4
      and IL-13 in the airways and sputum of mild asthma; and most recently, the observed efficacy
      of anti-IgE therapy in &quot;allergic&quot; asthma. However, other data, including the large numbers of
      subjects with atopy and no asthma, suggest Th2 adaptive responses are insufficient to explain
      many aspects of asthma. Whether and how innate and adaptive immune pathways interact in human
      asthma is not clear, with few studies beginning to address these interactions in vitro and in
      vivo.

      For this reason, the investigators of this study would like to prospectively enroll patients
      with known asthma and follow them through an asthma exacerbation, while treating them with a
      standardized protocol. Over six week's duration, the investigators would like to study
      patients by collecting physiologic data such as spirometry, and biologic material in the form
      of sputum, nasal scraping, venous blood, exhaled breath and sputum. It is our aim to fully
      characterize the impact of the prostaglandin/cycloygenase/eicosanoid pathway as it relates to
      asthma exacerbation and recovery.

      Completion of this study in human asthma may provide new mechanistic insights into how
      relationships between innate and adaptive immune responses influence the course of an asthma
      exacerbation. The information obtained from this research and the corresponding studies may
      lead to innovative medical therapies and insight into the role of the epithelium and its
      interactions with both innate and adaptive immunity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adults (age 18 and older) with moderate-severe persistent asthma identified by
             their physicians at the Comprehensive Lung Center and UPMC network physicians, and
             those individuals self-referred to the asthma research center will be considered for
             enrollment.

          -  All subjects will be involved in the research design first by participating in
             clinical testing to characterize the absence of any respiratory disease and the
             severity of asthma.

          -  Clinical testing will include:

               -  spirometry

               -  methacholine challenge (when necessary for diagnosis)

               -  allergy testing

               -  nitric oxide monitoring.

          -  These tests will be performed as part of the research design on all adult subjects
             ages 18-60.

          -  Only patients on inhaled corticosteroids (CS) regularly at doses of &gt;200
             micrograms/day (fluticasone or equivalent) will be entered into the trial. There is no
             upper limit of CS dose.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any of the following will exclude a patient from study enrollment:

               -  Subjects with mental handicaps

               -  Subjects with obvious lower respiratory tract bacterial infection (pneumonia)

               -  Subjects who are unable to provide consent directly and for whom an appropriate
                  legal representative cannot be found to provide consent

               -  Subjects who have previously indicated that they do not wish to be enrolled in
                  this study.

               -  A greater than five pack year history of smoking or current smoking.

               -  A prior diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction, cystic fibrosis or chronic
                  obstructive pulmonary disorder as well as any other lung disease besides asthma,
                  or any coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes or renal failure that is
                  not well-controlled as deemed by the principal investigator.

               -  Use of the 5 lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton

               -  Regular use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (intermittent use
                  will be allowed, but patients will be asked to take acetaminophen while in the
                  exacerbation phase of the trial if anti-pyretic/analgesic medication is required.
