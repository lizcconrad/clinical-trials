  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Libman-Sacks endocarditis (inflammation of
      the heart valves) is the cause of neuropsychiatric manifestations (stroke, transient ischemic
      attacks, cognitive dysfunction, seizures, acute confusional state, or psychosis) in patients
      with systemic lupus erythematosus.

      Hypothesis of the study: Libman-Sacks endocarditis (especially valve vegetations or &quot;small
      valve growths&quot;) generate macro (large) and micro (tiny) emboli that occlude the medium and
      small cerebral vessels resulting in altered perfusion, ischemic brain injury, and major NPSLE
      (stroke, TIA, seizures, cognitive dysfunction, acute confusional state, or psychosis).

      Specific Aim 1: To determine cross-sectionally in SLE subjects the effects of valve
      vegetations detected by TEE on the presence of active cerebral microemboli, altered
      perfusion, ischemic brain lesions, and NPSLE. Findings in SLE patients will be compared to
      those in controls.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine longitudinally in patients with new or recurrent NPSLE and
      during remission whether valve vegetations, active cerebral microemboli, and abnormal
      cerebral perfusion improve, or normalize when compared to baseline data in patients without
      NPSLE or matched controls.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine cross-sectionally in SLE subjects the presence of active
      cerebral microemboli, altered brain perfusion, brain injury, and NPSLE in relation to other
      valve abnormalities, such as valve thickening or valve regurgitation, in addition to or
      independently of valve vegetations; and to determine longitudinally these relationships in
      patients with NPSLE. Findings in SLE patients will be compared to baseline data in patients
      without NPSLE or matched controls.

      Our SLE/NPSLE cohort of &gt;400 subjects and our extensive cardiac and neuroimaging experience
      with TEE and MR-based techniques are essential resources for this study. We will integrate
      inflammatory and hemostatic parameters with multiple imaging modalities to investigate the
      causal connection between valve vegetations and the generation of microemboli and perfusion
      abnormalities, which then result in brain injury and NPSLE. A causal connection of valve
      vegetations to brain injury and NPSLE would result in a fundamental shift in the
      understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy of Libman-Sacks endocarditis and
      NPSLE. These findings may extend to other inflammatory diseases associated with valve disease
      and complicated with central nervous system disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diagnosis of SLE according to the American Rheumatology Association
             independent of gender or ethnicity and recruited from the Rheumatology Clinics at the
             University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center

          -  Patients (&gt; 18 and &lt; 60 years old) with new or recurrent major NPSLE

          -  Healthy volunteers based on history and physical examination

          -  Because of conscious sedation and the MR aspects of the study, women of childbearing
             potential who agree to participate will require to be on contraception therapy, had
             undergone an sterilization procedure, or have a negative pregnancy test for their
             inclusion in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (as defined by NIH) will be excluded because the neurocognitive tests are
             standardized for individuals 18 or older. In New Mexico, adulthood is legally defined
             as 18 years old. Therefore, inclusion of subjects &lt;18 years old would invalidate the
             results of neurocognitive testing. Moreover, the number of children below 18 with SLE
             is so low in our population as to not provide a statistically viable result.

          -  Subjects older than 60 years will also be excluded because their high prevalence and
             incidence of aging related valve and brain pathology and neurocognitive dysfunction.

          -  Pregnant women will not be studied because of the need of conscious sedation during
             TEE and the MR aspects of the study. Women of childbearing potential who agree to
             participate and are not on contraception therapy or have not undergone an
             sterilization procedure will require a negative pregnancy test before their inclusion
             in the study.

          -  Patients with known or suspected valve or cardiac disease unrelated to SLE such as
             rheumatic valve disease, active or healed infective endocarditis, congenital bicuspid
             aortic valves, myxomatous mitral valves with prolapse, and those with prosthetic
             valves and/or sustained atrial fibrillation or flutter will be excluded.

          -  Patients with a known cardiac substrate for embolism (LV or LA thrombi, LV aneurysm,
             LV ejection fraction &lt;40% will be excluded on enrollment, but the development of these
             complications during the study will be noted and considered as a separate variable.

          -  Patients with non-SLE related cardiovascular or CNS disease such as congenital
             hypercoagulability syndromes, hypertensive encephalopathy, CNS infection, metabolic
             disturbances, hepatic failure, uncontrolled diabetes, or patients who are medicated
             with neuroleptic drugs.

          -  Patients with serious medical illness unsuitable for undergoing TEE and MRI scanning.

          -  Patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

          -  Patients with contraindications to esophageal intubation (i.e. esophageal stricture or
             esophageal varices).

          -  Patients at risk for hazard due to magnetic fields will be excluded. In critically ill
             patients TEE will be postponed until medically stable. Patients with supratherapeutic
             INR (&gt;3.5) will not undergo TEE until INR &lt;3.5. 11)

          -  Patients without NPSLE on warfarin at the entry phase of the study.

          -  History of head trauma in the form of concussion or contusion.
