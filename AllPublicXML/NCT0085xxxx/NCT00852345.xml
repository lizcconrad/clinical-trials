  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clofazimine has shown effectiveness in the treatment of leprosy for many years. The World
      Health Organization and the National Hansen's Disease Program consider clofazamine to be
      standard therapy for treatment of multibacillary leprosy. In recent years, the availability
      of the drug has become limited and is currently available only under a research protocol and
      is considered &quot;investigational.&quot; Use of Clofazamine in patients presenting with lepromatous
      leprosy is necessary for patients exhibiting nerve involvement or lesions resistant to other
      therapies. This drug will be used prospectively for patients who require treatment of leprosy
      as deemed appropriate by a Kaiser Permanente Southern California physician.
