    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of
      an experimental drug called rilonacept in subjects with gout who are on urate-lowering
      therapy. Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 20 weeks. Rilonacept is
      being studied for use in preventing gout flares in subjects on urate-lowering therapy.

    <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the administration of first dose of study drug up to 35 days after the last dose of study drug). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>

    <description>A gout flare was defined as participant reported acute articular pain typical of a gout attack that required treatment with an anti-inflammatory therapeutic: had at least 3 of the following 4 signs or symptoms: joint swelling, tenderness, redness, and pain and with at least 1 of the following: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of motion, joint warmth or other symptoms similar to a prior gout flare. Number of gout flares per participant was reported for this outcome measure. For drop-outs, only flares occurred before Day 112 were counted, regardless whether the flares occurred during the treatment period or not.</description>

        <description>Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received investigational medicinal product (IMP) was considered an AE without regard to possibility of causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during on-treatment period (time from the administration of first dose of study drug up to 35 days after the last dose of study drug). A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. Any TEAE included participants with both serious and non-serious AEs.</description>
