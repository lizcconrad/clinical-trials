  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) can be a serious complication. The development of
      therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of this condition requires the
      identification of subgroup of patients with the greatest incidence of POCD. Several
      retrospective analyses have raised the possibility that surgery is a risk factor for the
      accelerated progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, there is increasing evidence
      that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Major surgery can be
      associated with a profound systemic inflammatory response. Consequently, it is reasonable to
      suggest that there is a link between major surgery and the postoperative development of AD in
      patients who are already at high risk for this complication, e.g. the elderly with mild
      cognitive impairment. In addition, there are several laboratory investigations that suggest
      that anesthetic agents increase amyloid peptide levels as well as enhance oligomerization of
      these proteins. The significance of these findings, however, is unknown. This clinical study
      seeks to correlate perioperative inflammatory responses, perioperative changes in
      amyloid-beta protein levels (markers of AD) with neurocognitive and functional outcome in the
      elderly who are at risk for POCD. This knowledge does not exist, but is essential in the
      effort to plan perioperative care that can reduce the incidence of POCD as well as improve
      functional recovery.

      We will recruit 50 patients 65 years and older scheduled for spine surgery. The design
      utilizes prospective serial assessments. The enrolled 50 surgical subjects will be evaluated
      preoperatively and postoperatively over 6 time-points (preoperatively, inta-op, post op day
      1, post op day 7, three months and six months) using a widely accepted set of neurocognitive
      tests, multiple indices of functional recovery, as well as blood tests for plasma biomarkers
      of inflammation and β-amyloids. Enrollees will be divided in 2 groups: 25 patients with mild
      cognitive impairment (diagnosed by clinical assessment) and 25 normal elderly patients.

      The definition of normal elderly includes: 1). Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) &lt; 3 and
      Mini-Mental Exam Score (MMSE) &gt;27; 2). Performance on neurocognitive testing (including
      memory) that is within 1.5 Standard Deviation (SD) of the age matched normative data; 3). The
      informant interview confirming no functional impairment in the subject. The definition of MCI
      includes: self-reported memory and functional complains, a history of memory decline with
      functional changes that are corroborated by a knowledgeable informant, and a clinical
      interview resulting in a GDS=3 or higher and MMSE=26 or lower.

      Serum and plasma will be collected and stored at baseline, intra-operatively, and one day
      post-operative for analysis of markers of inflammation. Plasma will be collected and stored
      at baseline, three months, and six months for analysis of Beta Amyloid levels. DNA will be
      collected and stored at baseline for analysis of Apolipoprotein E.
