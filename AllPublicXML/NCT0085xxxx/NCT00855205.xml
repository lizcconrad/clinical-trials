  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a inflammatory disease affecting many parts of the body, especially the lungs.
      While most patients do well, there is a group of patients who require continuous doses of
      prednisone or other drugs. The current study will determine the role of Rituximab as new
      agent for patients with refractory disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory pulmonary sarcoidosis will be eligible for participation in this
      open label trial of Rituximab as additional therapy. The study will evaluate the efficacy of
      rituximab in improving the symptoms and functional capacity in patients with chronic
      sarcoidosis with pulmonary involvement who are symptomatic despite current treatment.
