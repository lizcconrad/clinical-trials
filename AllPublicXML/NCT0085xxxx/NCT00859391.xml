      This is a Phase 0, Double-blind study that will assess the effect of in vitro treatment of
      gluten with ALV003 or with placebo when ingested by CD Subjects.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of gluten treated with ALV003
      vs placebo:

        -  The clinical response by symptom measurement before and after oral challenge

        -  The immune response measured by ELISPOT testing and serology The secondary objective of
           the study is to

        -  Describe the immunotoxic epitope profile of gluten digests with ALV003 compared with
           placebo

      The enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay is used in vaccine development, cancer research,
      infectious disease diagnosis and monitoring, autoimmune disease studies and allergy and
      transplantation research. The ELISPOT enables determination of the frequency of cytokine
      secreting cells. The ELISPOT is a combination of both immunoassay and bioassay because live
      cells are cultured in plates. This enables a very high sensitivity to detect cytokine
      secretion at a single cell level as secreted cytokine does not diffuse into media but is
      immediately membrane bound.

        The target population for this study is patients with celiac disease with HLA DQ2 phenotype
        who have well controlled celiac disease without significant co-morbidities and are
        previously on a gluten free diet for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-75 years

          -  Well controlled Celiac Disease without flare in symptoms for the past 8 weeks

          -  History of biopsy proven Celiac Disease

          -  Able and willing to complete a symptom diary for 3 days prior and through 3 days post
             gluten challenge

          -  Been on a gluten free diet for 8 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Have normal celiac serology (anti- tTG level of &lt;20 units/mL)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled complications of celiac disease which in the opinion of the Investigator
             would impact their immune response, or pose an increased risk to the subject.
             (example: like type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disease)

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women, subjects of childbearing potential to use two
             methods of contraception

          -  Concomitant medications such as over the counter digestive enzymes, immunosuppressive
             therapies, anticoagulants, NSAIDs. Chronic medications for well-controlled chronic
             conditions are allowed.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal lab values, as determined by the PI:

          -  Untreated or active peptic ulcer disease, esophagitis, motility disorders or any
             gastrointestinal diseases.

          -  Positive pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study drug administration

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to E.coli or E.coli derived proteins
