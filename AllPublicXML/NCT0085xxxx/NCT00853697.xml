  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usually, the male hormone testosterone makes prostate cancer cells grow. Lowering
      testosterone usually stops the growth of prostate cancer. However, after a period of time
      without testosterone, prostate cancer cells learn to grow again.

      You are able to join this trial because your prostate cancer is growing even though you have
      very low levels of testosterone. Studies have shown that high doses of testosterone, in this
      situation, can cause prostate cancer cells to stop growing.

      The investigators did a study several years ago in which the investigators gave high doses of
      testosterone to patients such as yourself. The investigators showed that giving testosterone
      in this situation was safe. The investigators also showed that the investigators could, in
      some cases, make the PSA go down using high-dose testosterone.

      The investigators believe that they can improve this type of treatment by combining
      testosterone with another drug called dutasteride. Dutasteride is another type of hormone. It
      should make testosterone levels rise. The investigators believe that combination of
      dutasteride and testosterone will be more a more powerful regimen against your cancer than
      testosterone alone.

    <description>This trial is a multi-center, open-label, phase II trial of the combination of exogenous testosterone (AndroGel®) with the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with dutasteride 3.5 mg once daily (oral administration). To avoid rapid conversion of testosterone to DHT in case 5α-reductase is not adequately inhibited during the first few days of concurrent treatment with dutasteride and testosterone, daily dutasteride treatment will be initiated 7 days prior to testosterone initiation.
Patients will receive AndroGel® at the dose of 15 g (3 times the standard replacement dose for hypogonadism) once daily (topical administration), starting on Day 8 and continuing for 12 weeks (or until disease progression or withdrawal from the study).</description>

             PSA determinations obtained at least 1 weeks apart), or 2 new osseous lesions by bone
             scan, soft tissue disease progression by RECIST 1.1 criteria , or the appearance of

             imaging in patients with progressive prostate cancer (PI: Morris), depending on tracer
             and scanner time availability. If the study is opened in other centers outside MSKCC,
