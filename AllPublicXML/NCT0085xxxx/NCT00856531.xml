    <textblock>
      The Möbius syndrome constitutes a congenital disorder classically caused by genetic and
      environmental factors. The clinical manifestations include lesion of the facial and abducens
      nerves associated with limb malformations specially club foot. The speech-language
      manifestations include compromise of oral and deglutition, speech and language functions,
      secondary to cranial nerves lesions and mental retardation. The language compromise in this
      disorder is still not well known. In this way, the main objective of this study is to
      characterize the oral language in a population of fifteen subjects with Möbius syndrome with
      age ranging from two to thirteen years old, from both sexes, seen in one of the three main
      center for genetic diagnosis in the state of Ceará. The present work is a descriptive study
      of a cross-sectional design conducted from February to December/2002, using a clinical
      evaluation of language components including morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics. The
      investigators identified exclusive speech involvement in 20,0% of the subjects, language
      disturbance in 46,7%, speech and language disturbance in 13,3% and oral language involvement
      in 26,7%. The investigators conclude that the language disturbance in the Möbius syndrome
      presents with a variable compromise of all oral language components. The delay in
      linguistical development, incomprehensive speech and the deficit of constructions of
      sentences and narrations are constant.
