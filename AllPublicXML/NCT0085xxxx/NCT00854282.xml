    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of mortality in our country, and ovarian cancer becomes a more
      and more important disease gradually in the field of gynecologic malignancies. According to
      the statistics of the Department of Health, the incidence of ovarian cancer increased in
      recent years and the mortality rate was the highest among all gynecologic malignancies in
      Taiwan. Early diagnosis for ovarian cancer is difficult due to the lack of obvious and
      specific initial symptoms. Therefore, it is usually at advanced stage when the diagnosis is
      confirmed. The prognostic parameters for ovarian cancer include tumor stage, histological
      subtype and grade, residual tumor after surgical intervention and the response to
      chemotherapy. However, the possible mechanism of ovarian cancer is still not clear now, which
      has considerable influence on the management and prognosis of the patients.

      Malignancy is considered as a multi-factorial disease, and the influence of immunologic
      mechanism on progression and prognosis of cancer is more and more important. The natural
      CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells actively suppress pathologic and physiological immune response,
      contributing to the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. The
      development and function of regulatory T cells depend on the expression of the transcription
      factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). The mechanisms of suppression are still not known well.
      Whatever the mechanisms of suppression are, it is necessary to control the magnitude of
      regulatory T cells-mediated suppression for the benefit of the host because too much
      suppression might lead to immunosuppression and render the host susceptible to infection and
      cancer.

      We will collect the tumor tissue, ascites and peripheral blood during operation. Through this
      research we will set up the immunological profiles in the changes of lymphocytes, humoral
      immunity and cell-mediated immunity in ovarian cancer patients. The kinetic changes and
      associations between regulatory T cells and the severity and progression of disease will also
      be evaluated. Therefore, the role of regulatory T cells would be defined in the patients with
      ovarian cancer. We will also correlate the regulatory T cells with the clinical prognosis of
      ovarian cancer patients. Finally, we will try to find an efficient therapeutic strategy for
      the cancer patients.

      Methods:

      All of the patients received four to six courses of adjuvant platinum-containing
      chemotherapy.Histologic grading was according to International Union against Cancer criteria
      (28). The stage of disease was classified according to the International Federation of
      Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO, 1987). Pelvic and paraaortic lymph node samplings will be
      performed, if the disease will be confined to within the ovary or will be without a ruptured
      capsule. The histopathologic data, including histologic type and histologic grade, will be
      evaluated by a certified pathologist. The maximal diameter of the residual tumor after
      surgery will be also recorded. All patients will be followed up at 3-month intervals.
