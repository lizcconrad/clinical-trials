      The investigators principal hypothesis is that INO and optic neuritis are objective,
      quantitative, and reproducible models for corroborating the hypothesis that changes in core
      body temperature are associated with the reversible and stereotypic decay in axonal
      conduction and that ACTHAR can serve to prevent such changes. The application of ocular motor
      and optic nerve measures appears to constitute a useful paradigm to detect and monitor
      responses to therapeutic strategies that stabilize nerve cell membranes in response to
      temperature induced decay in axonal conduction mechanisms, with implications on activities of
      daily life that are dependent upon vision (reading, driving, walking, work performance).

      A quantum leap forward in our understanding of MS pathophysiology was provided by the
      discovery of myelin by Louis Ranvier in 1878, and by Pierre Marie who first suggested in 1892
      that demyelination represented a critical element in MS pathology.1 In 1925 Lord Edgar
      Douglas Adrian reported the first electrical recordings of nerve transmission.2 Ultimately
      six Nobel prizes were awarded for contributions directly related to the characterization of
      the nerve impulse and the role played by myelin, a monumental achievement of modern biology.

      While working at the University of Otago in New Zealand, Dr. W. Ian McDonald (who passed away
      on December 13, 2006) was the first to provide objective evidence that demyelination in MS
      was associated with a corresponding change in the transmission of electrically coded messages
      within nerve axons.3-5 He noted that the disruption of myelin led to a reduction in axonal
      cross sectional area and thereby a reduction in conduction velocity, loss of saltatory
      conduction, with a predilection to conduction block. Understanding this conspicuous aspect of
      MS pathophysiology allows us to predict many of the reversible symptoms described by our
      patients, particularly those that are provoked or intensified by elevated ambient or core
      body temperature, exercise, and infection. Such processes appear to compromise the safety
      threshold for high fidelity nerve transmissions. This phenomenon was also recognized
      clinically by Wilhelm Uhthoff in 1899, when he evaluated optic neuritis patients who
      experienced reversible and stereotypic alterations in vision after exercise or exposure to
      heat.6 MS exacerbations (via inflammation, edema, and demyelination) and sustained
      progression of disability (via gliosis, sustained demyelination, and neurodegeneration)
      represent formidable challenges of the disease process that have partially yielded to a
      series of disease modifying therapeutic strategies.7 However, in most patients, bona fide
      exacerbations typically occur infrequently (perhaps a few per year, even in those not using
      treatment), and disability progression takes time (many years in most). Alternately,
      fluctuations in neuronal activity can be induced by a variety of factors with great frequency
      and variability (provoked over minutes, hours, days, or weeks) and correspondingly results in
      a compromise of functional capabilities such as vision, reading, driving, walking, work
      performance, cognitive processing, and the execution of activities of daily living. In
      essence, these frequent, transient, typically stereotypic and reversible physiologic changes
      constitute a major component of MS related disability.

      Notwithstanding the important achievement of validating the favorable effects of disease
      modifying agents in MS, a major and recalcitrant challenge, that should be at the forefront
      in MS therapeutics, is a focus on reducing the consequences of symptoms collateral to the
      disease process. Such symptoms include fatigue, weakness, gait dysfunction, spasticity, heat
      intolerance, pain, cognitive changes, sensory disturbances, bowel, bladder, sexual
      dysfunction, depression, and hopelessness.8 While the underpinnings of these complaints are
      manifold, changes in axonal conduction mechanisms now represent a well-recognized and
      cardinal feature of MS pathophysiology.

      A deeper understanding on how novel interventions might serve to enhance the axonal 'safety
      factor' to thermal perturbations (ambient, surface, and core body temperature) could lead to
      the identification of new treatment strategies for enhancing physiologic performance in CNS
      pathways involved in the organization of physical and intellectual capabilities. An important
      randomized controlled study systematically demonstrated the long-term benefits of acute and
      chronic cooling on objective as well as patient reported measures of neurologic function.9 It
      would be important to also understand how active heating impacts upon similar measures, and
      whether preemptive cooling is protective in response to a heat stress.

      We propose that neuro-ophthalmologic hallmarks of MS, INO (an ocular motor syndrome) and
      optic neuritis (a visual sensory syndrome), can be studied with objective methods (infrared
      oculography and VEPs respectively) to better understand the factors that provoke or prevent
      the reversible conduction changes in demyelinated axons, within highly discrete tract systems
      and whether a specific drug treatment, ACTHAR Gel, can mitigate heat induced worsening of
      ocular motor and anterior visual system dysfunction. Such studies would appear to be germane
      to the development of new treatment approaches focused on optimizing the fidelity of axonal
      conduction in demyelinated pathways, and providing elusive outcome measures for some Phase II
      trials. Education efforts to inform patients and health care providers on the pervasive
      nature of thermally induced symptoms in MS (and the potential impact on daily activities),
      could lead to effective strategies to enhance performance and safety. There has been a
      paucity of research and education on this very conspicuous and important aspect of MS and its
      impact upon patients, families, and the workplace.
