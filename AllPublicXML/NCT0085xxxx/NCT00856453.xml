      RATIONALE: Yoga may decrease fatigue, distress, and depression, and improve sleep quality in
      patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. It is not yet known whether practicing
      yoga in group classes is more effective than practicing yoga at home.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well yoga works in relieving fatigue
      in patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Examine the effectiveness of a restorative yoga (RY) intervention vs home yoga practice
           in patients undergoing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Examine the effectiveness of RY vs home yoga practice on depression, distress, and sleep
           quality in these patients.

        -  Examine the acute (pre- and post-yoga class) effects in these patients.

        -  Test the feasibility of using behavioral strategies to enhance yoga intervention
           adherence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I (restorative yoga intervention): Patients attend 45-minute group yoga classes
           every 3 weeks on the days they are scheduled for chemotherapy for approximately 5-6
           sessions. Patients are provided with a yoga DVD, a manual with photos and written
           descriptions/guidance to practice yoga postures at home, and basic yoga equipment (yoga
           mat, strap, block, yoga blankets) and instructed to practice to the DVD 3 times per week
           (twice weekly during week of group yoga class) for ≥ 45 minutes. Patients record yoga
           practice time/activity at the third yoga session of each week.

        -  Arm II (home yoga practice): Patients are provided with a yoga DVD, a manual with photos
           and written descriptions/guidance to practice yoga postures at home, and basic yoga
           equipment (yoga mat, strap, block, yoga blankets) and instructed to practice to the DVD
           3 times per week for ≥ 45 minutes. Patients record yoga practice time/activity at the
           third yoga session of each week.

      All patients complete questionnaires at baseline, at weeks 9, 18, and 22. Self-report
      measures include Distress Thermometer, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy
      (FACIT) - Spiritual Subscale, FACIT- Fatigue Subscale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Women's
      Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, Medical Outcome Study-Social Support Survey,
      Integrative Medicine Use, Pre- and Post- Class Ratings, and Intervention Feedback .

      After completion of study, patients are followed at 4 weeks.
