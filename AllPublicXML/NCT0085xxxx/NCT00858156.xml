      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of hepatic function on the
      pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of BG9928 in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic
      impairment and in subjects with normal hepatic function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be between the ages of 18 and 75, inclusive.

          -  Must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 kg/m2 and 36 kg/m2, inclusive.

        The following criteria apply only to subjects enrolled into Groups 1 and 2 (mild or
        moderate hepatic impairment):

          -  Must have stable hepatic disease (i.e., no change in disease status within the last 2
             months as determined by the enrolling Investigator) with laboratory and clinical
             findings that support the diagnosis of hepatic impairment.

          -  Must have a total Child-Pugh score (Section 22, Appendix I) of 5-6 (mild), or 7-9
             (moderate).

          -  Must be otherwise healthy as determined by the Investigator on the basis of pre-study
             physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, and clinical
             laboratory parameters. Subjects with controlled hypertension and those problems
             directly associated with the primary diagnosis of hepatic impairment may be included.
             Subjects with stable, mild, chronic concurrent diseases, such as degenerative joint
             disease, may be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of an allergic reaction to any methylxanthine-containing compound.

          -  History of seizure within the past 10 years, or use of any medication for the
             suppression of seizures within the past 5 years.

          -  History of brain surgery, meningitis/encephalitis, penetrating head trauma, stroke, or
             transient ischemic attack within the past 6 months.

          -  History of active (within 6 months) drug or alcohol abuse, a positive drug screen
             (without a medically indicated rationale), or a positive alcohol breath test at
             Screening or on Day -2.

          -  History of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  Serious systemic infection (e.g., septicemia) within the 30 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Fever, with body temperature &gt;38oC, within the 48 hours prior to Day 1.

          -  Active bacterial or viral infection.
