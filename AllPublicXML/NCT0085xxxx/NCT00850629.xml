  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators here propose to perform a collaborative clinical research effort including
      a randomized controlled trial investigating the mechanisms of weight maintenance and their
      relation to a lifestyle intervention in children, adolescents and adults. The detailed
      investigation and analysis of the variability and dynamics of the endocrine circuits
      responding to a negative energy balance and weight loss will be accompanied and enhanced by
      specific clinical projects targeting peripheral and central-nervous aspects of hormonal
      counter-regulation after weight loss. Mechanisms of endocrine counter-regulation and
      potential therapeutic approaches will be studied.
