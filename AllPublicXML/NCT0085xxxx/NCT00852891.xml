    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to analyze changes in cardiac function using Doppler
      echocardiogram in critical patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation using two
      different weaning methods (pressure support and T-tube) and to compare a subgroup of
      patients: success vs. failure in weaning and patients with vs. without heart disease.

      Weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) involves physiological changes that can overload the
      cardiorespiratory system due to changes in the interaction between patient and ventilator.

      This was a randomized crossover clinical trial that included patients in an intensive care
      unit (ICU) who had been on MV for more than 48 hours and who were considered ready for
      weaning. Cardiorespiratory variables, oxygenation, electrocardiogram (ECG) and Doppler
      echocardiogram findings were analyzed at baseline and after 30 minutes in each trial weaning
      method (PSV and T-tube). Comparisons were made between PSV and T-tube, weaning success and
      failure and patients with and without heart disease, using ANOVA and Student's t test. The
      level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

        Patients receiving MV for more than 48 hours, who had been admitted to the Intensive Care
        Unit (ICU), and who met the criteria for weaning from MV according to the parameters
        previously defined were selected to participate in this study.
