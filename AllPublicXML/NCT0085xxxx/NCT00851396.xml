  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the relationship between vitamin D status and insulin-
      glucose dynamics in obese Adolescents. The study is intended to assess the difference in the
      insulin sensitivity before and after correction of vitamin D deficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vitamin D deficient subjects are identified initially through an existing study. Those
      identified with vitamin D deficiency are notified and subsequently treated with standard
      therapy for vitamin D deficiency as part of their clinical care. Patients who self report
      that they have taken the treatment are enrolled in this study. Patients will be evaluated in
      this study with measurement of serum 25 OH D level, PTH and oral glucose tolerance test. The
      study will assess if there is improvement in glucose- insulin sensitivity dynamics once the
      serum 25OH D level is normalized

    <description>Obese adolescents will be screened for vitamin D deficiency through an existing study. Those found to be vitamin D deficient will be given standard treatment of vitamin D deficiency. In this study, patients who self report that they had taken the treatment for vitamin D will be screened for serum 25 OH D level and will undergo OGTT. The OGTT results as well as insulin resistance indices will be compared to their initial values.</description>
