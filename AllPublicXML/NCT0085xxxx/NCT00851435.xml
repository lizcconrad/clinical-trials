    <textblock>
      The objectives of this open study are to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and clinical outcome of patients who have HAP caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11
      after three separate administrations of KBPA-101 every third day in addition of standard of
      care antibiotic treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after hospital
      admission. HAP occurs in patients on conventional hospital wards and in intensive care units
      (ICU), some of them associated to mechanical ventilation, known as Ventilator Associated
      Pneumonia (VAP). VAP is the most common infection on intensive care units representing 82% of
      HAP cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most frequent pathogens involved in ICU-HAP
      and despite of adequate treatment its crude mortality remains as high as 70% of the cases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Patients under intensive care management with hospital acquired pneumonia

          -  Microbiological diagnosis of P. aeruginosa serotype O11 HAP by lower respiratory tract
             specimen (BAL or miniBAL) and presence of a new or progressing pulmonary infiltrate,
             plus one of the three following criteria: a) fever greater than 38ºC, b) WBC greater
             than 10,000/mm3, or c) purulent sputum

          -  In non-intubated patients confirmed microbiological diagnosis of P. aeruginosa
             serotype O11 HAP by endotracheal aspirate (ETA) and modified clinical pulmonary
             infection score (CPIS) higher than 6 points

          -  Patient is expected to survive longer than 72 hours

          -  Written informed consent provided by the patient or by the relatives or the designated
             trusted person

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days preceding the first dose of KBPA-101,
             or planned use during the study and safety follow-up periods

          -  Existence of any surgical or medical condition that might render the patient unduly
             susceptible to possible toxicity from the monoclonal antibody, including septic shock
             with unstable hemodynamics,

          -  Patients with a known complement deficiency associated with systemic lupus
             erythematosus, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, hereditary angioedema,
             membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, collagen vascular disease, autoimmune
             hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, scleroderma, or recurrent Neisserial infections

          -  Confirmed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection

          -  Transplant patients and/or simultaneous treatment with systemic immuno-suppressive
             drugs.

          -  Patients with a known liver function deficiency, e.g. associated with liver cirrhosis
             (Child Pugh B or C) or acute hepatitis

          -  Administration of poly- or mono-immunoglobulins within the three months preceding the
             first dose of study drug or planned administration during the study period

          -  Neutropenia
