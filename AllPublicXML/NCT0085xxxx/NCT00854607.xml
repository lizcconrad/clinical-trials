  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between fungal biomarker levels
      during anti-fungal therapy and the success of treatment for fungal infection. The primary
      hypothesis is that over the initial two weeks of anti-fungal therapy, fungal biomarkers from
      participants with invasive aspergillosis (IA) will be lower for those with a successful
      clinical outcome compared to those with a failed clinical outcome.

    <measure>Average of the Z-scores of the Time-Weighted Averages (TWA) of Fungal Biomarkers Galactomannan (GM) and (1,3)-β-D-glucan (βDG) Over the First Two Weeks of Treatment for Responders (R) and Non-Responders (NonR) to Anti-fungal Treatment at Week 6.</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>After enrollment blood was collected at baseline, twice per week for the first six weeks, then weekly through twelve weeks for biomarker analysis of GM and βDG. Clinical outcome was assessed for qualified participants at 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of antifungal treatment. For a given biomarker the Z-score is the difference from the mean of each individual TWA divided by the overall standard deviation (SD). The average of the Z-scores of the TWA for qualified participants is then calculated across all biomarkers, and used to derive the mean for R and NonR to antifungal therapy.</description>

        <title>Average of the Z-scores of the Time-Weighted Averages (TWA) of Fungal Biomarkers Galactomannan (GM) and (1,3)-β-D-glucan (βDG) Over the First Two Weeks of Treatment for Responders (R) and Non-Responders (NonR) to Anti-fungal Treatment at Week 6.</title>
        <description>After enrollment blood was collected at baseline, twice per week for the first six weeks, then weekly through twelve weeks for biomarker analysis of GM and βDG. Clinical outcome was assessed for qualified participants at 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of antifungal treatment. For a given biomarker the Z-score is the difference from the mean of each individual TWA divided by the overall standard deviation (SD). The average of the Z-scores of the TWA for qualified participants is then calculated across all biomarkers, and used to derive the mean for R and NonR to antifungal therapy.</description>

        <title>Average of the Z-scores of the SLSSL Fitted to the Fungal Biomarkers GM and βDG Over the First Week of Treatment for R and NonR to Anti-fungal Treatment at Week 6.</title>
        <description>After enrollment blood was collected at baseline, twice per week for the first six weeks, then weekly through twelve weeks for analysis of biomarkers GM and βDG. Clinical outcome was assessed for qualified participants at 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of antifungal treatment. For a given biomarker the Z-score is the difference from the mean of each individual SLSSL divided by the overall SD. The average Z-scores of the SLSSL for qualified participants is then calculated across all biomarkers, and used to derive the mean for R and NonR to antifungal therapy.</description>

        <title>Average of the Z-scores of the SLSSL Fitted to the Fungal Biomarkers GM and βDG Over the First 6 Weeks of Treatment for R and NonR to Anti-fungal Treatment at Week 6.</title>
        <description>After enrollment blood was collected at baseline, twice per week for the first six weeks, then weekly through twelve weeks for analysis of biomarkers GM and βDG. Clinical outcome was assessed for qualified participants at 6 and 12 weeks after initiation of antifungal treatment. For a given biomarker the Z-score is the difference from the mean of each individual SLSSL divided by the overall SD. The average Z-scores of the SLSSL for qualified participants is then calculated across all biomarkers, and used to derive the mean for R and NonR to antifungal therapy.</description>
