  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is studying how well giving fludarabine phosphate and melphalan together
      with total-body irradiation followed by donor stem cell transplant works in treating patients
      with hematologic cancer or bone marrow failure disorders. Giving low doses of chemotherapy
      and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop
      the growth of cancer cells or abnormal cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system
      from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's
      immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer or abnormal cells (graft-versus-tumor
      effect)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the transplant related mortality (TRM) of this reduced intensity
      transplantation (RIT) combination in a patient population that is usually not eligible for a
      full myeloablative allogeneic transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate engraftment, safety, clinical response, evidence of graft-versus-malignancy
      effect/graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and overall outcomes of treatment with our RIT
      regimen across a variety of hematological conditions.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -5
      to -2 and melphalan* IV over 30 minutes on day -2. Patients then undergo total-body
      irradiation on day -1 and allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0.

      Note: *Patients with chromosomal breakage syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia or dyskeratosis
      congenita, receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4 hours on day -4 to -2 instead of
      melphalan.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

          -  Informed consent

          -  DONOR: Permissible HLA matching: Related donors- single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B
             or DRB 1; unrelated donors- a single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B, or C, +/-
             additional single allele level mismatch at A, B, C or DRB1; cord blood &gt;= 4 out of 6
             antigen match at HLA A, B, DRB1)

          -  DONOR: Compatibility at the four most informative HLA loci: A, B, C and DRB1 are
             important for reducing the risk of GVHD and successful transplant outcomes; the A, B,
             C and DRB1 loci comprise 8 possible alleles (a haplotype being inherited from each
             parent); one additional locus, HLA-DQ, is also typed to ascertain haplotypes and
             assist in the search for a compatible donor; however mismatching at DQ has not been
             shown to be associated with adverse outcomes; high resolution molecular typing (at the
             allele level) is now the standard of care for unrelated donor searches and allows
             greater refinement of the search strategy

          -  DONOR: Matched related donor: a single antigen mismatch at A, B, or the DR transplant
             from a family member is associated with a higher risk of GVHD but similar overall
             survival when compared to full identity at these 3 regions; related donor/recipient
             pairs must be matched at 5 of 6 HLA antigens (A, B, DRBl)

          -  DONOR: Unrelated donor: when evaluating patients for unrelated donor transplant, a
             higher degree of matching is preferred due to minimize the risk of GVHD; the A, B, C,
             DRB1 and DQ loci, comprising 10 possible alleles, will be typed routinely for all
             unrelated transplants; given the higher risk of TRM in mismatched transplants, RIT is
             often the best way to mitigate the risk; evolving data from the National Marrow Donor
             Program now makes it possible to estimate the risks of donor-recipient HLA mismatch at
             the allele or antigen level; the higher risk from HLA-mismatching must be carefully
             assessed with respect to the clinical urgency and the patient's risk by the transplant
             physician; antigen level mismatches at DQ are inconsequential to transplant outcomes
             and are ignored with respect to donor selection for the purposes of this protocol,
             with matching requirements confined to the 8 loci involving HLA A, B, C and DRB1; for
             the purpose of this protocol, a single antigen mismatch at HLA A, B, or C, with or
             without additional single allele level mismatch may participate in this protocol for
             voluntary unrelated donors (blood or marrow); patients must be at least antigen-level
             matched at DRB1

          -  DONOR: If a patient has no suitable family donor matched for 5 of 6 HLA antigens (A,
             B, DRB1) and no suitable unrelated donor is identified or for reasons of urgency, the
             patient can be considered a candidate for cord blood transplant, provided a cord blood
             donor is identified with a &gt;= 4 out of 6 antigen match at HLA A, B, DRB1 antigens; the
             cord blood product must provide a minimum of 2 x 10^7 nucleated cells/kg, test
             negative for HIV and Hepatitis A, Band C, and sterility assays have no growth; the
             cord blood products are located through the National Marrow Donor Program, the
             American Registry, or the Bone Marrow Donor Worldwide or other established registries,
             and may be stored in the N.Y Placental Cord Blood Bank, the St. Louis Cord Blood Bank,
             or any of the established, registered International blood and marrow banks

          -  DONOR: Donor must be healthy and have nonreactive test results for all infectious
             disease assays as required by state and federal regulations; donors who screen
             seropositive for hepatitis and/or syphilis must be cleared by infectious disease
             consultation

          -  DONOR: The donor must have no uncontrolled cardiopulmonary, renal, endocrine, hepatic
             or psychiatric disease to render donation unsafe

          -  DONOR: The donor must be able to give informed consent for peripheral blood stem cell
             collection or bone marrow collection

          -  DONOR: Syngeneic donors are not eligible

          -  DONOR: Donors who have poor peripheral venous access, may require central venous line
             placement for stem cell apheresis

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, active serious infection or
