  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assist in the developement of 3 dimensional breast ultrasound imaging and when possible
      compare the ultrasound results with 3D mammography (digital tomosynthesis mammography)or
      clinical mammography and ultrasound. Hopefully that this new, 3D ultrasound imaging can
      provide important information not found on mammograms or routine breast ultrasound.

    <description>Subjects will be seated and have the indicated breast positioned in the 3D breast ultrasound imaging device. An ultrasound gel will be applied to the breast by the technician. The breast will be gently compressed between the ultrasound plates to facilitate the 3D (dimensional)breast imaging. This imaging session will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.</description>

    <intervention_name>Experimental Photoacoustic Imaging</intervention_name>
    <description>Subjects will be placed in a seated position for the photoacoustic tomography(PAT) imaging. The subjects will be given a laser protective mask to wear. Each subject will be instructed how to wear this mask(goggles) to protect their eyes during the imaging session. Pulse monitor leads may be placed on their chest to allow the computer to record the images of blood flow in the breast. The breast will be placed on the laser device platform and positioned so that the laser beam is appropriately directed to the targeted area of the breast. During the imaging the temperature of the skin under laser light, will be checked often with a thermometer to make sure that the skin is not getting too hot. This laser based imaging scan will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</description>
