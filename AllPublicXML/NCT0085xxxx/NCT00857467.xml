      This is a healthy volunteer three-way crossover study. A total of 12 subjects will receive
      three single administrations of 1 g rectal suppositories (containing either 5 mg NRL001, 10
      mg NRL001 or matching placebo), with a washout period of at least 7 days between dosings. A
      further 12 subjects will receive three single administrations of 2 g rectal suppositories
      (containing either 5 mg NRL001, 10 mg NRL001 or matching placebo), again with a 7 day washout
      period between dosings. The pharmacodynamic response, pharmacokinetics and safety profile
      will be determined.

             the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of medication in the last 30 days with a vasodilatory activity, or use of any
             medication currently or within the last 30 days which the Investigator believes may
             affect the study participation or results

          2. Use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors presently or within the last 2 weeks before study
             participation

          3. Use of any medication in the last 30 days applied to the anus and/or via the rectum

             in any other research study in the last three months which involved being paid a
             disturbance allowance; having an invasive procedure (e.g. venepuncture &gt;50ml,
             endoscopy) or exposure to ionising radiation.

          5. Regular intake of more than 21 units of alcohol per week

          6. History or any evidence of cardiovascular disease including ischaemic heart disease
             and hypertension (defined on examination: systolic blood pressure greater than 160
             mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg; based on at least two separate
             readings), peripheral vascular disease or Raynaud's syndrome

          7. Presence of diabetes mellitus

          8. History or symptoms of thyroid diseases, including hypo- or hyperthyroidism

             hepatic or cardiac) dysfunction

         12. Volunteers whom the Investigator feels would not comply with the requirements of the
             trial

         13. Volunteers who have been exposed to more than 5 mSv of ionising radiation in the last
             12 months.
