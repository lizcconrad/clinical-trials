    <textblock>
      Patients who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive subcutaneous injections of adalimumab at either 160/80 mg at Week
      0/2 and 40 mg every other week (eow) starting at Week 4 to Week 50, 80/40 mg at Week 0/2 and
      40 mg eow starting at Week 4 to Week 50, or placebo eow starting at Week 0 to Week 50 under
      the double-blind condition. At or after Week 8, participants who have inadequate response
      during the double-blind period can switch to the rescue arm, where participants from the
      placebo group initially receive adalimumab 160 mg and 80 mg 2 weeks later and those from the
      adalimumab group receive adalimumab 40 mg initially and 2 weeks later under double-blind
      conditions. All participants in the rescue arm then receive 40 mg adalimumab eow until Week
      50. Participants who complete the 52-week double-blind period receive open-label adalimumab
      40 mg eow starting at Week 52 and continuing until the end of the study. Participants who
      have an inadequate response or disease flare can dose escalate to 80 mg eow at or after Week
      60. Participants who dose escalate to 80 mg eow and continue to have an inadequate response
      or disease flare are withdrawn from the study.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤ 2 with no individual subscore &gt; 1. The Mayo score is a composite score of ulcerative colitis disease activity calculated as the sum of four subscores:
Stool Frequency Subscore (SFS), based on the participant's diary and scored from zero (normal number of stools) to three (5 or more stools than normal);
Rectal Bleeding Subscore (RBS), based on the participant's diary and scored from zero (no blood) to three (blood only passed);
Endoscopy Subscore (ESS), based on colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and scored from zero (normal or inactive disease) to three (severe disease, spontaneous bleeding, ulceration);
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore, based on the physician's overall assessment, and scored from zero (normal) to three (severe disease).
The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points, with higher scores representing more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events up to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related.
A serious adverse event is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission at 52 Weeks</title>
          <description>Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤ 2 with no individual subscore &gt; 1. The Mayo score is a composite score of ulcerative colitis disease activity calculated as the sum of four subscores:
Stool Frequency Subscore (SFS), based on the participant's diary and scored from zero (normal number of stools) to three (5 or more stools than normal);
Rectal Bleeding Subscore (RBS), based on the participant's diary and scored from zero (no blood) to three (blood only passed);
Endoscopy Subscore (ESS), based on colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and scored from zero (normal or inactive disease) to three (severe disease, spontaneous bleeding, ulceration);
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore, based on the physician's overall assessment, and scored from zero (normal) to three (severe disease).
The total Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points, with higher scores representing more severe disease.</description>

        <description>An inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire responder was defined as a participant with at least a 16-point increase from Baseline in total Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score. The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire consisting of 4 dimensions: bowel-related symptoms, systemic function, social function, and emotional status. The responses to each question within each domain range from 1 (significant impairment) to 7 (no impairment), with the total score ranging from 32 (very poor) to 224 (perfect health-related quality of life).</description>

          <description>An inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire responder was defined as a participant with at least a 16-point increase from Baseline in total Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) score. The IBDQ is a 32-item questionnaire consisting of 4 dimensions: bowel-related symptoms, systemic function, social function, and emotional status. The responses to each question within each domain range from 1 (significant impairment) to 7 (no impairment), with the total score ranging from 32 (very poor) to 224 (perfect health-related quality of life).</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either probably related, possibly related, probably not related or not related.
A serious adverse event is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.

      <time_frame>For the 3 randomized treatment arms, adverse events (AEs) were reported from the time of study drug administration up to Week 52 (double-blind period); for All Adalimumab, AEs were reported up to 221 weeks+70 days following discontinuation of study drug.</time_frame>
      <desc>Serious AEs (SAEs) were collected from the time participants signed the study-specific informed consent. For SAEs, the number of participants affected in the Double-blind Placebo arm (n=13) is reported from the final database lock, versus the number reported in Outcome Measure 11 (n=12), which was from the interim database lock.</desc>
