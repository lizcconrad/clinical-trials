      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Vertebroplasty may help prevent fractures and
      spinal cord compression caused by spinal metastasis. Giving stereotactic body radiation
      therapy together with vertebroplasty may help lessen pain and improve quality of life of
      patients with spinal metastasis.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving stereotactic body radiation therapy
      together with vertebroplasty works in treating patients with localized spinal metastasis.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy in reducing pain at 3 months
           in patients with localized spinal metastasis.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) scored as the time of
           maximal pain relief to an increase of 2 points on the Visual Analogue Scoring System.

        -  To determine the functional preservation of improvement as measured by the Brief Pain
           Inventory.

        -  To prospectively assess quality of life using the FACT-G and EQ-5D questionnaires.

        -  To determine the long-term stability of the treated vertebral bone (e.g., fracture,
           sclerotic change, vertebral body height, or malalignment) as measured by MRI, CT scan,
           and plain radiographs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to prior radiotherapy to
      the planned treatment site(s).

        -  Group 1 (prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo 5 fractions of stereotactic body
           radiotherapy (SBRT) over 30-90 minutes each.

        -  Group 2 (no prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo 1 fraction of SBRT over 30-90 minutes.

      Within 1 month after the initiation of SBRT, patients in both groups undergo percutaneous
      vertebroplasty.

      Patients complete pain and quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during
      study. Patients also undergo MRI and CT scan at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then
      every 6 months for 3 years to assess changes in vertebral bone strength and stability.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 weeks, at 1, 3, and 6 months,
      and then every 6 months for 3 years.
