      This is a Phase 4, retrospective and observational, multicenter, national (Brazil), open,
      noncomparative, and nonrandomized study, which does not have visits. This study will be
      conducted in accordance to Good Clinical Practices. The procedure will be the review of
      medical records of patients who have already completed 12 weeks of treatment of chronic
      hepatitis C with peginterferon alfa-2b and ribavirin. This review will take place after the
      subjects have signed the informed consent form authorizing collection of these data. The
      collection of data for virological response after Week 12 will be collected prospectively
      through the review of medical records after the subjects have completed their entire
      treatment and follow-up period.

      physician will be filling out the case report form with the information contained in the
      medical record. Any dose reduction and/or doses not taken during this period will be reported
      through the case report form. The collection of data for virological response after Week 12
      (such as virological response at the end of treatment and sustained virological response
      after follow-up period) will be collected prospectively through the review of medical records
      after the subjects have completed their entire treatment and follow-up period.
