  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 24-month study of the use of laronidase administered into the spinal fluid to treat
      cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). MPS I is a rare genetic condition due
      to deficiency of the enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase. Laronidase is the manufactured form of the
      enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase.

      MPS I is a heterogeneous disease with several clinical phenotypes ranging from the most
      severe, Hurler syndrome, to the attenuated forms, Hurler-Scheie and Scheie. Although patients
      with milder forms of MPS I may not have grossly observable problems with cognition, these
      patients do have learning difficulties that are apparent in school and with
      neuropsychological testing. The goal of this study is to evaluate whether intrathecal
      recombinant human alpha-l-iduronidase (rhIDU) injections can stabilize or improve cognitive
      decline in individuals with MPS I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 24-month open label, prospective, randomized trial in 16 MPS I patients age
      six years or older who have documented evidence of cognitive decline. The study will test the
      safety and efficacy of intrathecal recombinant human alpha-L iduronidase (rhIDU) to reduce or
      stabilize cognitive decline by assessing the subjects at baseline with neuropsychological,
      clinical, radiological, and biochemical evaluations and then monitoring the change in these
      parameters during a regimen of first monthly, then quarterly, intrathecal treatments with
      rhIDU. The clinical safety of the regimen will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events,
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory assessments, and clinical evaluations.

      Subjects will be randomized to a treatment or a control group for 12 months, following which
      all subjects will receive 12 months of active treatment. During the first 12 months, the
      control group will receive similar study assessments but will be unblinded with no placebo
      administered. Subjects will have extensive baseline screening evaluations, after which
      subjects who were randomized to the treatment group will receive their first dose of
      intrathecal rhIDU. The enzyme will be administered via intrathecal injection at 1-3 month
      intervals throughout the 24-month study period. There will be a mid-study analysis after 12
      months comparing changes in IQ and memory tests between controls and the treatment group. If
      pre-established criteria of improvement are met, the study will terminate at the 12 month
      point. If shown to be effective, intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) would be the
      only treatment for cognitive decline in patients who do not qualify for and/or are unable to
      have hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

    <description>For the treatment group, intrathecal rhIDU injections will consist of 3 cc of Aldurazyme® (laronidase) (approximately 1.74 mg) diluted with 6 cc of Elliotts B® solution for a total injection of 9 cc. The diluted enzyme will be administered via a lumbar puncture (IT) on day 0 after baseline assessments. IT injections will be repeated on days 30, 60, and 90. The subsequent doses will be administered at 3-month intervals for a total of 10 doses during the two-year period. Control patients will not receive treatment, lumbar puncture, or placebo, but will undergo all other study procedures and assessments during year one. Control patients will then enter a treatment phase consisting of four IT doses at 3-month intervals.</description>
