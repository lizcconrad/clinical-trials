  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weakness of the arm and hand results in long-term disability for many persons who suffer a
      stroke. After the initial recovery phase, only limited gains are achieved by retraining the
      weak limb to perform daily tasks. However, new treatment strategies such as repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show promise for enhancing motor recovery after
      stroke. rTMS is a noninvasive technique for modifying brain activity that aims to improve
      motor function by correcting abnormal patterns that occur after stroke. We believe that
      giving rTMS right before a therapy session will prepare the brain so that the patient is
      better able to participate in and benefit from training of the hand and arm. The goal of this
      study is to test how well this new strategy works to improve recovery in people who have mild
      to moderate weakness of the arm and hand after stroke.

      Participants will receive magnetic stimulation of the movement area of the brain just prior
      to arm and hand training for a series of eight sessions. We will evaluate changes in hand and
      arm function after the intervention and one month later to see if the changes are maintained.
      We will also test whether some groups of people benefit more than others from the
      intervention. If improvements in hand and arm function are observed after the intervention,
      we will test it more rigourously in a future clinical trial in which participants are
      randomly assigned to different treatment conditions. This research will show whether brain
      stimulation can be used to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation care.

    <description>For real rTMS,1200 pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1Hz, with an intensity equal to the 115% of the motor threshold as established at baseline. For Sham rTMS, procedures will be identical to those used for real rTMS with the exception that a placebo coil will be used, which provides acoustic and sensory stimulation like the real coil but does not stimulate neural tissue. 20-minute Real and Sham stimulation sessions will be administered bi-weekly for a period of 4 weeks</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  first clinical stroke involving the middle cerebral artery confirmed by CT or MRI scan
             during acute care at the MUHC, or second stroke involving the same hemisphere when
             there were no clinical residual effects from the first stroke;

          -  cortical or subcortical stroke resulting in hemiparesis;

          -  at least 3 months post-stroke;

          -  discharged from standard rehabilitation;

          -  able to provide informed consent, to follow instructions and participate in therapy,
             as evidenced by Mini Mental State Exam score &gt; 14;

          -  able to understand instructions in English or French.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  minimal or no residual upper extremity motor impairment;

          -  severe upper extremity motor impairment as indicated by inability to produce any
             voluntary contraction of intrinsic hand muscles; severe cognitive impairment in
             language or attention sufficient to impair communication during the consenting or
             intervention procedures (score &lt; 14 on the Mini Mental Status Exam);

          -  other central nervous system disorder or peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity;

          -  pain, spasticity, or other complications that would prevent participation in the
             intervention;

          -  history of seizure confirmed by interview and medical chart review;

          -  comorbidity such as Parkinson's disease, osteoarthritis, or cancer, precluding full
             participation in the assessments and in the experimental intervention;

          -  other conditions that increase the risk of side effects due to rTMS procedures: metal
             in cranium, intracardiac line, increased intracranial pressure, pregnancy, cardiac
             pacemaker, medication pump, tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, history of
