      Aims/hypothesis:

      Populations worldwide are aging and type 2 diabetes is common in individuals aged &gt;80 years.
      The important issue that needs to be considered is whether tight glycemic control is benefits
      for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. The benefits of intensive glucose control remain
      uncertain for the heterogeneous population of older diabetic patients due to a lack of
      clinical trial data evaluating the benefits of long-term intensive glucose control in older
      patients. This study is designed to provide reliable evidence on the balance of benefits and
      risks conferred by intensive glucose control in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes
      Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, open-labeled, controlled design to assess the
      benefits of treating elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will include 208
      elderly patients with type 2 diabetes and follow-up for 5 years. Eligible patients are
      randomized to receive intensive (A1C &lt;7.0%) or conservative (A1C around 8.0%) glycemic
      control. The primary study outcomes are a composite of macrovascular events and a composite
      of microvascular events, considered both jointly and separately. The secondary outcomes are
      death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, total coronary events, total
      cerebrovascular events, heart failure, peripheral vascular events, all cardiovascular events,
      and hospitalization for 24 hours or more.

      Expected results: This study is designed to provide reliable evidence on the balance of
      benefits and risks conferred by intensive and conservative glucose control in elderly
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Once completed, this trial will clearly influence the
      management of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, regardless of the results.
