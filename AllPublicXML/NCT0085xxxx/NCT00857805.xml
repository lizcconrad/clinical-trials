    <textblock>
      Patients with liver tumor burden that exceeds Milan criteria are considered to receive one of
      the following locoregional treatments: transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA), percutaneous ethanol injection and proton beam radiation (PBR). The goals of
      these treatments are to control tumor growth, to downstage tumor size to meet Milan criteria,
      and to improve survival. Patients who exceed the Milan criteria benefit from tumor
      downstaging as a result of treatment. Patients who meet Milan criteria benefit from tumor
      control to bridge them to liver transplantation. TACE is considered the most common
      locoregional treatment that is used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Proton beam
      radiotherapy has been used in treating HCC in a few centers across the globe. Phase I and II
      trials showed a satisfactory safety and efficacy results. Loma Linda University Medical
      Center is one of these pioneering centers that use proton beam as a treatment for HCC. This
      is the first randomized trial in the medical field that will compare head-to-head the
      efficacy of TACE versus proton beam in treating HCC patients.
