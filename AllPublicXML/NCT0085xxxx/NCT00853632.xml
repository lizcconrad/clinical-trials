      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the long term safety and effectiveness of the
      Carpentier-Edwards® PERIMOUNT Magna Mitral Valves in patients undergoing mitral valve
      replacement with or without concomitant procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center study to be conducted in the US and outside
      the US (OUS). Approximately 250 subjects are planned to be enrolled to obtain long term data
      from 101 subjects at 8 years post implant of the Magna mitral valve. Of these 250,
      approximately 38 (15%) are anticipated to be simultaneous aortic and mitral replacements.
      Subject enrollment will not start in the US before obtaining FDA approval of this post market
      study.

      Assessments will be obtained for the preoperative and operative visits, and postoperatively
      at discharge, six months, 1-year and annually thereafter for a minimum of 8 years. Subject's
      demographics (date of birth, sex), physical assessment (heart rate, height, weight, systolic
      and diastolic blood pressures), New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, cardiac
      rhythm, cardiovascular medical history/risk factors, non-cardiovascular conditions, previous
      cardiovascular procedures/interventions, antithromboembolic and lipid lowering medications
      and coagulation profile. Blood data is required for each subject preoperatively and at 6
      months. Echocardiographic evaluation required for each subject preoperatively, at discharge,
      6 months (between 3-6 months), 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 year follow-ups. A QOL survey (EQ-5D) will
      be completed by the subject pre-operatively and at the 6-month follow-up visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient requires, as indicated in the preoperative evaluation, a replacement
             mitral valve.

          -  The patient has signed and dated the subject informed consent form prior to surgery.

          -  The patient is expected to survive the surgery and be discharged.

          -  The patient is geographically stable and agrees to attend follow-up assessments.

          -  The patient is 18 years or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any known non-cardiac life-threatening disease, which will limit the
             patient's life expectancy below 1 year.

          -  The patient presents with active endocarditis within the last 3 months.

          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The patient is an intravenous drug abuser.

          -  The patient is currently a prison inmate.

          -  The patient is currently participating in a study of an investigational drug or
             device.

          -  The patient requires replacement of a native or prosthetic tricuspid or pulmonic
             valve.

          -  The patient requires replacement of a native or prosthetic aortic valve with a
             prosthesis other than a commercially available Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT Valve
             (i.e. models 2700, 2700TFX, 2800, 2800TFX, 2900, 3000, 3000TFX, 3300TFX)*.

          -  The patient was previously enrolled in the study.

          -  The patient has had prior aortic, tricuspid and/or pulmonary valve surgery, which
             included implantation of a bioprosthetic valve or mechanical valve that will remain in
             situ.
