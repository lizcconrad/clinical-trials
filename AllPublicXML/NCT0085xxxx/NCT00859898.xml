    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1C
      achieved with dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with metformin XR as compared with metformin
      XR monotherapy and compared with Dapagliflozin monotherapy, after 24 weeks of oral
      administration of double-blind treatment. The safety of treatment with dapagliflozin will
      also be assessed in this study

    <description>Adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline at Week 24 (or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available, ie, last observation carried forward (LOCF) was determined. HbA1c was measured as percent of hemoglobin by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. HbA1c measurements were obtained during the Qualification and Lead-In Periods and on Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Double-Blind Period.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) at Week 24 (LOCF) - Randomized, Treated Participants</title>
          <description>Data after rescue medication was excluded from this analysis. FPG was measured as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) by a central laboratory. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. FPG measurements were obtained during the Qualification and Lead-In Periods and on Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the Double-Blind Period.</description>

Data after rescue included for all special AEs except hypoglycemia (excluded data after rescue).

        <description>Measurements were taken during the Qualification and Lead-In Periods and on Day 1 and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the Double Blind Period. Blood pressure values were obtained: after the participant was seated quietly for 5 minutes; at least 8 hours after the last ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine; and in the same arm (right or left) consistently through out the study. Systolic and Diastolic pressures were measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Data after rescue were also included. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication.</description>

        <description>Safety laboratory measurements were obtained during the Qualification and Lead-In Periods and on Day 1 of the Double-Blind Period and at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. BL was defined as the last assessment prior to the start of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Data included from BL up to and including the last day of treatment plus 30 days. Liver function abnormality criteria: FDA Guidance for Industry: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation (July 2009). Data after rescue was also included. Abbreviations: Pretreatment (PreRX), upper limit of normal (ULN); greater than (&gt;) less than (&lt;); Units per liter (U/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT); aspartate aminotransferase (AST); alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Marked abnormality Low (High) defined: ALP, AST and ALT (&gt;3*ULN); bilirubin (&gt;2*ULN if PreRX &lt;= ULN; &gt;3*ULN if PreRX &gt; ULN); AST or ALT plus (+) bilirubin elevation: AST or ALT &gt;3*ULN and bilirubin &gt;1.5*ULN within 14 days on or after ALT elevation.</description>
