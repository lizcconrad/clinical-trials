    <description>All patients will receive standard treatment with definitive radiation therapy (IMRT, intensity modulated radiation therapy), administered as one fraction per day (Monday through Friday) over approximately 33 fractions.

Patients will receive daily RAD0001 it will be administered orally or via percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) once daily according to the dose escalation scheme plus cisplatin intravenously once per week (Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36) according to the dose escalation scheme.
Approximately 3 - 4 months after completion of chemoradiation, radiologic response assessment will be performed.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>

             lymphoma, or melanoma). Patients with thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular,
             undifferentiated, Hurthle cell, medullary, or anaplastic) may be eligible.

          -  Patients with cutaneous squamous cell cancer or basal cell cancer arising in the head
             and neck may be eligible.

        oropharyngeal primaries with nodal disease at levels IV or V

          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; or = to 70%

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; than or = to 1.5 X 109/L,
             Platelets &gt; or = to 100 x 109/L, Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL.

          -  Adequate liver function: serum bilirubin &lt; or = to 1.5 X upper limit of normal(ULN),
             and serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase, ALT; aspartate aminotransferase,
             AST) activity &lt; or = to 2.0 X ULN.

          -  Adequate renal function: serum creatinine within institutional normal limits, or
             calculated creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft and Gault method) &gt; or = to 45 mL/min
             for patients with creatinine limits above institutional normal.

          -  INR &lt; 1.5 or aPTT &lt; 1.5 X upper limits of normal

          -  For women of child-bearing potential, negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 14
             days prior to administration of RAD001.

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             birth control methods while on treatment and for at least 3 months there after.

          -  The planned radiation therapy treatment dose must meet protocol requirements (Resected
             tumors/post-operative patients: maximum planned dose 66 Gy. Unresected tumors: maximum
             planned dose 70 Gy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Any prior radiation therapy to
             &gt;25% of the bone marrow. Any prior radiation to whole pelvis and/or brain.

          -  Patients with unresected squamous cell cancer (SCC) arising in the oral cavity,
             oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx are excluded, unless they at have received at least
             2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with a regimen that includes cisplatin or
             carboplatin. (For patients with unresected head and neck tumors other than SCC of oral
             cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx, there is no requirement for induction
             chemotherapy prior to protocol chemoradiation)..

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin (warfarin)

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt; or = to grade 3, according to Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0.

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia &gt; or = to grade 2 (CTCAE version 3.0).

          -  Patients who require chronic treatment with steroids ( &gt; prednisone 5 mg/day) or other
             immunosuppressive agents are excluded. Both cisplatin and RAD001 are
             immunosuppressive, and chronic steroid use (&gt; prednisone 5 mg/day) or use of other
             immunosuppressive agents might increase the risk of lethal infection in this setting.
             Patients on low- dose steroid replacement regimens (&lt; or = to prednisone 5 mg/day) are
             not excluded, because low dose steroids should not be immunosuppressive.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of RAD001 (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection).

          -  Active infection or serious underlying medical condition that would impair the
             patient's ability to receive protocol treatment. Other concurrent severe and/or
             uncontrolled medical disease which would compromise participation in the study in the
             opinion of the investigator (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, unstable angina, or
             congestive heart failure - New York Heart Association Class III or IV)

          -  HIV-positive patients. These patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Additionally, pharmacokinetic interactions
             between antiretroviral therapy and the study regimen may be problematic for these
             patients.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Other active malignancy, other than indolent malignancies which the investigator
             determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment and safety analysis. For example,
             patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or prostate
             cancer with no current biochemical (PSA) or radiologic evidence of disease may enroll.

          -  Impaired lung function: O2 saturation 88% or less at rest on room air by Pulse
             Oximetry. If O2 saturation is &lt; or = to 88% at rest, further pulmonary function tests
             (PFTs) should be ordered to confirm normal pulmonary function and eligibility.

          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             of study entry or during the study period. Close contact with those who have received
             attenuated live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella, and TY21a typhoid vaccines.

          -  Liver disease such as cirrhosis or severe hepatic impairment (Childs-Pugh class C).
