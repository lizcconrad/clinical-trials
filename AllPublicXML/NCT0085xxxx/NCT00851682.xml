  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to find out if MRI techniques examining (1) the motion of
      water molecules in the prostate (diffusion sensitive MRI), (2) the difference in blood flow
      to the prostate (dynamic contrast enhanced MRI), and (3) differences in chemical composition
      of the prostate (MR spectroscopy), can be used to detect prostate cancer early and
      non-invasively. Localization of the cancer within the prostate would be of particular
      importance in focal cryoablation of prostate carcinoma which we hope to improve as a result
      of this project.

      Additional aim of the study is to correlate expression of genes believed to pay a role in
      prostate cancer with MRI findings.

      Radical prostatectomy patients will undergo an MRI prior to their scheduled surgery. Ex vivo
      imaging will be done on prostates once removed. Results from the final pathology with be
      compared with results of imaging to determine the accuracy of the image analysis in cancer
      localization and staging.

      Brachytherapy patients will undergo an MRI prior to their scheduled procedure. Two areas of
      suspected cancer and two areas without suspected cancer will be prospectively identified
      based on the MRI imaging. At the time of brachytherapy, transrectal needle biopsies will be
      obtained from the previously identified areas. The needle cores will be reviewed by study
      pathologist to determine the accuracy of the image analysis in cancer localization and
      staging.
