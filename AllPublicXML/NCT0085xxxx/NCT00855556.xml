      The goal of the study is to develop and organize an effort to identify genes that determine
      an individual's risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD).

        1. To ascertain, study and establish a repository of DNA samples that will allow for the
           identification of known and yet-to-be-identified genetic markers associated with the
           development of PD.

        2. To create a database with clinical, genetic (HLA, genome screen) and medical history
           information that will facilitate the search for PD susceptibility genes.

        3. To provide a centralized DNA repository to allow for targeted studies of genetic factors
           contributing to the onset, heterogeneity and progression of PD.

        4. To evaluate opportunities to extend the results of research to develop methods of risk
           prediction, prevention and therapy for PD.

    Enrollment into this registry was not as robust as investigator envisioned. Thus, the registry

    <description>The blood collection is designed to obtain blood samples as a source of DNA for genotyping and to establish a plasma and serum storage repository for future assays. GCRC nurses will perform all blood draws associated with this study. The following procedures are designed to standardize sample collection:
Blood will be collected with the participant in the seated position with the reclining position reserved for those with a history of fainting during blood collection.
Participants will be instructed to drink plenty of water (e.g., at least 8 large glasses of water) prior to the clinic visit as this facilitates easier collection.
No fasting, activity or medication restrictions are required prior to or following blood collection.
Blood collection will follow completion of the questionnaires. They will be performed by a nurse or technician with documented class time and experience in phlebotomy. Technician certification will occur prior to blood collection.</description>
