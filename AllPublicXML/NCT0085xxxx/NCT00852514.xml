    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a widely used modality of renal replacement therapy. Due to its
      continuous nature of therapy, better control of fluid status and preservation of residual
      renal function were presumed by most nephrologists. However, recent evidences showed that it
      might not be the case. The severity of fluid overloading and the need for anti-hypertensive
      agents to control blood pressure seems to be more severe for PD patients. Therefore, more
      aggressive strategy to control dry weight is mandatory in PD patients. However, over
      reduction of dry weight might affect residual renal function (RRF) and, probably, the
      survival of PD patients. A balance between reduction of dry weight and preservation of RRF is
      crucial for the care of PD patients. Currently, only clinical measures like cardiothoracic
      ratio on chest X-ray and absence of pedal edema were used to evaluate PD patient's dry
      weight. There is no objective method to determine dry weight accurately. In this prospective
      and randomized study, the investigators will use multi-frequency bio-impedance (MF-BIA) to
      detect intracellular and extracellular water (ECW) content of patients.
