  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was the extension of the LANTU_C_02761 study named EASIE and identified as
      NCT00751114 (core study comparing insulin glargine versus sitagliptin in insulin-naïve
      patients treated with metformin and not adequately controlled).

      All patients with Glycosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 7% at the end of the core study had
      the possibility to enter this extension study if they met the other inclusion criteria and
      did not present with any exclusion criteria.

      The visit 14 of the core study (week 24) was the visit 1 (baseline, week 0) of the extension
      study which consisted of a 12-week treatment period.

      The objectives of this extension study were:

        -  To assess the glycemic control (HbA1c &lt;7%) of a 3-month combination therapy with
           metformin, insulin glargine and sitagliptin in patients not adequately controlled by a
           previous treatment with metformin plus either insulin glargine or sitagliptin.

        -  To assess the effect of insulin glargine in combination with sitagliptin on HbA1c level,
           fasting plasma glucose, 7-point glucose profile, hypoglycemia occurrence, body weight
           and overall safety.

          <description>Insulin glargine administered once a day, in the evening, at dinner or at bedtime. Starting dose: - last dose administered in the core study for patients previously treated with insulin glargine, - 0.2 U/Kg of body weight for patients previously treated with sitagliptin. Monitoring of blood glucose and titration: all patients, irrespective of their previous treatment group in the core study were empowered to adjust their insulin doses, under strict investigator's supervision. The goal was to achieve through a force titration 70 &lt;FPG ≤ 100 mg/dL (3.9 &lt;FPG ≤ 5.5 mmol/L).
Sitagliptin: stable dose of 100 mg once a day administered with or without food.</description>
