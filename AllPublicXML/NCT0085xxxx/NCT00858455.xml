  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the effect of Maalox® and One A Day® on the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK1349572, and also to compare the safety of GSK1349572 when administered alone and when
      administered with Maalox® and One A Day®. There are four dosing periods in this study, each
      period requires a 4 night stay. A follow-up visit is also required at approximately 7 days
      after the last dose administration. Starting from the first period to the follow-up, it will
      take about 1 month. Screening visit is required to be completed within 30 days prior to the
      first dose.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
             criteria apply:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:

          -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or

          -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a postmenopausal status.
             For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, HRT should be discontinued for
             2 weeks and then the subject rescreened, as HRT can suppress FSH.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg for men and ≥ 45 kg for women and body mass index (BMI) within the
             range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). One repeat
             measurement to confirm eligibility is allowed.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
             criteria apply:

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof, or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  If heparin is used during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to
             heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks/week for men or &gt;7 drinks/week for women. One

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine human chorionic
             gonadotrophin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody result.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
