      This clinical study is to determine whether daily administration of a formulation of 552-02
      improves the dry mouth condition in subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether daily administration of
      an oromucosal formulation of 552-02 improves the global assessment of dry mouth, as assessed
      by visual analog scale (VAS), in subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety of daily administration of an oromucosal formulation of 552-02 in
           subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.

        -  To evaluate whether administration of an oromucosal formulation of 552-02 improves the
           subjective measurement of 6 different salivary functions, as measured using VAS, in
           subjects with primary Sjögren's syndrome.

             for at least 30 days before study participation and at least 30 days after the
             completion of dosing.

          -  Good health, as determined by a medical history, a physical examination, a detailed
             oral examination, 12-lead ECG, and measurement of clinical chemistry, hematology,
