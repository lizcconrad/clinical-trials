  <official_title>Phase I, Open-label, 3-way Crossover Trial in Healthy Male Volunteers to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics of TMC114 and TMC41629 After a Single Oral Dose of 2 Controlled-release Coformulations as Compared to an Immediate-release Coformulation of TMC114/TMC41629</official_title>

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability (the degree to which a drug
      becomes available in the body after administration) of 3 different pharmaceutical
      preparations of a combination of two drugs, TMC114 and TMC41629. There will be 1 single oral
      intake (intake by mouth) of each of the 3 preparations. The study will also investigate the
      safety of use and the potential side effects of TMC114 and TMC41629, and determine the
      circulating levels of both compounds in your blood over time (pharmacokinetics), after a
      single intake.

      TMC41629 is a new investigational drug for the treatment of HIV. TMC114, is also known as
      Darunavir. In this randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open label trial
      (investigator and healthy volunteer know the name of the study medication), each healthy
      volunteer will receive a single dose of TMC114/TMC41629, in 3 subsequent sessions, Treatment
      A, Treatment B and Treatment C. Each capsule is equivalent to a dose of 200 mg of TMC114 and
      23.67 mg of TMC41629. Treatment A (immediate-release formulation) will serve as reference
      formulation. All medication intakes will be orally and in fasted conditions.The study
      duration is at least 19 days, excluding screening and follow-up visits with three single
      intakes with 72 hours follow-up per intake. Each volunteer will receive a single dose of each
      formulation. TMC114/TMC41629 is formulated as an oral immediate-release hard-gelatin capsule,
      as an oral gastro-resistant hard-gelatin capsule, enteric-coated and as an oral
      gastro-resistant hard-gelatin capsule, colon-targeted. Each capsule is equivalent to a dose
      of 200 mg of TMC114 and 23.67 mg of TMC41629.
