      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill
      tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy, such as yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres that
      deliver a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor, may kill more tumor cells and cause
      less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Capecitabine may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation
      therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of yttrium Y 90 glass
      microspheres when given together with capecitabine in treating patients with liver
      cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Establish the maximally tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres in combination
           with capecitabine in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or liver metastases.

        -  Characterize the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also
      receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres by intra-arterial hepatic infusion on days 1-7 of
      course 2.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
