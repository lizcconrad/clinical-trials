  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with schizophrenia,
      schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar I disorder who also have metabolic syndrome have a
      larger decrease in fasting non-high density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol levels with
      aripiprazole than with their current atypical antipsychotic treatment (olanzapine,
      risperidone, or quetiapine).

    <measure>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in Fasting Non-high Density Lipoprotein (Non-HDL) Cholesterol Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 16</time_frame>
    <description>Based on Last Observation Carried Forward data. Non-HDL cholesterol is defined as the difference between total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Fasting non-HDL cholesterol is defined as the measured fasting HDL cholesterol level subtracted from the measured fasting total cholesterol level.</description>

    <description>AE=any new untoward medical event or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that may or may not be causally related to treatment. SAE=any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; is life-threatening, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or an important medical event; requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant incapacity or drug dependency or abuse.</description>

    <measure>Mean Changes From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S scale is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of a patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; or 7=extremely ill.</description>

    <description>Any value falling outside of the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the investigator at the site. The investigator will indicate whether or not a flagged value is of clinical significance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQoL-Lite) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, and 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IWQoL-Lite is a 31-item self-report survey that assesses the impact of weight on quality of life (QoL) in obese patients. Total score=the sum of scores(ranging from 1-5 for each item) for all 31 items. The sum is then rescaled to a 0-100 scoring, with 0 representing the poorest and 100 the best QoL. The survey also assesses improvements in QoL that occur with weight losses of 5% or greater and deteriorations in QoL with weight gain of 5% or greater. A change of 7.8 to 12.0 points from baseline=meaningful improvement. A change of -4.5 to -7.6 points from baseline=meaningful deterioration.</description>

        <title>Mean Changes From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Scale</title>
        <description>The CGI-S scale is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of a patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; or 7=extremely ill.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Impact of Weight on Quality of Life (IWQoL-Lite) Scores</title>
        <description>The IWQoL-Lite is a 31-item self-report survey that assesses the impact of weight on quality of life (QoL) in obese patients. Total score=the sum of scores(ranging from 1-5 for each item) for all 31 items. The sum is then rescaled to a 0-100 scoring, with 0 representing the poorest and 100 the best QoL. The survey also assesses improvements in QoL that occur with weight losses of 5% or greater and deteriorations in QoL with weight gain of 5% or greater. A change of 7.8 to 12.0 points from baseline=meaningful improvement. A change of -4.5 to -7.6 points from baseline=meaningful deterioration.</description>
