  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was intended to assess how well inhaled NVA237 opens up the airways of patients
      with mild, moderate or severe COPD over a 24 hour period after a 14 day treatment period.

    <time_frame>From Day 1 to 0-24 hours after drug administration on Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) was calculated as the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second as measured by a spirometer. This outcome measures the change is FEV1 from predose (day 1) to the readings taken 0-24 hours post dose on day 14. The variable was analyzed with an analysis-of-covariance model which included baseline FEV1 value as a covariate.</description>

          <title>Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) AUC 0-12 Hours on Day 14</title>
          <description>Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) was calculated as the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second as measured by a spirometer. This outcome measures the change is FEV1 from pre-dose (day 1) to the readings taken 0-12 hours post dose on day 14. The variable was analyzed with an analysis-of-covariance model which included baseline FEV1 value as a covariate.</description>
