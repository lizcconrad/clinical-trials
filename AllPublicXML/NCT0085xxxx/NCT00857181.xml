  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether the oscillation of cytokine concentrations in serum
      is able to predict the development of infection in patients with liver cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with liver cirrhosis frequently develop bacterial, viral or fungal infections which
      are the main trigger for decompensation of cirrhosis and development of complications and
      thereby infection hugely impacts morbidity and mortality in these patients. However, there is
      no clinical test available that allows rapid, on-site decision making if a patient is likely
      to develop an infection. The purpose of this study is to measure cytokines interleukin (IL)
      6, IL8, IL10 and TNFalpha in patients with liver cirrhosis over a long follow-up period and
      test whether these inflammatory markers are able to predict the occurrence of infection
      before it becomes clinically significant. For this purpose, one hundred fifty consecutive
      patients with diagnosis of liver cirrhosis will be followed bi-monthly for 18 months. Blood
      samples will be collected for the cytokine measurements and infection cases will be reported
      at each study visit.
