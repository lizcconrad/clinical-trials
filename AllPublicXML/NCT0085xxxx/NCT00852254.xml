  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel method to measure cardiac index based on ultrasound indicator dilution technology
      (UIDT) has been developed by Transonic Systems Inc. (Ithaca, NY, USA). The method overcomes
      many of the limitations that have plagued the existing techniques used to measure cardiac
      index in critically ill children.

      In the proposed investigation, the investigators hope to validate a novel application of an
      existing technology in critically ill infants and children. The primary aim of this study is
      to determine the accuracy of cardiac index measured by UIDT when compared to the
      gold-standard Fick technique. The primary hypothesis is that the average of three consecutive
      measurements of cardiac index by UIDT will be accurate when compared to the Fick technique.
      Secondary aims will be to determine the precision of the measurement, the feasibility of the
      technique with regards to time required and any complications encountered. An exploratory
      secondary aim of this study is to determine whether central blood volume (CBV) derived from
      indicator transit time (ITT) correlates with central venous pressure (CVP) and
      echocardiography derived measures of preload.

        Pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) with in situ arterial and central venous

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: less than 18 years.

          -  Admission to the CICU (Cardiac Intensive Care Unit) (8S) or MISICU (Medical-Surgical
             Intensive Care Unit) (7S) of the Children's Hospital Boston.

          -  Presence of a central venous catheter with its tip in the superior vena cava or a
             catheter in the pulmonary artery, documented by radiography.

          -  Requirement for mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.

          -  Presence of an arterial catheter.

          -  Patients must have a two ventricle circulation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Endotracheal tube leak of greater than 10%.

          -  A significant air leak around the endotracheal tube makes VO2 impossible to measure.

          -  Presence of relevant intracardiac shunt.

          -  Intracardiac shunt will decrease the area under the arterial dilution curve
             unpredictably, making cardiac index calculations unreliable.

          -  A patent foramen ovale and a single ventricular septal defect less than or equal to
             2mm or an atrial septal defect less than or equal to 3mm will be considered irrelevant
             for the purposes of this study.

          -  Previous enrollment in an incompatible research study.

          -  Current or prior diagnosis of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  A small amount of heparin is required to flush the extracorporeal AV (Arteriovenous)
             loop that is required for the measurements.

          -  Pneumothorax with ongoing air leak.

          -  An air leak will invalidate the measurement of VO2.
