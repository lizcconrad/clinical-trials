    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common and disabling condition associated with psychiatric and medical
      comorbidities and often persists despite currently available treatments. Acupuncture has been
      reported to benefit individuals with insomnia and can decrease hyperarousal. This blinded RCT
      will investigate the impact of a standardized acupuncture protocol on insomnia, daytime
      symptoms, and hyperarousal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common problem that is disabling and that frequently persists despite available
      medical and behavioral approaches. It is associated significant psychiatric and medical
      comorbidities and high medical and societal costs. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRA's)
      and cognitive behavioral therapies are common treatments, but despite these, insomnia remains
      a pervasive problem. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments are being used
      widely for the treatment of insomnia, but many of these modalities have sparse research
      support. There are numerous reports in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)literature of
      dramatic benefits of acupuncture for the treatment of insomnia, but carefully designed
      studies are limited. Insomnia has been associated with hyperarousal and acupuncture has
      documented effects on autonomics with a shift towards parasympathetic predominance. In
      consultation with experts in acupuncture and TCM, we developed a protocol for the treatment
      of insomnia and have used it clinically with good success.

      We will be conducting a 3-year exploratory pilot randomized-controlled blinded trial (RCT) of
      this protocol on 56 adults with insomnia disorder, utilizing a control condition involving
      placement of placebo needles. We seek to determine the effect size of this acupuncture
      intervention in comparison to the control condition in preparation for a more definitive
      study, with the future primary aim to determine if acupuncture is effective and well
      tolerated in the treatment of insomnia. Measures will include self-report and objective
      measures of sleep quality and duration including polysomnography (PSG). Secondary-exploratory
      aims will be to determine the impact of this acupuncture protocol on daytime symptoms of
      insomnia such as fatigue, anxiety, and depression as well as to explore the impact of
      acupuncture on self-report and objective measures of hyperarousal.

    <description>PSG is the &quot;gold standard&quot; objective measure of sleep, which complements in-home diary measures and actigraphy.

    <description>A 19-item questionnaire developed by Buysse et. al. that rates the subject's habitual sleep over the past month(109). The 19 questions are combined into seven clinically-derived component scores, each weighted equally from 0-3.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ages 18-60;

          2. Ability to speak, read, and write English;

          3. Insomnia disorder, as defined by RDC, of 3 months or greater duration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of serious psychiatric Axis I DSM-IV disorders such as bipolar or psychotic
             disordersâ€”as individuals with conditions may respond differently than insomnia
             disorder to the acupuncture intervention, potentially confounding the results;

          2. Active suicidal ideation or active psychosis, as this may present a concern regarding
             safety for a subject's participation in this study;

          3. Presence of depressive or anxiety disorders of moderate or greater severity based on
             either HAM-D scores or HAM-A scores of 14 or greater;

          4. Presence of unstable medical conditions commonly associated with significant sleep
             disturbance, e.g. uncompensated congestive heart failure, as this would not be
             expected to respond to the acupuncture intervention;

          5. Presence of other sleep disorder, such as periodic limb movement disorder or sleep
             apnea, as these conditions would require other medical treatmentâ€”this will be based on
             known history of sleep disorder or findings on screening PSG of apnea-hypopnea index
             of &gt; 10 or periodic limb movement index of &gt;10;

          6. Alcohol use &gt; 14 beverages/week, as this may impact on response to the intervention
             and assessment measures;

          7. Ongoing use of any recreational drugs;

          8. Ongoing use of benzodiazepines, prescription hypnotic medication, over-the-counter
             hypnotic medication, or nutritional supplements with purported hypnotic effects;

          9. Ongoing use of other psychotropic medication, such as psychostimulants, or
             antipsychotics;

         10. Caffeine use &gt; the equivalent of 5 cups of coffee/day;

         11. Pregnancy, as the safe use of acupuncture in pregnancy has not been established;

         12. Active malignancy, autoimmune condition, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs;

         13. Presence of coagulopathy or use of anticoagulant medication;

         14. Active involvement in any psychotherapy or other treatment specifically directed
             towards insomnia;

         15. Prior experience with acupuncture treatment in the last 6 months or prior
             participation in an acupuncture research study.
