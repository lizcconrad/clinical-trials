    <textblock>
      Patient stem cells will be mobilized with induction chemotherapy (R)-ICE and G-CSF. If
      sufficient cells can be mobilized, patients will be treated with high-dose chemotherapy and a
      transplant of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with an antiviral vector (M87o). If
      autologous CD34+ yield is insufficient, allogeneic gene-modified cells will be given, if a
      compatible donor is available. To minimize risk of transplant failure, a second unmodified
      CD34+ cell transplant will be given one week after the first transplant.
