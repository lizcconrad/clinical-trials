  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased access to highly reinforcing sedentary behaviors in the home such as TV and
      computers are associated with overweight in youth. Reducing these behaviors reduces
      overweight and prevents increases in overweight in youth who are at risk, likely by
      increasing physical activity and/or reducing energy intake. Reducing access to highly
      reinforcing sedentary activities frees-up time and youth must choose to reallocate their time
      between engaging in other, less reinforcing sedentary activities or physical activity.
      Neighborhood environments that provide easy access to reinforcing physical activities such as
      those at parks may result in greater increases in physical activity when access to highly
      reinforcing home sedentary behaviors is reduced. The investigators have found in 3 data sets
      of youth ranging in age from 4 to 16 years that the proportion of park and recreation area to
      residential area within ½ mile of the child's home parcel (park and recreation index)
      independently predicted the physical activity of youth. The investigators also found that
      increases in physical activity when access to sedentary behaviors were reduced for 3 weeks
      was related to park area within ½ mile of the child's home. The aim of this study is to
      decrease access to home sedentary behaviors for 4 months and determine if changes in physical
      activity habits are related to access to parks and recreation areas in the neighborhood
      environment. The investigators propose to study 128 sedentary overweight male and female
      12-14 year-old youth recruited from parcels within Erie County, New York that have a high or
      low park and recreation index. Groups will be matched on racial/ethnic distribution and
      socioeconomic status. Subjects living at low and high park access parcels will then be
      equally randomized to groups that reduce targeted sedentary behavior (TV, computer use) time
      by 50% using TV Allowance devices placed on each TV/monitor in the home or a control group
      that has the same experimental experiences including TV Allowance devices placed on each
      TV/monitor, but programmed to not limit access to targeted sedentary behavior. Subjects will
      wear both accelerometers and wrist-watch-type global positioning systems to determine changes
      in the duration and intensity of physical activity in various parcel types, including parks.
      The investigators hypothesize differential responses in physical activity and the utilization
      of parks for physical activity. The group of youth that live at parcels with high access to
      parks and that incur a 50% reduction in sedentary behavior will have greater increases in
      physical activity, number of visits to parks and will accrue greater physical activity at
      parks than youth in the other 3 treatment groups. The investigators hypothesize that the
      alterations in physical activity will be mediated by parent modeling of physical activity and
      individual differences in the motivation to be physically active. The investigators
      hypothesize that there will be a main effect of reduction in access to sedentary behaviors on
      energy and fat intake and percent overweight.

    <description>Access to sedentary behaviors: Reduced access - reduce access to sedentary behaviors by 50% using TV Allowance technology. Usual access - monitoring only, no change in access to sedentary behaviors. Access to neighborhood parks: High access - large amount of park land very near to the child's home. Low access - little to no park land near the child's home.</description>
