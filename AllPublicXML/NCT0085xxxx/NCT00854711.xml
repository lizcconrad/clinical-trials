  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium, termed ischemia/reperfusion during the treatment of MI
      may result in paradoxical myocardial injury compromising myocardial salvage and left
      ventricular functional recovery. Nitric oxide (NO) modulates many of the processes
      contributing to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR)and inhaled NO (iNO) has been shown to
      decease infarct size in animal models of IR. iNO has been studied in various clinical
      settings and has shown promise im modulating the detrimental effects of IR. Clinical toxicity
      potentially associated with the use of iNO was of no apparent concern in these studies.
      Although controlled trials of iNO therapy in humans with acute MI have not been published,
      anecdotal experience indicates a beneficial impact of iNO on the hemodynamic course of
      patients with right ventricular MI. iNO is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxemia and acute
      pulmonary hypertension. iNO has been studied at this dose in various clinical settings and
      side effects related to its use at such doses are extremely uncommon. The effect of iNO on IR
      injury in patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI is unknown. The investigator intend to
      perform a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of iNO in patients with
      acute MI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention to determine whether this form of
      therapy can decrease infarct size and improve clinical outcomes.

      Eligible consenting patients will be randomly assigned to either of the 2 treatment arms
      using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Treatment arms: 1) Intervention group,
      treated with inhalation of a mixture of NO 80 ppm and oxygen; or, 2) Control group,
      inhalation oxygen and nitrogen (placebo). In both groups, oxygen will be administered at the
      minimal FiO2 required to maintain arterial oxygen saturation determined by pulse oxymetry
      &gt;97%. Inhalation treatment will be given throughout the angioplasty procedure via a reservoir
      face mask and a dedicated respiratory circuit. Nitric oxide will be delivered using an
      FDA-approved device marketed in Israel under license by the Ministry of Health. The device is
      in routine clinical use in intensive care units, neonatal care units, and catheterization
      laboratories. An NO-level detector will be employed in the catheterization laboratory to
      monitor the ambient NO exposure of the staff.

      Upon arrival in the catheterization laboratory, a 40 ml blood sample will be obtained for a
      full chemistry panel, lipid levels, complete blood count. Creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB
      fraction, and troponin I will be measured at baseline and every 4 hours following the
      angioplasty procedure during the first 24 hours, and then every 6 hours during the second and
      third days, and as clinically indicated thereafter.Methemoglobin levels will be measured at
      baseline, every 30 minutes throughout the interventional procedure, at procedure completion,
      and at 4 hours post procedure.

      All patients will undergo diagnostic angiography and interventional procedures as per
      standard clinical practice. Post procedural pharmacotherapy, sheath removal, and deployment
      of hemostatic devices will be left to the discretion of the attending physicians.

      Following treatment in the catheterization laboratory, medical treatment throughout
      hospitalization and recommendations for therapy after discharge will be left to the
      discretion of the attending cardiologists managing patient care on the hospital wards. These
      cardiologists will be blinded to the patient randomization status.
