      The objective is to conduct an exploratory study on the effect of Omalizumab on COPD patients
      with elevated IgE. Exploratory outcomes include to determine whether Omalizumab use: reduces
      exacerbations in COPD patients; or improves rescue medication use, decreases ICS use,
      modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea score, St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), forced expiratory volume at one second
      (FEV1)(the latter 3 with BMI make up the BODE score), residual volume (RV), total lung
      capacity (TLC), exhaled nitric oxide (ENO), and determination C-reactive protein (CRP).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Smoking-related COPD and aged between 40 and 70 yrs.

          -  Total IgE of 30-700 IU and a positive RAST or skin prick test result to one or more
             perennial environmental allergens (e.g. dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae,
             Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus), cockroach, dog, or cat.)

          -  Any race or sex; women with childbearing potential are required to use an acceptable
             method for birth control and have a negative pregnancy test

          -  History of ≥2 exacerbations during 2 yrs previous to the enrollment date

          -  An exacerbation will be defined as an increase or new onset of more than one of the
             following: cough, sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, or chest tightness with a duration of at
             least 3 days requiring antibiotic or systemic steroid treatment. The severity of an
             exacerbation will be determined by the following:

          -  Mild: Home management, with or without contacting a health care provider, or
             unscheduled office visit

          -  Moderate: Requiring a visit to an emergency department

          -  Severe: Requiring hospitalization

          -  Very Severe: Requiring intubation and medical ventilation

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1 30-64% of predicted; the first 5 subjects enrolled will be
             required to have post-bronchodilator FEV1 50-64%

          -  Post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7

          -  Smokers or ex-smokers with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history

          -  Able to communicate meaningfully with the study personnel and to understand and read
             fluently in English

          -  Written informed consent;

          -  BODE score 3-10.

        Exclusion Criteria:
