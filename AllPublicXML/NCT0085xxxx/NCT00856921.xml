  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AAAS gene has been known to cause achalasia, alacrima, adrenal abnormalities and a
      progressive neurological syndrome. A considerable proportion of achalasia patients have been
      known to show alacrima (decreased secretion of tears). However, the genetic mechanism between
      achalasia and alacrima has not been defined yet. The investigators postulated that some
      proportions of early-onset achalasia could be correlated with AAAS gene; thus, the
      investigators aimed to investigate the relationship between the AAAS gene and early-onset
      achalasia.
