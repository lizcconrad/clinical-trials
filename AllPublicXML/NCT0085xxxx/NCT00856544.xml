  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is intended to provide evidence that CP-690,550 dosed 5 mg BID and 10 mg
      BID is safe and effective when used in combination with a variety of traditional disease
      modifying antirheumatic drugs in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is intended to
      confirm the benefits of CP-690,550 in improving signs and symptoms and physical function that
      were observed in the Phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis studies.

    <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

DAS28-4 (ESR) less than or equal to (&lt;=)3.2 implied low disease activity, greater than (&gt;)3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, less than (&lt;)2.6=remission.

        <title>36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Month 9 and 12</title>
        <description>SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The score for a section is an average of the individual question scores, which are scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning) and is reported as 2 summary scores; physical component score and mental component score. Total score range for the summary scores = 0-100, where higher score represents higher level of functioning.</description>

        <population>FAS population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.

        <description>MOS-SS: participant-rated 12 item questionnaire to assess constructs of sleep over past week. It included 7 subscales: sleep disturbance, snoring, awakened short of breath, sleep adequacy, somnolence, sleep quantity and optimal sleep. Participants responded whether their sleep was optimal or not by choosing yes or no. Number of participants with optimal sleep are reported.</description>

        <title>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Baseline, Month 1, 3, and 6</title>
        <description>FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

        <title>Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D)- Health State Profile Utility Score at Baseline, Month 3 and 6</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (&quot;confined to bed&quot;). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, 6</time_frame>
        <population>FAS population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points for each group respectively.</population>

          <title>Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) Score at Baseline, Month 3 and 6</title>
          <description>WLQ: participant-reported 25-item scale to evaluate degree to which health problems interfere with an ability to perform job roles along 4 dimensions: time management scale (5-items); physical demands scale (6-item); mental-interpersonal demands Scale (9-items); output demands scale (5-items). All the scales ranged from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time). Work loss index, which represented percentage of lost work over time period relative to a normative population, was derived (total score:0[no loss] to 100[complete loss of work]).</description>
          <population>FAS population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for each parameter at given time points for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Work Productivity and Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) at Baseline, Month 3 and 6</title>
        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)-HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months for direct, indirect medical cost domains. Direct cost:visit to doctor, non-medical practitioner, nursing home, hospital, surgery, emergency room(ER) treatment, diagnostic tests, over-night stay, home healthcare services, aids/devices used. Indirect costs associated with functional disability:employment status, willingness to work, work disability due to RA, sick leave,part time work, ability to perform chores, chores done by family/friends/housekeeper. Assessment was based on 0 to 2-point scale;higher score=higher medical cost.</description>

        <population>FAS population included participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for each parameter at given time points for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Work Productivity and Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) at Month 12</title>
        <description>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)-HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months for direct, indirect medical cost domains. Direct cost:visit to doctor,non-medical practitioner,nursing home,hospital,surgery,emergency room(ER) treatment,diagnostic tests, over-night stay,home healthcare services, aids/devices used. Indirect costs associated with functional disability:employment status,willingness to work,work disability due to RA,sick leave,part time work,ability to perform chores,chores done by family/friends/housekeeper. Assessment was based on 0 to 2-point scale;higher score=higher medical cost.</description>
