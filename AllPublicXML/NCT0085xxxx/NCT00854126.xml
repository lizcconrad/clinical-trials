  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating oral doses of GDC-0980 administered to patients with
      incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy or NHL that has progressed or
      failed to respond to at least one prior regimen or for which there is no standard therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid
             malignancies, or NHL without leukemic phase, that has progressed despite standard of
             care therapy or for which there is no standard therapy of proven clinical benefit

          -  A biopsy-accessible lesion from which tissue can be obtained safely

          -  Evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST and/or the following: prostate cancer
             patients with non-measurable disease are eligible if they have two rising
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels that meet the PSA Working Group criteria for
             progression prior to initiation of study treatment; ovarian cancer patients with
             non-measurable disease are eligible if they have two rising CA-125 levels greater than
             the ULN &gt;= 2 weeks apart prior to initiation of study treatment.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at screening

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic and organ function within 28 days before initiation of GDC-0980

          -  Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for both men and
             women while participating in the study

          -  For patients participating in DCE-MRI assessments: at least one metastatic lesion
             measuring &gt;/= 3 cm in the liver or &gt;/= 2 cm elsewhere (lung and mediastinum lesions
             are ineligible) in at least one dimension (on CT scan)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Leptomeningeal disease as the only manifestation of the current malignancy

          -  History of Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus requiring regular medication

          -  Known HIV infection

          -  Any other diseases, active or controlled pulmonary dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction,
             physical examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable
             suspicion of a disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational
             drug or that may affect the interpretation of the results or renders the patients at
             high risk from treatment complications

          -  Significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of Day 1

          -  Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0980

             bony metastases), or herbal therapy as cancer therapy within 3 weeks prior to
             initiation of GDC-0980

          -  Palliative radiation to bony metastases within 2 weeks prior to initiation of GDC-0980

          -  Need for chronic corticosteroid therapy of &gt;=10 mg of prednisone per day or an
