    <textblock>
      The goals of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequentially blocking the
      angiogenesis pathway via known antiangiogenic mechanisms, first with bevacizumab and then
      addition of oral cyclophosphamide upon progression of cancer through bevacizumab. The drugs
      used in this study were chosen because of their known antiangiogenic properties,
      tolerability, and anti-ovarian cancer effects.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the efficacy of a sequential antiangiogenic blockade regimen of bevacizumab then
           cyclophosphamide with bevacizumab at disease progression in patients with recurrent
           ovarian cancer as measured by the proportion of patients who remain on study at three
           months (4 cycles)

        -  Assess the safety profile with respect to gastrointestinal perforations

      Secondary

        -  Assess other toxicity/ safety profile of this metronomic antiangiogenic approach

        -  Assess preliminary response rate and proportion of patients on study at 6 months

        -  Assess progression-free survival, time to progression and overall survival

      Correlative

        -  Determine if biological correlates of angiogenesis are altered by the addition of
           sequential therapy

        -  Determine if changes in biological markers are correlated with clinical state of cancer

        -  Determine whether biomarkers of angiogenesis can predict and measure response

        -  Determine whether oncogenic mutations predict response

        -  Determine whether hypertension and urinary biomarkers such as varying levels of
           albuminuria predict response to bevacizumab

        -  Determine patient risk factors for hypertension and proteinuria as toxicities of
           bevacizumab

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This study used a two-stage design to evaluate safety and efficacy of sequential
      antiangiogenic blockade with a regimen of bevacizumab then cyclophosphamide added at disease
      progression. Safety was measured by the incidence of grade 3-5 gastrointestinal perforation
      (GIP) during the first 3 months of therapy and efficacy by completion of at least 3 months of
      therapy. The sample size was determined based on efficacy with the null and alternative
      therapy completion rate of 50% and 80%, respectively. If 6 or more patients enrolled in the
      stage one cohort (n=9 patients) completed at least 3 months of therapy then accrual would
      proceed to stage two (n=11 patients) if there were fewer than 2 cases of grade 3-5 GIP. There
      was 0.75 probability of stopping the trial at stage one if the true therapy completion rate
      was 50%. If 13 or fewer patients remained on therapy for at least 3 months by the end of
      stage two, this regimen would be deemed ineffective. The power to reject the null hypothesis
      with a one-sided binomial test was 87% assuming 5% significance.

    <measure>Therapy Completion Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Serologic and radiologic disease assessments occurred every 2 cycles/6 weeks on treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort was 7.5 months (range 0.7-20.7).</time_frame>
    <description>The therapy completion rate is defined as the proportion of participants who completed at least 3 months/4 cycles of therapy. Participants were treated until disease progression on the combination regimen or unacceptable toxicity. Clinical response was evaluated based on RECIST 1.0 criteria for measurable disease (MD) participants and Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA-125 (Rustin) criteria for non-MD participants. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Serologic PD is rise in CA-125 or previously normal CA125 that rises to &gt;/=2xULN documented, both requiring 2nd confirmation.</description>

    <measure>Grade 3-5 Gastrointestinal Perforation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed each cycle/3 weeks throughout treatment from time of first dose and up to day 30 post-treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort was 7.5 months (range 0.7-20.7).</time_frame>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Radiologic disease assessments occurred every 2 cycles/6 weeks on treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort was 7.5 months (range 0.7-20.7).</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve confirmed stable disease (SD) or better on treatment based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started. SD is neither PR nor PD. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Radiologic disease assessments occurred every 2 cycles/6 weeks on treatment and every 3 months in follow-up until PD, death or lost to follow-up. Median treatment duration was 7.5 months (range 0.7-20.7) and survival follow-up 23 months..</time_frame>
    <description>PFS estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods is defined as the duration of time from the start of bevacizumab alone to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from the study or death. If participant ultimately received both bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide then it was the time until PD on both agents. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Serologic PD is rise in CA-125 or previously normal CA-125 that rises to &gt;/=2xULN documented, both requiring 2nd confirmation. Participants who were event-free were censored at the date of their last disease evaluation.</description>

        <title>Therapy Completion Rate</title>
        <description>The therapy completion rate is defined as the proportion of participants who completed at least 3 months/4 cycles of therapy. Participants were treated until disease progression on the combination regimen or unacceptable toxicity. Clinical response was evaluated based on RECIST 1.0 criteria for measurable disease (MD) participants and Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) CA-125 (Rustin) criteria for non-MD participants. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Serologic PD is rise in CA-125 or previously normal CA125 that rises to &gt;/=2xULN documented, both requiring 2nd confirmation.</description>
        <time_frame>Serologic and radiologic disease assessments occurred every 2 cycles/6 weeks on treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort was 7.5 months (range 0.7-20.7).</time_frame>

        <title>Clinical Benefit Response Rate</title>
        <description>Clinical benefit response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve confirmed stable disease (SD) or better on treatment based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started. SD is neither PR nor PD. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</title>
