  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the use of the patients own immune cells to treat prostate cancer.
      Cells are taken from the patient and grown in the laboratory to become specialized immune
      cells called dendritic cells. Dendritic cells instruct other immune cells to recognize and
      attack foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, or abnormal proteins on cancer cells. A
      protein called Tn-MUC-1 is added to the cells.This protein is present on prostate cancer
      cells. The modified cells are injected back into the patient, with the intention that the
      dendritic cells will instruct other immune cells to attack the prostate cancer cells.

      Patients undergo one standard apheresis to harvest peripheral mononuclear cells for dendritic
      cell vaccine preparation. The modified cells (vaccine) are frozen so that multiple injections
      may be given. Patients my receive up to 5 injections. The vaccine is given either
      intradermally or into a lymph node.

      Patients will undergo blood sample collection for immune response studies on the day of
      treatment and 2 weeks following treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a histologically documented diagnosis of prostate cancer

          -  Subject was surgically castrated at least 3 months prior to study inclusion or has
             been pharmacologically castrated for a minimum of 3 months prior to study inclusion.

          -  Subject must meet one of the following PSA criteria:

               -  A PSA value of ≥20ng/mL (µg/L) obtained 12 months prior to study inclusion OR

               -  A 50% rise in PSA values with a minimum rise of 1.0 ng/ml (µg/L), within 6 months
                  prior to study inclusion OR

               -  A rise in PSA defined by 2 sequential increases in PSA values. inclusion. There
                  must be at least 2 weeks between each qualifying PSA value.
