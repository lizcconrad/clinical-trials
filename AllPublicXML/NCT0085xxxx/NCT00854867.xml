  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety of giving Whole Brain Radiotherapy
      (WBRT) together with intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte®) for patients with
      leptomeningeal metastases. The study will compare the safety of giving DepoCyte at the same
      time as WBRT with giving the drug after WBRT is complete.

    <description>Subjects will receive a total of 38.4 Gray (Gy) WBRT given over 4 weeks. Subjects will receive 3 GyWBRT on Days 1 and 2 and then 1.8 Gy on the third fourth and fifth days of WBRT treatment during Week 1. Subjects will then receive 1.8 Gy WBRT per day; 5 days out of seven, each week for the next 3 weeks. A total of 4 doses of DepoCyte (50 mg of liposomal ARA-C) will be administered intrathecally. The first dose will be administered on Day 3 (or Day 4 or 5) of Week 1, i.e. the third day of radiotherapy treatment when the dosage is reduced to 1.8 Gy. The second dose will be administered on Day 17(+2 days); the third dose will be administered on Day 31 (+2 days); the fourth dose will be administered on Day 45 (+2 days) to complete the induction phase of the protocol. Subjects will continue to receive an additional 6 doses of DepoCyte one dose every 28 days (+2 days) during the maintenance period. The first dose will be given 28 days after the last dose in the induction phase.</description>

        Indication and Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:

        Subjects who are to be included in the study have to meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Informed consent

          -  Male and female, age over 18 years

          -  Solid tumour neoplastic meningitis as demonstrated by a positive lumbar CSF cytology
             (obtained within 21 days prior to treatment initiation) OR Characteristic signs and
             symptoms of neoplastic meningitis PLUS an MRI indicating the presence of meningeal
             tumour (diagnosis to be made by neuro-oncologist and confirmed / signed within the
             CRF). All MRIs will be forwarded for central review and confirmation of diagnosis. In
             case of discrepancy the central review overrides the assessment of the investigator.

          -  CSF flow abnormality excluded by either an MRI scan or a 99Tc-DTPA or 111In-DTPA flow
             study.

        (If a flow abnormality is initially demonstrated but the flow block is subsequently
        documented by another flow study or MRI scan to be relieved following limited field
        radiation therapy, the subject may then be eligible)

          -  If brain metastasis confirmed (including subjects who have had previous stereotactical
             radiosurgery or solitary lesion brain surgery) the lesion should be less than 3cm
             diameter

          -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score more than 24

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

        Laboratory values as follows:

          -  Platelet count more than or equal to 80,000/mm3

          -  ANC more than or equal to 1,000/mm3

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2 x upper limit of normal

          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 3 x upper limit of normal

          -  SGOT (AST) less than or equal to 3 x upper limit of normal

          -  LDH less than or equal to 3 x upper limit of normal

               -  Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative (urine or serum)
                  pregnancy test within 21 days prior to the start of study treatment.

               -  Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of
                  contraception to prevent pregnancy for the duration of the study (e.g. implants,
                  combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or
                  vasectomised partner).

               -  Males must be willing to use an effective method of contraception with their
                  partner to prevent pregnancy for the duration of the study (e.g. implants,
                  combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or
                  vasectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous WBRT

          -  Brain metastases more than 3 cm diameter

          -  Previous IT treatment

          -  Uncontrolled infection including HIV infection

          -  Any present condition that is regarded as contraindication for WBRT and intrathecal
             chemotherapy

          -  Prior treatment with systemic ARA-C

          -  Anticipated hypersensitivity to DepoCyte or ARA-C

          -  Clinically manifest encephalopathy

          -  On anticoagulant therapy

          -  Ventricular peritoneal CSF drain in situ

          -  Subjects unable to comply with study procedures

          -  Pregnancy and lactation Any other investigational drug administered within 21 days
             prior to study entry
