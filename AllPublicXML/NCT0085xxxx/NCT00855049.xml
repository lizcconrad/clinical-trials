  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the systemic absorption of nasally inhaled
      acetaminophen (TylenolÂ®) versus orally ingested acetaminophen by comparing the serum drug
      concentrations of the two groups obtained at various times after study drug administration.

    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at addressing a significant void in the current literature regarding
      nasally administered acetaminophen pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen
      following oral and rectal administration have been well studied but to date there are no
      published studies determining the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen following intranasal
      administration. This route is currently popular among heroin users. Understanding the
      pharmacokinetics of nasally administered acetaminophen will help physicians address the
      important clinical implications of acetaminophen toxicity in this population.

      Ten healthy adult volunteers age 18 to 45 years will be recruited for this pilot project.
      Study participants will be randomized in permuted blocks to receive either oral or intranasal
      administration of a standardized 500 mg dose of acetaminophen. Blood samples will be drawn
      from a peripheral intravenous catheter at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 240, 360, and
      480 minutes after study drug administration and sent to the laboratory for determination of
      serum acetaminophen concentration. After a one week washout period, each participant will
      cross over to receive 500 mg of acetaminophen via the remaining route of administration in
      the second arm of the study. The serial acetaminophen concentrations will be utilized to
      perform pharmacokinetic calculations.
