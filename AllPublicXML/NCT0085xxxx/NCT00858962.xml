  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this protocol is to study the effect of an HIV medication known as
      Raltegravir on Buprenorphine in people who have been receiving the same dose of Buprenorphine
      for at least 3 weeks before study entry. This will be determined by giving Raltegravir along
      with Buprenorphine and by measuring the amount of Raltegravir and Buprenorphine in the blood.
      The investigators will also learn about the effects of Buprenorphine on Raltegravir and about
      the safety of taking these two medications together.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of people who are infected with HIV have acquired it through injection drug
      use. Some of these people are currently being treated with Buprenorphine for their addiction
      and with medications for HIV infection. Raltegravir is a medication that was approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir acts by
      making it more difficult for the virus that causes AIDS to multiply and cause more damage to
      the immune system in someone who is HIV infected.

      Earlier studies looking at the effect of Buprenorphine and HIV medications have shown that
      Buprenorphine and some HIV medications act differently when taken together. It is important
      to learn if taking Buprenorphine and HIV medications together results in changes in the blood
      level of either medication. If the HIV medication affects the level of Buprenorphine in the
      blood, an individual taking Buprenorphine and HIV medications may experience symptoms of
      withdrawal, even while taking their usual dose of Buprenorphine. On the other hand, if
      Buprenorphine decreases the amount of HIV medication in the blood, then the HIV medication
      may be less effective in controlling HIV infection. It is therefore important to learn if
      Raltegravir and Buprenorphine will affect each other when taken together.

      In order to learn about the effects of Buprenorphine and Raltegravir, we will need to measure
      the amount of Buprenorphine in your blood for 24 hours before you have taken Raltegravir and
      then compare that to the amount of Buprenorphine in your blood after you have taken
      Buprenorphine and Raltegravir together .

          <description>HIV negative subjects currently enrolled in Buprenorphine maintenance therapy on a stable dose of BUP for at least 3 weeks were admitted to the HRU for PK sampling at intervals over a 24 hour period. Subjects then received RAL and BUP co-administration for a minimum of 4 days after which a second series of blood draws at intervals over a 24 hour period were conducted.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample size was small, though within the range of similar drug-drug interaction studies. This study utilized a within-subject design with patients acting as their own controls (thereby resulting in less intra-patient variability).</limitations_and_caveats>
