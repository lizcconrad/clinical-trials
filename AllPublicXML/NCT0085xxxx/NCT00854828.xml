  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study evaluating the effectiveness of nonoperative and operative
      treatments. The investigators wish to identify important clinical and radiographic
      determinants of outcomes in the management of adults with symptomatic lumbar scoliosis
      (ASLS).

      Note: Enrollment was complete July 2014. NIAMS funding ended 2/28/17. We continue to follow
      enrolled subjects while we seek additional funding to follow all subjects through 8 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim #1: Compare the outcomes of surgery and nonoperative treatment in patients aged
      40 to 80 with ASLS defined as a lumbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30°, and
      either of the following: Oswestry (ODI) score of 20 or more; or Scoliosis Research Society
      Quality of Life instrument (SRS-QOL) score of 4.0 or less, in the domains of pain, function
      and/or appearance.

      Specific Aim #2: Evaluate the impact of patient factors (age, gender, socioeconomic status,
      education) and comorbidities [mental health, body mass index (BMI) and bone mineral density
      (BMD)] on adverse events and treatment outcomes for both the nonoperative and operative arms.
      Incorporate these variables into a prediction model to help identify those patients most
      likely to benefit from either a surgical or nonoperative approach

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  aged 40 to 80 years with

          -  ASLS defined as lumbar curve with a coronal Cobb measurement ≥ 30°, and either of the
             following: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score ≥ 20 or SRS-QOL score ≤ 4.0 in the
             domains of pain, function and/or appearance.

          -  If assigned to surgical intervention (by randomization or patient preference), the
             intervention plan would include, at a minimum, the Cobb levels of the
             Thoracolumbar/lumbar spine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Substantial cardiac, pulmonary, renal or metabolic disease that, in the judgment of
             the surgical team, would preclude performing an operative procedure without undue risk
             of morbidity and mortality

          -  Concomitant high-grade spondylolisthesis (Grade 3)

          -  Prior thoracic or multiple level lumbar laminectomy or decompression [single or two
             level lumbar decompression (e.g., herniated disc) will not be an exclusion]

          -  Prior thoracic or lumbar fusion

          -  Osteoporosis evidence by a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) T-score &lt;-3.0 at
             hip or lumbar spine for patients considered to be at risk (post menopausal females,
             males &gt; 60 years of age, steroid dependent rheumatoid arthritics, status post organ
             transplantation, etc.). Patients may be randomized prior to obtaining DEXA results.
             Non Surgical patients may initiate non surgical treatments prior to completion of DEXA
             (if required) as non surgical treatments will not affect DEXA results BUT DEXA must be
             completed and results entered within 3 months of enrollment. Surgical patient must
             have DEXA prior to surgical intervention.

          -  Neuromuscular scoliosis (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's
             Disease, post-polio syndrome, Charcot Marie Tooth disease)

          -  Congenital scoliosis in the lumbar spine. Congenital anomalies of the cervical or
             thoracic spine are acceptable.

          -  Spine tumor, infection or connective tissue disorder

          -  Cognitively impaired or unable/unwilling to comply with follow-up

          -  Pregnancy or planning on conceiving during time of study involvement

          -  Ankylosing Spondylitis

          -  Past history of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty of the thoracic or lumbar spine
