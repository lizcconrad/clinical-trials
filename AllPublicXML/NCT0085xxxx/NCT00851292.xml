  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the difference in prostate cancer between two prostate
      biopsy techniques, namely end-firing and side-firing. These differ in the angle at which the
      prostate is biopsied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Research towards the efficacy of transrectal prostate biopsies has predominantly
      focused on the amount of biopsy cores. However, variation in the angle of entrance of the
      biopsy gun has been less studied. It is believed that obtaining biopsy cores by end firing
      will improve the efficacy, because of an improved sampling of the apical region.

      Objectives: To investigate the difference between side and end-firing in transrectal prostate
      needle biopsies in terms of qualitative and quantitative prostate cancer detection.

      Methods: From September 1st 2009 - September 1st 2012, all men with an initial prostate
      biopsy in a representative, Dutch, general hospital with six participating urologists and two
      residents will be subjected to a randomized controlled, single blind, single center,
      diagnostics trial. Men will be randomized for a biopsy using an end-firing or a side-firing
      probe. The primary endpoint is the prostate cancer detection rate; secondary endpoints are
      the number of cores invaded with prostate cancer, nomogram for indolent cancer-score, Gleason
      score, complications and biopsy length.

      Expected outcomes: We hypothesize that no differences between the biopsy techniques exist.
