    <textblock>
      Comparison of efficacy and safety of glargine insulin and metformin as first line drug of
      patients insufficiently treated with lifestyle intervention. So far treatment also algorithm
      with lifestyle and metformin has not been evaluated in patients with type 2 diabetes and
      HbA1C greater or equal 7 % and lower than 8.1%.Besides HbA1C postprandial glucose excursion
      and glycemic variability as determinants of oxidative stress will be measured by continuous
      glucose measurement(CGM). Further more CGM will reveal risk of hypoglycemia at night. As
      secondary objectives effect on endothelial function, renal function and biomarkers of low
      great inflammation will be evaluated. So far only scarce information on face to face
      comparison in ealy diabetes exists.

    <description>Metformin is administered as coated tablet. Initial dose is 500 mg twice a day (morning and evening) during or after the meal. The first administration takes place on the evening of visit 1c. The duration of the therapy is 36 weeks until visit 8c.
Initial dose of 500 mg bid was increased after 4 weeks (visit 2) to 850 mg bid when the patient tolerated the initial dose. If the side effects were not tolerable, the initial dose was decreased to 500 mg once a day and where appropriate increased at a later visit.
After 8 weeks (visit 3) metformin dose was increased to 1000 mg bid when tolerated. If dose is not tolerated, it was decreased to the next lower dose.</description>

    <intervention_name>Insulin glargine</intervention_name>
    <description>Insulin glargine is given subcutaneously with an insulin-pen (SoloStarÂ®). The dose was titrated to reach a fasting plasma glucose value of &lt;5.6 mmol/l. Insulin glargine was given once a day in the evening before going to bed (bed-time injection). The first insulin injection takes place on the evening of visit 1c. The duration of the therapy is 36 weeks until visit 8c. All patients were trained in handling and storage of the insulin-pen.</description>
