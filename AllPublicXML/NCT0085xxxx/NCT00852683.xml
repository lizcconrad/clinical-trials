  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a devastating disease. Some women with breast cancer undergo surgery to
      remove the breast and lymph nodes in the axilla (armpit). Unfortunately, surgery of this type
      is associated with pain both in the days immediately following the operation and in the long
      term. Pain that continues for more than three months after surgery is known as chronic pain
      and affects as many as 1/5 to more than Â½ of patients having this surgery. Often this pain is
      of a particular type known as neuropathic pain. There have been studies demonstrating that
      the intensity of pain after surgery may be related to the likelihood of developing chronic
      pain. It is important to develop methods to reduce acute pain after breast cancer surgery and
      to reduce chronic pain for breast cancer survivors.

      Pregabalin is a medication used in the treatment of chronic pain. It has been shown to be
      effective for neuropathic pain. There has also been one study demonstrating its effectiveness
      in reducing pain after dental extraction. We are interested in determining whether pregabalin
      taken for 14 days starting the day of surgery will reduce acute (short term) pain and chronic
      pain from this type of breast cancer surgery.

      In order to test ability of pregabalin for the reduction of chronic pain it may be necessary
      to follow a large number of patients for up to one year after surgery. This may require
      studying patients in more than one institution. Prior to starting such a large study we are
      proposing a pilot or preliminary study. This study will follow a smaller group of
      participants (68) for 6 months. From the pilot study we will determine the effect of
      pregabalin on acute pain and logistic and statistical information required for the full
      study. We will randomly assign participants to receive pregabalin or placebo (sugar pills)
      for twice daily for 14 days starting one hour before surgery. We will monitor the
      participants' pain at one hour after surgery, 24 hours after surgery, one week, two weeks,
      three months and six months after surgery. We will also monitor for a number of other
      parameters such as medication side effects and the need for other pain medications.
      Recruitment of study participants is expected to take 6-7 months.
