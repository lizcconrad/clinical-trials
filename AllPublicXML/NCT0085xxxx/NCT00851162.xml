      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using mesenchymal stem cells will heal
      benign bone lesion defects faster than demineralized bone matrix

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthobiologics have recently become a mainstay in treating bony defects whether related to
      trauma, tumor, or other various reconstructive entities.1 Historically, benign bone growths
      that were excised, would be filled with either cement, autograft bone, or allograft
      substances. More recently, other substances have been utilized. These substances carry any or
      all osteoinductive, osteoconductive, or osteogenic properties. Various materials have been
      used to fill bony voids specifically related to benign bone growths. Trinityâ„¢ by Blackstone
      Medical inc. is an allograft substance that has recently began utilization. The difference in
      Trinity compared to various other allografts is that it utilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
      along with an allograft carrier to incorporate and induce bone formation. Previously, in
      order for stem cells to be included in grafting, it would require bone marrow aspiration and
      the morbidity that is associated with iliac crest bone grafting.

      Trinity MSC's are pre-immunodepleted and therefore, do not stimulate local T-cell
      proliferation but instead are activated to act as osteoblasts and stimulate bone formation.
      This local response, could accelerate healing, earlier weight-bearing, healing, and filing of
      bone voids in patients that have had excision of bony masses. In previous animal models, the
      use of MSC's have been shown to increase bone healing in critical sized defects.

      Trinity is currently approved for FDA use in bone defects specifically within the spine or
      trauma. It has not been shown to have any significant adverse events over standard bone
      substitute products. We hypothesize benign bone lesions that undergo curettage and filling
      with Trinity will heal faster than bone lesions filled with basic bone grafting.
