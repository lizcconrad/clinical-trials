    <textblock>
      This project addresses a vexing problem that has alluded the best efforts of the
      medical/scientific community: treatment of resistant neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is
      common and includes conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, post herpetic neuralgia and post
      stroke pain and is believed to affect at least 3% of adults. Surveys of patients with
      neuropathic pain indicate that 60% do not receive adequate relief with current treatment.
      Results from recent laboratory and human studies reveal a new approach to treatment. This
      approach is based on the findings that neuroinflammation appears to be involved in
      development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. This study explores the effects of an
      immune-modulating blood-derived product, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), in treating
      neuropathic pain. IVIG is thought to reduce neuroinflammation contributing to neuropathic
      pain. If successful, the study will provide important insights into pain mechanisms and a
      better understanding of how IVIG relieves neuropathic pain.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Reduction in neuroinflammation (NI) markers will co-vary with clinical indicators of
           pain relief

        2. Patients with higher levels of markers of NI will be more likely to respond to IVIG

      This study will employ a randomized double blind cross-over design. A total of 12 subjects
      will be recruited for the study. Once each subject has satisfied the inclusion and exclusion
      criteria and provided informed consent, the subject will be randomized to either the IVIG or
      placebo treatment groups, using a pre-determined randomization list generated by the research
      office at the University of Calgary. Complete responders will begin a monitoring phase,
      partial and non-responders will return for a second cycle in one month. Complete responders,
      with prolonged relief, will cross-over to the alternative treatment when their pain returns
      if this occurs within 6 months of the infusion.
