  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During weaning from mechanical ventilation process, the energy expenditure in T tube is
      greater than pressure support ventilation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The energy expenditure (EE) was measured during the two periods of 30-minutes, with the 10
      first minutes being discarded for analysis purposes. The other variables were recorded and
      monitored during the 10th and the 30th minute, in both pressure support (PS) and t-Tube (TT)
      modes. Patients were randomized in terms of sequence selection: PS - TT or TT - PS. In the
      baseline period, patients were receiving mechanical ventilation (Servo 900C and Servo 300;
      Siemens-Elema, Solna, Sweden), with PS ranging from 10 to 15cmH2O. During the PS mode,
      patients received assisted pressure ventilation of 10 cmH2O, 5 cmH2O of final positive
      expiratory pressure, the sensitivity of -1cmH2O and FiO2 of 0.4. During TT mode, oxygen flow
      was delivered in order to keep the same FiO2 that was provided in PS (0.4) as controlled by
      monitor screen (Datex Ohmeda S/5 - Compact Airway Module, M-COVX model, Finland). In this
      mode, an extensor was employed, one end of which was connected to the oxygen-enriched and the
      other end was secured to a 3-output (&quot;T&quot;) connector, which was attached to the patient's
      ventilatory prosthesis. During the rest period (30 minutes), patients returned to the
      mechanical ventilation parameters utilized in the baseline period.
