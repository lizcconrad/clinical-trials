    <textblock>
      This will be a phase I, randomized, two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential
      study in up to 50 healthy female subjects. The study will be comprised of three treatment
      periods for a total of 4 weeks treatment duration:

      Period I 1 week (Days 1-7) administration of betahistine daily (three times per day; 144
      mg/day total) or matching placebo.

      Period II 1 week (Days 8-14) titration of olanzapine once daily (2.5 to 10 mg) and
      continuation of betahistine or matching placebo administration (daily; three times per day)
      Period III 2 weeks (Days 15-28) of continued co-administration of betahistine/matching
      placebo, three times per day, and olanzapine once daily (7.5 to 10 mg/day)

Period I 1 week (Days 1-7) administration of betahistine 48 mg three times daily (144 mg/day total) or matching placebo Period II 1 week (Days 8-14) titration of olanzapine once daily (from 2.5 mg up to 10 mg) and continuation of betahistine or matching placebo administration (three times daily as in Period I) Period III 2 weeks (Days 15-28) of co-administration of betahistine or matching placebo (three times daily; as in Periods II and III) and olanzapine once daily (7.5 or 10 mg, as tolerated)
On Day 1, after a 7-day screening period, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio:
Betahistine 48 mg TID; 08:00, 13:00 and 18:00 (144 mg/day total) Matching placebo TID; 08:00, 13:00 and 18:00</description>
