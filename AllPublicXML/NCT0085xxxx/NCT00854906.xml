  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine if putting fluorescein onto the eye (most common
      test done for dry eye syndrome) is an accurate way to measure dry eye symptoms. The
      investigators can avoid placing any foreign substance into the eye by using a manual
      keratometer. Therefore, the investigators want to compare the measurements of tear breakup
      time using fluorescein with using a novel method, a manual keratometer and then compare these
      measurements to a validated dry eye symptoms questionnaire. All qualifying patients who were
      scheduled in the Jones Eye Institute Clinics for a complete eye exam were offered information
      about the study and invited to participate. Participants were recruited from February 29,
      2009 to April 14, 2009.Participants who did not meet the study protocol's inclusion and
      exclusion criteria were not included the study or study data analysis. All subjects eyes were
      measured for KTBUT and FTBUT.

      This is an observational study to measure the difference between Keratometric Tear Break Up
      Time (KTBUT) and Fluorescein Tear Break Up Time (FTBUT). All qualified study participants had
      their eyes measured for tear break up time measured with a keratometer and with fluorescein
      dye. In this study, we compare the use of the most common method, fluorescein dye, to measure
      tear break up time to a novel method, a keratometer, to measure tear break up time. Using the
      keratometer avoids instilling fluorescein dye into the tear film and not altering the tear
      film's physiologic environment.

        <title>Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) is a validated 12-item questionnaire used in dry eye studies. The OSDI Scale ranges from 0= Normal to 100= Severe. Subcategories include problems--all of the time, most of the time, half of the time,and none of the time.</description>
        <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
        <population>By comparing the KTBUT and the FTBUT to the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire score of each participant, we will be able to evaluate the difference in tear break up time using these items. The OSDI was given once before the participant's KTBUT and FTBUT was measured.</population>
