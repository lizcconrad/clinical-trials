  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system undergoes a range of changes as individuals become elderly. These may
      manifest as an increasing susceptibility to infection or a tendency to develop autoimmune or
      malignant disease. Multiple underlying factors contribute to this phenomenon of immunological
      aging, and in this study the investigators will examine the possibility that inadequate diet
      may be one such contributing factor. Fruit and vegetable intake, which can be low in the
      elderly, is associated with reduced chronic disease risk. This proposal will test the
      hypothesis that increased fruit and vegetable intake may positively affect clinically
      relevant measures of immune function. One hundred healthy volunteers aged 65-85 years
      following a low fruit and vegetable diet (&lt;=2 portions/d) will be recruited and randomised to
      continue following their normal diet, or to consume at least 5 portions of fruit and
      vegetables daily for 16 weeks. Immune function and biochemical markers of nutritional status
      will be assessed before and after the intervention period.
