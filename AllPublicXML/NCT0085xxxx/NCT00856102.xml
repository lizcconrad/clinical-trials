      The objective of the proposed research is to determine the efficacy of a home-based walking
      exercise program in promoting cognitive-psychosocial functions of men with prostate cancer
      receiving androgen depletion therapy (ADT). ADT is the mainstay treatment for men with
      advanced prostate cancer. However, ADT has a number of side effects including compromised
      cognitive function, depression and anxiety, which negatively impacts the quality of life of
      men with prostate cancer. The central question of the proposed research is to determine if
      exercise will have a positive impact on the quality of life of men with prostate cancer
      undergoing ADT.
