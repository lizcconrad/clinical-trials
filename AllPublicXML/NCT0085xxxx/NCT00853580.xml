  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether Lovastatin ™ significantly improves
      visual spatial learning and/or sustained attention in children with NF1.

      Secondary Aims:

      To evaluate the effect of Lovastatin ™ on measures of executive function, behavior and
      quality of life in children with NF1 and cognitive deficits.

      To further evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of Lovastatin ™ in children with NF1 and
      cognitive deficits.

      Hypotheses

      It is hypothesized that Lovastatin ™ will improve the visual spatial memory and/or attention
      deficits in children with NF1. This is based on studies demonstrating that Lovastatin ™ has
      significantly improved impairments in visual spatial memory and attention in the NF1 murine
      model.

      It is further expected that Lovastatin ™ will be safe and well tolerated over a 16-week
      period.

      Study Design

      This is a prospective multi-centre randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study to determine
      the efficacy of Lovastatin ™ on visual spatial learning and/or attention abilities of
      children with NF1 aged between 8 and less than 16 years. In addition, the effect of
      Lovastatin ™ on secondary measures of executive function, visual spatial skills, behavior and
      quality of life will be assessed. Participants will be randomized to 16-weeks of treatment
      with Lovastatin ™ or a matched placebo. It is plausible and ethical to employ a placebo group
      as no standard therapy with established efficacy is being withheld. There is no cross-over in
      this study due to a lack of data concerning the length of possible washout effects. The
      Lovastatin ™ dose will begin at 20 mg once daily/continuous dosing and escalate over a
      two-week period to 40 mg once daily/continuous dosing and continue at this dose for 14 weeks.
      Participants will be carefully monitored for side effects. The safety of Lovastatin ™ will be
      evaluated using laboratory tests, clinical signs and adverse effects, which will be monitored
      at regular intervals over the 16-week period. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be
      administered at baseline, 16 weeks post-treatment and at follow-up, 8 weeks after cessation
      of treatment to determine any carry-over effects. The safety of Lovastatin ™ will also be
      evaluated, with regular monitoring of side-effects during the trial.

      Study Population

      This is a Phase II study involving children with NF1 (aged between 8 years to 15 years 11
      months old at time of enrollment) with evidence of cognitive impairment, defined as having a
      score of at least one standard deviation or more below the population mean on a measure of
      visual spatial learning and/or attention.

      A total of 142 participants with NF1 aged between 8 years and 15 years 11 months will be
      enrolled in the study. The age limits were selected on the basis that Lovastatin ™ has been
      shown to be safe in children aged between 8 and 17 years old. In addition, one of the primary
      outcome measures (attention) only has normative data for up to 15 years 11 months. Therefore,
      the maximum age limit for participants at time of enrolment is 15 years 11 months so that
      normative data can be used to determine whether participants are impaired. The pediatric NF1
      population is an ideal group in which to study the cognitive effects of Lovastatin ™ because
      it represents an opportunity for early pharmacological intervention of cognitive deficits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Paired Associate Learning (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized test of visuospatial learning. Participants had to remember patterns associated with different locations on the screen, and during the test phase, as each pattern is presented, point to the appropriate location. The test starts at a very simple level and gradually increases in difficulty. Higher number of errors indicates poorer performance. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Score! (Test of Everyday Attention for Children)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Score! is a measure of sustained attention. Participants were required to silently count a series of aurally presented tones and say the total number of tones counted at the end of each trial. The number of tones ranged from 9 to 15, with a total of 10 trials (range 0-10). Higher values represent better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spatial Working Memory (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized measure of spatial working memory. This task assessed the participant's ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory.
In this test, participants were shown an array of boxes on a computer screen and they were required to search through the boxes for hidden tokens. One box at a time was touched until a blue token was found inside. Participants then commenced a new search for the next token. The key instruction was that, once a token had been located, that box would not be used again to hide another token.
Unit of measure was between search errors, determined by the number of boxes a participant reopens in which a token had previously been found. Higher score indicated poorer performance. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>

    <measure>Stockings of Cambridge (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) Automated Battery).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized measure of spatial planning based on the &quot;Tower of London&quot; test. It required participants to move balls in a lower display to match a pattern shown in the upper display in a certain number of moves.
More specifically, the participant was shown two displays containing three coloured balls. The displays were presented in such a way that they could be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in socks suspended from a beam. The test administrator first demonstrated to the participant how to move the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display and completed one demonstration problem, where the solution required one move. The participant then completed problems that increased in difficulty, from one through to five move problems.
The unit of measure was the mean number of moves taken to complete a problem that could not be completed in less than five moves. The higher the score, the poorer the performance (range 5-12).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stop Signal Task (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized measure of inhibitory control. The participant quickly responded to an arrow stimulus by pressing one of two buttons (left or right), depending on the direction in which the arrow pointed on the screen. If an audio tone is present, the subject was supposed to withhold the response.
The difficulty of the task was manipulated by altering the delay before a stop signal (auditory tone) was presented, known as the stop signal delay. The outcome from this measure was stop signal reaction time (last half of test), which was computed by subtracting the mean stop signal delay at which the participant was able to stop on 50% of trials from the mean reaction time on go trials. Poorer response inhibition was reflected by a larger stop signal reaction time. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sky Search (Test of Everyday Attention for Children)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Sky Search is a measure of selective visual attention. Participants were presented with a A3 sheet with target stimuli (spaceships in identical pairs) randomly distributed among many distractors (spaceships in non-identical pairs). They were required to circle as many of the targets as possible as quickly as possible. The outcome measure (attention score), was a timing score reflecting the average time taken per target found. Higher scores represent poorer performance. Raw data are reported. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sky Search DT (Test of Everyday Attention for Children)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Sky Search DT is a test of divided attention. Children completed a parallel version of the Sky Search subtest while at the same time, silently counted the number of tones in a similar way to the Score! subtest. Higher scores represent poorer performance. Raw data are reported. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Creature Counting (Test of Everyday Attention for Children)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Creature Counting is a measure of attentional control. Participants were required to count &quot;creatures&quot; from top of the page to the bottom, using arrows as cues to switch from counting up to counting down (and vice versa). There were seven testing trials. The outcome variable was the total number of correct trials (range 0-7). Higher scores represent better performances.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Commission Errors (Conners Continuous Performance Test, Second Edition; CPT-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A computerised measure of impulse control. Letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Commission errors represented the number of times a participant incorrectly responded to the non-target (letter 'X'). T-scores are reported, as generated by the test software. Higher scores indicate poorer performances.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Omission Errors (Conners Continuous Performance Test, Second Edition; CPT-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post-treatment (16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A computerised measure of vigilance and concentration. Letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter 'X' which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Omission errors represented the number of times a participant fails to respond to target letters (all other than 'X'). T-scores are reported, as generated by the test software. Higher scores indicate poorer performances.</description>

        <title>Spatial Working Memory (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery)</title>
        <description>A computerized measure of spatial working memory. This task assessed the participant’s ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory.
In this test, participants were shown an array of boxes on a computer screen and they were required to search through the boxes for hidden tokens. One box at a time was touched until a blue token was found inside. Participants then commenced a new search for the next token. The key instruction was that, once a token had been located, that box would not be used again to hide another token.
Unit of measure was between search errors, determined by the number of boxes a participant reopens in which a token had previously been found. Higher score indicated poorer performance. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>

        <title>Stockings of Cambridge (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) Automated Battery).</title>
        <description>A computerized measure of spatial planning based on the &quot;Tower of London&quot; test. It required participants to move balls in a lower display to match a pattern shown in the upper display in a certain number of moves.
More specifically, the participant was shown two displays containing three coloured balls. The displays were presented in such a way that they could be perceived as stacks of coloured balls held in socks suspended from a beam. The test administrator first demonstrated to the participant how to move the balls in the lower display to copy the pattern in the upper display and completed one demonstration problem, where the solution required one move. The participant then completed problems that increased in difficulty, from one through to five move problems.
The unit of measure was the mean number of moves taken to complete a problem that could not be completed in less than five moves. The higher the score, the poorer the performance (range 5-12).</description>

        <title>Stop Signal Task (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery)</title>
        <description>A computerized measure of inhibitory control. The participant quickly responded to an arrow stimulus by pressing one of two buttons (left or right), depending on the direction in which the arrow pointed on the screen. If an audio tone is present, the subject was supposed to withhold the response.
The difficulty of the task was manipulated by altering the delay before a stop signal (auditory tone) was presented, known as the stop signal delay. The outcome from this measure was stop signal reaction time (last half of test), which was computed by subtracting the mean stop signal delay at which the participant was able to stop on 50% of trials from the mean reaction time on go trials. Poorer response inhibition was reflected by a larger stop signal reaction time. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>

Participants were presented with a A3 sheet with target stimuli (spaceships in identical pairs) randomly distributed among many distractors (spaceships in non-identical pairs). They were required to circle as many of the targets as possible as quickly as possible. The outcome measure (attention score), was a timing score reflecting the average time taken per target found. Higher scores represent poorer performance. Raw data are reported. Scale does not have a maximum range.</description>

        <description>A computerised measure of impulse control. Letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter ‘X’ which is a non-target stimulus. Participants responded to target stimuli by pressing the space bar of a computer keyboard (90% of the stimuli) while withholding responses to non-target stimuli (10% of the test). Commission errors represented the number of times a participant incorrectly responded to the non-target (letter ‘X’). T-scores are reported, as generated by the test software. Higher scores indicate poorer performances.</description>

        <description>A computerised measure of vigilance and concentration. Letters were presented serially on a screen in a random order. All letters were considered target stimuli, except for the letter ‘X’ which is a non-target stimulus.

Omission errors represented the number of times a participant fails to respond to target letters (all other than ‘X’). T-scores are reported, as generated by the test software.
