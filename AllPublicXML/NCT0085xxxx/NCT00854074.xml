    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to validate the design of the ElectroCore RMS-1100
      Resolution Motility System™ and the ability to safely place a stimulation electrode in the
      epidural space of the spine in a post-operative subject, and to evaluate the subject's
      ability to tolerate stimulation for up to 48 hours. The secondary goal is to confirm that the
      electrical signal being delivered via this electrode shows evidence of effectiveness in
      improving the functional GI motility in subjects experiencing post-operative paralytic ileus

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of neurostimulation in the epidural
      space in the spine on the activity of the enteric nervous system (ENS).

      ElectroCore has successfully studied POI in an animal model and believes that temporary
      neurostimulation of the spine may be useful in re-starting the ENS in humans, resulting in
      the resumption of coherent GI motility in the gut and normal bowel function in a shorter
      period of time than currently occurs. Electrical pulses will be used to modulate the signals
      that may be preventing a return to normal GI activity. This device and procedure used in this
      study are similar to the system and procedure used to implant the temporary trial stimulator
      used evaluate the effectiveness of spine pain stimulation prior to implantation of the
      permanent device.
