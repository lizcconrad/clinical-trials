  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of optimized oil (enriched with
      micronutriments) on the prevention on cardiovascular diseases.

      Randomised crossover dietary intervention study:

      The main objective of the clinical study is to investigate the effect of the consumption of
      an &quot;optimized&quot; rapeseed oil on the lipid metabolism of volunteers as compared with the
      consumption of a &quot;reference&quot; oil.

      Post prandial study:

      The second objective of the clinical study is to investigate the effect of the consumption of
      an &quot;optimized&quot; rapeseed oil on the biomarkers of oxidative stress during post prandial period
      as compared with the consumption of a &quot;reference&quot; oil.

      For both studies, sedentary men between 30 and 65 years of age, with a BMI between 25 and 30,
      without cardiovascular disorders, will be selected.

      Randomised crossover dietary intervention study:

      Sixty volunteers will be randomised into 2 groups of 30. The study will last 12weeks. The
      first 3 weeks will be an adaptation period or &quot;run in&quot;. Volunteers will have every day20 g of
      the reference rapeseed oil and 20 g of the reference oil-based rapeseed margarine.
      Subsequently, the two groups will follow 2 dietary intervention periods of 3 weeks during
      which the volunteers will have alternatively either the reference oil/margarine or the
      optimized oil/margarine. Three weeks of &quot;wash out&quot; will separate the two dietary
      interventions of the cross over design trial.

      Cardiovascular risk and oxidative stress biomarkers will be assessed in plasma at week 0, 3,
      6, 9 and 12.

      Volunteers will alsoperform dietary surveys at the week 3, 6, 9 and 12.

      Post prandial study:

      16 volunteers will be cast lots among the 60 volunteers. They will be randomised into 2
      groups of 8. The first kinetic study will be done on week 3. 8 subjects will take 66 g of
      reference oil and 8 subjects will take 66 g of the optimized oil. 5 blood samples (20 mL
      each) will be taken.
