      Objective To evaluate the accuracy of data acquisition by Health e pod device in measurement
      of body temperature, to compare it to a standard body temperature measure equipment About 400
      consecutive patients admitted to PEU in Assaf Harofeh Medical Center will compile the Study
      Population.

      Basic vital signs will be recorded on admission and during hospitalization as per the PEU
      policy and not in particular for this study.

      As a part of routine check-up all admitted patients undergo body temperature measure (oral or
      rectal - as per the PEU policy and with PEU devices).

      Following an explanation and patient agreement, eligible patients (and their legal guardian)
      will sign informed consent and enter the study. The health e pod device will be applied to
      measure body temperature, immediately after the standard temperature measure has been
      performed by the PEU professional.
