  <brief_title>Study of Escalating Doses of NRL001 Given in Slow-release Rectal Suppositories of Different Weights</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Dose Escalation Study in Healthy Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single Doses of Rectal Suppositories Containing Between 5 and 15 mg NRL001 or Matching Placebo for Two Different Sized Suppositories (1 g and 2 g).</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies investigating single doses of different NRL001 formulations showed
      formulation-dependent differences in exposure, even though they had similar effects on mean
      anal resting pressure (MARP). This study is a first step in investigating the hypothesis that
      a better balance between desired anal effects and undesired systemic effects can be reached
      with a NRL001-slow release suppository than with previously studied formulations.

      To this purpose, single doses of 5 to 15 mg, administered as 1 g and 2 g suppositories, are
      being investigated with regard to their pharmacokinetics and systemic effects (blood
      pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiographic heart rate).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult male or female volunteers (as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory test values, vital signs, and electrocardiograms [ECGs] at
             screening) aged 18-45 years.

          2. Non-smokers from 3 months of receiving first dose and for the duration of the study.

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 30 kg/m2.

          4. Able and willing to receive rectal treatments.

          5. Able to voluntarily provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          6. Must understand the purposes and risks of the study and agree to follow the
             restrictions and schedule of procedures as defined in the protocol.

          7. Female volunteers must be postmenopausal (for at least one year and confirmed by serum
             FSH at screening), surgically sterile, practising true sexual abstinence, or use two
             highly effective methods of contraception as follows throughout the study until after
             post study physical: contraceptive implants, injectables, combined oral
             contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), vasectomised partner or barrier
             method (condom or occlusive cap) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.

          8. Hormonal and IUD methods of contraception must be established for a period of 3 months
             prior to dosing and cannot be changed or altered during the study.
