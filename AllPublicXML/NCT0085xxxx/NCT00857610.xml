  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical therapy with retinoids is the only proven medical therapy for aged/photoaged human
      skin. However, topical therapy with retinoids often result in unwanted cutaneous dermatitis,
      including erythema and scaling. The reseachers intend to investigate the dose, frequency of
      use, and time dependence of topical retinol-induced dermatitis. The researchers intend to
      evaluate retinoid-induced dermatitis biochemically, including retinol regulation of retinoid
      responsive genes that control retinoid metabolism and serve as markers for retinoid
      bioactivity. The researchers will also investigate the role of EGF receptor pathway in
      retinoid-induced dermatitis.
