  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized double blind clinical trial to test the effect of Naltrexone on HIV
      infected heavy drinkers. The study will select 40 HIV positive patients who meet criteria for
      heavy drinking. Treatments include Naltrexone (25-100mg)and placebo. Patients will be
      treated, followed up, and assessed for a duration of 12 weeks.

      The investigators associated hypotheses Hypothesis 1: Naltrexone will reduce the frequency of
      heavy drinking. Hypothesis 2: Naltrexone will lead to maintenance or improvement in CD4
      lymphocyte count and decreased HIV RNA levels.

      Hypothesis 3: Naltrexone will lead to a reduction in sexual risk behaviors. Hypothesis 4:
      Naltrexone will lead to improved adherence to HAART. Hypothesis 5 (Exploratory): Naltrexone
      will be well-tolerated with minimal side effects and patients will exhibit good treatment
      retention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be HIV-positive.

          2. Report heavy drinking 4 or more times in the past 4 weeks. Heavy drinking is defined
             as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men on any occasion.

          3. Not be abstinent from alcohol for greater than 30 days.

          4. Be at least 18 years old.

          5. Be able to understand English and provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Be psychotic or severely psychiatrically disabled.

          2. Have medical conditions that would preclude completing or be of harm during the course
             of the study.

          3. Have laboratory or clinical evidence of significant liver dysfunction (alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3 times the
             upper limit of the normal range) or cirrhosis.

          4. Have a known contraindication to naltrexone therapy (e.g. taking opioid medication for
             pain).

          5. Be pregnant, nursing or unable to use an effective method of birth control (women).

          6. Subjects who are taking or use narcotics will not be included because naltrexone will
             precipitate withdrawal.
