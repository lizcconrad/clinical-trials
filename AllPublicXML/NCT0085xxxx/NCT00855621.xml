  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify factors predicting good results in patients treated
      with deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. The study includes a comparison of two
      surgical methods used to provide this therapy.

      The study will prospectively examine the effects of deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic
      nucleus (STN-DBS) on motor function, quality of life and cognitive function in Parkinson's
      disease (PD) patients treated at Rikshospitalet University Hospital. The aim is to identify
      which factors that predict good treatment outcome, in order to improve patient selection of
      this generally highly effective, but specialized and expensive treatment.

      The study has several aims:

        1. Randomized double-blind evaluation of the impact of using single vs. multiple
           electrode-recordings to guide electrode placement.

        2. To identify factors predicting good effect on motor function and improvements of quality
           of life after deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.

        3. To identify cognitive and psychiatric changes related to deep brain stimulation of the
           subthalamic nucleus

        4. To study social functioning of patients after STN-DBS and quality of life of patient
           caregivers

    <description>Chronic bilateral deep brain stimulation in the nucleus subthalamicus is performed using the most effective of four electrode contacts identified during testing of stimulation settings. Stimulation settings will be variable and adjusted according to the symptoms of each individual patient. Stimulation parameters will be recorded at each individual examination. Dopaminergic and other necessary medication will be given according to the need of each patient.</description>
