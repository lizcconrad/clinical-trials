    <measure>Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Minimum FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours After Allergen Challenge on Day 13 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>4-10 hours after allergen challenge on Day 13 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Analyzed using a mixed effects model including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. Minimum FEV1 over 4-10 hours post allergen challenge was minimum value of all the post-saline time points between 4 to 10 hours (4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 and 10 hours). The adjusted mean is presented as least square mean (LSM).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Day 14 of each treatment period (approximately 17 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Non-allergen challenge FEV1 data was measured on Day 1, 7, 13 and 14. The FEV1 assessments on Day 1 was taken at pre-dose and those on Day 7 was taken post-dose. On Day 13, the pre-allergen challenge FEV1 values was used and on Day 14 the pre-methacholine challenge FEV1 values was used. Absolute change in FEV1 on Day 7, 13 and 14 from pre-dose FEV1 was analyzed separately using a mixed-effects ANOVA model. Period-level Baseline was defined as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant-level Baseline for each period, each participant. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value. Post-randomization values refer to assessments performed post dose and after the Baseline assessment. The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>

        <title>Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Minimum FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours After Allergen Challenge on Day 13 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Analyzed using a mixed effects model including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. Minimum FEV1 over 4-10 hours post allergen challenge was minimum value of all the post-saline time points between 4 to 10 hours (4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 and 10 hours). The adjusted mean is presented as least square mean (LSM).</description>

          <title>Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Minimum FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours After Allergen Challenge on Day 13 of Each Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Analyzed using a mixed effects model including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. Minimum FEV1 over 4-10 hours post allergen challenge was minimum value of all the post-saline time points between 4 to 10 hours (4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 and 10 hours). The adjusted mean is presented as least square mean (LSM).</description>

        <title>EAR: Minimum FEV1 and Weighted Mean FEV1 Between 0-2 Hours After Allergen Challenge on Day 13 of Each Treatment Period.</title>
        <description>Analyzed using a mixed effects model including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline was defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. Minimum FEV1 over 0-2 hrs post-allergen challenge (minimum EAR) was the minimum value of all the post-(bolus) allergen challenge. Weighted mean EAR was calculated for FEV1 over 0-2 hours post allergen challenge using the linear trapezoidal rule. It was measured up to and including 2 hours (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5 and 2 hours). The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>

          <title>EAR: Minimum FEV1 and Weighted Mean FEV1 Between 0-2 Hours After Allergen Challenge on Day 13 of Each Treatment Period.</title>
          <description>Analyzed using a mixed effects model including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline was defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. Minimum FEV1 over 0-2 hrs post-allergen challenge (minimum EAR) was the minimum value of all the post-(bolus) allergen challenge. Weighted mean EAR was calculated for FEV1 over 0-2 hours post allergen challenge using the linear trapezoidal rule. It was measured up to and including 2 hours (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5 and 2 hours). The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FEV1-allergen Challenge at Each Time Point</title>
        <description>A mixed model analysis was performed separately for each planned time point during the allergen challenge on Day 13, from 5 minutes to 10 hour, including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline was defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. FEV1 was measured at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 and 10 hours. The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in FEV1-allergen Challenge at Each Time Point</title>
          <description>A mixed model analysis was performed separately for each planned time point during the allergen challenge on Day 13, from 5 minutes to 10 hour, including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline was defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. Absolute change from saline Baseline was calculated for each participant and time point as value equal to highest challenge value minus highest saline value. FEV1 was measured at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 and 10 hours. The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in FEV1-non Allergen Challenge</title>
        <description>Non-allergen challenge FEV1 data was measured on Day 1, 7, 13 and 14. The FEV1 assessments on Day 1 was taken at pre-dose and those on Day 7 was taken post-dose. On Day 13, the pre-allergen challenge FEV1 values was used and on Day 14 the pre-methacholine challenge FEV1 values was used. Absolute change in FEV1 on Day 7, 13 and 14 from pre-dose FEV1 was analyzed separately using a mixed-effects ANOVA model. Period-level Baseline was defined as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant-level Baseline for each period, each participant. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value. Post-randomization values refer to assessments performed post dose and after the Baseline assessment. The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>

        <title>Provocative Concentration of Methacholine Resulting in a 20% Reduction in FEV1 (PC20) on Day 14 of Each Treatment Period.</title>
        <description>Methacholine challenge PC20 data the concentration of methacholine to cause &gt;= 20% decrease (that is change &lt;= -20%) in FEV1 compared with saline [Baseline]) was log transformed and analysed using a mixed effects model including covariates for participant level Baseline FEV1 and period level Baseline FEV1. Participant level Baseline was defined as the mean of Day 1 pre-dose values across periods for each participant and period level Baseline as the difference between the Day 1 pre-dose value and participant level Baseline for each period. The PC20 was obtained by linear interpolation (on the log 2 concentration scale) between the lowest concentration of methacholine that caused at least 20% decrease from Baseline and the preceding concentration. The adjusted mean is presented as LSM.</description>
