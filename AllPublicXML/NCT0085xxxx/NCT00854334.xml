    <textblock>
      Rationale: Obesity is an increasing childhood epidemic in Canada. Obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) is a complication of obesity which causes cardiovascular disease, reduced quality of
      life, and premature death. While the complex interactions between obesity and OSA are not
      entirely clear, we hypothesize that these conditions may compound each other by:

        1. decreasing physical activity and total energy expenditure by reducing both non-exercise
           physical pursuits (NEAT- non-exercise activity thermogenesis) and purposeful physical
           activity.

        2. alterations in the secretion of appetite-controlling hormones, which may lead to
           increases in energy intake.

      Objective: To determine whether the presence of both obesity and OSA in children is
      associated with a decrease in physical activity and alterations in appetite-regulating
      hormones greater than those seen in either condition alone or compared to controls.

      Methods: Comparison of children 10-17 years with obesity and OSA, obesity alone, OSA alone
      and neither condition, for the following outcomes: (1) NEAT (kcal/day) (2) Physical activity
      behavior, appetite regulating hormone profile and self-report appetite assessment.

      Unique Aspects: This study combines expertise in sleep medicine, exercise physiology and
      obesity. Conclusions from this study will better characterize this high-risk clinical
      population so that innovative strategies targeting improvements in lifestyle behaviors can be
      developed.
