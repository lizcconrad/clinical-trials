    <description>Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) for ingenol mebutate and its two acyl isomers (PEP015 and PEP025) levels over the 24 hour sampling time period based on actual values measured. Blood samples were taken: at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following study medication application on Day 2.</description>

    <description>Time at which Cmax is attained (Tmax) for ingenol mebutate, and its two acyl isomers (PEP015 and PEP025) levels measured at 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours following study medication application on Day 2. If a maximum value occured at more than one timepoint Tmax is defined as the first timepoint with this value.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and Day 2, 3, 8, 15, 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients with LSR at any time point during the study above 0. The treatment area was assessed at baseline and at each subsequent study visit for the presence and grade of the following Local Skin Responses (LSRs): erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration using the Local Skin Response Grading Scale (version 5). Each LSR was graded from 0 (best outcome) to 4 (worst outcome). A composite LSR score was calculated as the sum of each individual LSR grade, giving a possible range of 0-24.</description>

    <description>Max composite Local Skin Response (LSR) score on day 3 only . The treatment area was assessed at baseline and at each subsequent study visit for the presence and grade of the following Local Skin Responses (LSRs): erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration using the Local Skin Response Grading Scale (version 5). Each LSR was graded from 0 (best outcome) to 4 (worst outcome). A composite LSR score was calculated as the sum of each individual LSR grade, giving a possible range of 0-24. (One vehicle treated patent had a LSR on day 1 only).</description>

          <title>Max Composite Local Skin Response (LSR) Score</title>
          <description>Max composite Local Skin Response (LSR) score on day 3 only . The treatment area was assessed at baseline and at each subsequent study visit for the presence and grade of the following Local Skin Responses (LSRs): erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration using the Local Skin Response Grading Scale (version 5). Each LSR was graded from 0 (best outcome) to 4 (worst outcome). A composite LSR score was calculated as the sum of each individual LSR grade, giving a possible range of 0–24. (One vehicle treated patent had a LSR on day 1 only).</description>
