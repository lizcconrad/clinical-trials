    <textblock>
      This purpose of this clinical research was to determine the efficacy and safety of an
      experimental drug called Rilonacept in participants with an acute gout attack. Participants
      participated in this study for 30 days. Rilonacept alone was being compared with Indomethacin
      alone and the combination of Rilonacept plus Indomethacin in treating acute gout flares.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Pain Using a 5-Point Likert Scale (PAP-LS) in Index Joint to Averaged PAP-LS at 24, 48 and 72 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose on Day 1 (Baseline); post-dose at 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and then daily up to Day 13 or until gout flare ends</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to complete a daily diary entry and assessed their pain in the past 24 hours using 5-point Likert Scale of 0 (None) to 4 (extreme pain), where; 0= none, 1= mild pain, 2= moderate pain, 3= severe pain, or 4= extreme pain. Change in PAP-LS in the index joint from baseline (Day 1) to the averaged PAP-LS values at 24, 48 and 72 hours was reported in this outcome measure (averaged PAP value= [PAP at 24 hours + PAP at 48 hours + PAP at 72 hours]/3).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 80 study sites in North America between 16 March 2009 and 26 February 2010. A total of 747 participants were screened in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Out of 747 participants, 225 were randomized and treated in the study. Participants were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the three treatment groups (Placebo [for Rilonacept] + Indomethacin or Rilonacept 320 mg + Indomethacin or Rilonacept 320 mg + Placebo [for Indomethacin]) on Day 1 of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Pain Using a 5-Point Likert Scale (PAP-LS) in Index Joint to Averaged PAP-LS at 24, 48 and 72 Hours</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to complete a daily diary entry and assessed their pain in the past 24 hours using 5-point Likert Scale of 0 (None) to 4 (extreme pain), where; 0= none, 1= mild pain, 2= moderate pain, 3= severe pain, or 4= extreme pain. Change in PAP-LS in the index joint from baseline (Day 1) to the averaged PAP-LS values at 24, 48 and 72 hours was reported in this outcome measure (averaged PAP value= [PAP at 24 hours + PAP at 48 hours + PAP at 72 hours]/3).</description>
