      Primary objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the implanted S-ICD system. A
      maximum of 10 subjects were to be enrolled and followed for one month to collect data on the
      safety, efficacy, and performance of the implanted S-ICD system. Additionally, patient
      comfort will be assessed as will cosmetic outcome.
