  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment benefits from surgical treatment by tendon
      repair and from physiotherapy for small and medium-sized rotator cuff tears.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical treatment by tendon repair or physiotherapy are accepted treatment options for small
      and medium-sized rotator cuff tears, but have never been compared in randomised, controlled
      studies.

      In this study, patients presenting clinical signs together with imaging findings (MRI and
      sonography) for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear will be randomly allocated to surgery
      (tendon repair) or physiotherapy. Outcome measuring will be performed by the Constant score,
      the self report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), the Short
      Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and subscores for shoulder motion, pain, strength and patient
      satisfaction. Scores will be taken at baseline and after 6 months,1, 2 and 5 years by a
      blinded assessor. All operated shoulders will be controlled by MRI after one year. Patients
      with no effect from physiotherapy after at least 15 treatment sessions will be offered
      secondary surgical treatment, and scoring results from last follow-up before surgery will be
      carried forward to analysis, according to an intention to treat principle.
