  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous in vitro studies it could be shown, that Dexpanthenol has an influence on the
      gene expression of fibroblasts. The genes which are influenced by Dexpanthenol play mainly a
      role during cell proliferating processes.The aim of this study is to investigate the
      molecular effect of Dexpanthenol on human living skin, during wound healing.
