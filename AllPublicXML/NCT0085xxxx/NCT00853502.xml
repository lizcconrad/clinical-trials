  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased bone strength is a common and serious medical problem present in many people with
      anorexia nervosa. Men with anorexia nervosa have lower levels of gonadal steroids such as
      testosterone. Low testosterone levels have been shown to result in low bone density.

      We are investigating whether bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture are abnormal in
      males with anorexia nervosa and whether supplementation with testosterone would improve both
      bone mineral density and bone microarchitecture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low bone mineral density is a co-morbidity associated with anorexia nervosa that has been
      shown to persist even after weight gain. Peak bone mass accrual occurs during the adolescent
      years, and a disruption in this critical process increases the risk for developing persistent
      deficits in bone density, and possibly increased fracture risk. Multiple variables contribute
      to the bone mass accrual process in puberty including adequate levels of sex hormones and
      puberty specific changes in levels of these hormones. Teenage boys with anorexia nervosa have
      lower bone density than normal weight boys of comparable maturity, and also have decreased
      levels of testosterone, as well as estradiol, when compared with healthy controls. Although
      testosterone is an important predictor of bone density in males with anorexia nervosa, the
      effect of testosterone replacement on bone mass accrual and bone microarchitecture in
      hypogonadal teenage boys and young adult men with anorexia nervosa is unknown. We hypothesize
      both bone mass and bone microarchitecture are abnormal in anorexia nervosa and that
      testosterone replacement in adolescent males with anorexia nervosa will improve both bone
      mass and microarchitecture.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Anorexia Nervosa

          -  Teenage boys and young adult men, age 14-30 years

          -  Hypogonadism indicated by a testosterone level within the lower 25th percentile for
             pubertal stage or below normal for pubertal stage

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disease or illness known to affect bone metabolism

          -  Use of medications known to affect bone metabolism, such as corticosteroids or
             androgenic steroids, within 3 months of study initiation

          -  Subjects with a z-score less than -2.5 on DXA secondary to concerns of severely low
             bone mineral density which may require aggressive monitoring
