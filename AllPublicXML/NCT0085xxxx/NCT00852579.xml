  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common disease in Westernised societies, affecting up to 10% of the population.
      Corticosteroids are the most effective treatment for asthma but the therapeutic response
      varies considerably between individuals. A major cause of corticosteroid insensitivity in
      asthma is cigarette smoking. Active cigarette smoking occurs in over 25% of adults with
      asthma and a further 25% are ex-smokers. In a series of proof of concept clinical studies the
      investigators demonstrated for the first time that the efficacy of inhaled and oral
      corticosteroids is markedly impaired in smokers with asthma and to a lesser extent in
      ex-smokers with asthma. Active cigarette smoking has other detrimental effects on asthma
      morbidity including more severe symptoms, increased rates of hospitalisation, and accelerated
      decline in lung function. Smoking cessation advice is often ineffective because many adult
      smokers with asthma do not believe that they are personally at risk from their smoking, take
      many years until stopping smoking and frequently restart smoking after quitting. Alternative
      or additional drugs to corticosteroids are needed for smokers with asthma who are unable to
      obtain the clinical benefits associated with stopping smoking. In a proof of concept clinical
      trial the investigators will test the hypothesis that macrolides improve asthma control and
      reduce sputum neutrophil counts of smokers with chronic asthma.
