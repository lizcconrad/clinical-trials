      INDICATION:

      Patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1 and non-responders to standard treatment for
      hepatitis C.

      OBJECTIVES:

        1. ascertain the rate of sustained response in patients with hepatitis C, genotype 1 with
           peginterferon + ribavirin resistance.

        2. To know the response rate in 12 weeks

        3. Describe the tolerance and safety of thalidomide in combination with peginterferon and
           ribavirin.

      DESIGN OF TEST Pilot Study:

      The single arm study will:

      1. Thalidomide 200 mg and peg-interferon alfa 2b (based on weight: 50-120 mcg / week) +
      ribavirin (based on weight: 1000-1200mg / day)

      Be tracked for 24 weeks after treatment.

      Suspended treatment of 12 weeks in patients who have failed a drop of HCV RNA&gt; 2 log.

      Patients who have been suspended for any reason, the treatment will be followed during 24
      weeks, to assess safety parameters.
