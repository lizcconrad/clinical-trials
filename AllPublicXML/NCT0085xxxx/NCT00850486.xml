  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficiency of the HyperQ technology compared with
      standard ECG analysis in detecting exercise induced ischemia in women who are referred to
      coronary angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in women. In fact, CVD is
      responsible for a third of all deaths of women worldwide and half of all deaths of women over
      50 years of age in developing countries. Historically, women have been underrepresented in
      clinical trials. The lack of good trial evidence concerning sex-specific outcomes has led to
      assumptions about CVD treatment in women, which in turn may have resulted in inadequate
      diagnoses and suboptimal management, greatly affecting outcomes. This knowledge gap may also
      explain why cardiovascular health in women is not improving as fast as that of men. Over the
      last decades, mortality rates in men have steadily declined, while those in women remained
      stable.

      The treadmill exercise test is the classic initial investigation for the diagnosis of
      coronary artery disease (CAD), and significant ST depression on the ECG is the commonly used
      indicator of a positive test. Compared with men, in women it is known that ST depression is
      less likely to be associated with CAD. False positive rates of treadmill exercise testing
      have been reported to be as high as 67%, while positive predictive value is around 48-50%.

      Coronary angiography is one of the most frequently performed procedures in women; however,
      non-obstructive (ie, &lt;50% stenosis) CAD is frequently reported. Additionally, approximately
      30% of women undergoing PTCA because of a positive exercise test are found to have normal
      coronary arteries. A successful outcome in the current study will significantly improve
      non-invasive diagnosis of CAD in women and may reduce the number of unnecessary invasive
      procedures performed.
