  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will compare workplace health intervention delivered by advisors based in GP
      practices with normal GP care to assess the usefulness of the concept and its potential for
      wider use in a larger randomised controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to examine the impact of H@W intervention(s) on job retention
      and return to work and compare outcomes with those from normal GP care. The target population
      for this study is people still at work but experiencing a work-related health problem as well
      as those off work. For the purpose of the study, short term sickness absence is defined as a
      period of 4 weeks or less and long term sickness absence defined as a period of 4 weeks or
      longer. Hypothesis

      That H@W intervention in comparison to standard care:

        -  promotes work retention

        -  enables a quick and sustained return to work for those on short term sick leave (4 weeks
           or less)

        -  achieves sustained return to work for those on long term sick leave of 4 weeks or more.
           This could include a phased return to work.

        -  achieves positive outcomes which could mean leaving one job and starting another.

    <description>The intervention group will receive additional support from a H@W Workplace Health Advisor who will deliver an intervention aimed at sickness absence prevention or sustained return to work, depending on individual circumstances. The intervention will be standardized as far as possible to show types of activity undertaken with participants, their GP, line managers, human resources departments and trade union representatives.</description>
