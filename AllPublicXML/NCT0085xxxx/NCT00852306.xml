      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to freeze eggs in order to preserve
      the fertility potential of young women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human egg freezing is rapidly becoming a vital tool in Assisted Reproductive Technology.
      Candidates for egg freezing include women without partners who wish to preserve their
      fertility; cancer patients at risk of losing fertility from chemotherapy; and donor egg
      recipients. While in the past, egg freezing has not been as successful as embryo freezing in
      producing live births, recent experience in several centers has demonstrated significant
      improvement, with pregnancy rates comparable to those achieved with frozen embryos. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the best method to freeze eggs. We shall be seeking
      volunteers from the egg donor program, since young, fertile donors represent the best model
      to study the effect of egg freezing.

      We plan to enroll 12 recipients and 6 donors in this study. Each egg donor will go through a
      stringent screening process (medical, genetic and psychological). Eggs retrieved from all
      donors will be split in half: one half will be frozen by the slow freeze method, and the
      other half by vitrification. Each of the six donors will be paired with two recipients; each
      recipient will be assigned half the total eggs frozen. For each recipient, half of the eggs
      will come from the slow freeze group and the other half will come from vitrification.

      When the recipient's uterine lining is deemed ready (following estrogen treatment and
      ultrasound monitoring), thawing will be performed on eggs frozen by either the slow freeze or
      the vitrification method. The thaw process will be randomized between the two types of
      freezing. One sperm will be injected into each egg that survived the freeze. Fertilization
      and embryo development will be recorded. Ideally, two embryos will be transferred into the
      recipient's uterus. Pregnancy will be determined by a blood test and followed by serial blood
      tests and ultrasound.

      The study will determine which freezing method yields better survival and pregnancy rates.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  donors: women ages 21-32 who wish to donate their eggs; must pass medical, physical
             and psychological screening.

          -  recipients: women under the age of 50 who wish to have eggs donated to them through
             the Donor Egg Program and who aslo pass the medical, physical and psychological
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  donors: those who do not pass the genetic screening or psychological testing, as
             described below

          -  recipients: those who do not pass the screening.

        The genetic screening of donors will involve the following:

          -  All donors will be screened for Cystic Fibrosis, Fragile X and Spinomuscular Atrophy
             (SMA).

          -  In addition, donors of Ashkenazi Jewish origin will be screened for Gaucher's disease,
             Canavan,Tay -Sachs, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann Pick, Fanconi's Anemia, Bloom and
             Mucolipidosis Type IV.

          -  Donors of African-American origin will be screened for Sickle-Cell disease.

          -  Donors of Asian, Mediterranean, Latino or Hispanic origins will be screened for
             Thalassemia.

        Recipient Screening: A Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE) at the Center will take a detailed
        history and perform a physical examination on all potential recipients. The RE will assess
        the health of the potential recipient in order to assess her capacity to carry a pregnancy.
        Previous IVF cycles, successful or unsuccessful, will have no implication on recipient
        selection.

        The recipient and her partner (if applicable) will meet with the program psychologist. The
        psychological evaluation is detailed below.

        Psychological evaluation: A psychological evaluation will be conducted of the Recipient,
        her partner (if applicable) and the Donor. The purpose of these evaluations is to determine
        the suitability of the parties to participate in the Donor Egg Program. Psychological tests
        will be administered by the Center as part of the evaluation process.

        These evaluations may result in a recommendation that one and/or all of the parties not
        participate in the Donor Egg Program. The psychologist will not be providing any advice or
        treatment to the Donor or Recipient(s). Nor will the Donor or Recipient(s) be entitled to
        the results of the Psychologist's evaluation. The Psychologist will provide the results of
        his/her evaluations to the Center for Human Reproduction.

        As with our standard Donor Egg Program practices, there will be an upper age limit of 50
        years for all recipients participating in the study.
