  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing dysfunction and delay of oral feeding skills in premature infants significantly
      delay discharge from the hospital. Thickening oral formula or breast milk feeds with
      commercial thickeners and rice cereal has been used in some nurseries with the goal of
      promoting development of adequate feeding skills. The objective of this pilot study is to
      examine the effect of thickened feeds on premature infants with oral feeding difficulties due
      to dysfunction secondary to immature swallowing.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Thickened feeds will lead to a reduction in symptoms secondary to immature swallowing in
           32-40 weeks gestational age infants when compared to non-thickened feeds

        -  Thickened feeds will promote transition to hospital discharge.
