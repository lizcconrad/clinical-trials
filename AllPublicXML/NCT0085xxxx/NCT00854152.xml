  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating oral doses of GDC-0980 administered to patients with
      incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancy or NHL that has progressed or
      failed to respond to at least one prior regimen or for which there is no standard therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented, incurable, locally advanced or metastatic solid
             malignancies, or NHL without leukemic phase, that has progressed despite standard of

          -  Evaluable or measurable disease per RECIST and/or the following: prostate cancer
             patients with non-measurable disease are eligible if they have two rising
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels that meet the PSA Working Group criteria for
             progression prior to initiation of study treatment; ovarian cancer patients with
             non-measurable disease are eligible if they have two rising CA-125 levels greater than
             the ULN &gt;= 2 weeks apart prior to initiation of study treatment.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;=12 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic and organ function within 14 days before initiation of GDC-0980

          -  Documented willingness to use an effective means of contraception for both men and
             women while participating in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

             by echocardiogram or MUGA scan

          -  DLCO &lt; 50% of predicted value corrected for hemoglobin and alveolar volume prior to
             initiation of GDC-0980

             neuropathy

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
