      This is an exploratory study in which all eligible subjects are given Panitumumab according
      to the dose and schedule approved by Health Canada. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine whether the presence of certain biomarkers (substances measurable in blood, normal
      cells or tumour tissue) are associated with an increased or decreased chance of benefit from
      panitumumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer affects 20,000 Canadians a year. Despite efforts to improve screening, 8,500
      patients will die of the disease (1). The agents used in both the adjuvant and metastatic
      setting have dramatically changed over the past ten years. Even with the optimal treatment
      and careful follow-up many patients will develop metastasis. For most this is an incurable
      condition and the median survival for these patients is only 2 years (2).

      Therapy with 5-Fluorouracil (FU)/Leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan with or without
      bevacizumab are conventionally used as first and second line therapy for metastatic
      colorectal cancer. Third line therapy options are limited to anti-epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) therapy Cetuximab or Panitumumab either as monotherapy or in combination with
      Irinotecan. Recent data (see Table 1) has demonstrated that KRAS mutation status is a
      predictor of benefit to anti-EGFR therapy, with wild-type tumours demonstrating a response
      rate of 10-17% to monotherapy while a 0% response rate is observed among KRAS mutant tumours.

      The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the correlation of biomarkers (PTEN,
      BRAF, amphiregulin, c-MET, EGFR) with response rate among patients with KRAS wild type
      tumours treated with panitumumab. If a high response subgroup can be identified, this may
      support the use of Panitumumab with combination therapy in the first line setting. Secondary
      objectives are to determine the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs for patients treated
      with single agent panitumumab and to describe overall survival (OS) and progression free
      survival (PFS) in registered patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:
