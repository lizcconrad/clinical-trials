  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term effects of vagus nerve stimulation
      (VNS) by auricular stimulation (stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve which
      innervates the ear) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is characterized by a chronic systemic
      inflammation affecting the joints but also carries an increased risk for extra-articular
      manifestations as well as other organ manifestations such as cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      which significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality in this disorder.

    <description>Vagus nerve stimulation for 5 minutes with an oscillatory device (Brookstone) used in previous experimental animal studies for stimulating the vagus nerve on the neck by carotid massage. The oscillatory part of this pen-like device is approximately 0,5 cm2.
Basic lab tests (metabolic panel and CBC with differential) and monocyte cytokine synthesis and other inflammatory markers will be analyzed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of RA based on the ACR guidelines. Disease activity measured
             as activity score (DAS-28 CRP) will be used

          2. None of the exclusion criteria (see below).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Minors (&lt;18 years of age) and mentally incompetent individuals

          2. One or more of the following conditions: immunosuppressive condition (which includes
             malignancy, chronic alcoholism, diabetes), severe chronic dementia, psychiatric
             illness with active psychosis, current intravenous or other serious illicit drug use

          3. Pregnancy

          4. Terminal status referred for palliative care only

          5. Homeless status

          6. IDDM and NIDDM patients will not be enrolled in this study

          7. Previous history of ischemic cardiovascular disease including myocardial infarction,
             unstable angina, and bradytachyarrythmias

          8. Moderate or severe anemia. Hemoglobin levels will be determined at screening. A
             cut-off level of &lt; 10 mg/dL in women and &lt; 11 mg/dL in men is selected.

          9. Smoking

         10. Subjects taking concomitant medications potentially affecting autonomic function such
             as anti-cholinergic medications and beta-blockers.
