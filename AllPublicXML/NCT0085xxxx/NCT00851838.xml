  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major challenge of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy is the development of glucose-sparing
      strategies able to provide an efficacious ultrafiltration (UF) profile. Study hypothesis is
      to evaluate the possibility to formulate PD solutions containing L-carnitine as an osmotic
      agent to partially replace glucose.
