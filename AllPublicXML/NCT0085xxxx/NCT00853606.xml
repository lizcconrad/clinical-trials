    <description>Data presented as mean change from baseline and the treatment period in the percentage of Yes responses to Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary question 3 &quot;Did your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse?&quot; Baseline is the run-in period from the qualifying study (TA-301/TA-302) consisting of all data reported during the non-treatment interval from Visit 1 to Visit 2. The treatment period is the on-treatment interval beginning with the first dose of study drug and ending on the last study visit.</description>

    <measure>Change in International Index of Erectile Function - Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire assesses subject's evaluation of erectile function over the previous 4-week period. Total score from questions 1-5 &amp; 15 ranges from 1 to 30. A higher score indicates better erectile function. Baseline is the observation at Visit 2 of the qualifying study (TA-301/TA-302). End of treatment is the observation at Visit 8 of the last observation carried forward.</description>
