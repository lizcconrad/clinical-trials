    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the BVS Everolimus
      Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS) in the treatment of patients with a maximum of two de
      novo native coronary artery lesions located in two different major epicardial vessels.

      Currently in development at Abbott Vascular. Not available for sale in the United States.

             (DL-lactide) or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

         10. Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will
             require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel
