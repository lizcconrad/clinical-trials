  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physical function of older candidates for renal transplantation and their ability to
      sustain physical activity programs are currently unknown. The primary goal of this study is
      to determine the feasibility of a physical activity intervention in older dialysis-dependent
      patients, assessing its effect on maintaining transplant candidacy and outcome after
      transplantation. Clinical practice guidelines do not set an absolute age limit for evaluating
      potential renal transplant candidates. While cardiovascular risk assessment and malignancy
      screening are emphasized in the older age group, physical performance and the risk for
      disability are often overlooked. Although healthy older patients experience increased life
      expectancy after renal transplantation versus remaining on dialysis, outcomes such as the
      capacity to live independently and function well have not been studied. Given the poorer
      baseline health status in aging end-stage renal disease patients, rapid changes in health on
      dialysis, and the national organ shortage, it is increasingly important to identify factors
      that predict better outcomes and devise strategies that will maximize the benefit of
      transplantation in older individuals.

      The investigators hypothesize that muscle is the principal organ system underlying impaired
      physical function among older transplant candidates, and that decreased muscle mass and
      physical functioning lead to poorer outcomes in older renal transplant candidates. The
      investigators propose that a simple bedside performance measurement of lower extremity
      functional limitations, the Short Physical Performance Battery, will be a strong predictor of
      outcomes in this patient cohort. The investigators also propose that outcomes can be improved
      with exercise training, potentially leading to longer durations of active transplant
      candidacy and greater independence after successful transplantation. The Specific Aims of
      this research are:

        1. Determine the feasibility of an exercise intervention in dialysis-dependent wait-listed
           patients age 60 years and over who will be randomized to one of two groups: usual care
           versus a structured physical activity program.

        2. Define the natural history of physical function in patients age 60 years and greater who
           remain on dialysis or undergo renal transplantation attempting to identify a subgroup of
           older wait listed patients who are at high risk for developing disability.

    <description>The intervention is an individualized, structured, moderate intensity home-based physical activity program. During the first 12 weeks the program will focus on lower extremity strengthening, and thereafter incorporate cardiovascular activity. The target duration of activity is 150 minutes per week, i.e., 20-30 min on most days of the week. However, the program is adjusted based on each participant's progression, initial level of physical fitness and will be modified in response to illness, injury, or physical symptoms.</description>
