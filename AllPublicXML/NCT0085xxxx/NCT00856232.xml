      This study will randomly assign emergency department patients seeking treatment for a
      headache to one of three groups. The first group will receive standard emergency care as
      determined by the treating physician, the second group will breathe high flow air by facemask
      for 15 minutes, and the third group will breathe high flow oxygen by face mask for 15
      minutes. The patients will be questioned in the beginning of their treatment and at 2, 5, 10,
      15 and 30 minutes after it's begun about the intensity of their headache and how much relief
      they are experiencing from their treatment. Concentration of carbon dioxide exhaled by
      patients will also be recorded at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes. After fifteen minutes, the
      patients in groups 2 and 3 will continue with standard emergency care, which can include any
      treatment their physician sees fit. Patients in all three groups will receive a stopwatch in
      the beginning of their emergency department visit and record the total extent of time their
      headache will take to resolve.
