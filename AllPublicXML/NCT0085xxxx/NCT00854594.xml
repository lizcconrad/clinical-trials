    <textblock>
      The investigators' study focuses on improving the care of diabetes, a complex chronic
      illness, by providing important insights into interprofessional training and its potential
      role in fostering the necessary interdisciplinary management needed for chronic conditions
      and in addressing the gap between best practice and actual care provided.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The complexity of diabetes management challenges the acute care-oriented healthcare system.
      Some experts suggest part of the problem is that the healthcare system fosters a separate
      silos decision making model. While there is increasing recognition that quality diabetes care
      is best provided in an interdisciplinary manner, interprofessional training models are
      limited, as is understanding of the links between interprofessional training, actual
      practice, and patient outcomes. Advancing our understanding of interprofessional training
      models is critical because most of the complications associated with diabetes (e.g.,
      amputations, renal failure, strokes) can be prevented or delayed with proper management. The
      investigators' objective is to better understand the processes and mechanisms by which
      interprofessional training impacts on chronic care management (practice patterns) and the
      ways it translates into improved patient outcomes.

    <description>Providers asked to indicate their level of confidence on an 11-point scale, with 0 indicating 'not at all confident' and 10 indicating 'extremely confident' for the following activities:
Instruct patients on home glucose monitoring
Teach foot care
Teach insulin administration
Instruct patients about diet
Help patients make changes in their diets that you have recommended
Instruct patients about regular exercise
Help patients make changes in their exercise habits that you have recommended
Identify candidates for long-acting insulin
Interpret glucose patterns
Adjust insulin in insulin-treated patients with poor glycemic control
Do you feel comfortable knowing whether to titrate basal insulin versus bolus insulin
Manage patients with poor glycemic control
Initiate insulin therapy (NPH or insulin glargine and aspart)
Apply principles of diabetes care in a team setting
Averages of provider efficacy were calculated across all activities.</description>

    <measure>Attitudes Toward Healthcare Teams Scale and Subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A validated scale developed to assess attitudes towards teams in a healthcare setting with three subscales to assess attitudes toward team value, attitudes toward team efficiency, and attitudes towards physician's shared role on a team. Each of the 21 items is rated 1 to 6, ranging from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree'. The scale was considered 'complete' for analysis among providers who answered at least 7 of the 21 items. Items were reverse-coded as specified in the subscale development publication. Averages across completed items were calculated within provider. Higher values corresponded with more positive attitudes towards teams.</description>

        <title>Attitudes Toward Healthcare Teams Scale and Subscales</title>
        <description>A validated scale developed to assess attitudes towards teams in a healthcare setting with three subscales to assess attitudes toward team value, attitudes toward team efficiency, and attitudes towards physician's shared role on a team. Each of the 21 items is rated 1 to 6, ranging from 'Strongly Disagree' to 'Strongly Agree'. The scale was considered 'complete' for analysis among providers who answered at least 7 of the 21 items. Items were reverse-coded as specified in the subscale development publication. Averages across completed items were calculated within provider. Higher values corresponded with more positive attitudes towards teams.</description>

At the end of the 18 months the randomly selected patients and providers will be asked to take part in a qualitative interview.
Role modeling in Shared medical appointments to Promote Establishing Collaborative Teams (ReSPECT): The intervention is designed to educate the clinicians at intervention CBOCs by modeling interprofessional team practices during SMAs for DM patients from each CBOC primary care provider's (PCP) patient panel. We hypothesize that this education at intervention CBOCs will improve interprofessional practices and overall quality care delivered to veterans.</description>

        <description>Providers asked to indicate their level of confidence on an 11-point scale, with 0 indicating 'not at all confident' and 10 indicating 'extremely confident' for the following activities:
Instruct patients on home glucose monitoring
Teach foot care
Teach insulin administration
Instruct patients about diet
Help patients make changes in their diets that you have recommended
Instruct patients about regular exercise
Help patients make changes in their exercise habits that you have recommended
Identify candidates for long-acting insulin
Interpret glucose patterns
Adjust insulin in insulin-treated patients with poor glycemic control
Do you feel comfortable knowing whether to titrate basal insulin versus bolus insulin
Manage patients with poor glycemic control
Initiate insulin therapy (NPH or insulin glargine and aspart)
Apply principles of diabetes care in a team setting
