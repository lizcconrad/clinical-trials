  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether variations in the perilipin, and
      several other, genes would be a useful tool for physicians who are caring for morbidly obese
      patients to guide therapy.

      The main hypotheses to be tested is that sequence variations (polymorphisms) in the perilipin
      gene and several other obesity-related genes are associated with resistance to weight loss
      for obese individuals on energy restricted diets, potentially playing a role in the
      development of obesity related complications.

      The PRIMARY goal of this study is to investigate the association of perilipin gene
      polymorphisms, with obese subjects who are &quot;resistant&quot; to weight loss in a defined program.

      The SECONDARY goal of this study is to investigate if additional candidate obesity genes that
      have previously been associated with obesity or energy metabolism show association with
      resistance to weight loss in subjects on an energy restricted diet. Additionally, we would
      like to investigate if any metabolic syndrome parameters, such as dyslipidemia or abnormal
      fasting glucose are associated with perilipin or variations in other obesity-related genes.
