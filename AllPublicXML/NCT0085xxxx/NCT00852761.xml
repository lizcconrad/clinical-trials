  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of two different forms of a
      topical steroid (clobetasol propionate) in patients with plaque-type psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to obtain efficacy and tolerability data for two clobetasol
      propionate therapies in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis. Subjects will be randomized
      to only one of the two therapies for treatment throughout the study.
