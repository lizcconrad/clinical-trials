      Purpose: This is a pilot study to evaluate HIV viremia and persistence in acutely HIV
      infected antiretroviral naïve patients treated with Darunavir/ritonavir and Etravirine

      Participants: 20 participants, age 18 and older, HIV infected, antiretroviral naïve patients

      Procedures (methods): ARV treatment with Darunavir/ritonavir and Etravirine,

      Optional studies:

      Genital secretion samples, Cerebrospinal fluid samples, Leukapheresis, Endoscopy/colonoscopy

      Study Design

      This is a multicenter, single arm, 48-week open-label pilot study of DRV/R &amp; ETR in acute HIV
      infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection Study Consortium.
      If baseline resistance is detected after treatment begins (e.g. evidence of pre-existing
      baseline resistance (genotypic or phenotypic) that may adversely affect the efficacy of the
      study regimen), the patient may elect to alter treatment as per best clinical practice. The
      new regimen will not be provided by the study, but will be obtained for the participant
      through available clinical resources.

      After patients are identified with acute HIV infection, they will be offered the opportunity
      to participate in the study. Patients will also be offered the opportunity to co-enroll in
      CHAVI 001 and 012, studies that follow the virological and immunological response of patients
      with AHI, regardless of the initiation of ART. An overall consent form will be signed for
      study participation, and separate informed consents with signatures will be obtained for
      optional studies. Patients will be eligible for participation after signing the overall
      consent - agreeing to participate in studies of other compartment specimens is not required
      for enrollment. At the initial visit, patient eligibility will be confirmed with appropriate
      laboratory testing (see &quot;STUDY POPULATION&quot;). When eligibility is verified, entry laboratory
      studies will be obtained, and the participants will be started on DRV/r, and ETR. All
      participants will be followed at regular intervals thereafter as specified in the schedule of
      evaluations. Participants meeting criteria for virologic failure will be offered the
      opportunity to switch to the best available regimen as selected by their HIV provider.

      Hypothesis

      Combination therapy with DRV/R &amp; ETR will suppress plasma viremia and improve immunologic
      function in antiretroviral (ART)-naïve, acutely HIV-infected (AHI) patients, and will limit
      replication in HIV-1 cellular compartments.

             least 24 consecutive months, or have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g.,

             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements or confound the
             analysis of study endpoints.

         10. Any active psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, severe depression, or severe
             bipolar affective disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound

        <description>Neuropsychological performance was assessed at Week 2 or 4, Week 24 and Week 48 in the following measures: Premorbid/language (Wide Range Achievement Test 4 -Reading Subtest), Learning (HVLT-R, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised), Memory (HVLT-R), Speed of Processing (Trailmaking A (Army Individual Test Battery, 1944), 1974, Stroop color, Attention (WAIS-III Symbol Search; Stroop word, Fine motor, Executive (Trailmaking B, Stroop interference, Letter, Category Fluency. An overall summary score was created by averaging all tests. Participants also completed the self-reported functional status Patient's Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory (PAOFI) and the Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS). Best available demographically corrected normative data were utilized to create z scores. A negative z score denotes below-average performance relative to a US normative comparison population. A higher z score is a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Overall Neurocognitive Impairment at Week 24</title>
        <description>Neuropsychological performance was assessed at week 2 or 4, week 24 and week 48 in the following measures: Premorbid/language (Wide Range Achievement Test 4 -Reading Subtest), Learning (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised), Memory (HVLT-R), Speed of Processing (Trailmaking A (Army Individual Test Battery, 1944), 1974, Stroop color, Attention (WAIS-III Symbol Search; Stroop word, Fine motor, Executive (Trailmaking B, Stroop interference, Letter, Category Fluency. An overall summary score of neurocognitive functioning was created by averaging all tests. Participants also completed Patient's Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory (PAOFI) and the Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADLS). Best available demographically corrected normative data were utilized to create z scores. A negative z score denotes below-average performance relative to a US normative comparison population. A higher z score is a better outcome.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Early termination prior to target enrollment due to slow enrollment limited analysis involving optional procedures. Lack of paired (baseline and followup) samples from optional procedures also limited ability to perform these analyses.</limitations_and_caveats>
