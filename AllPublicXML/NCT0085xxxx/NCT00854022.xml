  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will further the understanding of the genetic events leading to the development of
      RCC; explore the genetic basis for genetic instability and how it affects cancer risk; and
      eventually provide a means of identifying a subgroup of individuals who are most likely to
      develop RCC. Such individuals may then be targeted for intervention programs such as
      chemoprevention or dietary modification.

      We will utilize the blood collected to run several laboratory analyses that will assess DNA
      damage/repair, telomere length, telomerase activity, and other genetic instability as
      predictors of RCC risk. All information linking this unique identifier to the participant
      will be kept in a secure location under lock-and-key password protected.

      In addition, RCC tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples may be obtained from the MDACC
      Institutional Tissue Bank (ITB) for cases only. The samples obtained will be left over from
      surgical procedures, so as to prevent any additional distress to the patient.
