  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 3 million mothers in the USA alone leave the hospital breastfeeding
      an infant. However, a large number discontinue breastfeeding, because milk synthesis is poor
      or simply stops. Termed &quot;Insufficient Milk Syndrome,&quot; this condition probably accounts for
      approximately 5-10% of the total population of breastfeeding mothers and includes many
      mothers with premature infants, mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome, and a myriad of other
      unknown causes. The mother's inability to breastfeed causes enormous feelings of inadequacy,
      grief, depression, and other problems, not to mention increased health risks to the infant.

      The most popular herbal remedy used around the world for increasing milk synthesis is
      fenugreek. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum graecum) is a seed product from the legume family
      that is commonly sold, since the dried, ripe seed and extracts are used as an artificial
      flavor for maple syrup. When used orally in amounts commonly found in foods, it has been
      granted Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status in the USA by the FDA. Although it is used
      by millions of women around the world to increase their milk supply, we have only one small
      case report which suggested it might actually increase the milk supply.

      In this one study, the authors found an approximate 40% increase in milk production, although
      the study was not blinded, nor did they use a control population. For these reasons, we still
      do not know with certainty if fenugreek works as a galactagogue.

      This study is designed to accurately determine if seven days of fenugreek will stimulate milk
      production in a selected group of subjects with poor milk supply. We hypothesize that the
      women enrolled in the test group will have increased milk production at the end of the 8-day
      study.
