  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine if patients in the embedded motor imagery (MI)
      training group (EG1) need less time to perform the motor task than patients in the added MI
      training group (EG2).

      The purpose of the study is to examine if patients in the embedded MI training into
      physiotherapy (EG1) need less time to perform the motor task than patients in the added MI
      training to physiotherapy (EG2).

      A third groups serves a control group (CG) to investigate the effect of the intervention
      versus a group with a control intervention.

      Additionally, semi-structured interviews before and after the intervention will give an
      insight in the patient's experience with motor imagery (MI), their expectations regarding the
      intervention and their opinions about MI after the intervention.
