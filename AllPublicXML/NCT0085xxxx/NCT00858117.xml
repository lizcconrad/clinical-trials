      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and rituximab, can block cancer growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving
      alemtuzumab together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving alemtuzumab together with
      rituximab and to see how well it works in treating patients with previously untreated B-cell
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the response rate in patients with previously untreated B-cell chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia treated with alemtuzumab and rituximab.

        -  To evaluate the toxicity of alemtuzumab and rituximab in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously on days 1, 3, and 5 in weeks 1-18 and
      rituximab IV on day 1 in weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for laboratory biomarker
      studies. Samples are analyzed for surface markers (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD10, CD19, CD20,
      CD25, CD38, CD52, Zap-70) and IgVH by PCR, flow cytometry, and FISH. Samples are also
      analyzed for alemtuzumab and anti-alemtuzumab antibody levels by flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)*, as defined by the following
             criteria:

               -  Small- to moderate-size lymphocytes with &lt; 55% prolymphocytes, atypical
                  lymphocytes, or lymphoblasts

               -  Phenotypically characterized B-CLL expressing CD20 and CD52, as defined by the
