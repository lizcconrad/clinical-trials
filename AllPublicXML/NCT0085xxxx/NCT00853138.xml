  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a
      web-based (i.e., internet) treatment approach for providing psychological treatment to reduce
      pain and improve functioning in children and adolescents with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is an important problem for children and adolescents owing to its high
      prevalence rate and significant impact on children's mood, daily functioning, and overall
      quality of life. Effective psychological treatments have been developed to change behaviors
      and thoughts important in the child's ability to cope with chronic pain. However, the
      majority of children do not have access to these treatments due to a variety of barriers such
      as geographical distance from pediatric pain treatment centers.

      The purpose of this study is to develop a more accessible method of delivering effective
      psychological treatment to reduce pain and increase function in children. Children with
      chronic headache, abdominal, or musculoskeletal pain will be randomized to either receive the
      web-based treatment right away or to be in a wait-list control condition and receive the
      treatment 8 weeks later. Both groups of children will continue to receive clinical care
      through specialty medical clinics. Children's level of pain, their ability to perform, daily
      functional activities, and overall quality of life will be evaluated before treatment begins,
      immediately after treatment, and at a 3 month follow up.

    <description>Cognitive-behavioral therapy delivered via the internet in eight treatment modules for children (education, stress and negative emotions, deep breathing and relaxation, distraction, cognitive skills, sleep hygiene and lifestyle, staying active, relapse prevention) and eight treatment modules for parents (education, stress and negative emotions, operant strategies I, operant strategies II, modeling, sleep hygiene and lifestyle, communication, relapse prevention).</description>

    <description>In addition to standard medical care, the children and parents in the family CBT condition will also receive education about chronic pain, pain behaviors and operant strategies as well as training in coping skills using an interactive, engaging format on the Internet.
The Internet site will consist of three main sections: child treatment modules, parent treatment modules, and diary tracking. All users will complete 8 treatment modules (one per week) over the 8-week treatment period. Each module will require approximately 30-40 minutes to complete. There is separate specific content of the intervention for child users and for parent users.
Assignments are incorporated into each module for the participant to work on during the treatment week.</description>
