  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 biological axis plays an important
      role in promoting angiogenesis in PC; and that the genetic changes and the microenvironment
      of the tumor regulate the expression of CXCR2 ligands/CXCR2 in PC in order to potentiate
      their angiogenic phenotype. A corollary of this hypothesis is that the cell surface receptors
      (CXCR2) and the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the angiogenic responses
      induced by ELR+ CXC-chemokines are potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions in
      PC.
