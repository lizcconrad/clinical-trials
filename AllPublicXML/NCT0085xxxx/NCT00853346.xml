      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of a form of talk therapy called cognitive
      behavior therapy (CBT) in the treatment of major depression in individuals with Parkinson's
      disease (PD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CBT is a specific type of treatment that has been shown to be as helpful in treating
      depression as medications for depression. CBT focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
      It focuses on the here and now, rather than the past. CBT offers concrete strategies and
      skills for coping with depression, PD, and other life problems. Previous research leads us to
      believe that this type of therapy may help people with PD cope with their depression.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        In addition to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, the following
        conditions must be met for patient eligibility:

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Subjects with a primary diagnosis of PD who also currently meet DSM-IV criteria for
             MDD

          -  Subjects must be stable on their anti-Parkinson treatment, as defined by no medication
             changes over the past 6 weeks

          -  Subjects may be taking an antidepressant as long as they have had a stable dose for up
             to 6 weeks and do not alter the dosage during the course of the study

          -  Men or women 40-80 years of age

          -  HAMD-17 scores &gt; 14 at screen visit

          -  Score of 25 or greater on the Mini-Mental Status Examination

          -  Willing to come to MGH for screening and study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria are to be excluded from the study:

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a current, serious suicidal or
             homicidal risk

          -  Patients who would not be appropriate for a delayed CBT control due to the severity of
             their depression based on clinical judgment as well as HAMD-17 scores &gt; 28

          -  The following DSM-IV diagnoses: 1) substance use disorders, including alcohol
             dependence, active within the last 3 months; 2) schizophrenia; 3) delusional disorder;
             4) psychotic disorders not elsewhere classified; 5) bipolar disorder; 6) MDD with
             psychotic features

          -  Subjects who meet DSM-IV criteria for dementia

          -  Severe, unstable concurrent medical conditions (determined by his/her physician) that
             are likely to require hospitalization within six months from study entry (e.g., a
             patient with severe congestive heart failure who has a history of recent hospital
             admissions)

          -  Subjects may not be receiving a psychosocial intervention that is specific for
             depression; psychosocial interventions not specific for depression (e.g., couples
             counseling) and established for three or more months before screen visit are allowed
