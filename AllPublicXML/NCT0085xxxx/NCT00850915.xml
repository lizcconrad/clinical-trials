  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is a well studied clinical intervention for primary and
      secondary prevention of active tuberculosis (TB) after infection with Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis. It is widely used in industrialized countries in TB outbreak management,
      focusing on high risk groups such as close contacts in the family, in congregate settings,
      and in the workplace amongst others. Individuals infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus
      (HIV) have a markedly higher risk of acquiring a TB-infection and developing consequently
      active TB, making HIV-infected individuals a target population for IPT. Studies of IPT in HIV
      infected persons in the nineties demonstrated the efficacy of IPT in the prevention of active
      TB in Sub -Saharan Africa and more recent studies suggest that the protective effect remains
      present in individuals on antiretroviral therapy.

      Despite the proven efficacy of IPT this intervention has not been taken up by most HIV and TB
      control programmes in Africa where the burden of TB/HIV is highest. The reasons for the low
      uptake of IPT are many and varied but include fears of expansion of isoniazid resistance and
      subsequently the development of multi -drug resistant TB with widespread use of IPT.
      Additionally screening protocols for excluding active TB and selecting persons for IPT have
      not been uniformly agreed upon. There have also been concerns that programmes designed to
      provide IPT may shift TB control programmes from their primary responsibility of finding and
      treating active TB. Finally it has been unclear as to which programme, between the HIV and
      the TB control programme, has the primary responsibility of managing the provision of the IPT
      intervention.

      The World Health Organization and other technical agencies engaged in global TB control have
      recently re-emphasized the need to scale up IPT. In this proposal we outline an operational
      research study to evaluate the introduction of IPT at community level and to measure its
      effectiveness at preventing TB. The study is based on the context of expansion of
      Community-Based Direct Observed Therapy Short Course (CB-DOTS), home-based care and the
      concept of HIV prevention with positives (PwPs), where there is a real opportunity to focus
      on the household as a source of HIV-associated tuberculosis.

      The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial. It compares the incidence of TB in
      household contacts including children under 5 of identified TB/HIV co-infected patients, who
      received IPT through proactive community intervention and those in a control group where the
      community was handled in the &quot;usual way&quot;. In the intervention group household contacts of
      index cases of HIV positive, smear positive PTB will be visited at home and consenting
      contacts will be screened for active TB using a simple questionnaire. Those found to be fit
      will receive isoniazid 300mg (5 mg per Kg for children) once daily for 6 months, regardless
      of the HIV-status. Those found not to be fit will be referred for further evaluation at the
      nearest TB diagnostic centre. In the control group, routine care following national
      guidelines will be offered. This consists of contact invitation and assessment of eligibility
      for IPT, especially, in children less than 5 years. Both groups will be followed up monthly
      through household visits. Follow up will be for a total of 24 months including the six months
      when IPT is provided.

      A confidential HIV screening test will be provided to all consenting contacts in both
      intervention and control group after appropriate counseling.

      The primary outcome is the incidence of TB in the intervention and control household
      contacts. The difference in incidence between the two groups is a measure of efficacy of the
      intervention. In addition the efficacy of the intervention will be estimated stratified by
      HIV status of household contacts if data allows. Secondary outcomes are the incidence of
      adverse events, the incidence of TB-related symptoms, measures on the uptake of IPT
      (proportion of contacts starting and discontinuing IPT, treatment adherence) and programmatic
      indicators, i.e. percentage of persons eligible for IPT and resources needed.

    <description>In the intervention group, the household contacts of enrolled TB/HIV co-infected patient are visited at home by community health workers. Those contacts providing informed consent and considered fit (assessed by simple questionnaire) are assumed not to have active TB and are eligible for IPT. They are offered isoniazid at 300mg (5 mg per Kg for children) once daily for 6 months, regardless of their HIV-status.
In the control group, in line with routine care, eligible index cases are requested to send their contacts to the clinic for evaluation. Contacts presenting to the clinic will be screened for TB and receive IPT, if under 5 years and when active TB is ruled out as per the current national guidelines.
All contacts (both intervention and control group) are followed up monthly to assess occurrence of symptoms suggestive of TB.</description>
