  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitor therapy is in France the adjuvant reference treatment for postmenopausal
      women with early-stage breast cancer. This treatment induces bone loss and a higher risk of
      fractures.

      This study aimed to document the effect of bisphosphonate therapy in preventing bone loss and
      osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with aromatase inhibitor treatment for breast
      cancer
