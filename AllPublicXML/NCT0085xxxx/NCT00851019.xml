  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is important for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but it is often
      not sustained for many reasons, including lack of interest. New video games that involve
      physical movement (&quot;exergames&quot;) may help in this regard. This study will compare the
      &quot;exergame&quot; &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; (DDR) with traditional treadmill exercise on blood sugar
      control among sedentary, overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes.

      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of a 3-month ad libitum program of the
      &quot;exergame&quot; &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; (DDR) versus traditional treadmill exercise. Each group
      of subjects will be assessed at baseline, and then assigned exclusively to one of the two
      exercise modalities. Subjects will be free to attend exercise sessions in their assigned
      exercise modality at the exercise facility, at a frequency, duration and intensity of their
      own choosing with minimal staff supervision, for a period of exactly 90 days; adoption of new
      exercise programs outside of the study will be prohibited. Dosages of any concurrent
      medications will be maintained constant, and all subjects will receive standardized nutrition
      counseling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 65 inclusive

          -  Diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (by ADA diagnostic criteria) for at least 1 year

          -  On stable doses of oral anti-hyperglycemic medications for at least 3 months (i.e.,
             sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones, and/or DPP-4 inhibitors; GLP-1 analogues
             may also be permitted)

          -  Hemoglobin A1c level between 7.5% and 9.0% inclusive

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 40.0 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Able to engage in a regular program of mild-to-moderate intensity physical activity

          -  Subjects not currently engaged in any regimented exercise program outside of the usual
             activities of daily living that is intended to achieve metabolic changes (e.g., weight
             loss, athletic training, etc.)

          -  Able to give informed consent and cooperate with all necessary procedures of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindications to a regular program of mild-to-moderate intensity exercise, or
             any cardiovascular, pulmonary, orthopedic, rheumatological or neurological conditions
             that may, in the opinion of the investigators, interfere with the subject's optimal
             participation in a regular exercise program, interfere with the quality of the data
             collected from the subject, or make a regular exercise program potentially hazardous

          -  Diabetes mellitus currently being treated with insulin and/or pramlintide

          -  Screening fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 300 mg/dL or greater or symptoms of
             hyperglycemia (polyuria, polydipsia); screening FPG &lt; 60 mg dL, or a history of
             symptomatic hypoglycemia averaging more than once per day; or any other history
             suggestive of erratic glucose control

          -  Screening fasting triglycerides 500 mg/dL or greater; or LDL-cholesterol 200 mg/dL or
             greater; screening blood pressure averaging 180 mm Hg or greater systolic or 100 mm Hg
             or greater diastolic

          -  Subjects currently engaged in any regimented exercise program outside of the usual
             activities of daily living that is intended to achieve metabolic changes (e.g., weight
             loss, athletic training, etc.); any such activities occurring on a sporadic basis may
             still disqualify the subject, depending upon its frequency, to be judged at the
             discretion of the PI. Subjects must maintain their usual occupational and other
             routine daily activities during the study at a reasonably constant level.

          -  Subjects who routinely engage in DDR, either at home or video game arcades;
             &quot;occasional&quot; participation in DDR may still disqualify the subject, depending upon the
             frequency of participation, to be judged at the discretion of the PI

          -  Changing doses of any concurrent medications that are known to alter the study's
             outcomes (e.g., oral anti-hyperglycemic agents, lipid-lowering agents, weight loss
             agents, anti-hypertensive agents, systemic glucocorticoids, thyroid medications,
             hormone replacement therapies, oral contraceptives, etc.) or the anticipated need to
             start any of these medications; such medications taken concurrently must remain at
             constant dosages throughout the study.

          -  Past history of clinically significant dysfunction of other organ systems (e.g., known
             hepatic disease or hepatic transaminase levels greater than 3X the upper limit of the
             normal range other than steatohepatitis; known renal dysfunction or creatinine level
             1.5 mg/dL or greater; past history of malignancies excluding cutaneous basal cell
             carcinoma; known chronic infections including HIV, endocrinopathies such as untreated
             thyroid disease, adrenal disease, or pituitary dysfunction, etc.), or any recent
             surgeries that preclude regular exercise, in the opinion of the investigators

          -  Active hemolytic anemia, known hemoglobinopathies, or any other state of accelerated
             RBC turnover that may alter the accuracy of the HbA1c measurement

          -  Pregnancy or lactation
