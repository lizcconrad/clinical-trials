    <time_frame>up to 10 days from index visit</time_frame>
    <description>For each dose of study medication, parents indicated which of the symptoms were present (runny nose, cough, nasal congestion, sneezing). Parents rated change in each symptom present one hour after a dose of study medication for up to 6 doses in study logs. Responses were dichotomized as at least some improvement or better (improvement) vs. no improvement or worse. The outcome measure is number of times that improvement in a specific symptom was noted after a dose of the homeopathic remedy. Completed study logs were received from 37 of 49 enrolled participants.</description>
