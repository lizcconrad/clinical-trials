    <textblock>
      Removal of large bile duct stones can be technically challenging at ERCP. Particularly, when
      the size of the stone is more than 1.2cm they are removed using a metal basket (lithotripsy).
      This can sometimes be technically challenging and may require more than one ERCP session.
      Recently, a balloon has been used to enlarge the opening of the bile duct (sphincteroplasty)
      to help easy removal of stones in one ERCP session. There are no studies comparing the
      lithotripsy and sphincteroplasty techniques. This randomized trial is designed to address the
      question of which technique is superior for bile duct stone extraction: lithotripsy versus
      sphincteroplasty.

      Stones in the bile duct can result in various complications including acute cholangitis,
      acute pancreatitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis.1 Bile duct stones should therefore be
      removed and this can be successfully achieved in 85-90% of patients using standard endoscopic
      techniques. This comprises endoscopic sphincterotomy whereby the duodenal sphincter at the
      entrance of the bile duct is cut during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      and subsequent removal of the stone is achieved using standard accessories such as a basket
      and/or extraction balloon.2 However, large (â‰¥ 15mm in size) or multiple stones and those
      located in non-dilated bile ducts can be difficult to remove by endoscopic sphincterotomy and
      using only standard accessories.2 In such cases, mechanical lithotripsy can be performed for
      stone fragmentation prior to removal. This involves the use of a basket and a sheath that can
      be wrapped around the stone, which are in turn attached to a handle that is turned to result
      in stone fragmentation.1,2 Although shown to be effective in 84-98% of patients with large
      stones, this method can be cumbersome and time-consuming.2

      Endoscopic Balloon sphincteroplasty (EBS) [(Hurricane RX Balloon Dilatation Catheter; Boston
      Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) or CRE Wireguided Balloon Dilatation Catheter; Boston
      Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA)] is an alternative technique in which a balloon is used to
      dilate the papilla located at the bile duct opening by up to 8-20mm (depending on size of the
      distal CBD) after performing an endoscopic sphincterotomy. Following dilation, the stone is
      removed using a basket and/or extraction balloon. This technique was shown to be effective in
      clearing the bile duct in 89-95% of patients with difficult bile stones in whom initial
      endoscopic sphincterotomy was unsuccessful.3 Furthermore, in a randomized trial comparing
      endoscopic sphincterotomy alone versus EBS for removal of bile duct stones, the use of
      mechanical lithotripsy was significantly lower in the EBS group (28.8% for EBS vs. 46.2% for
      endoscopic sphincterotomy only, p=0.028), although the overall stone clearance rates were
      comparable between the two groups (89% for ESBD vs. 88.5% for ES only, p=0.279).4

      The SpyGlass Direct Visualization System (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is a
      single-operator peroral cholangioscopy system (POC) which allows direct visualization of the
      bile duct stone.2 The main advantage of this technique is that a probe can be inserted into
      the endoscope and then guided through the bile duct to reach the stone. Using this probe, the
      energy from laser (laser lithotripsy) can be accurately focused onto the stone to cause stone
      fragmentation under direct visualization.1 The use of SpyGlass system with laser lithotripsy
      has been shown to be successful in the clearance of difficult bile duct stones in 73-100%
      patients.4-9

      Although various methods for removal of bile duct stones exist, there have been thus far no
      studies directly comparing EBS with cholangioscopy-guided laser lithotripsy for clearance of
      bile duct stones. The aim of this study is therefore to compare efficiency of the
      single-operator peroral cholangioscopy-directed laser lithotripsy (POC-LL) using the SpyGlass
      Direct Visualization system versus EBS for clearance of difficult bile duct stones.
