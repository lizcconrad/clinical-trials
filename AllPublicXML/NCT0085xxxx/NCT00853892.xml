      The objective of this open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover study was to evaluate the
      oral bioavailability of the Mallinckrodt controlled-release test tablet formulation of
      oxycodone 40 mg compared to an equivalent oral dose of a commercially available
      controlled-release tablet of oxycodone (OxyContin® 40 mg, Purdue Pharma L.P.) in a test group
      of healthy subjects under fasting conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, 18 years of age or older.

          2. Female subjects must be postmenopausal for at least one year, surgically sterile, or
             practicing adequate non-hormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to and for
             the duration of study participation. All female subjects will undergo a pregnancy test
             at screening and at check-in to the clinical study site for every dosing period. The
             results of the test must be negative for continued participation.

          3. Weight must be within 15% of the ideal weight for height and frame, as adopted by the
             Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1999.

          4. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by a
             screening medical history obtained within 30 days prior to study start. Subjects
             should not present with a history of significant past illness expected to affect the
             investigation.

          5. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:

               1. Laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis). A subject with
                  laboratory values that are not within the clinical laboratory's reference range
                  does not qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the
                  investigator.

               2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), drugs of abuse, alcohol, and hepatitis B and
                  C testing will be performed at screening. Results of these tests must be negative
                  or non-reactive for subjects to qualify for the study. At each check-in to the
                  study site, a urine drug screen will be performed that must be negative for
                  continued participation.

               3. Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all
                  subjects at screening. Appropriately trained and experienced medical personnel
                  must interpret this ECG. A subject with an ECG that is not within normal range
                  does not qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the
                  investigator.

          6. Subjects must be able to provide written consent and agree to abide by the study
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of chronic alcohol, drug, or narcotic abuse.

          2. Chronic use of tranquilizers, sedatives, aspirin, antibiotics, or other medications.

          3. History or presence of major organ dysfunction.

          4. History of malignancy, stroke, or diabetes; cardiac, renal, liver, pulmonary, or
             severe gastrointestinal disease; or other serious illness.

          5. History of anxiety, tension, severe agitation, psychosis, or mental depression.

          6. Family history or diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder.

          7. History of acute abdominal or pelvic conditions.

          8. History of conditions which might contraindicate or require caution be used in the
             administration of oxycodone, including renal impairment, hepatobiliary or pancreatic
             disease, GI obstruction, cardiac disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, acute or
             severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, elevated intracranial pressure, depleted blood
             volume, paralytic ileus, or allergy to oxycodone, or history of hypersensitivity to
             any opiate agonist

          9. Administration of any other investigational drug during the 30 days prior to
             enrollment into the study.

         10. Subjects who have smoked or used nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to
             study entry.

         11. Subjects who have donated blood within 30 days prior to study entry, including that
             withdrawn during the conduct of any other clinical study.

         12. Subjects presenting with acute illness.

         13. Subjects who have taken prescription drugs within 14 days or over-the-counter
             medications (including herbal preparations) within 7 days prior to dosing except for
             standard daily dose multivitamins.

         14. Subjects who have a positive Narcan® challenge.
