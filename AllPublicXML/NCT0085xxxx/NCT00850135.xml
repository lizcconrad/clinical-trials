  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic pregnant patients are at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including larger than
      expected fetuses and unplanned operative deliveries, due to elevated blood glucose levels.
      the one-hour glucola test is currently used to screen pregnant patients for gestational
      diabetes. This involves ingesting a 50-gram glucose load, followed by a blood test one hour
      later. We wish to compare 7-day continuous glucose monitoring to the one-hour glucola test,
      and determine which one correlates better with adverse pregnancy outcomes as well as which
      one more accurately identifies patients at risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

      All pregnant patients without pre-existing diabetes will be eligible for the study. Interest
      in participation will be determined at their initial prenatal visit. Those that are
      interested will be consented. Between 24-28 weeks of gestation, the recommended period of
      glucola testing, a soft sensor for continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be
      inserted superficially under the skin. The patient will be instructed on how to wear and care
      for the device. She will wear the CGMS for 7 days, then return to the clinic for removal of
      the device, and downloading of the data. She will perform the routine glucola test sometime
      between days 2 to 7 . Finger stick blood glucoses will be checked by the patient 2 times
      daily during the 7 days of wearing the CGMS. Results of CGMS will not be available to the
      patient or her physician until after completion of the pregnancy. The patient will be treated
      routinely, based on the results of the routine glucola test.

    <measure>Correlation Between Glucose AUC and Birth Weight.</measure>
    <time_frame>CGM measured 7 days at beginning of pregnancy,birth weight measured a time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>For each patient's CGM data, we calculated the total area under the curve (AUC) for values above the predefined cutoffs of 110, 120, 130, 140, and 180 mg/dL. Patients wore the CGM for different amounts of time; therefore, the total AUC for the entire duration of CGM use was divided by the number of 24-hour periods of data collection. We called these normalized values &quot;AUC-110,&quot; &quot;AUC-120,&quot; &quot;AUC-130,&quot; &quot;AUC-140,&quot; and &quot;AUC-180,&quot; and they reflect both the magnitude and duration of hyperglycemic excursions above the predetermined thresholds in an average 24-hour period. Birth weight percentile was determined using birth weight data derived from 1999 and 2000 United States Natality datasets. The correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between birth weight percentiles and each of the following: AUC-110, AUC-120, AUC-130, AUC-140, AUC-180, and 1-hour GCT result.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pregnancy and Delivery Characteristics for Participants With AUC-130 &lt;= 22,000 and AUC-130 &gt; 22,000</measure>
    <time_frame>CGM measured 7 days at beginning of pregnancy,birth weight measured a time of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>For our secondary outcome analyses,we chose to focus on AUC-130 because 130 mg/dL is a common threshold used when treating gestational diabetics. In addition, 130 mg/dL was the threshold used in an earlier pilot study performed at our institution because it had the best correlation with birth weight percentile.
Secondary outcomes were compared between these two groups using the chi-square test. Data were analyzed using Stata 11.2. AUC-130 values were divided into &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; at a cutoff of 22,000, which was the 90th percentile of AUC-130 values.</description>

        <title>Correlation Between Glucose AUC and Birth Weight.</title>
        <description>For each patient’s CGM data, we calculated the total area under the curve (AUC) for values above the predefined cutoffs of 110, 120, 130, 140, and 180 mg/dL. Patients wore the CGM for different amounts of time; therefore, the total AUC for the entire duration of CGM use was divided by the number of 24-hour periods of data collection. We called these normalized values “AUC-110,” “AUC-120,” “AUC-130,” “AUC-140,” and “AUC-180,” and they reflect both the magnitude and duration of hyperglycemic excursions above the predetermined thresholds in an average 24-hour period. Birth weight percentile was determined using birth weight data derived from 1999 and 2000 United States Natality datasets. The correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between birth weight percentiles and each of the following: AUC-110, AUC-120, AUC-130, AUC-140, AUC-180, and 1-hour GCT result.</description>

The patient will be instructed on how to wear and care for the device. She will wear the CGMS for 7 days, then return to the clinic for removal of the device, and downloading of the data. Finger stick blood glucoses will be checked by the patient 2 times daily during the 7 days of wearing the CGMS.</description>

        <description>For our secondary outcome analyses,we chose to focus on AUC-130 because 130 mg/dL is a common threshold used when treating gestational diabetics. In addition, 130 mg/dL was the threshold used in an earlier pilot study performed at our institution because it had the best correlation with birth weight percentile.
Secondary outcomes were compared between these two groups using the chi-square test. Data were analyzed using Stata 11.2. AUC-130 values were divided into “high” and “low” at a cutoff of 22,000, which was the 90th percentile of AUC-130 values.</description>

          <title>Continuous Glucose Monitor for Diabetes in Pregnancy Screening</title>
          <description>The Seven Continuous Glucose Monitoring System: Between 24-28 weeks of gestation, the recommended period of glucola testing, a soft sensor for continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be inserted superficially under the skin. The patient will be instructed on how to wear and care for the device. She will wear the CGMS for 7 days, then return to the clinic for removal of the device, and downloading of the data. Finger stick blood glucoses will be checked by the patient 2 times daily during the 7 days of wearing the CGMS.</description>
