      The purpose of this prospective clinical data-collection is to document the performance and
      clinical outcomes of Pro Osteon® as a Bone Void Filler. FDA has cleared this device via
      premarket notifications 510(k) K063346, K980817, and K990131. There will be no experimental
      or investigational devices used.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria will be the same as the stated indications stated in the summary of the
        FDA approved 510(k) K063346, K980817, and K990131 application. These indications are stated
        below:

          -  PRO OSTEON® 500R Resorbable Bone Graft Substitute is indicated only for bony voids or
             gaps that are not intrinsic to the stability of the bony structure.

          -  PRO OSTEON® 500R is indicated to be gently packed into bony voids or gaps of the
             skeletal system (i.e, the extremities, spine and pelvis). These defects may be
             surgically created osseous defects or osseous defects created from traumatic injury to
             the bone. PRO OSTEON® 500R can be combined with autogenous blood, and/or sterile
             fluids (saline or Ringer's solution). The product provides a bone void filler that
             resorbs and is replaced with bone during the healing process.

          -  Surgical techniques and patient care are to be standard for the surgeon participating
             in the protocol and should be maintained the same throughout the course of the
             data-collection.

          -  All patients must sign an IRB-approved Informed Consent to be enrolled into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria will be the same as the stated contraindications stated in the summary
        of the FDA approved 510(k) K063346, K980817, and K990131 application. These
        contraindications are stated below:

          -  Pro Osteon® 500R Resorbable Bone Graft Substitute is contraindicated for fractures of
             the growth plate

          -  For segmental defects

          -  For indications which may be subjected to excessive impact or stresses

          -  When there is significant vascular impairment proximal to the graft site

          -  When there are metabolic or systemic bone disorders that affect bone or wound healing

          -  In infected sites

          -  When stabilization of the defect is not possible.

          -  The use of Pro Osteon® 500R is also contraindicated in cases where intraoperative soft
             tissue coverage is not planned or possible.
