      The goal of this clinical research study is to create a registry (research database) of
      clinical data about patients who receive radiation therapy, with or without hormone therapy,
      to treat prostate cancer that has come back after surgical removal of the prostate. This
      treatment is standard and the actual treatment is not part of this protocol.

      Researchers want to collect data and use this registry to learn about the long-term status of
      prostate cancer after these treatments.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 500 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson,
      Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System, and/or MD Anderson Cancer Center Albuquerque.

      Standard Treatment:

      If you are found to be eligible and you choose to take part, you will be enrolled in this
      study. Study participants will be those who are receiving the standard radiation treatment
      for prostate cancer, which has come back after surgical removal of the prostate. If your PSA
      level is lower, you will receive radiation alone. If your PSA level is higher, you will
      receive hormone therapy in addition to radiation. You will sign a separate consent form that
      will describe these treatments and their risks in more detail. This study requires no other
      treatment. The main purpose of this study is data gathering through the use of questionnaires
      and tissue banking.

      Follow-Up Tests

      After your treatment (radiation with or without hormone therapy), you will receive routine
      follow-up care. The results of the following routine tests will be entered into the registry:

        -  After completing radiation, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your PSA
           levels every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and
           every year from then on.

        -  If you receive hormone therapy, additional blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to
           check the levels of testosterone hormone. These blood tests to check your testosterone
           levels will be drawn at the same time as your PSA blood tests, until your testosterone
           levels are in the normal range.

        -  Every 6 months for the first 2 years after completing radiation, you will have a
           physical exam and a digital rectal exam. After that, the physical exam and digital
           rectal exam will be repeated every year from then on.

      Information Collection:

      While you are on study, on a long-term basis, researchers will collect information from your
      medical records about the status of the disease. This information will be entered into the
      registry. To identify you, the registry uses your medical record number instead of your name
      or other identifying information. The registry is password-protected to keep the data secure.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You will be on study for as long as you agree to keep taking part. If you go off study, your
      data will no longer be entered into the registry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate definitively treated by radical prostatectomy.

          2. Patients must have no evidence of nodal or distant metastasis by clinical and
             radiologic staging to include bone scan and CT scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.
             Patients with clinical or radiographic local recurrence are eligible. In patients with
             Gleason score less than or equal to 7 and PSA less than or equal to 1, CT or MRI of
             the abdomen is recommended but not required.

          3. Rising PSA after prostatectomy defined as at least 2 consecutive rises. If total PSA &lt;
             0.2 ng/ml, surgical pathology must also show extracapsular extension, positive
             margins, or seminal vesicle involvement.

          4. Total PSA &lt; 5 ng/ml within 12 weeks prior to starting radiation or hormone therapy.

          5. Patients with PSA greater than or equal to 0.5 ng/ml may have up to 3 months of an
             LHRH agonist and an anti-androgen immediately prior to enrollment.

          6. All patient must have a serum testosterone of 150 ng/dl or greater documented prior to
             initiation of hormone therapy. Alternatively, patients without documentation of serum
             testosterone prior to initiation of hormone therapy should not have had any other
             prior hormone therapy within the 24 months preceding initiation of hormone therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pathologically positive pelvic lymph nodes at prostatectomy.

          2. Patients with positive prostascint scans outside prostatic fossa.

          3. Any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological therapy for cancer within 90 days of
             enrollment.

          4. Hormone therapy (specifically LHRH agonist or antagonist, non-steroidal or steroidal
             antiandrogens) of more than 6 months duration at any time in the past for prostate
             cancer.

          5. Contraindications to external beam radiation therapy to include previous pelvic
             radiation, inflammatory bowel disease or history of collagen vascular disease.
