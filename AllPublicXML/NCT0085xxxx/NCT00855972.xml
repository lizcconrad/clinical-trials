  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to obtain data or information on the safety and effectiveness
      of low dose naltrexone (LDN) for treating the symptoms of juvenile primary fibromyalgia
      syndrome. This is a dose finding study to find whether LDN helps the symptoms of juvenile
      fibromyalgia, and at what dose it does so.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot dosage-finding and efficacy study, we will experimentally test whether LDN
      reduces the symptoms of JPFS. We will recruit 40 children with JPFS. Participants will be
      screened via the JPFS criteria of Yunus and Masi. The study will be an open-label test of
      various doses of LDN to determine whether LDN reduces JPFS symptoms, and the appropriate dose
      at which it does so. Primary endpoints will be daily pain, fatigue, and sleep.

      The protocol is designed to take 18 weeks. There are a total of 10 study visits, taking place
      approximately every 2 weeks.

    The FDA IND application is paused due to additional required testing. The IRB protocol was
    closed prior to research starting.
