      To compare treatment outcome in patients with Crohn's disease with secondary loss of response
      to infliximab (i.e. initial good response follow by loss of response) treated according to
      current standards based only on clinical features versus treatment based on serum levels of
      infliximab and anti-infliximab antibody (Ab) status.

    <description>In the intervention group treatment of patients with Crohn's disease with secondary loss of response to infliximab is based on serum infliximab and anti-infliximab Ab levels according to following algorithm:
Low s-infliximab in the presence of anti-infliximab Ab: Adalimumab 80 mg s.c. followed by 40 mg every 2 weeks.
Low s-infliximab without anti-infliximab Ab: Infliximab 10 mg/kg i.v. every 8 weeks.
High s-infliximab without anti-infliximab Ab: Stop infliximab treatment. Review history. Steroids or surgery.
High s-infliximab in the presence of anti-infliximab Ab: Same as number 3.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be able to understand the information given to him/her and give written
             informed consent.

          2. Definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease (confirmed by recent radiological, endoscopic
             and/or histological evidence according to international criteria) .

          3. Age minimum 18 years.

          4. Previous good response to at least 3 doses (5mg/kg) of infliximab (as judged by the
             treating physician).

          5. Loss of response to standard doses of infliximab (as judged by the treating
             physician).

          6. Last infliximab infusion given at least 4 weeks before inclusion.

          7. For patients with luminal disease, the CDAI should be above 220 points at inclusion.

          8. For patients with fistulising disease only, at least one draining perianal fistula
             (confirmed by radiography, MR, ultrasound or physical examination) should be present.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any contraindication to continued infliximab treatment

          2. Short bowel syndrome

          3. Bowel resection within 12 weeks of inclusion.

          4. Current or recent history of severe, progressive, and/or uncontrolled renal, hepatic,
             haematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological, or
             cerebral disease.

          5. Pregnancy

          6. History of alcohol or drug abuse within the prior year

          7. Patients who do not meet concomitant medication criteria.

          8. Any other condition, which in the Investigator's judgment would make the patient
             unsuitable for inclusion in the study.
