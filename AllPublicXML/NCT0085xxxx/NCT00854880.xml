      The primary biologically active components of ginseng are saponin triterpenoid glycosides
      called ginsenosides whose names relate to their chromatographic position (Ra, Rb, etc.).
      Based on the related studies, American ginseng was inferred to have the effects of modulating
      gastrointestinal system, lowering blood sugar level, enhancing memory, and suppressing
      mutation of breast cancer cell line. It also has anti-oxidant and neuroprotective effect.
      Among the experiences about the therapeutic uses of American ginseng, it is concluded that
      American ginseng is effective in treating gastrointestinal diseases. PDC339 is an active
      ingredient of American ginseng. This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
      parallel comparative phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDC-339
      in patients with acute erosive gastritis. The study period for each patient includes a
      screening/wash-out period of 1 week and a treatment period (including a 2-week follow-up) of
      6 weeks. Subjects will be required to make a total of 5 visits. There will be a total of
      evaluable 60 patients (20 patients in each treatment group). If the drop out rate is assumed
      to be up to 10%, then there will be a total of 69 eligible patients. All of the subjects who
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and receive
      randomly either PDC-339 or placebo according a randomization list. The following clinical
      assessments will be performed: Primary efficacy assessment - the change of endoscopic gastric
      integrity; secondary efficacy assessment - the change of the severity of symptom on a 4-point
      scale at visit 3,4 from the baseline.
