  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of noninvasive pressure support
      ventilation and early alveolar recruitment maneuver during anesthesia induction of morbidly
      obese patients on both oxygenation and functional residual capacity modifications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atelectasis formation during general anesthesia, leading to reduced end-expiratory lung
      volume, is an important cause of intrapulmonary shunt leading to impaired gas-exchange and
      hypoxemia. During general anesthesia and the immediate postoperative period, morbidly obese
      patients, who develop a larger amount of atelectasis than non-obese patient, are more likely
      to present impairment of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. Noninvasive
      positive-pressure support ventilation (NIPPV) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) are
      effective to provide oxygenation during intubation of hypoxemic patients. Recent data suggest
      that NIPPV enhances preoxygenation in morbidly obese patients. Moreover, the application of
      PEEP during induction of anesthesia prevents atelectasis formation and increases nonhypoxic
      apnea duration in obese patients despite the use of high-inspired oxygen fraction. However,
      the use of both NIPPV is widely used in the operating room, because of technical and
      materials constraints.

      Several trials have demonstrated that alveolar recruitment maneuvers (RM) are effective to
      remove atelectasis and improve lungs mechanics and gas-exchange.

      The purpose of this randomized and controlled study is to compare the effects of two
      ventilatory strategies during anesthesia induction of morbidly obese patients on both
      gas-exchange and functional residual capacity (FRC) modifications: 1- Control group:
      preoxygenation using 100% O2 via a face-mask and PEEP 10 cmH2O after intubation; 2- NIPPV
      group: preoxygenation using NIPPV and PEEP 10 cmH2O after intubation; 3- RM group:
      preoxygenation using 100% O2 via a face-mask and early RM plus PEEP 10 cmH2O after
      intubation.
