  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of pregnant women experience depression. Untreated depression during
      pregnancy is linked to decreased prenatal care, difficulties in the pregnancy, poorer
      outcomes for the baby, and developmental, language, and behaviour problems in the older
      child.

      While medication can often offer relief, pregnant women suffering with depression are often
      reluctant to take medications that may affect the unborn baby. There is little research about
      the effectiveness of other treatments such as support groups.

      The investigators project will provide relaxation groups for pregnant women with anxiety and
      depression. The group will provide a chance to get support from other pregnant women. Two
      health care specialists will provide information about anxiety and depression. They will also
      teach the skills for women to manage their symptoms. Women will be asked to complete a few
      questionnaires to evaluate their symptoms before, during, and after they join the group. They
      will also be asked to evaluate how the group met their needs.
