      Study phase: Phase II Investigational product, dosage, and route of administration:
      Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) is composed of a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody (ibritumomab)
      covalently bound to the chelating agent tiuxetan. To prepare the active therapeutic agent
      [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, the antibody is chelated with the β-emitter yttrium-90 chloride
      immediately before intravenous administration. Treatment with [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan is
      preceded by an infusion of rituximab (Rituxan, Mabthera) in order to optimize the
      biodistribution of radiolabeled antibody by depleting CD20 positive B-cells. Rituximab is a
      chimeric human/murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody. The Zevalin study regimen is given as an
      infusion of rituximab 250 mg/m2 and (where biodistribution imaging or dosimetry is
      compulsory) 185 MBq (5mCi) of [111In]-ibritumomab tiuxetan on Day 1 followed 7 to 9 days
      later by a single dose of 14.8 MBq/kg (0.4 mCi/kg) of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, maximal
      dose of 1184 MBq (32 mCi), preceded by 250 mg/m2 of rituximab.

      Indication: stage II-IV follicular lymphoma (FL) grade I-II after 4 cycles of FMR Study
      objectives: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, as well as
      assessment of quality of life Patient population: Patients with after 4 cycles of treatment
      with FMR Study design: Prospective, multicenter, open-label study designed to treat patients
      with a sequential front-line treatment represented by 4 cycles FMR plus Zevalin Duration of
      treatment: Four months for FMR and two treatment days one week apart followed by a 12-week
      safety period for Zevalin Duration of study: Estimated duration of study is 18 months Primary
      efficacy parameter: Overall response rate and complete response rate Secondary efficacy
      parameters: Overall survival, Disease-free survival, health-related quality of life.

      Safety parameters: Vital signs, adverse events (AEs), hematology, blood chemistry,and
      immunoglobulin levels Number of study centers: 4 study centers in Italy T otal number of
      patients, statistical rationale provided: Expected total of 55 patients. The final sample
      size will be based on the number of events observed for the primary efficacy endpoint as
      calculated in the sequential statistical model.

      Adverse events: AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning and/or spontaneously reported
      will be documented.

      Planned start and end of recruitment: Start of recruitment: 3rd quarter 2006. End of
      recruitment: 1st quarter of 2007
