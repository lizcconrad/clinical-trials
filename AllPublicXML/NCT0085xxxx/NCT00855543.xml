      The purpose of this study is to better understand (1) if phospholipase A2 producing
      microorganisms and cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13) are associated with
      premature labor (2) if pregnant teens are more likely to have phospholipase A2 producing
      bacteria than a pregnant adults and (3) if there is a difference in the cytokines between
      pregnant teens and adults.We hypothesize that phospholipase producing microorganisms may
      trigger the onset of premature labor. The following are hypothesized: (a) The microorganism
      cultured should show high activities of phospholipase A2 (b) The cervical length measurement
      predictive value should correspond to the gestation age at term (c) Vaginal flora of teen
      will be more susceptible to colonization with higher phospholipase A2 producing bacteria than
      that of an adult (d) The maternal genotype contribution to the concentration of IL-1, IL-4,
      IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and TNF-alpha during the first trimester of pregnancy in teens is
      different in the production of inflammatory cytokines and modulators(e) The maternal genotype
      of teens therefore influences the production of phospholipase A2 and causes an increase in
      preterm delivery.
