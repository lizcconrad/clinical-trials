      This is a multi center, open label, long term safety study in pediatric subjects 6 through 17
      years of age, inclusive, with a diagnosis of ADHD associated insomnia. Subjects who complete
      Study 190 246 (Rollover subjects) and meet the study enrollment criteria will be allowed to
      participate in this long term safety study. Additionally, Treatment na√Øve subjects will be
      enrolled in this long term safety study in order to meet the overall subject enrollment
      objective of obtaining 100 subjects with 12 months of treatment. This study was previously
      posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon Sumitomo
      Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion Pharmaceuticals

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Item Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is a physician-completed scale to assess any suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. The C-SSRS contained questions about suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. Subjects were placed into categories for suicidal behavior and for suicidal ideation based on their responses to various questions. Any suicidality was defined as suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. The suicidal behavior categories were determined based on the response to the questions under suicidal behavior (Completed Suicide, Actual Attempt, Interrupted Attempt, Aborted Attempt, Preparatory Acts or Behavior).The suicidal ideation categories were determined by examining the response to 5 questions under suicidal ideation (Wish to be Dead, Nonspecific Active Suicidal Thoughts, Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act, Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan, Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Coding Copy Subtest A or B, or Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months (from the 1st dose to the end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>These tests are standardized information processing tasks to assess recognition and recoding of sensory information. The subject was given 90 seconds to complete as many substitutions of symbols as possible according to a code provided on top of the sheet. The Coding Copy Subtest A was used for subjects 6 to 7 years of age, the Coding Copy Subtest B was used for subjects 8 to 16 years of age, and the DSST was used for subjects 17 years of age. The DSST consists of rows containing small blank squares, each paired with a randomly assigned numbers 1-9. Above the rows is a key that pairs each number with a symbol. The subject must fill in the blank spaces with the matching symbol that is in the key. For the Subcopy tests the subject simply copies the symbol above each empty square. Scaled scores are used to account for age differences among test takers. Scaled scores range from 1 to 19, and higher scores indicate higher cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months (from the 1st dose to the end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>CBCL was completed by parents or guardians who saw the child in home-like settings. It includes several competence items, open-ended items for describing the child's illnesses, disabilities, concerns about the child, best things about the child, and several items to rate behavioral, emotional, and social problems. Responses are recorded on a Likert scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The checklist contains 120 questions. The standardized score is computed by determining the z-score by subtracting the mean for the subject's age group and gender from the raw score and then dividing this by the standard deviation for the subject's age group and gender. Next, multiply the zscore by 15 and then add 100. For activities scale, social scale, school scale, and total competence scale, higher values indicate higher competencies. For Internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and total problems, higher values indicate more problems.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Conners' Continuous Performance Test II (CCPT II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months (from the 1st dose to the end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The CCPT-II is a computer-based 14-minute, visual-performance task. During an administration, respondents were required to press the space bar or click the mouse whenever any letter except the target letter appears on the screen. The speed at which the letters were presented varied during the administration. There were 6 blocks, with 3 sub-blocks, each containing 20 trials (letter presentations). The interstimulus intervals (ISIs) were 1, 2, and 4 seconds with a display time of 250 milliseconds. The order in which the different ISIs were presented varied between blocks. Conners' CCPT-II provides the following measures:% Omissions,% Commissions, Hit Reaction Time, Hit Reaction Time Standard Error,Variability of Standard Error, Detectability (d'), Response Style (beta), Perseverations, Hit Reaction Time Block Change (Vigilance Measure), Hit Standard Error Block Change (Vigilance Measure), Hit Reaction Time ISI change, and Hit Standard Error ISI Change, Confidence Index.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Months (from the 1st dose to the end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-10‚Ñ¢ Health Survey for Children is a 10-item care-giver completed assessment designed to measure children's health-related quality of life. The scale asked questions about the child's physical wellness, feelings, behavior, and activities at school and with family and friends. The SF-10 physical and psychosocial summary measures were scored such that higher scores indicated more favorable functioning. The Physical Summary Score is computed by summing values for questions 1, 2a, 2b, 3 and 5 and standardizing scores by normalizing to a total possible score of 0-100 with higher scores representing more positive indications. The Psychosocial Summary Score is computed by summing questions 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and standardizing scores by normalizing to a total possible score of 0-100 with higher scores representing more positive indications.</description>

        <title>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Item Responses</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a physician-completed scale to assess any suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. The C-SSRS contained questions about suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. Subjects were placed into categories for suicidal behavior and for suicidal ideation based on their responses to various questions. Any suicidality was defined as suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. The suicidal behavior categories were determined based on the response to the questions under suicidal behavior (Completed Suicide, Actual Attempt, Interrupted Attempt, Aborted Attempt, Preparatory Acts or Behavior).The suicidal ideation categories were determined by examining the response to 5 questions under suicidal ideation (Wish to be Dead, Nonspecific Active Suicidal Thoughts, Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (Not Plan) without Intent to Act, Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan, Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent).</description>

        <description>These tests are standardized information processing tasks to assess recognition and recoding of sensory information. The subject was given 90 seconds to complete as many substitutions of symbols as possible according to a code provided on top of the sheet. The Coding Copy Subtest A was used for subjects 6 to 7 years of age, the Coding Copy Subtest B was used for subjects 8 to 16 years of age, and the DSST was used for subjects 17 years of age. The DSST consists of rows containing small blank squares, each paired with a randomly assigned numbers 1-9. Above the rows is a key that pairs each number with a symbol. The subject must fill in the blank spaces with the matching symbol that is in the key. For the Subcopy tests the subject simply copies the symbol above each empty square. Scaled scores are used to account for age differences among test takers. Scaled scores range from 1 to 19, and higher scores indicate higher cognitive function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</title>
        <description>CBCL was completed by parents or guardians who saw the child in home-like settings. It includes several competence items, open-ended items for describing the child's illnesses, disabilities, concerns about the child, best things about the child, and several items to rate behavioral, emotional, and social problems. Responses are recorded on a Likert scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. The checklist contains 120 questions. The standardized score is computed by determining the z-score by subtracting the mean for the subject‚Äôs age group and gender from the raw score and then dividing this by the standard deviation for the subject‚Äôs age group and gender. Next, multiply the zscore by 15 and then add 100. For activities scale, social scale, school scale, and total competence scale, higher values indicate higher competencies. For Internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and total problems, higher values indicate more problems.</description>

        <description>The CCPT-II is a computer-based 14-minute, visual-performance task. During an administration, respondents were required to press the space bar or click the mouse whenever any letter except the target letter appears on the screen. The speed at which the letters were presented varied during the administration. There were 6 blocks, with 3 sub-blocks, each containing 20 trials (letter presentations). The interstimulus intervals (ISIs) were 1, 2, and 4 seconds with a display time of 250 milliseconds. The order in which the different ISIs were presented varied between blocks. Conners‚Äô CCPT-II provides the following measures:% Omissions,% Commissions, Hit Reaction Time, Hit Reaction Time Standard Error,Variability of Standard Error, Detectability (d‚Äô), Response Style (beta), Perseverations, Hit Reaction Time Block Change (Vigilance Measure), Hit Standard Error Block Change (Vigilance Measure), Hit Reaction Time ISI change, and Hit Standard Error ISI Change, Confidence Index.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Scale</title>
        <description>The SF-10‚Ñ¢ Health Survey for Children is a 10-item care-giver completed assessment designed to measure children's health-related quality of life. The scale asked questions about the child's physical wellness, feelings, behavior, and activities at school and with family and friends. The SF-10 physical and psychosocial summary measures were scored such that higher scores indicated more favorable functioning. The Physical Summary Score is computed by summing values for questions 1, 2a, 2b, 3 and 5 and standardizing scores by normalizing to a total possible score of 0-100 with higher scores representing more positive indications. The Psychosocial Summary Score is computed by summing questions 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and standardizing scores by normalizing to a total possible score of 0-100 with higher scores representing more positive indications.</description>
