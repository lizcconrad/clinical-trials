  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer patients are often at risk of malnutrition because of weight loss, lack of
      appetite and reduced food intake. Being malnourished can contribute to the incidence and
      severity of cancer treatment side effects and increase the risk of infection. Currently
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer do not receive early nutrition using a feeding tube.

      The purpose of this study is to compare enteral nutrition along with standard post-surgery
      care against current standard post-operative care alone. This study will see if early
      nutrition using a feeding tube has an impact on length of hospital admission, recovery from
      surgery, complications from surgery, nutritional status and ultimately a reduction in
      treatment costs in people with Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC). Primary Peritoneal
      Cancer (PPC) or Fallopian Tube Cancer. Nutritional support has been shown to ;

        -  Prevent and treat under-nutrition,

        -  Enhance anti-tumour treatment effects,

        -  Reduce adverse effects of anti-tumour therapies,

        -  Improve quality of life.

    <description>During primary surgical treatment an enteral feeding tube will be inserted through the patient's nose into their small bowel. Enteral feeding will commence 4 hours following return to ward from surgery. Feeding will start at a rate of 40 ml/hr for the first 24 hours, and then increased to goal weight. Goal will be calculated by 125 kiloJoules/kilogram adjusted body weight.</description>
