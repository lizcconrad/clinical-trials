  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries (tooth decay) is a disease with significant public health implications
      afflicting low-income children, with marked rural disparities in disease prevalence and
      treatment. More than 70% of 11th grade children in Crook, Deschutes and Jefferson counties
      have experienced tooth decay. Effective approaches to prevent decay include brushing with
      fluoridated toothpaste and professional dental care. Medicaid enrolled children are legally
      entitled to dental care under Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT), yet
      &lt;50% had any care in 2010. Free distribution of toothpaste and toothbrushes combined with
      parental education can increase toothbrushing frequency and reducing tooth decay. However,
      many parents are confused about when to start, how much and often toothpaste should be used,
      and how to overcome behavioral difficulties in brushing toddlers' teeth or getting older
      children to brush their own. The investigators' objective is to implement and evaluate a
      community-wide toothpaste distribution campaign enhanced by telephone support for OHP
      children and adolescents and their families in Central Oregon

      A community-wide toothpaste distribution campaign enhanced by telephone support. A tooth kit
      with toothpaste and toothbrushes for the whole family together with oral hygiene instructions
      in English and Spanish will be mailed every 3 months. Half of the population will be randomly
      assigned to also receive telephone support (Short message service and one-to-one calls).
      Families will receive biweekly messages with oral hygiene tips. Bilingual culturally
      competent staff will be available by telephone to support families in overcoming barriers.
