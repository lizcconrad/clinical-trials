    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and
      Ad26.ZEBOV as heterologous and homologous prime-boost vaccine regimens in healthy adult
      participants.

    <textblock>
      This study consists of 3 parts: the first and third part with standard doses and the second
      part with higher doses. All parts are randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV
      administered in different doses, sequences and schedules to healthy adult participants. The
      study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days, a vaccination period in which
      participants will be vaccinated at baseline (Day 1) followed by a boost on Day 15, 29, or 57,
      and third vaccine 1-year post-prime (3rd vaccination is optional for subjects in groups 1-8).
      The total duration of the study will be about 1 year for participants who wiil receive boost
      vaccine and about 3 months for participants who will receive placebo and 2 year for
      participants who will receive a 3rd dose. Safety will be monitored during the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and the
             investigator's clinical judgment

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) â¥18.5 and &lt;35.0 kg/m2

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum Î²-human chorionic
             gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening, a negative urine pregnancy test immediately
             prior to each study vaccine administration, and practice adequate birth control
             measures from 28 days before the prime vaccination until at least 3 months after the
             boost vaccination as specified in the study protocol. If not heterosexually active at
             screening, must agree to practice adequate birth control measures if they become
             heterosexually active during their participation in the study (from screening onwards
             until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination). Agree not to donate eggs (ova,
             oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction during participation in the study
             (from screening onwards until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination)

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal (&gt;45 years of age with
             amenorrhea for â¥2 years or any age with amenorrhea for â¥6 months and serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 mIU/mL) or surgically sterile (hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), are not required to use the
             birth control methods as specified in the study protocol

          -  A man who has not had a vasectomy and is sexually active with a woman of childbearing
             potential must agree to use a double-barrier method of birth control, such as either
             condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with occlusive cap
             (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.
             In case the female partner is using an adequate method of birth control, a
             single-barrier method of birth control for the male subject is acceptable. Men must
             also agree not to donate sperm during their participation in the study (from screening
             onwards until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination)

          -  Must be available and willing to participate for the duration of the study visits and
             follow-up, provide verifiable identification, and have a means to be contacted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been vaccinated with a candidate Ebola vaccine

          -  Has been diagnosed with Ebola disease or exposed to Ebola including travel to West
             Africa in the last 12 months. West Africa includes but is not limited to the countries
             of Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone. Participants who anticipate traveling to
             epidemic Ebola areas before the start of the long-term follow-up period will also be
             excluded from enrollment into the study

          -  Has received any Ad26- or MVA-based candidate vaccine in the past

          -  Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines
             or vaccine products (including any of the constituents of the study vaccines),
             including known allergy to egg or aminoglycosides

          -  A woman who is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             enrolled in the study or within 3 months after the boost vaccination

          -  History of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet
             alone; thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12
             months; uncontrolled hypertension as defined in the study protocol; or, major
             psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12 months that in
             the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation
