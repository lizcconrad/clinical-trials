    <textblock>
      The objectives of the proposed study are to assess whether the metabolic effects of walnut
      consumption depends on which food components the walnuts substitute (i.e. carbohydrates;
      saturated fatty acids) and whether it is important to consume walnuts as snacks or with
      meals.

      The objectives of the proposed study are to assess whether the metabolic effects of walnut
      consumption depends on which food components the walnuts substitute (i.e. carbohydrates;
      saturated fatty acids) and whether it is important to consume walnuts as snacks or with
      meals.

      The metabolic effects of walnut consumption may not only relate to the ingested walnuts but
      also to what is not eaten when walnuts are consumed. We want to evaluate whether the
      metabolic changes are more pronounced if study participants are instructed to reduce
      carbohydrates or saturated fatty acids to remain on an isocaloric diet. In a third group we
      will test what food is omitted if no specific instructions are given. Furthermore half of the
      subjects in each group will be instructed to eat walnuts with meals and half as snacks.
