  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reproducibility assessment of a quantitative measure of the amount of trunk compensation by
      kinematic analysis in a grasping task in stroke patients.This &quot;maladaptive trunk
      compensation&quot; is suspected to be underlined by &quot;arm non-use&quot; in some patients, since this
      abnormal movement impairs the ability of patients to correctly flex their shoulder and extend
      their elbow during grasping.
