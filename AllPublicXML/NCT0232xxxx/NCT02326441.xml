  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug
      KX2-361 and to determine how much of the study drug enters the bloodstream, in patients with
      advanced malignancies that have not responded to conventional therapies.

             metastases are also eligible.

             OR Confirmed Histological/cytological hematological malignancy that is refractory
             to/relapsed after and/or intolerant of standard therapies or for which no standard

             any number of prior treatments are allowed.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-2, Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60 (for glioma
