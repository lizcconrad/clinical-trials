    <measure>Central Corneal Swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 Hours Post lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal swelling measurements were taken in the right eye during slit lamp evaluations, 6-8 hours post lens insertion. The average corneal swelling per lens was reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Limbal Redness</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 hours post lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>Limbal redness was assessed in both eyes using a slit lamp, 6-8 hours post lens insertion. Redness was assessed in 4 regions of the eye (nasal, temporal, inferior and superior) and was graded with a 5-point scale (i.e. Grade 0= None, Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). For each region (nasal, temporal, inferior and superior) the average grade was calculated by lens. The Total Grade was then calculated by summing all the average grade for each region. The regional average grade ranges from 0 to 4. The total Grade ranges from 0 to 16.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant must be at leat 18 years old or older and no greater than 65 years
             old. Children younger than18 will likely no be able to come back and forth to the
             clinic during the typical work week as outlined in the above (due to school schedules)
             and thus not be able to adhere to the protocol.

          2. The participant must be a current soft contact lens wearer who routinely wears lenses
             at least 6-8 hours per day and at least 4 days per week for at least the past 3
             months.

          3. Refraction suitable for spherical soft contact lens powers between -1.00 and -6.00 D
             the participant must be correctable to 20/30 or better at distance with both eyes with
             dispensed contact lenses.

          4. The participant must be free of any active anterior segment disorders that would
             preclude safe contact lens wear. Active anterior segment disorders and evidence of
             central microbial keratitis are not allowed. However, evidence of past CLPU will be
             allowed so long as no more than 3 such scars are detected bilaterally. Evidence of
             more than 3 CLPU-like scars places excessive risk on the participant for subsequent
             CIE.

          5. The participant must be correctable to 20/25 or better in each eye with spectacles.
             Amblyopia will be excluded.

          6. Flat and steep corneal curvatures from keratometry readings must be between 39.00 and
             48.50 D, respectively. Corneal curvatures outside this range may be indicative of a
             disease state, and the participants are not expected to comfortably wear the study
             lenses.

          7. The participant must own or agree to purchase a pair of spectacles that can be worn
             when lenses are removed, during the washout periods, or in case of ocular discomfort
             or emergency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant has worn rigid gas permeable contact lenses within the last 30 days or
             PMMA lenses within the past 12 months. These lenses can transiently alter the corneal
             shape and influence the fitting of soft contact lenses or alter endothelial cell
             morphology.

          2. The participant has an immunocompromising disease or any other systemic disease that
             in the investigator's opinion will affect ocular health or increase risk during daily
             contact lens wear.

          3. The participant is taking any medication that in the investigator's opinion will
             affect ocular physiology or study participation.

          4. The participant has an ocular disease or condition such as aphakia, clinically
             significant corneal dystrophies, corneal edema, external ocular infection, iritis, or
             had any anterior segment surgery.

          5. The participant is taking any ocular medications. If a participant was previous taking
             any ocular medications, the medications must have been discontinued at least 2 weeks
             prior to enrollment.

          6. The participant must have less than or equal to grade 2 on any of the slit lamp
             observations of: upper tarsal papilla, corneal staining, corneal neovascularization,
             conjunctival injection, and lid erythema or scales.

          7. The participant is currently pregnant or lactating. Participant who become pregnant
             during the study will be discontinued.

          8. An employee or member of the UHCMC Eye Institute or a family member of any study
             personnel.

        <title>Limbal Redness</title>
        <description>Limbal redness was assessed in both eyes using a slit lamp, 6-8 hours post lens insertion. Redness was assessed in 4 regions of the eye (nasal, temporal, inferior and superior) and was graded with a 5-point scale (i.e. Grade 0= None, Grade 1 = trace, Grade 2 = Mild, Grade 3 = moderate and Grade 4 = severe). For each region (nasal, temporal, inferior and superior) the average grade was calculated by lens. The Total Grade was then calculated by summing all the average grade for each region. The regional average grade ranges from 0 to 4. The total Grade ranges from 0 to 16.</description>
