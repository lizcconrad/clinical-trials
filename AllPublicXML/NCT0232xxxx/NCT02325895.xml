    <textblock>
      The objective of the investigators current study was to examine whether 50 g dried plum would
      be as effective as 100 g dried plum in reversing bone loss in osteopenic older postmenopausal
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty-five randomly assigned into one of three treatment groups: 1) 50g dried plum; 2) 100g
      dried plum; and 3) control (0g dried plum). All groups received 500mg calcium and 400 IU
      vitamin D as a daily supplement. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months to
      assess biomarkers of bone turnover. Physical activity recall and 3-day food records were
      obtained at baseline, 3 and 6 months to examine physical activity and dietary confounders as
      potential covariates
