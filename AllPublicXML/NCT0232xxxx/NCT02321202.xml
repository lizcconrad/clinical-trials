    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of ω-3 fatty acid in patients with liver cancer followed hepatectomy
      is not known. This study provided evidences that ω-3 fatty acid-based parenteral nutrition
      improved postoperative recovery for cirrhotic patients with liver cancer underwent
      hepatectomy..

    <textblock>
      A new lipid emulsion enriched ω-3 fatty acid was manufactured, and was reported avoid
      hyperinflammatory situations in patients followed major surgery. However, the role of ω-3
      fatty acid-based parenteral nutrition for postoperative patients with cirrhosis-related liver
      cancer is unclear. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ω-3 fatty
      acid-based parenteral nutrition for cirrhotic patients with liver cancer followed
      hepatectomy.

      A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted for cirrhotic patients with
      liver cancer underwent hepatectomy between March 2010 and September 2013 in the investigators
      institution. For postoperative parenteral nutrition, 20% Structolipid and 10% Omegaven were
      applied to the trial group, while only Structolipid to the control group for 5 consecutive
      days postoperatively.
