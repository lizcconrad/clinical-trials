    <textblock>
      The McGill Ingestive Skills Assessment (MISA) for measuring dysphagic clients' functional
      performance during meals has been previously translated into Danish (MISA-DK) and this
      translated version validated. Critical issues about the construct validity of the scale, per
      se, had been raised. Consequently, major revisions of the MISA-DK have been undertaken, which
      necessitates a new validation process. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the construct validity of a revised version of the MISA-DK when used amongst dysphagic adults
      in hospitals settings and community services.

      This study will assess the construct validity of a revised version of MISA-DK in the acute
      and rehabilitative settings by testing it for fit against a multidimensional Rasch model.

      Participants in this research will be 500 dysphagic clients from several centres in Denmark,
      namely 250 acute patients from three Danish Regional university Hospitals in Herning,
      Hjørring and Odense, and 250 clients in the rehabilitation setting from the Århus
      Rehabilitation Institute, Hillerød Rehabilitation Institute and the Rehabilitation division
      of Copenhagen.

      Participants who are judged to have a swallowing problem are assessed with the MISA-DK by
      special educated occupational therapists The MISA-DK assessment are implemented as a part of
      the usual assessment routine at the occupational therapy departments at the included centres
      and will be administered immediately after referral to Occupational therapy. This research
      will be the first to implement and assess a standardised method for assessing mealtime
      performance for dysphagia in dysphagic patients across the continuum of diagnosis and
      rehabilitation recovery.

      The application of the Multidimensional Rasch models to the MIS-DK data aims to identify the
      combination of items in the MISA-DK that provide the highest level of specific objectivity
      and statistical sufficiency when determining ingestive skill ability. Furthermore,
      Differential item function by diagnosis, age and setting will be determined.

    <description>The MISA-DK is administered as observation of dysphagic clients performance during a usual meal with 14 different textures (four liquids and ten solids). The MISA-DK is composed of 36 ingestive skill items distributed into four subscales: positioning for meals (four items); self-feeding skills, judgment and behavior (seven items); and oral motor skills for liquid (11 items) and solid ingestion (14 items). All items are scored on a three-point ordinal scale (1=absent ingestive skill; 2=insufficient ingestive skill performance; 3=adequate ingestive skill performance), which are summated into a total score. The scores of the 36 ingestive skill items serve as a basis for rehabilitation planning and diet recommendations.</description>
