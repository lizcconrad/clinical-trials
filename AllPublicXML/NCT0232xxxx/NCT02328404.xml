      This is a prospective double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial
      designed to examine the effect of supplementation with 50,000 IU vitamin D3 for 3 months on
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) prognosis, serum 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) level, serum

      This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of 50,000 IU vitamin D
      supplementation once weekly for 3 months on improvement in PCOS prognosis and improvement in
      serum 25(OH)D levels in 60 overweight Jordanian females (defined as having a BMI 25-30kg/m2),
      diagnosed with PCOS (based on Rotterdam criteria), and with hypovitaminosis D (defined as a
      serum 25(OH)D level &lt; 20 ng/mL), compared with placebo.

      Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the dosing regimen will be conducted over 6 study
      visits during which clinical and biochemical signs of PCOS as well as serum 25(OH)D level,
      serum chromium level, insulin resistance, and BMI will be evaluated.

      The measurements will be collected as follows : day (-7) during screening , Day (0) base line
      measurements , Day (30) , Day(60), Day (90), day (104).

          <title>Hirsutism Score</title>
          <description>The scale ranges between 0 and 36, where A score of 8 or higher was considered as androgen excess (Ferriman and Gallwey, 1961).
Hirsutism score was assessed using self-administrated Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system (Ferriman and Gallwey, 1961). Each participant answered the hirsutism test with the help of a trained nurse who was working in the same clinic. The score of each body site may range between 0 (no excessive terminal hair growth) to 4 (extensive terminal hair growth).</description>

        <description>Evaluation of the efficacy of the dosing regimen as per the approved Summery of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (50,000 IU vitamin D3 once weekly for 3 months) on improvement in PCOS prognosis clinically using ultrasound examination.
In this measure the reported results were the finding of the ultrasound examination after the course of the treatment /intervention as per the study protocol and reporting the numbers of patients with normal ovaries, One normal ovary and the other is polycystic or both ovaries are poly-cystic.
An improvement in PCOS prognosis clinically by ultrasound examination is defined by:
decreasing the number of follicles to &lt; 12 follicles measuring 2-9 mm in diameter
decreasing ovarian volume to &lt; 10 cm3</description>

One of the clinical signs of improving PCOS prognosis is menstrual cycle regularity.
In this measure ,the reported results consist of the number of volunteers/patients in each arm either with regular menstrual cycle or irregular menstrual cycle after completing the course of the treatment/ intervention as per the study protocol.
The results will be statistically analyzed using paired student t-test and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference of the means within and between the two groups will be calculated.</description>

        <title>Free Androgen Index</title>
        <description>Free Androgen Index is calculated as the ratio of total testosterone to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).
In this measure , the Free Androgen Index in each arm were reported after completing the course of the treatment / intervention as per the study protocol. After which, the means were compared for statistical significance between the two groups / arms.
Improvement assessment of PCOS Prognosis by evaluating the change in Free Androgen Index.
One of the clinical signs of improving PCOS prognosis is the change in FAI. the results will be statistically analyzed using Wilcoxon (Mann- Whitney) method at 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference of the means within and between the two groups will be calculated.</description>
