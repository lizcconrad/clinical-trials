      To study the effects of EPA-enriched supplement compared with conventional supplement in
      malnourished head and neck cancer patients undergone surgery. The patients are divided into 2
      groups receiving the different formula supplements. The both supplements are isocaloric. The
      patients receive the supplement for 3 weeks (1 week prior to surgery and 2 weeks post
      surgery) Primary outcome is perioperative weight changing. Secondary outcomes are body
      compositions, hospital stay days, complication and co-morbidity.
