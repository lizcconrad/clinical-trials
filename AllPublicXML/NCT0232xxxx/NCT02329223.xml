    <textblock>
      This was a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of omalizumab administered
      subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult participants 12
      - 75 years who received the diagnosis of refractory chronic spontaneous uriticaria and who
      remained symptomatic despite standard-dosed non-sedating H1 antihistamine treatment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Itch Severity Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly itch severity score is a component of the Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7) composite score. The UAS7 is a composite score of the number of wheals (hives) and the severity of the itch. The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS7 is a composite score of the number of wheals (hives) and the severity of the itch. The UAS7 is determined by the sum of the daily urticaria activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticaria activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticaria activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticaria activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticaria activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Number of Hives Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly hives score is the sum of the daily hives scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The number of hives is measured twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 12 hives per 12 hours). The daily hives score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline score is the sum of the daily hives scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates more hives. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a UAS7 Score ≤ 6 at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The UAS7 is a composite score of the number of wheals (hives) and the severity of the itch. The UAS7 is determined by the sum of the daily urticaria activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticaria activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticaria activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticaria activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticaria activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Size of the Largest Hive Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly size of the largest hive score is the sum of the daily size of the largest hive scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily size of the largest hive score is assessed twice daily (morning and evening) on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (&gt; 2.5 cm). The daily size of the largest hive score is the average of the morning and evening scores. The Baseline weekly size of the largest hive score is calculated over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher score indicates larger hives. A negative change score from baseline indicates a reduction in hive size.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Weekly Itch Severity Score Minimally Important Difference (MID) Responders at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly itch severity score MID response is defined as a reduction from baseline in weekly itch severity score of ≥ 5 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Complete Responders (UAS7 = 0) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Complete responders are defined as participants who achieved UAS7 = 0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10-item dermatology-specific health-related quality of life measure. Participants rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The overall DLQI is the sum of the responses to the 10 items and ranges from 0 to 30. A lower score indicates a better quality of life. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Itch Severity Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The weekly itch severity score is a component of the Urticaria Activity Score 7 (UAS7) composite score. The UAS7 is a composite score of the number of wheals (hives) and the severity of the itch. The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The Baseline weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher itch severity score indicates more severe itching. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Urticaria Activity Score Over 7 Days (UAS7) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The UAS7 is a composite score of the number of wheals (hives) and the severity of the itch. The UAS7 is determined by the sum of the daily urticaria activity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 42. The daily urticaria activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticaria activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticaria activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticaria activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Overall Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The DLQI is a 10-item dermatology-specific health-related quality of life measure. Participants rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Very much). The overall DLQI is the sum of the responses to the 10 items and ranges from 0 to 30. A lower score indicates a better quality of life. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
