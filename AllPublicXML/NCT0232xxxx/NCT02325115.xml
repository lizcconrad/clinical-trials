      Background: Despite current popularity, positive mental health is under researched. This is
      possibly due to a lack of consensus on appropriate measuresThe Warwick-Edinburgh Mental
      Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS) is a 14 positively phrased Likert-style list of items developed to
      measure mental well-being. Its validation has been internationally explored. This report
      presents the French validation of the WEMWBS (F-WEMWBS) in non-clinical and clinical
      populations.

      Methods: Two non-clinical populations comprised of 319 working adults (WORK), and 75 students
      (STUD), and one clinical population of 121 patients with remitted schizophrenia (PRS) were
      included in the validation study. Participants completed the F-WEMWBS as well as
      complementary measures of psychological constructs potentially related to well-being.

      Three different populations participated in the study: two non-clinical populations composed
      of students (STUD), and working adults (WORK) and one clinical population comprised of
      patients with remitted schizophrenia (PRS). The STUD population was a convenient sample of 75
      first year students (51 females and 24 males); with 45 from a School of Business Management
      and 30 from a medical university. The WORK population was also a convenient sample of 113 (63
      females and 256 males) working adults including 217 soldiers from Paris Fire Brigade, 93
      nurses and 9 individuals from a research laboratory. The PRS population was comprised of 121
      remitted schizophrenia patients (39 females and 82 males) who were all clients of the
      rehabilitation centre for psychotic disorders (Le Vinatier hospital), situated in Lyon,
      France.
