  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dental pain study evaluating the efficacy and safety of a single dose of test
      acetaminophen (ACE) (1000 mg) compared to commercial acetaminophen (1000 mg), ibuprofen (IBU)
      (400 mg), and placebo over a 6 hour period. Subjects will undergo dental extraction of three
      or four third molars.
