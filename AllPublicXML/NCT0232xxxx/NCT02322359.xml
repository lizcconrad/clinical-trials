  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Chest compressions represent an important physical effort leading to fatigue and
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality degradation. Despite a known harmful effect of chest
      compressions interruptions, current guidelines still recommend provider switch every 2
      minutes. Feedback impact on chest compressions quality during an extended cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation remains to be assessed.

      Study design: simulated prospective monocentric randomized crossover trial. Participants and
      methods: Sixty professionals rescuers of the pre-hospital care unit of University Hospital of
      Caen (doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers) are enrolled to performed 10 minutes of
      continuous chest compression on manikin (ResusciAnne®, Laerdal), twice, with and without a
      feedback device (CPRmeter®). Correct compression score (the main criterion) is defined by
      reached target of rate, depth and leaning at the same time (recorded continuously).

      Hypothesis: Feedback device delay fatigue effect arises during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
