  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ERCP is the primary choice for removal of common bile duct stone (CBDS) currently. However,
      4-24% patients underwent recurrence after successful clearance of CBDS. Stone re-formation
      due to chronic inflammation of biliary duct is generally considered an important cause of
      CBDS recurrence, which is associated with duodenal-biliary reflux (DBR) after sphincterotomy.
      Although it was believed that DBR was the important cause of CBDS recurrence, the direct
      evidence was still lacking. Here we conducted a case control study to investigate the DBR
      rate in patients with recurrent CBDS after ERCP.

        Patients with history of recurrent common bile duct stone (recurrent group) and
        non-recurrent common bile duct stone (control group) in Xijing Hospital of Digestive
        Diseases were invited to participate the study. All the patients underwent successful stone
        removal by ERCP previously. Patients in the control group were matched with the recurrence
        group by age and gender at 1:1 ratio.
