  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to define an effective therapeutic approach, using
      currently available medication, to prevent or mitigate the loss of bone mass and bone
      strength that occurs after acute spinal cord injury.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of zoledronic acid to evaluate
      its efficacy and safety over a 2 year period for the prevention of bone loss and maintenance
      of bone strength in individuals with recent onset SCI (see diagram below). Subjects will be
      randomized at the baseline visit to receive either zoledronic acid or placebo. At the end of
      the first year of the study, each treatment group will be re-randomized to either zoledronic
      acid or placebo to evaluate the durability of response to zoledronic acid and the utility of
      serum bone markers to guide therapeutic decision making. DXA imaging, CT imaging and bone
      markers will be obtained at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months.

    <description>Mean change in BMD from baseline after one year, evaluated by DXA at the total hip, in the group of participants treated with zoledronic acid will be statistically significantly less than the mean change in BMD in the group receiving placebo.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Retreatment of those participants who received zoledronic for the first year of the study with zoledronic acid again is expected to result in a continued inhibition of bone loss, such that when compared to individuals who had received zoledronic acid for the first year and then placebo, a statistically significant difference between mean changes from baseline in BMD at the hip and knee skeletal sites will be observed after 2 years.</description>
