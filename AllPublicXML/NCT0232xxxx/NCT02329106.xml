      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of irreversible
      electroportion in unresectable liver cancer close to diaphragmatic dome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm pilot clinical trial. Patients will be subjected to irreversible electroporation
      (IRE) as the sole treatment of liver cancer close to diaphragmatic dome.

      This pilot study was designed to study the feasibility and safety of treatment as an
      alternative therapeutic IRE in the treatment of neoplastic nodules in the liver, with
      particular reference to close to diaphragmatic dome, where the current therapeutic arsenal is
      inadequate or counter-indicated.

      To perform the IRE procedure the IRE NanoKnife™ System (AngioDynamics) will be used.

    <description>Cell death of CRLM after IRE is demonstrated macroscopically by using vitality-staining with triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride (TTC). Since and shape of the ablation zone is assessed. Immunohistologic examination is used to more specifically assess microscopic cell damage and vessel wall damage. Apoptotic markers are used.</description>
