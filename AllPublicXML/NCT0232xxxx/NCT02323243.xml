    <textblock>
      Detrusor striated sphincter dyssynergia (DSSD) is defined as the persistence or increasing of
      the striated sphincter activity during voiding and characterizes the spinal cord injuries
      located under the protuberance. The standard treatment for DSSD is medical, either
      pharmacological or by clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC). Some patients are
      unable to perform CISC and require alternative surgical techniques such as external
      sphincterotomy which is invasive, irreversible and with no adjustment period for the patient.

      Urethral stents have been developed as an alternative to surgical sphincterotomy. Temporary
      stents provide a non-definitive treatment, especially for evolutionary pathologies, for
      patients refusing a destructive surgery (psychosocial impact), or for patients having not
      defined yet their therapeutic preference. The Allium company has developed the &quot; Bulbar
      Urethral Stent &quot; (BUS) system, which advantages are the possibility to perform the procedure
      under local anesthesia and to remove more easily the stent, with similar performances
      compared to the other devices. In order to quantify the interest of the BUS system, the
      investigators propose to perform a prospective study aimed at describing its technical and
      clinical results in terms of efficacy and safety.
