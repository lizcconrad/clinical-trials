  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an excess risk of acute kidney injury
      (AKI) with Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as compared to Selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), two classes of medication used for the treatment of
      depression.

      We plan to conduct retrospective population-based cohort studies within eight administrative
      databases from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Within each cohort, a
      nested case-control analysis will be performed to estimate incidence rate ratios (RR) of AKI
      associated with SNRIs compared to SSRIs using conditional logistic regression, with
      adjustment for high-dimensional propensity scores at baseline. The overall effect across
      sites will then be estimated using meta-analytic methods.

        The cohort will be formed of all patients in the databases aged 12 or older (or 65 or older
        in some of the databases) with a first prescription of an antidepressant of the SNRI or
        SSRI class of any dose between January 1, 1997 and March 31, 2010. The databases to be
        included are eight administrative databases from Canada (Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia,
        Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan), the United States (US MarketScan), and the United
        Kingdom (CPRD).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They had less than 1 year of information in the database prior to the date of cohort
             entry.

          -  They had a prescription of an SNRI or SSRI in the year before the date of cohort
             entry.
