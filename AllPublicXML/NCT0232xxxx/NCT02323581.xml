      configuration branched and fenestrated stent graft (TAAA device) or physician-specified
      branched and fenestrated stent grafts (Physician-Specified TAAA Devices) for treatment of
      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) involving the mesenteric and renal arteries in

    <description>Either the TAAA device or the Physician-Specified TAAA Device will be implanted.
The TAAA Device is a standard configuration branched stent graft with a combination of two branches for the mesenteric arteries and two fenestrations for the renal arteries.
The Physician-Specified TAAA Devices are designed on a per patient basis and may include a combination of up to 4 fenestrations and branches for mesenteric and renal arteries. An additional 5th branch or fenestration may be included if there is a large accessory renal artery. Branches will be used for downward-oriented mesenteric and renal arteries and fenestrations for renal arteries that project laterally or upwards.</description>

    <intervention_name>Endovascular treatment of Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm</intervention_name>
    <description>A TAAA is an abnormal enlargement (ballooning out) of the main artery (the aorta) and involves all or part of the aorta in your chest as well as all or part of the aorta in the abdomen. It also involves the part of the aorta where the arteries that bring blood to the liver, stomach and intestines and kidneys are attached.
This investigational procedure that is being studied uses stent-grafts (cylindrical fabric tubes (grafts), with metal springs (stents) attached). The stent-grafts are placed inside the aneurysmal (weakened) area of the aorta to re-line it. These customized stent-grafts have special branches attached to them or openings (called &quot;fenestrations&quot;) that are used to keep blood flowing to the arteries that supply the liver, stomach, intestines and kidneys. The investigational stent graft will be designed and custom-made specifically for your aneurysm.</description>
