  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects of different training types ,including combined
      inspiratory with expiratory pressure threshold training,inspiratory pressure threshold
      training on patients with chronic obstructive airway disease and investigate whether
      expiratory pressure threshold training associated with inspiratory pressure threshold
      training would be better than inspiratory pressure threshold training alone, with regard to
      exercise capacity, respiratory muscle strength and endurance.

    <textblock>
      We will study 60 patients diagnosed of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.The monitoring
      will be done for 8 weeks. Pressure-threshold respiratory trainers were calibrated to provide
      different loads according to the patients against inspiration (IMST) or expiration (EMST).
      Those chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinically stable patients stratified from mild
      to very severe GOLD stages, were blinded to randomly divided into 3 different groups:
      a)control group:without any training;b) inspiratory and expiratory pressure threshold
      training group: trained with the pressure threshold trainer twice time daily with 15minutes'
      duration;c)inspiratory pressure threshold training group:trained with the pressure threshold
      trainer twice time daily with 15 minutes' duration,different from the b group,the expiratory
      pressure threshold is calibrated at 0.
