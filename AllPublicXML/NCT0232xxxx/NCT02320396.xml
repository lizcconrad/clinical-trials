    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of desloratadine (MK-4117) in Japanese participants with
      seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). The primary hypothesis of this study is that the change
      from Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) is improved by desloratadine compared to
      placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) During 2 Weeks of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1 to Day 13 (Weeks 1 through 2 average) of double-blind treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS was used to evaluate participant nasal symptoms of: sneezing (daily frequency of attacks scored from 0 [&lt;1 time or &quot;none&quot;] to 4 [≥21 times]), rhinorrhea (daily frequency of blowing nose scored from 0 [&lt;1 time or &quot;none&quot;] to 4 [≥21 times]), nasal congestion (scored from 0 [no nasal blockage] to 4 [completely obstructed all day]), and nasal itching (scored from 0 [none] to 4 [nose is itchy, requiring frequent rubbing or blowing nose) as rated in the participant's diary. The TNSS was the sum of the 4 nasal symptom sub-scores. TNSS scores ranged from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms. Baseline (BL) measurement was an average of scores for 3 days prior to treatment (during Confirmation of Symptom Period). Post-BL measurement was an average from Day 1 to Day 13 (2 week average). Change from BL = Post BL measurement - BL measurement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks (Up to 2 weeks after last dose of study drug)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, was also an AE.</description>

    <description>The investigator assessed the participant's symptoms of allergic rhinitis and nasal findings at the end of the study (2 week visit or discontinuation visit) compared with those at the start of the study period (based on their recollection/memory of the participant's symptoms, no formal baseline assessment) and evaluated their impression of study drug on effect according to 6 grades: Much better, Better, Slightly better, Unchanged, Worse, or Unevaluable. The evaluation result and reason for judgment (if needed) was recorded in the participant's case report form. The investigator's impression was evaluated based on the symptoms for allergic rhinitis, nasal findings and participant's own impression at Week 2. The percentage of participants with assessments of &quot;Better&quot; and &quot;Much better&quot; graded by the investigator (Investigator's Impression Rate) was reported and analyzed using Odds Ratio analysis.</description>

        <description>The TNSS was used to evaluate participant nasal symptoms of: sneezing (daily frequency of attacks scored from 0 [&lt;1 time or “none”] to 4 [≥21 times]), rhinorrhea (daily frequency of blowing nose scored from 0 [&lt;1 time or “none”] to 4 [≥21 times]), nasal congestion (scored from 0 [no nasal blockage] to 4 [completely obstructed all day]), and nasal itching (scored from 0 [none] to 4 [nose is itchy, requiring frequent rubbing or blowing nose) as rated in the participant’s diary. The TNSS was the sum of the 4 nasal symptom sub-scores. TNSS scores ranged from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms. Baseline (BL) measurement was an average of scores for 3 days prior to treatment (during Confirmation of Symptom Period). Post-BL measurement was an average from Day 1 to Day 13 (2 week average). Change from BL = Post BL measurement – BL measurement.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s product, was also an AE.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in TNSS for Week 1 and Week 2 of Double-blind Treatment</title>
          <description>The TNSS was used to evaluate participant nasal symptoms of: sneezing (daily frequency of attacks scored from 0 [&lt;1 time or “none”] to 4 [≥21 times]), rhinorrhea (daily frequency of blowing nose scored from 0 [&lt;1 time or “none”] to 4 [≥21 times]), nasal congestion (scored from 0 [no nasal blockage] to 4 [completely obstructed all day]), and nasal itching (scored from 0 [none] to 4 [nose is itchy, requiring frequent rubbing or blowing nose) as rated in the participant’s diary. The TNSS was the sum of the 4 nasal symptom sub-scores. TNSS scores ranged from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating more frequent/severe nasal symptoms. Baseline (BL) measurement was an average of scores for 3 days prior to treatment (during Confirmation of Symptom Period). Post-BL measurement for Week 1 was an average from Day 1 to Day 7 and post-BL measurement for Week 2 was an average from Day 8 to Day 13. Change from BL = Post BL measurement – BL measurement.</description>

        <description>Eye symptoms rated in the participant’s diary included eye pruritis (eye itching scored from 0 [none] to 4 [severe eye itching, requiring frequent rubbing of eye]) and watering eyes (scored from 0 [none] to 4 [severe eye watering requiring frequent wiping of eyes]). Eye symptom scores ranged from 0 to 4, with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptom. The change from baseline in eye pruritis, eye watering, and the worse one of either eye symptom were reported. Baseline measurement was an average of scores for 3 days prior to treatment. Post-baseline measurement for Week 1 was an average of scores from Day 1 to Day 7. Change from BL = Post BL measurement – BL measurement.</description>

The change from baseline in eye pruritis, eye watering, and the worse one of either eye symptom were reported. BL measurement was an average of scores for 3 days prior to treatment. Post-BL measurement for 2 week Average was an average of scores from Day 1 to Day 13. Change from BL = Post BL measurement – BL measurement.</description>

The evaluation result and reason for judgment (if needed) was recorded in the participant’s case report form. The investigator’s impression was evaluated based on the symptoms for allergic rhinitis, nasal findings and participant’s own impression at Week 2. The percentage of participants with assessments of “Better” and “Much better” graded by the investigator (Investigator’s Impression Rate) was reported and analyzed using Odds Ratio analysis.</description>

        <description>The participant evaluated their symptoms of allergic rhinitis at the end of the study (2 week visit or discontinuation visit) compared with those at the start of the study period (based on their recollection/memory of their symptoms, no formal baseline assessment) and recorded in their Subject Allergy Diary their impression of study drug on effect according to 6 grades: Much better, Better, Slightly better, Unchanged, Worse, or Unevaluable. The percentage of participants with assessments of “Better” and “Much better” graded by the participant (Participant’s Impression Rate) was reported and analyzed using Odds Ratio analysis.</description>
