    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate the efficacy of transplanting screened donor
      fecal material in treating patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.
      Participants with refractory Clostridium difficile infection will be given healthy donor
      stool administered by colonoscopy or enema and their response will be evaluated by symptom
      questionnaire and stool testing for Clostridium difficile at 4 weeks after the treatment.
