  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggests that repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for brief periods
      (termed intermittent hypoxia) is a safe and effective treatment strategy to promote
      meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The goal of
      the study is to understand how caffeine may augment the effects of intermittent hypoxia on
      motor function and spinal plasticity (ability of the nervous system to strengthen neural
      pathways based on new experiences) following SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the effects of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) as a possible
      therapeutic intervention to promote functionally useful motor recovery. In this sub-study,
      the investigators will assess changes in leg motor function in response to repetitive AIH
      with and without caffeine.

      Participants will receive caffeine+AIH, placebo+AIH in a randomized order. Before each
      intervention round, subjects will be asked to avoid caffeine-containing substances for 48 hrs
      (&gt; 5* half-life of ~7 hrs) prior to arrival to control for baseline plasma levels of
      caffeine. Subjects will then ingest capsules containing either placebo (dextrose) or caffeine
      (up to 6mg/kg). Capsules will be prepared by Johnson Compounding &amp; Wellness. Saliva samples
      will be collected before and after the breathing intervention using a standard passive drool
      protocol to assess caffeine concentrations within the body. The subject will be asked to
      collect saliva in their mouth and drool into a vial.

      During and after each intervention, both the rate and extent of magnitude changes in
      voluntary and involuntary muscle response behaviors important for walking will be compared
      between interventions within participants. Repeated measurements will be collected on all
      subjects that participate in the multiple interventions.
