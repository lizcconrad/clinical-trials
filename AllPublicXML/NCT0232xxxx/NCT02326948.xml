    <textblock>
      In order to estimate region-specific risk factors for gallbladder cancer (GBC) in Jeju
      island, Korea the investigators performed a case-control study. Among 124 GBC patients and
      7088 health controls, the investigators randomly selected 78 cases and 78 age-sex matched
