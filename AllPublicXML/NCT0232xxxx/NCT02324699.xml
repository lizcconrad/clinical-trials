  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of co-induction with corticosteroid therapies may accelerate the remission rate when used
      with vedolizumab. Further, this may lead to higher rates of response and remission at week 10
      than would be seen with vedolizumab monotherapy.

      This study will examine prednisone co-induction with vedolizumab in patients with Crohn's
      disease. To address questions regarding the effect of co-induction on mucosal healing, the
      study will include colonoscopic assessment of mucosal healing. Finally, colonic biopsies in
      this study will allow to elucidate further the mechanism of action of vedolizumab in Crohn's
      disease through immune phenotyping studies.

    <description>Clinical remission, defined as CDAI &lt; 150, in group with steroid co-induction vs. placebo co-induction. The purpose of this crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) calculator is to gauge the progress or lack of progress for people with crohn's disease. CDAI scores below 150 indicate a better prognosis than higher scores</description>
