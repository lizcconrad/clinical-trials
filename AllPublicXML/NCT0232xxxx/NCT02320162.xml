  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project was to compare the effectiveness of experiential learning (EL) and
      traditional lecturing (TL) school-based oral health education on the oral health knowledge,
      attitude, habits, oral hygiene, gingival health and caries incidence of 10 and 13-year-old
      Greek children. Thee hundred and fifty children were selected from three areas of Greece.
      Information on oral health knowledge, attitude and behaviour were obtained using a
      questionnaire. Dental plaque was recorded using a modified hygiene index, gingivitis was
      assessed using the simplified gingival index and dental caries was measured by recording the
      number of Decayed, Missing and Filled teeth (DMFT) using the British Association for the
      Study of Community Dentistry (BASCD) criteria. All children were examined by two calibrated
      dentists, using a World Health Organisation (WHO) periodontal probe and artificial light.
      Questionnaires were delivered and clinical examinations were performed at baseline and at 6
      and 18 months post-intervention. The EL oral health educational program was implemented by
      teachers using the program's manual.

    <description>350 children were clinically examined and dental plaque, gingivitis and caries were recorded using appropriate indexes. 6 and 18 months later, children were re-examined using the same method to test if there was any change on the dental plaque, gingivitis and caries level and if this change differ significantly between the two different oral health education groups (Experiential learning or Traditional Lecturing).</description>
