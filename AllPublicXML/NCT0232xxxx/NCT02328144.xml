  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhoidal disease occurs in 50% of people over 40 years old and is the most common cause
      of anorectal surgery. One of the complications of hemorrhoidectomy is pain, which is a
      difficult symptom to appreciate and assess, by its frequent and large variations in
      sensitivity in each patient. Many studies have been done to reduce patient postoperative
      pain, but there is no ideal method. The application of both oral and topical metronidazole
      has shown to decrease pain following hemorrhoidectomy, but its use is not standardized.

      The investigators evaluated the effect of oral administration of metronidazole versus
      homologated placebo in pain control after hemorrhoidectomy

      Objective: Evaluate the effect of oral administration of metronidazole versus homologated
      placebo in pain control after hemorrhoidectomy.

      Material and methods: Controlled clinical trial, composed of 44 patients in a randomized
      manner, realized at the Coloproctology, Western Medical Center, Mexican Institute of Social
      Security. Referred beneficiaries adults were included, of either sex, who merited elective
      hemorrhoidectomy for hemorrhoidal disease grades III-IV using Ferguson's technique. They were
      assigned to receive metronidazole (study group) or homologated (control group) and the
      randomization was conducted by sealed envelopes and subsequently. We collected demographic
      and clinical variables. Postoperative pain was assessed by visual analog scale at 6 and
      12hrs, 1, 4, 7 and 14 days; additional analgesic use; complications; return to normal
      activity and patient satisfaction; also were measured, in a blood sample after surgery and 12
      hrs later, interleukin 6 and 10.

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
      frequencies and percentages
