    <textblock>
      This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate the effectiveness of two population-based
      outreach programs for preventing suicide attempts among patients identified as at-risk. The
      study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington (the lead site) and at
      HealthPartners, KP Colorado and KP Northwest. Electronic health records will be used to
      identify outpatients aged 18 or older who respond to a routinely administered PHQ depression
      questionnaire by reporting thoughts of death or self-harm &quot;most of the days&quot; or &quot;nearly every
      day&quot;. This trial will be limited to patients receiving care from one of the four
      participating health systems. Eligible patients will be automatically assigned to continue in
      usual care (1/3) or to either of the two intervention programs (1/3 each). Those assigned to
      usual care will not be contacted at all by study staff and will continue to receive usual
      care from treating primary care and mental health providers. Both intervention programs
      involve outreach by Epic secure messaging (with optional telephone outreach for those not
      reading messages). The Care Management intervention includes routine outreach to assess
      ongoing risk of suicide attempt and care management to monitor and facilitate ongoing
      engagement in outpatient follow-up. The Care Manager will coordinate care with treatment by
      primary and behavioral health care providers using Epic Staff Messaging (or telephone
      contacts if necessary). The Skills Training intervention uses an online skills training
      program to support patients in developing and using self-management skills for emotion
      regulation and crisis management. A Coach will monitor each participant's use of the program
      and send periodic messages (using Epic secure messaging) to encourage and support use of the
      program and practice of program skills. Each intervention continues for up to one year. In
      all three groups (Usual Care, Care Management, and Skills Training) virtual data warehouse
      data will be used to identify likely suicide attempts over 18 months following randomization.
      Analyses will compare risk of suicide attempt among all those randomized, regardless of
      response to the initial invitation or level of participation in the intervention programs.
      Comparison of all those randomized is the only scientifically valid method for assessing the
      overall impact of either program on population-level risk of suicide attempt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each week, a programmer will use Epic/Clarity data to identify adult outpatients who
      completed a PHQ depression questionnaire in the previous week and reported thoughts of death
      or self-harm &quot;most of the days&quot; or &quot;nearly every day&quot;. This trial will be limited to patients
      receiving care from one of the three participating health systems.

      Those identified will be automatically assigned to continued Usual Care or to one of two
      intervention programs (Care Management or Skills Training).

      The Care Management intervention includes periodic outreach to assess ongoing risk of suicide
      attempt and as-needed care management to facilitate engagement in ongoing outpatient
      follow-up. Contacts will occur by secure messaging (with the option of telephone outreach for
      those who do not read messages). Each contact will include a request to complete a new risk
      assessment questionnaire (the abbreviated Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale used at each
      site) unless a risk assessment was recently documented in the medical record. Using an
      algorithm tested in pilot studies, the Care Manager will determine appropriate timing of
      follow-up and (if not already scheduled) communicate with the participant to facilitate
      appropriate follow-up care. Time between outreach contacts will vary from 2 weeks to 2
      months, depending on the most recent risk assessment. Outreach contacts will continue up to
      12 months. All outreach contacts will be documented in the Epic electronic health record in
      the same manner as any other mental health clinical contacts. The Care Manager(s) will be
      licensed mental health clinician(s) with experience in suicide risk assessment, supervised by
      site specific clinician investigators. A detailed protocol for the Care Management program
      (including sample messages) is included with this application.

      The Skills Training intervention is an online program intended to teach specific skills for
      emotion regulation and crisis management. The content of the program is derived from
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy, an evidence-based psychotherapy designed for people at risk for
      suicide attempts. The program includes four modules or chapters, each focused on a specific
      skill. Each chapter includes written and video didactic instruction, video examples, in-vivo
      practice, and written homework exercises. The program will be supported by a Coach who will
      send periodic messages (via Epic secure messaging) encouraging use of the program and
      practice of specific skills. Coaching messages will be scheduled every 1-3 weeks during the
      first 3 months of the program and every 1-3 months over the following 9 months (varying
      according to each participant's level of participation and progress in the program). All
      coaching messages will be documented in the Epic electronic health record in the same manner
      as any other mental health clinical contacts. The Coach(es) will be licensed mental health
      clinician(s) supervised by site specific clinician investigators. The online program will be
      delivered by a secure website (KP Washington Health Research Institute's DatStat server), and
      participants will reach the program using encrypted personalized links sent to them via Epic
      secure messaging. This trial does not have open enrollment, please see the public facing
      website at www.NowMattersNow.org

      Those assigned to Usual Care will not be contacted.

      For all patients in all three intervention groups, a site programmer will extract data from
      the Virtual Data Warehouse to identify probable suicide attempts over 18 months following
      randomization.
