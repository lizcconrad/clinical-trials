      Post Authorisation Safety Registry for US patients with Generalised Lipodystrophy treated
      with Metreleptin.

      This registry will add to the knowledge about metreleptin gained from clinical trials by
      providing information on the incidence rates of acute pancreatitis, hypoglycemia,
      hypersensitivity and lymphoma in patients treated with metreleptin in routine clinical
      practice.
