  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim is to analyze whether the routine use of chest physiotherapy in non cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) improves the cough severity and the quality of life in this
      population. In addition, the secondary end-points include incidences of exacerbations,
      changes in lung function, exercise capacity, airways inflammation, sputum analysis and
      eventual adverse events.

      The present project will be a single-blind , randomized, controlled trial of 12-month daily
      performing chest physiotherapy compared with usual care, followed by a 3-month
      intervention-free in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

      Intervention group will perform daily autonomous airway clearance techniques (positive
      expiratory pressure technique through Acapella device and autogenic drainage technique).
      Patients will receive professional sessions once a month.

      Control group will receive their usual care and educational sessions about their disease.
      Physiotherapist will call them once a month.

      During the study period the patients' pharmacological treatment remained unchanged
