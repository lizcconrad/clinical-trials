  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interval training is superior to continuous training for improving glycemic control,
      hereunder glycemic variability and -spikes. However, the underlying mechanisms and the
      clinical impact is at present unknown.

      The overall objective of this project is to determine the mechanisms underlying aeroic
      interval-training-induced reductions in glycemic variability and -spikes, and the impact on
      levels of systemic inflammation in type 2 diabetes patients. It is hypothesized that aerobic
      interval training reduces glycemic variability and -spikes more than continuous training due
      to larger improvements in both peripheral insulin sensitivity and the mass action effect of
      glucose. Moreover, it is hypothesized that these reductions in glycemic variability and
      -spikes also reduces systemic inflammation.

    <description>Systemic inflammation will be measured as isoprostanes in urine collected over 24 hours. The changes in glycemic control (Outcome 1), will be correlated with the changes in systemic inflammation.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>A 2-step (pancreatic + hyperinsulinemic) hyperglycemic clamp will be performed before and after each intervention, to assess the mechanisms behind the intervention-induced improvements in glycemic control. In this way, the intervention-induced effects on glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity will be assessed.</description>
