      Multicenter, prospective, interventional open case series study using a randomized
      split-mouth design in moderate to severe chronic periodontitis patients having half-mouth
      treated with the KLOX BioPhotonic OraLum gel with a LED curing lamp as an adjunct to
      conventional non-surgical periodontal treatment (SRP) versus SRP alone in the second
      (control) half-mouth.
