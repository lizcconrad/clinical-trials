  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) to
      placebo in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis (A
      common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded
      erythematous, dry, scaling patches).

      A Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the
      Investigator nor the participant know about the study treatment), placebo-controlled (a
      pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to
      test if the drug has a real effect) study of CNTO 1959 (Guselkumab) in the treatment of
      participants with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis. Participants will receive either
      treatment of CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) 50 milligram (mg) or 100 mg or Placebo 50 mg or 100 mg.
      Participants will primarily be assessed for Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score and
      Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QOL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a participants QOL. It is a 10-item questionnaire that in addition to evaluating overall QOL can be used to assess 6 different aspects that may affect QOL: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment. The DLQI item response options are rated by the participant from 0 (not at all/not relevant) to 3 (very much) with a total score range of 0 (best) to 30 (worst); higher scores indicate poor quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (NAPSI) Among Participants with Nail Psoriasis at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The NAPSI is an index used for assessing and grading the severity of nail psoriasis. A target nail representing the worst nail psoriasis is divided into quadrants and is graded for nail matrix psoriasis (pitting, leukonychia, red spots in the lunula, and nail plate crumbling) and nail bed psoriasis (onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop discoloration, and nail bed hyperkeratosis). The sum of these scores is the total NAPSI score. The total NAPSI score equals the sum of scores for all of the finger nails evaluated and ranges from 0 to 80. Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The ss-IGA instrument is used to evaluate the disease severity of scalp psoriasis. The lesions are assessed in terms of the clinical signs of redness, thickness, and scaliness which are scored as: no signs (0), slight signs (1), moderate signs (2), severe signs (3), and very severe signs (4). The sum of the 3 stores results in a total sign score ranging from 0 to 12.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EuroQOL Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by participants and consists of 2 pages - the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analog scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, and severe problems. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Physical and Mental Component Summary Scores of 36- Item Short Form Health Assessment Questionnaire (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of 8 multi-item scales: limitations in physical functioning due to health problems, limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general mental health (psychological distress and well-being), limitations in usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems, limitations in social functioning due to physical or mental health problems, vitality (energy and fatigue), and general health perception. Summations of item scores of the same subscale give the subscale scores, which are transformed into a range from 0 to 100; zero= worst HRQL, 100=best HRQL. PCS and MCS scores are constructed as a T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 and no minimum or maximum score; higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire : Psoriasis (WPAI: PSO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI questionnaire is used to measure productivity loss associated with psoriasis during the past 7 days. It consists of six questions about absence from work because of psoriasis, hours actually worked, reduction in productivity at work attributed to psoriasis and reduction in productivity while performing daily activities. This instrument generates four scores between 0 and 100: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced productivity while working), work productivity loss (overall work impairment / absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment, which were expressed in percentage of impairment.</description>
