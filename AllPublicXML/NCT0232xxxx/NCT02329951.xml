  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we are attempting to determine which factors are associated with
      interventional treatment outcome for LBP (and to what extent). Up to 346 patients with LBP
      who are considered to be good candidates for therapeutic interventional procedures will be
      given a complete history and physical exam, which includes the assessment of Waddell signs,
      and querying them regarding factors shown in non-interventional studies or retrospective
      studies evaluating interventional treatments to be associated with negative treatment
      outcomes. These factors include the presence of Waddell and other physical exam signs, opioid
      use, allergies, psychopathology, concomitant pain conditions, a 6-point Likert scale on
      expectations, sleep abnormalities, secondary gain (e.g. medical board or litigation),
      procedure-related pain, obesity, and smoking history. They will then proceed to undergo their
      scheduled intervention, which will be limited to epidural steroid injections (ESI), facet
      blocks and if positive, radiofrequency denervation, and sacroiliac (SI) joint injections. A
      positive outcome will be defined as &gt; 50% pain relief based on average pain score at 1-month
      and a score of at least 4 on a 1-5 Likert satisfaction scale. Those with a positive outcome
      at 1-month will remain in the study and be followed again at 3-months.

      This will be an observational study with a 3-month follow-up. The course of clinical
      treatment will be decided by a physician independent of the research. Besides filling out
      questionnaires and standardized follow-up visits, all subjects will receive the same care
      they would if they did not participate in the study. The study will be discussed with the
      subjects and they will be enrolled in the study after it is determined that they meet
      selection criteria and are scheduled for one of the above injections. They will then fill out
      all of the questionnaires. All procedures will be performed with fluoroscopy. Following each
      procedure, the procedure-related pain will be reported on a 0-10 scale (all patients will
      receive as much 1% lidocaine local anesthetic as is necessary), including the reported pain
      to the standardized skin wheal at the start of the procedure.

      Patients will then receive standardized epidural steroid injections (transforaminal or
      interlaminar), sacroiliac joint injections, or facet blocks and radiofrequency denervation if
      they experience a positive block. Details about these procedures are available upon request.

      No patients will be permitted additional interventions between the time of their procedure
      and follow-up visits. Rescue medications will be in the form of either tramadol, NSAIDs or if
      the patient is on opioids, a &lt; 20% increase in dose. The first follow-up visit will be
      scheduled 1 month from the start of treatment for ESI and SI joint patients, and 1 month
      after RF denervation in positive diagnostic facet block responders. In those facet block
      patients who obtain prolonged relief from the &quot;diagnostic&quot; medial branch block, follow-up
      will be 1 month after the block (these patients may proceed to have denervation if their pain
      recurs after 1 month but before their final 3-month follow-up, and their 3-month follow-up
      will be 3 months after their medial branch block). A positive outcome will be defined as a &gt;
      2-point decrease in average LBP coupled with a positive satisfaction rating (4 or 5 on a
      5-point scale). Subjects who obtain a positive outcome at their initial 1-month follow-up
      visit will remain in the study and return for the final 3-month follow-up visit. Those with a
      negative outcome will exit the study &quot;per protocol&quot; to receive standard care, which may
      consist of other injections or non-rescue medications such as antidepressants and
      anticonvulsants. Subjects who obtain a positive outcome at 1-month but experience a
      recurrence before their 3-month follow-up visit will also exit the study per protocol, with
      their final outcome measures recorded before they receive standard care.
