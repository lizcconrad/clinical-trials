  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial. This clinical study
      evaluates the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with advanced liver cancer who have
      progressed on Systemic Therapy (Chemotherapy and/or Targeted Therapy).

      Approximately 400 patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to Apatinib or placebo (1/3 chance to receive placebo).

      Primary endpoint of the study is overall survival.
