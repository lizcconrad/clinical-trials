  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to have subjects report whether or not several antibiotic
      products sting when they are applied to minor wounds created on the inner arms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the sting potential of single applications
      of over-the-counter (OTC) topical antibiotic ointments and cream compared to saline (negative
      control) and isopropyl alcohol (positive control) when applied to a tape-stripped wound site.

    <time_frame>Post-tape stripping to immediately after investigational product application</time_frame>
    <description>The stinging sensation was assessed by the subject using the following scale: 0 = no stinging sensation, 1 = mild stinging sensation, 2 = moderate stinging sensation, and 3 = severe stinging sensation at post-tape stripping and immediately after product application. Change from post-tape striping was calculated as the subject assessment of stinging sensation immediately after investigational product application minus the subject assessment of stinging sensation at post-tape stripping.</description>

             it through 1 month after administration of study drug)

          6. Willing and able to comply with the tape stripping and all study procedures and attend

          6. Known sensitivity or allergies to the investigational products, to first aid
             preparations or local anesthetics (e.g. gauze products, pramoxine), or to adhesive
             bandages

          7. Known allergies to unscented soap

             the inner forearms

         11. Presence of excessive hair on the inner forearms which could interfere with the test
             procedures

         12. Presents with skin disorders on the inner arms (cuts, scratches, scars, etc), which in
             the opinion of the Investigator or qualified designee, will interfere with the study
             assessment or will create undue risk for the subject

         13. Pre-existing or dormant dermatologic skin conditions (e.g., eczema, seborrheic
             dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, etc.) that could interfere with
             the outcome of the study as determined by the Investigator or qualified designee

         14. Other medical condition that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study

        <title>Mean Change From Post-Tape Stripping in Subject Assessment of Stinging Sensation Immediately After Investigational Product Application</title>
        <description>The stinging sensation was assessed by the subject using the following scale: 0 = no stinging sensation, 1 = mild stinging sensation, 2 = moderate stinging sensation, and 3 = severe stinging sensation at post-tape stripping and immediately after product application. Change from post-tape striping was calculated as the subject assessment of stinging sensation immediately after investigational product application minus the subject assessment of stinging sensation at post-tape stripping.</description>
        <time_frame>Post-tape stripping to immediately after investigational product application</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was based on all randomized subjects who initiated the tape-stripping procedures and perceived sting sensation immediately after the application of alcohol.</population>

          <title>Mean Change From Post-Tape Stripping in Subject Assessment of Stinging Sensation Immediately After Investigational Product Application</title>
          <description>The stinging sensation was assessed by the subject using the following scale: 0 = no stinging sensation, 1 = mild stinging sensation, 2 = moderate stinging sensation, and 3 = severe stinging sensation at post-tape stripping and immediately after product application. Change from post-tape striping was calculated as the subject assessment of stinging sensation immediately after investigational product application minus the subject assessment of stinging sensation at post-tape stripping.</description>
          <population>Analysis was based on all randomized subjects who initiated the tape-stripping procedures and perceived sting sensation immediately after the application of alcohol.</population>
