  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder
      characterised by chronic or recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort and diarrhoea. The aim of
      this trial is the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of oral ibodutant 10 mg once daily as
      compared to placebo in women with IBS-D over a 12-week treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the efficacy and safety of ibodutant 10 mg, given once daily for 12 weeks
      in comparison with placebo in female IBS-D patients. Randomisation to ibodutant and placebo
      will be 1:1. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of weekly response for abdominal pain intensity
      and stool consistency over 12 weeks of treatment in at least 50% of the weeks of treatment.

      The clinical phase of the study comprises up to 2 weeks of screening for patient's
      eligibility, a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free) for IBS severity assessment, a 12-week
      double-blind treatment period, a 4-week randomised withdrawal (RW) period and a 2-week safety
      follow-up, resulting in a maximum 22-week overall duration of the study for each patient.

      Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in a telephone-based electronic diary from
      run-in until end of treatment.
