  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the enantiomers of tramadol
      and O-desmethyltramadol (ODM) in generally healthy young and elderly adults. Using a
      randomised, double-blind, crossover design, participants were administered a single 200mg
      tramadol extended-release tablet and placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol (ODM) have not
      been extensively studied in elderly patients. Given the importance of hepatic function in the
      metabolism of tramadol into the more potent ODM metabolite and the fact that tramadol is
      primarily renally excreted, age-related changes in hepatic and renal function may affect the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of tramadol. Data on the pharmacokinetics of tramadol,
      the ODM metabolite and their enantiomers will provide important information as to the source
      of any differences in the metabolism or elimination of Tramadol Contramid® OAD in the elderly
      as compared to younger subjects. Differences in the PK of tramadol and O-desmethyltramadol
      could result in differences in Pharmacodynamics of tramadol, specifically in analgesic
      effect. An Electrically Stimulated Pain Model was used to evaluate any differences in current
      perception and pain tolerance between the age groups.
