  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The liver plays a crucial role in physiological glycemic control through its involvement in
      several glucose metabolism processes, including glycogenogenesis and glycogenolysis. Liver
      diseases result in impaired glucose metabolism due to hepatocyte dysfunction, termed as
      &quot;hepatogenous diabetes&quot;. Abnormal glucose metabolism is found in over 90% of patients with
      liver cirrhosis. and clinically significant diabetes is known to occur in 30% to 70% of the
      patients.

      A cohort study of cirrhotic patients with hepatogenous diabetes reported a relatively low
      diabetic complication rate, and the majority of mortality causes were complications related
      to liver cirrhosis; furthermore, mortality rate due to diabetic complications were reported
      to be low. Nonetheless, the average survival rate following the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis
      is rising due to increasing early detection rate and improvements in treatment modalities,
      and such rise in survival is expected to result in increased prevalence of hepatogenous
      diabetes and its complications. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate an accurate diagnosis
      of hepatogenous and to provide appropriate treatment.

      Analyses of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated an association
      between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and mean plasma glucose concentration in diabetic
      patients, and currently, HbA1c is being employed as an appropriate marker in diagnosing
      diabetes mellitus and in monitoring the control of mean blood glucose.

      The association between mean plasma glucose concentration and HbA1c in cirrhotic patients has
      not been clearly established as of yet; however, HbA1c in cirrhotic patients is expected to
      be influenced by various factors resulted by liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly, including
      rapid erythrocyte turnover rate and other glycation processes.

      Therefore, HbA1c may not be an appropriate indicator in the diagnosis of hepatogenous
      diabetes or the monitoring of glycemic control; however, no systemic study on this issue has
      been performed so far. Therefore, the investigators are aiming to investigate the association
      between mean plasma glucose concentration and HbA1c in patients with compensated or
      decompensated liver cirrhosis who also have hepatogenous diabetes.

    <description>The patient choose 3 days within each month, during which they shall check blood glucose level 7 times daily (fasting and 2-hour postprandial glucose for each meal plus bedtime glucose). This shall be done for 3 months.
The study shall be concluded after laboratory studies, including glycated hemoglobin, after 3 months.
Safety assessment :
The subjects shall be educated on hypoglycemic symptoms, checking blood glucose upon onset of hypoglycemia, and immediate food intake. They shall also be instructed to report such events immediately by phone. The cause of hypoglycemia shall be evaluated, and the medications shall be adjusted.
Efficacy assessment :
To assess the primary outcome, the mean plasma glucose shall be calculated by first obtaining the mean of self-monitored blood glucose across 3 days every month and then by adding 11% of the value to the mean- this shall be compared with glycated hemoglobin level measured at 3 months after baseline to check for association.</description>
