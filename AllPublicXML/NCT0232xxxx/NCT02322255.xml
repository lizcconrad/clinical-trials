  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) is a rare, severely disabling disease
      characterized by painful, recurrent episodes of soft tissue swelling (flare-ups) that result
      in abnormal bone formation in muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Flare-ups begin early in life
      and may occur spontaneously or after soft tissue trauma, vaccinations, or influenza
      infections. Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict movement by locking joints leading to
      cumulative loss of function and disability. This 3-year, non-interventional, two-part,
      natural history study is designed to gain insight into total body HO, FOP disease
      progression, the impact of FOP on subjects' physical functioning, and clinical features and
      biomarkers that may be useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. This
      natural history study will also provide important information to inform the design of
      subsequent interventional trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, natural history, non-interventional, longitudinal study in subjects
      with classic FOP. A thorough baseline examination will be performed to determine the current
      status of disease in each subject. In Part A, two imaging modalities assessed total body HO
      at baseline, and the optimal method (low-dose whole body CT scan [excluding head]) will be
      employed in Part B for the balance of the study. Progression will be assessed at annual
      in-clinic visits (ie, at Months 12, 24, and 36) at which time the procedures conducted at the
      baseline visit will be repeated. In addition, site personnel will telephone subjects midway
      between the annual visits (ie, at Months 6, 18, and 30).

      During the 36-month follow-up period, at least one new flare-up (with a maximum of one per
      year) will be carefully studied. An in-clinic visit will be performed within 14 days
      following the subject's identification of his/her flare-up. Additional visits at Day 42 and
      Day 84 (after the initial flare-up clinic visit) will be performed. An additional future
      visit may be scheduled after Day 84 at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI) for
      prolonged flare-ups. However, subjects with an eligible flare-up may elect to participate in
      an ongoing Clementia interventional study rather than continue in this natural history study.
