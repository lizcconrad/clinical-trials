      The purpose of this study is to evaluate to determine the effect of food on the PK(
      pharmacokinetics) of a single dose of 250 mg Sufatinib and its metabolites in healthy
      subjects and to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of 250mg in healthy
      subjects.This study will be an open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover PK food effect
      study of Sufatinib administered orally at 250 mg. Subjects will be screened for eligibility
      up to 14 days prior to entry into the study,there will be 2 treatments,2 weeks follow-up.
