      The study will explore the benefit of tea for microcirculation. Subjects will consume tea ar
      a placebo matched for taste and appearance in a blinded cross over design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies indicate that regular consumption of black tea reduces the risk of
      cardiovascular diseases. Tea consumption can result in improvements in endothelial function
      of conduit arteries as measured by flow mediated dilation.

      Less is known however about its effects in other vascular beds. The study will test the
      hypothesis that tea affects endothelial function in the muscle microcirculation. This will be
      done by assessment of forearm blood flow using venous occlusion plethysmography after
      consumption of black tea against or placebo in a randomised, full cross-over study in 20
      healthy middle-aged to elderly subjects
