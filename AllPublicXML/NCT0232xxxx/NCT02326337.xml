    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and economical benefits of
      Cyclical Pressure Topical Wound Oxygen (TWO2) Therapy in the treatment of chronic diabetic
      foot ulcers. Subjects will wear a standardized off-loading device and use advanced moist
      wound therapy (AMWT) dressings. Following a 2 week run-in period with the standardized care
      and after meeting all the eligibility criteria, half the subjects will use the TWO2 device,
      while the other half will use a sham device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects meeting the initial eligibility criteria will enter a 2 week run-in period with a
      standardized off-loading device, advanced moist wound therapy (AMWT) dressings and will
      receive sharp debridement. Subjects with wounds that do not decrease more than 30% at the end
      of the 2 week run-in period and where all other eligibility criteria are met, will be
      randomized to either the TWO2 device arm, or sham (placebo) device arm.

      All subjects will use the TWO2/Sham device for 90 minutes a day at their home or nursing care
      facility 5 times a week for the treatment phase of up to 12 weeks. Monitoring of the wound
      will take place with weekly clinic visits for safety and compliance assessment and
      documentation. Weekly wound photographs and measurements will be taken. Wounds that close at,
      or before, 12 weeks will continue to use TWO2/sham device, off-loading and AMWT and have an
      additional visit two weeks later to confirm wound closure. All subjects whether healed or not
      will enter a follow up period of an additional 12 and 38 weeks.

      The maximum duration for participation in the trial is 54 weeks. During the follow-up phase,
      subjects will receive standard care according to the clinician's recommendation and will be
      asked not to participate in another wound care trial during this period.

    <description>Economic Analysis is a composite measure of the wound before the study (up to one year) and for the duration of the study. The assessment is obtained by documenting treatment history of the wound that includes types of dressings used, time taken for dressing changes, by whom dressings are changed, and type and duration of hospitalization as well as the administration of the EQ-5D questionnaire at the Baseline visit, weeks 4, 8 and 12 on treatment and 12 and 26 weeks post treatment.</description>
