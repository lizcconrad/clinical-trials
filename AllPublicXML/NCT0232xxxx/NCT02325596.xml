    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the upstream events of Th17/Treg imbalance in CRS and their
      immune regulatory factors. Then the investigators aimed to explore the regulatory role of
      miRNA on DC-Th axis and its dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CRS, in order to determine the
      miRNA expression profile in CRS and clarify the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of CRS by
      regulating the DC-Th axis.

    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), commonly encountered in the Ô¨Åeld of clinical
      otorhinolaryngology, is still a challenging proposition for doctors because of its high
      incidence and the unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. Nowadays, studies on the pathogenesis of
      NP are still attached great importance by researchers from each country. NP has become a
      global health problem with a considerable socioeconomic burden. Recently, research showed
      that the impaired balance of Th17/Treg was the significant basis of NP. Nevertheless, the
      pathogenesis of Th17/Treg imbalance was unclear. In this study, DC-Th axis was designed as
      the main line, and the regulation of miRNA on DC was designed as the entry point. This study
      aimed to evaluate the upstream events of Th17/Treg imbalance in CRS and their immune
      regulatory factors. Then the investigators aimed to explore the regulatory role of miRNA on
      DC-Th axis and its dysfunction in the pathogenesis of CRS, in order to determine the miRNA
      expression profile in CRS and clarify the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of CRS by
      regulating the DC-Th axis. This study will play an important role in clarifying the
      pathogenesis of CRS eventually and will fill the blanks of the research between miRNA and CRS
      in the investigators'country. This study is with important clinical value for establishing
      control strategies for CRS.
