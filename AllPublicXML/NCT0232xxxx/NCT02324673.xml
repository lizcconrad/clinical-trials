  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label trial designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of 3 multiple ascending doses of Cannabidiol Oral
      Solution in a sequential fashion.

      Participants will be pediatric (aged 1-17, inclusive), experiencing treatment-resistant
      seizures, and satisfy all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE was defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatment or any event already present that worsens. Any laboratory (clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate) and physical examination findings deemed by the investigator to be clinically significant were captured as AEs. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires the participant be at a risk of death at the time of the event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, or other serious event that requires medical or surgical intervention.</description>

    <description>The CGI-I was completed by the parents/caregivers and the investigator and was used to assess participants global status of their condition on Day 11 using a 7-point scale, where 1=very much improved and 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S was completed by the parents/caregivers and the Investigator and was used to rate participant's mental illness status at Baseline (Screening) and Day 11 using a 7-point scale, where 1=normal, not mentally ill, and 7=among the most extremely mentally ill participants. This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. The change in CGI-S score at Day 11 relative to Baseline is reported. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement (decreased severity in illness).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Seizure Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The specific number of tonic and atonic seizures per study day were recorded in a diary. The change in number of seizures at Day 11 relative to Baseline is reported. A negative change from Baseline indicates an improvement based on Daily Seizure Activity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Suicide Related Thoughts and Behaviors Assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS captured the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide related thoughts and behaviors at Day 11. The C-SSRS was only used for participants ≥ 7 years of age. The number of participants with results of &quot;Yes&quot; for Suicidal Ideation (Wish to be Dead and Non-Specific Active Suicidal Thoughts) and Suicidal Behavior (Actual Attempt, Interrupted Attempt, Aborted Attempt, Preparatory Acts or Behavior, and Suicidal Behavior) are reported.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product. It does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE was defined as any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatment or any event already present that worsens. Any laboratory (clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate) and physical examination findings deemed by the investigator to be clinically significant were captured as AEs. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires the participant be at a risk of death at the time of the event, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital abnormality/birth defect, or other serious event that requires medical or surgical intervention.</description>

This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. The change in CGI-S score at Day 11 relative to Baseline is reported.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Assessment</title>
          <description>The CGI-S was completed by the parents/caregivers and the Investigator and was used to rate participant’s mental illness status at Baseline (Screening) and Day 11 using a 7-point scale, where 1=normal, not mentally ill, and 7=among the most extremely mentally ill participants. This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. The change in CGI-S score at Day 11 relative to Baseline is reported. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement (decreased severity in illness).</description>
          <population>EFF, all participants who received ≥1 dose of the investigational product and had ≥1 efficacy assessment for CGI-S post-dose.</population>
