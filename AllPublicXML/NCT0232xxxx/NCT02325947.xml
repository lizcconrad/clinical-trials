  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of non-invasive BCI-exoskeleton
      technology based on EEG patterns recognition matching to motor imagery in post-stroke
      patients with hand paresis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BCI training is based on EEG activity patterns recording during hand motor imagery. A
      subject sit comfortably 1m from a computer screen which presents visual instructions during
      the session. The robotic exoskeleton is fixed to the paretic hand. Subject visually fixate on
      a circle presented in the center of the screen and receive instructions from three
      surrounding rhomboidal arrows. Subject is given three commands instructing them to relax or
      imagine slow hand opening movement with the right or left hand. The &quot;Relax&quot; command means
      that the subject have to sit still and look at the center of the screen. Commands are
      presented randomly, each of 10 sec duration.

      A visual cue provides the subject with feedback regarding the mental task recognition: the
      central circle turned green if the classifier recognizes the task in agreement with the given
      command, or remains white if the signal is not recognized. In addition to visual feedback the
      subject is provided with kinesthetic feedback: the exoskeleton is opening the hand when the
      classifier recognizes the imagery of paretic hand movement.

      The EEG is registered with 30 electrodes distributed over the head in accordance with the
      standard international 10-20 system. EEG signals are filtered from 5-30Hz. A Bayesian
      approach for EEG pattern classifying is used in the system. The activity sources most
      relevant for BCI functioning will be identified using an independent component analysis
      (ICA). Classification accuracy will by measured with Cohen's kappa (Kohavi and Provost,
      1998). The procedure may consist from up to three sessions, the duration of 1 session is 10
      min, there are 5 min time brake between session and total duration of procedure is up to 45
      min. The number of procedures - at least 10. The maximal interval between procedures is 3
      days.
