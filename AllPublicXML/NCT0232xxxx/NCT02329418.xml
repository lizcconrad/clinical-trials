  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relatives of patients in situation of withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining therapies
      often show post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (60%)[1]. This number is even greater when
      family members are active in this decision (81%) or when communication is not optimal between
      medical team and family members.

      There are several ways to assist families of patients in intensive care units [2], amongst
      them the use of a written document to explain the environment, therapies and possible
      outcomes.

      Here the investigators want to test the impact of a written document in the context of
      end-of-life conference in intensive care units. Specifically, this research addresses wether
      such written support could decrease 3-months post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and
      depression exhibited by the closest family member or the patient representative.
