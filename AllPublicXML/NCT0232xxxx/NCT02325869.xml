      Coronary arterial disease (CAD) is defined as obstruction of blood flow into the coronary
      arteries (i.e. the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle). Patients with symptoms of
      coronary artery disease usually suffer from stable angina pectoris (chest pain or
      discomfort), unstable angina pectoris, or a myocardial infarction (heart attack). The
      symptoms range from mild angina, to moderate or severe angina.

      In some cases of CAD the blood vessel is chronically totally blocked (total occlusion),
      stopping blood flow through the blocked blood vessel. In these cases a minimally invasive
      treatment or a surgery may be needed. &quot;Minimally invasive procedures&quot; consist of angioplasty
      or stent placement. The procedure is performed under local anesthetic with the patient lying
      on their back.

      Angioplasty is a routine, well known, non-surgical procedure that is performed by making a
      small incision of the skin in the groin through which a catheter (narrow tube) and a
      guidewire (a thin metal wire) are inserted to reach the blocked artery. After reaching the
      blocked artery and crossing the blockage with a guidewire, a tiny balloon is inflated inside
      the artery to open the blockage. During the course of this procedure small pieces of the
      material that is causing the blockage may break off and be carried by the blood stream to
      other parts of the body where they may lodge and cause damage by blocking the blood flow .
      The Bell Balloon Catheter is designed to help the physician capture some of this material
      that may have broken off.

    <description>An angioplasty procedure to open the blockage in blood vessels will be performed. Standard angioplasty procedure includes local analgesia of the groin area and a small cut through which the procedure will be performed. An introducer sheath (thin tube) will be inserted. The Bell Balloon dilatation will then be inserted. The Bell Balloon works in fashion similar to standard balloon with the same physical and behavioral characteristics. Upon deflation, debris from the blockage is withdrawn into the cavity formed between the deflated balloon and its outer capsule. Then balloon is retracted and retrieved through the guiding catheter, together with the captured debris and trap it between the outer surface of the balloon and the inner surface of the membrane.</description>
