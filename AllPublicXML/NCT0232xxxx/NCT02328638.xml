  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to develop and pilot test a manual-based,
      interdisciplinary intervention for youth, ages 3 to 10 years, with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD) and overweight called the Changing Health in Autism through Nutrition, Getting fit, and
      Expanding variety (CHANGE) obesity program.

      The purpose of the study is to develop and test the feasibility of a structured, innovative
      approach to treat obesity in 16 children (age 3 to 10 years) with autism spectrum disorder
      (ASD). This 16-week program integrates behavioral psychology and nutrition science to meet
      the challenges of obesity in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The PI will apply
      an evidence-based behavioral intervention to increase food variety,15 use applied behavior
      analytic strategies to teach physical activities in a developmentally-appropriate manner,
      employ biometrics to assess progress, utilize dietetic interventions to improve nutritional
      balance, and train caregivers to use behavior management strategies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of ASD confirmed by a clinical psychologist using a &quot;gold standard&quot;
             diagnostic tools

          -  Overweight status, as evidenced by a BMI percentile &gt; 85% to 94%, and 4) mild to no
             food selectivity, as evidenced by either history of consuming some fruits and
             vegetable, tolerating new foods near their plate, and/or trying new foods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children being treated with atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine, aripiprazole,
             risperidone) or other medications known to cause weight gain will be excluded from the
             study due to the weight gain associated with these medications

          -  Children with unstable medical conditions will be excluded for safety concerns

          -  Children presenting with severe aggression, self injury, or other disruptive behaviors
             that require intensive behavioral intervention will be excluded and referred to other
             services as needed
