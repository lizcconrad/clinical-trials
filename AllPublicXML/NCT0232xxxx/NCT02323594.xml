          2. Target Population: Healthy subjects as determined by no clinically significant
             deviation from normal in medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and clinical
             laboratory determinations.

          3. Age and Reproductive Status : Males and females, ages 18 to 49 years, inclusive. Women
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 24
             hours prior to the start of study drug and must be using an acceptable method of
             contraception for 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Women must not be
             breastfeeding.

        Males who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of
        contraception for duration of treatment with study drug females must still undergo
        pregnancy testing as described in this section.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases : Any significant acute or chronic medical
             illness. Current or recent (within 3 months of study drug administration)
             gastrointestinal disease that could impact upon the absorption of study drug. Any
             major surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration. Any gastrointestinal
             surgery that could impact upon the absorption of study drug (appendectomies with no
             complications are allowed at the investigator's discretion). Inability to tolerate
             oral medication, smokers or recent durg or alcohol abuse and Any other sound medical,
             psychiatric, and/or social reason as determined by the investigator.

          2. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings: Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically
             significant deviation from normal in physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or
             clinical laboratory determinations beyond what is consistent with the target
             population, positive urine screen for drugs, positive blood screen for hepatitis C
             antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or HIV-1, -2 antibodies.

          3. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction : History of allergy to DCV, ASV, Hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors, HCV NS5A replication cofactors, or related
             compounds.
