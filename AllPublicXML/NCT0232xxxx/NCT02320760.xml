  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study evaluates the effect of individualized physical activity on
      prescription (PAP) in older overweight adults. The primary hypothesis is that an
      individualized prescription of physical activity increases physical activity level in
      overweight older adults after 6 months. Secondary hypothesis are that the increased physical
      activity level will improve cardio metabolic risk factors and quality of life.

      200 women and men, aged 65 with low physical activity level, overweight, and abdominal
      obesity, will be randomized to an intervention group or a control group. The control group
      receives general information about physical activity and registration of physical activity
      level for one week. The intervention group receives in addition an individualized physical
      activity on prescription with patient-centered counseling.

      After six months both groups go through the same health check-up as at baseline and
      follow-ups take place after 12 and 24 months.
