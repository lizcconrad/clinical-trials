  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to translate the &quot;AKQoL&quot;-questionnaire which measures the
      quality of life of patients with actinic keratosis into German and to validate it for the
      Swiss population.

      By using the technique of cognitive interviewing the investigators are focussing on the
      patients' understanding of the questions. The first session of cognitive interviews will
      show, where there is need for improvement in terms of misinterpreted phrases or vaguely
      worded questions. The goal is to rephrase the questions according to the feedback of the
      patients. The revised version will then be presented to a new population.

    <textblock>
      Actinic keratosis is a UV-induced skin disease, which presents as a reddish, squamous and
      sometimes itchy lesion. Actinic keratosis seems to have a negative impact on patients'
      quality of life. Esmann et al. elaborated on patients with actinic keratosis from Zealand,
      Denmark a questionnaire which measures the quality of life.

      The objective of this study is to translate this questionnaire into German and to validate it
      for the Swiss population. This questionnaire might become part of a planned national register
      for data collection of patients with AK.

      The investigators will assess the content validity of the questionnaire by using the
      technique of cognitive interviewing. The investigators are going to talk 34 patients with AK
      from the department of Dermatology, University Hospital Zurich through the translated
      version. Thereby, the investigators are focusing on the patients' understanding of the
      questions.

      The first session of cognitive interviews will show, where there is need for improvement in
      terms of misinterpreted phrases or vaguely worded questions. The goal is to rephrase the
      questions in the sense that they become more clear and are understood by different
      interviewee in the same way. The revised version will then be presented to a new population.
      The performance of cognitive interview sessions and revisions will continue until the survey
      will be approved by at least 80% of the respondents.

    <description>For the individual cognitive interviews we are using the two techniques &quot;to think aloud&quot; and the &quot;verbal probing&quot;. &quot;To think aloud&quot; means, that the patients are asked to express precisely what comes to their mind when reading the single questions. This means, the interviewer is interested in the line of thoughts, which arise when reading the question. Thereby, the problems which appear in the usually covert process of answering a question should be revealed. In a second step, we are using the &quot;verbal probing&quot; technique to identify possible misunderstandings of the questions or difficulties with single phrases. The interviewer asks further questions that target the patients' interpretation.</description>
