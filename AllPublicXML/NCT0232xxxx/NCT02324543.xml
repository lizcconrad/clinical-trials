  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at whether gemcitabine, taxotere, and xeloda (GTX) in combination
      with cisplatin and irinotecan is effective (anti-tumor activity) and safe in patients with
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      The study is being done in 2 parts. The first part is the dose escalation part where the dose
      of irinotecan is increased until the highest safe dose of irinotecan is defined that can be
      given with gemcitabine, taxotere, xeloda, and cisplatin.

      After the safe dose of irinotecan in combination with gemcitabine, taxotere, xeloda, and
      cisplatin is defined, the second part will use these defined doses to look at how effective
      these drugs are against advanced pancreatic cancer.

             cisplatin, or irinotecan.

          8. Patient with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
