  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial focuses on a Phase II randomized masked clinical trial testing the effectiveness
      and safety of peri-operative administration of ramelteon, a melatonin agonist in the
      prevention of postoperative delirium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will randomize older aged patients undergoing general or regional anesthesia for
      orthopedic surgical procedures to three perioperative doses of a melatonin agonist,
      ramelteon, and placebo in a masked double blind fashion. The primary outcomes are 1) the
      incidence of post-operative delirium in the recovery period in the Postoperative Anesthesia
      Care Unit and on post-operative days 1 and 2 following surgery, and 2) the safety of
      ramelteon as documented by the presence of adverse events in the follow-up period.
