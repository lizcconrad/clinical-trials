  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is effective and feasible to provide a
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) education program to patients admitted with an
      acute exacerbation of COPD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) evidence
      strongly suggests that all patients should be discharged with an action plan, consisting of
      identified patient responsibilities for their ongoing care and advice on recognizing and
      seeking help in the event of future acute exacerbations. Despite these recommendations,
      structured chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) specific education is rarely offered
      within acute hospital settings and, in addition, research in this area is limited. This study
      aims to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of an introductory education program
      delivered during and shortly after an AECOPD hospitalization.

    <description>Introductory disease education: This group will attend two one-on-one education sessions. The educational content will be standardized and a checklist will be used to ensure that all topics are addressed. The sessions will focus on enhancing self-efficacy in areas that are thought to be important to individuals who recently had an AECOPD.</description>
