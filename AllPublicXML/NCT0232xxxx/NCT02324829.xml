  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiotherapists spend a large amount of their time with patients observing their
      rehabilitation techniques. A patient going through rehabilitation exercises are routine and
      does not necessarily require the attention of the physiotherapist. This research will develop
      a sensor system that will be strapped onto the patients and will provide feedback on how
      accurately the exercise is being executed. This will free up the physiotherapist to focus on
      diagnosis and other tasks that will better utilize the physiotherapist's training. A previous
      study has shown that this system is feasible for healthy subjects. This study would test to
      see if this system is extendable to rehabilitation subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many of the tasks performed regularly by physiotherapists during any given rehabilitation
      session are repetitive and do not rely on the physiotherapist's expertise, and could be
      performed and observed by automated means. The developed system will detect patient body
      postures and movements with data collected through sensors such as accelerometers. This data
      will be pattern matched to a predetermined movement pattern and feedback will be provided for
      patients regarding accuracy of their exercises. This data can be logged for the
      physiotherapist to examine at a later time. By automating this component of a rehabilitation
      session, the system will allow the physiotherapist to focus diagnosis and other tasks that
      will better utilize their training. The specific application for this prototype will be
      post-operative knee/hip replacement patients, so all devices must be non-invasive and must
      not interfere with normal recovery processes.

      A previous version of this experiment on healthy participants has been successfully
      performed. This study would like to examine the feasibility of this system on rehabilitation
      subjects, as the movement patterns of a subject in physical rehabilitation may be
      dramatically different then a healthy subject. No intervention is suggested by the system, as
      this study is observational.

        Specific target audience for sensor deployment is patients who has undergone knee or hip
        joint replacement and is taking physiotherapy rehabilitation sessions to recover. The
        target audience of this system is rehabilitation subjects who have recently had knee or hip
        replacement therapy. We would like to track several subjects over their rehabilitation stay
        to see the impact of rehabilitation on their movement pattern. Recruitment will be limited
        to in-patients only, as out-patients tend to be discharged from rehabilitation because they
        are healthier, and would likely have movement patterns closer to healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient who has had hip and/or knee total joint replacement and requires
             rehabilitation, and are assessed by physiotherapists as likely able to finish their
             rehabilitation cycle and be discharged to home.

          -  Patients with medical complications or other injuries will be not be excluded, as we
             are interested in seeing the movement profiles of a wide range of people.

          -  In-patients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at risk of developing serious postoperative complications, such as an
             infection, myocardial infarction or anything that requires subsequent surgery, they
             may be excluded.

          -  Out-patients.

          -  Patients who cannot give explicit consent or understand the physiotherapist's
             instructions

          -  Patients who do not speak fluent English
