    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of DPX-Survivac plus low
      dose cyclophosphamide in subjects with recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who
      are not eligible for transplant.

      A multi-center treatment study assessing the efficacy and safety of an immunotherapeutic
      vaccine (DPX-Survivac) combined with low dose cyclophosphamide. Subjects with measurable,
      histologically proven DLBCL expressing survivin will be treated in this open-label, single
      arm study. Survivin is a protein commonly over-expressed in many types of cancer, including
      DLBCL.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologically proven recurrent DLBCL. Subjects may have recurrence
             after primary or second treatment regimens for DLBCL. Subjects with recurrence at
             least 90 days post-autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) are eligible. Patients
             with partial response or measurable disease after first line therapy (who are not
             candidates for ASCT) or after second line therapy without disease progression may also
             be eligible.

          -  Previous localized surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy more than 21 days prior to
             SD0.

          -  Subjects may have received previous courses of an investigational biologic therapy
             including active or passive immunotherapy (e.g. rituximab), other B cell depleting
             antibody therapy, or radioimmunotherapy (e.g. tositumomab or ibritumomab) if last
             administration is greater than 77 days prior to SD0.

          -  Subjects must have at least one measurable site of disease.

          -  Willing to undergo a pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor biopsy.

          -  Subjects must have evidence of survivin expression in pre-treatment tumor sample.

          -  A screening Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) of 0-1.

          -  A life expectancy &gt; 6 months.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for possible curative therapies such as ASCT.

          -  Patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy or
             who are currently on an investigational product/trial are excluded. There must be at
             least 21 days since completion of prior chemotherapy/radiation and at least 77 days
             since completion of immunotherapy until study treatment begins (SD0). Subjects must
             have recovered from all acute toxicities from prior treatment; peripheral neuropathy
             must be &lt; grade 2.

          -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients with refractory disease after their last treatment (i.e. progression within
             90 days).

          -  Patients who have received prior survivin based vaccines.

          -  Progressive CNS lymphoma requiring treatment within 84 days prior to SD0.

          -  History of active autoimmune disease, such as but not restricted to, inflammatory
             bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, or
             multiple sclerosis requiring treatment within the last two years.
