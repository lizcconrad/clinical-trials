  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the OHA PILI 'Ohana Project is to disseminate and evaluate the effectiveness
      of a community-based intervention (PILI 'Ohana Intervention Program) aimed at eliminating
      obesity in Pacific Peoples across the four islands. Dissemination will involve implementation
      of the program in eight communities through partnerships with nine different community-based
      organizations serving those areas (four founding community partners and five new community
      partners). These organizations provide services to a large number of Pacific Peoples,
      including (but not limited to) Native Hawaiians, Samoans, Filipinos, and Chuukese.

      The main aims are to: (1) train five additional community organizations and their staff to
      deliver the PILI 'Ohana Intervention Program, (2) to enroll 150 overweight/obese participants
      across 8 different communities and four different islands into the intervention program, and
      (3) to evaluate the effectiveness of the program in reducing weight/BMI by at least 3% of the
      participant's initial weight.

      The PILI 'Ohana Intervention is a 9-month lifestyle intervention focusing on individual
      health behaviors in the context of family and community environments and in the
      socio-cultural context of Pacific Peoples. In order to increase the likelihood that an
      organization will implement the PLP, they will be able to adapt the intervention and
      participant assessments. The POP will provide guidance on adaption of the intervention and
      assessments at the training (CHS #21680). What is described below is the maximum amount of
      contact and assessment procedures that participants will undergo. Therefore, organizations
      may change the timing of the 14 lessons and refrain from using all the assessment procedures,
      but will still provide the 14 lessons and offer the same incentives to participants for
      assessments.

    <description>A 12-week Individual-focused Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention. Our 12-week intervention is modeled after the Diabetes Prevention Program's (DPP) Lifestyle Intervention. Each of the 8 lessons of this 12-week intervention will be done in a group classroom setting via trained community peer educators for a total of 8 group meetings as outlined above. Lesson 1 through 4 will be done every week, once a week, for 4 weeks followed by every other week for the remaining 4 lessons (lessons 5 through 8). Each group meeting will have between 12 to 15 people and take 1 to 1 Â½ hours to complete. After completing the 12-week behavioral weight loss intervention, participants will participate in an additional 6 lessons. A lesson will be done once-a-month. These 6 lessons will teach participants how to involve their family and friends in their healthy lifestyle changes.</description>
