  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When examining a subject in quiet stance from the side, the leg segment is usually seen to be
      oriented upwards and forwards by about 5°; the knee may be flexed by a few degrees, the
      shoulders are behind the great trochanter and the head is held forwards. The forward head
      position moves the center of gravity forwards and thus may increase pressure under the
      forefoot. Conversely, moving the head backwards should be accompanied by an increase in
      pressure under the heel and thus decreased pressure under the forefoot.

      The study's objective is to study the influence of alignment of the head with the back (i.e.
      a rearward head position) and head rotation on the foot pressure distribution (measured using
      a foot pressure platform).

    <description>The subject stands on the platform, with the heels and buttocks touching a vertical plane and the head held freely. The subject then moves his/her head backwards so that it touches the vertical plane. Next, he/she turns the head to the right and then towards the left. Each of these positions is maintained for 2 minutes.
The platform's sensors measure the anteroposterior foot pressure distribution during the various acquisitions.</description>
