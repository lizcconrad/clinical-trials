    <textblock>
      One of the most challenging issues of chronic Chagas disease is to provide earlier detection
      of heart involvement. Two-dimensional speckle tracking (2-D ST) echocardiography, a new
      imaging modality with useful applications in several cardiac diseases, has been validated for
      subjects with myocardial infarction against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Here the
      investigators hypothesize that the longitudinal global strain (LGS) has an incremental value
      to ejection fraction for predicting myocardial fibrosis in subjects with Chagas disease.
