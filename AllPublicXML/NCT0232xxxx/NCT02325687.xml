    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common and is a risk factor for postoperative complications,
      including respiratory and cardiac events and delirium. Despite this risk, however, there are
      currently no accepted biomarkers that can predict poor outcomes, making it unclear to see
      which patients will have complications after surgery, and who might need prolonged monitoring
      or an extended hospital stay. An improved understanding of the pathophysiology of OSA is
      required to identify potential biomarkers for outcomes after surgery, as well as to develop
      new treatments. The aim of this pilot study is to identify serum and cerebrospinal (CSF)
      biomarkers associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The presence of cytokines and
      neurotrophins will be determined and quantified in both patients with OSA and in controls.
      The CSF samples will additionally be analyzed by proteomic methods to identify potential
      biomarkers with significantly different levels present in patients with and without OSA. The
      working hypothesis is that OSA patients who are non-CPAP-compliant will have higher levels of
      circulating cytokines and lower levels of circulating neurotrophins in serum and CSF,
      compared to patients who are CPAP-compliant and/or controls.

    <textblock>
      It is being increasingly understood that OSA represents an inflammatory state, with multiple
      studies showing increased levels of circulating cytokines, possibly providing the link
      between OSA and cardiovascular/pulmonary morbidity (Nadeem et al., 2013). In support of this,
      use of CPAP therapy is associated with a reduction in the levels of circulating cytokines in
      patients with OSA (Baessler et al, 2013). Despite these data, to our knowledge, there are no
      studies that specifically examine the association between the presence of cytokines and
      surgical complications. The present investigation may be helpful for future studies looking
      at this relationship. Inflammation has recently been emphasized as a component of the CNS
      manifestations of OSA as well, including generalized cognitive deficits and post-operative
      delirium (Flink et al., 2012; Lal et al., 2012). It is possible that intermittent hypoxia
      leads to CNS inflammation/activation of microglia (as has been shown in in vitro studies;
      Yang et al., 2013), which, together with blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown (recently shown
      to be involved in OSA; Lim &amp; Pack, 2014), results in elevated circulating peripheral levels
      of cytokines. Alternatively (or additionally), there could be direct peripheral activation of
      systemic macrophages as a consequence No Title Page 6 of 36

      4/15/16 of sleep deprivation and the cortisol/stress response to this condition. In any
      event, to date, there are no studies exploring the presence or levels of cytokines in the CSF
      of patients with OSA. In addition to the release of inflammatory cytokines, activation of
      microglia causes the release of neuroprotective neurotrophins (Nakajima &amp; Kohsaka, 2004).
      Alterations in levels of several neurotrophins have been implicated in multiple CNS diseases.
      For example, in Parkinson's disease, there is a known elevation in cytokines with reduced
      circulating levels of CSF neurotrophins (BDNF and NGF) and this balance has been posited to
      underlie some of the symptoms and progression of the disease (Nagatsu et al., 2000). BDNF has
      recently been shown to protect against the development of Alzheimer's disease and dementia,
      as well as to increase with caloric restriction and physical activity (Aisen, 2014).
      Considering OSA is associated with obesity, it is possible that low BDNF may (at least in
      part) mediate some of the cognitive deficits seen in OSA. Additionally, low BDNF is
      associated with postoperative delirium in clinical studies (Grandi et al., 2011). Currently,
      the role of neurotrophins in OSA remains underinvestigated. Of all the known neurotrophins,
      only BDNF has been studied in OSA patients, and the results are conflicting, with some
      studies suggesting reduced levels of serum BDNF (Wang et al., 2012) and others showing no
      differences compared to control patients (Panaree et al., 2011). This may in part be due to
      the detection methods employed or small sample sizes, and to date, no one has investigated
      CSF levels of neurotrophins in this patient population. Here we hypothesize that the
      detrimental effects of circulating cytokines in OSA may be balanced in some patients by
      beneficial effects exerted by neurotrophins, and that this differential balance may
      represent: 1) a tool for identifying which patients are at risk for post-operative
      complications in future studies, i.e., a useful biomarker for stratifying operative risk; 2)
      a new understanding of the pathophysiology of OSA; and 3) a role for neuroprotective
      strategies in the management of OSA.
