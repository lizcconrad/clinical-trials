  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toric intraocular lens (IOL) is now widely used for the cataract surgery with preoperative
      corneal astigmatism.

      Symptomatic epiretinal membrane (ERM) is often treated with 25-gauge transconjunctival
      sutureless vitrectomy, resulting in good visual recovery. So far, however, limited
      information is available on the the stability of axis rotation, astigmatism correction, and
      improvement in uncorrected distance visual acuity, using astigmatism-correcting IOL in a
      25-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery. In the
      current study, eyes with a preoperative corneal cylinder of more than 0.75 diopter had a
      triple procedure for idiopathic ERM using a toric IOL. Outcome measures will be the amount of
      IOL axis rotation, uncorrected visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, and corneal
      and refractive astigmatism up to 6 months postoperatively. We are expecting to show that
      postoperative IOL axis stability is similar to that reported for cataract surgery alone in
      vitrectomy (triple procedure) for idiopathic ERM with a toric IOL.
