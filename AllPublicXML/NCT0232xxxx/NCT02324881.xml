    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a pain management smartphone application for monitoring
      pain in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation
      therapy. The study is also open to patients with esophageal or lung cancer. A smartphone
      application may allow patients to assess their symptoms in a manner that is closer to
      real-time than having to recall pain episodes during once weekly on-treatment visits with a
      health care provider. This real-time monitoring may improve the timing and efficacy of
      interventions leading to better pain-control and quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain consumer input to determine the optimal way to address and monitor the patient's
      symptoms.

      II. Train patients to use the pain management smartphone application (PMSA) and determine the
      compliance characteristics and the number of additional on-treatment visits (OTVs) prompted
      by usage of the application.

      OUTLINE:

      Selected patients are interviewed for input that will help guide the wording of questions of
      the PMSA. All patients/caregivers are then instructed to download the PMSA and are
      demonstrated how to properly use the application. Beginning on the first day of radiation
      therapy (day 1), patients are instructed to use the PMSA for the duration of their radiation
      therapy (up to day 50), although the timing may change based on the availability of the app.

    <description>Patients/caregivers are instructed to download the PMSA and are demonstrated how to properly use the application. Beginning on the first day of radiation therapy (day 1), patients are instructed to use the PMSA for the duration of their radiation therapy (up to day 50). The patient will fill out a satisfaction questionnaire at the completion of their treatment (Questionnaire administration). The timing of use may change depending on the availability of the app. The use of the app is classified as the &quot;telephone-based intervention&quot; per NCI.</description>
