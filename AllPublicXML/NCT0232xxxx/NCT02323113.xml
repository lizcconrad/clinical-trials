  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1b dose finding phase is to determine the safety, tolerability, and
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TAK-659 in participants with
      relapsed or refractory AML. The purpose of the Phase 2 expansion phase is to evaluate
      preliminary efficacy of TAK-659 in relapsed or refractory AML as measured by overall response
      rate (ORR).

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-659. TAK-659 is being tested to treat
      people who have relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). This study will be
      conducted in 2 phases. The first phase will determine a safe and well-tolerated dose of
      TAK-659 to be used in the second phase, and the second phase will look at response to
      treatment in people who take TAK-659.

      The study will enroll approximately 106 participants (up to 40 in the first phase and 66 in
      the second phase). There will be two separate cohorts during Phase 2 portion of the study,
      one for participants with FLT-3 ITD mutations and the other for FLT-3 wild-type participants.

      Phase 1b:

      • TAK-659 60 milligram (mg) tablet starting dose escalated in 20 mg or higher increments to a
      maximum tolerated dose or RP2D

      Phase 2:

      • TAK-659 tablet at the maximum tolerated dose or RP2D determined in Phase 1b.

      All participants will be asked to take their prescribed tablets at the same time each day
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is up to 24 months (12 months of treatment and 12 months of
      follow up) unless the treating physician believes the participant would continue to derive
      benefit from the study drug.

    <description>An AE is considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. AEs will be recorded from first dose of study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study drug or to the start of anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
A SAE is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. SAEs will be reported from signing of informed consent form through 28 days after the last dose of study drug even if the participant starts nonprotocol therapy.</description>

                  usual lifestyle of the subject. (Periodic abstinence [example, calendar,
                  ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods], withdrawal, spermicides only,
                  and lactational amenorrhea are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female
                  and male condoms should not be used together).

          6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          7. In the absence of rapid progressive disease, the interval from prior systemic
             anticancer treatment to time of TAK-659 administration should be at least 2 weeks for
             cytotoxic agents (other than hydroxyurea), or at least 5 half-lives for noncytotoxic
             agents, and participants have to have recovered from acute toxicities of these
             therapies. Participants who are on hydroxyurea may be included in the study and may

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically active central nervous system leukemia.

          2. Female participants who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum
             pregnancy test during the Screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1

             period. However, a minimum of 10 days should elapse from prior therapy to initiating
             protocol therapy.)

          5. Persistent clinically significant toxicity from prior chemotherapy that is Grade 2 or
