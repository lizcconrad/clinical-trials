      Research hypothesis: Release of levonorgestrel from Metraplant-E levonorgestrel releasing
      intrauterine contraceptive device is inadequate to be used as a medical line of treatment of
      dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

      The investigators aim to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the intrauterine system
      (Metraplant-E) in the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

      Primary outcome : The investigators aim to evaluate the short term release of levonorgestrel
      from the Metraplant-E levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs).
      This is in a trial to determine to what extent the intrauterine release of levonorgestrel
      would reduce MBL in women with menorrhagia and if the treatment would increase the body iron
      stores and the degree of patient satisfaction and acceptability of treatment for the patients
      with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. This will be conducted through a questionnaire offered
      to the women participating in this study which is designed on Likert scale.

      Secondary outcome:

      1) Endometrial biopsy prior to and 6 months after the insertion of the intrauterine system
      (Metraplant-E).

      3) Haemoglobin level measurement in gm/dl and serum ferritin level on same occasions as when
      endometrial biopsy is done.

      4) The amount of monthly menstrual blood loss after the insertion the Metraplant-E
      levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine contraceptive devices using the following scores:
      bleeding index,total bleeding score and Pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC).

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Women seeking contraception.

        2. Women with history of menorrhagia.

        3. Pre and perimenopausal women who are married or previously married.

        4. Failure of other medical treatment to control menorrhagia such as hemostatics.

        5. Women who did not tolerate copper IUD (intrauterine device) due to increased amount of
           menstrual blood loss which could lead to anemia.
