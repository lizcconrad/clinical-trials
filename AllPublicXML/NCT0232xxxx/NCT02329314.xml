      Collect the details about hepatic dysfunctional patients induced by various etiology who have
      a usage of Glycyrrhizic Acid, then arrange and analyse the data to evaluate the clinical
      curative effect of glycyrrhizic acid.

      This experiment will screen and collect qualified cases from medical records in Shuguang
      Hospital.to collect the patients with liver injury in clinic, including (1) conforms to
      ALT&gt;1.5 times the normal value or &gt;70 IU/L, age 18 to 70 years of age, sex is not limited;
      (2) patients with viral hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver, or autoimmune liver disease, or
      schistosomiasis, or drug-induced liver damage, or for other reasons clear or unclear leading
      to abnormal liver function ; (3) except for tumor patients. The index of liver function such
      as ALT, AST, Alb, et al are detected respectively before and after preventive treatment of
      the glycyrrhizic acid for liver injury ,and through the synthesizing of the single sample
      difference t test and clinical practice to analyze the clinical efficacy of glycyrrhizin
      intervention treatment of hepatic injury
