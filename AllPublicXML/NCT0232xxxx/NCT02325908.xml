    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how the amount of fluid in the body of a hemodialysis
      patient affects him or her. Body hydration is the amount of fluid in the human body and known
      to be related to blood pressure. Too much fluid can lead to high blood pressure which can
      cause heart problems and eventually lead to death. Bioimpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) is a
      method that may be used to measure body hydration. This can be applied in the whole body,
      arm, trunk, calf, and leg. It is a non-invasive and inexpensive method and no known risk. BIS
      measurements can be used to assess optimal hydration status which is defined as a patient's
      ideal weight after completing a dialysis treatment. The investigators hypothesize that your
      target weight may be better estimated by the BIS. The results of this study, in particular
      the continuous measurement of calf hydration which is associated with the hydration of the
      whole body, may provide useful information about physiologic (&quot;healthy&quot;) body hydration. It
      may possibly help to improve treatment procedures for patients in the future. The Renal
      Research Institute plans to enroll 100 chronic hemodialysis patients and 200 healthy controls
      in this study.

    <textblock>
      Estimation of the hydration state of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is an important
      aspect of clinical practice. Deterioration in renal function often leads to volume overload
      with resulting hypertension and there is no simple and accurate technique available to
      measure body hydration at the moment.

      In hemodialysis (HD) patients, one limitation to adequate ultrafiltration necessary to
      achieve optimal hydration status (dry weight) is inadequate vascular refilling from the
      interstitial space. Blood pressure may decrease due to limitation of vascular refilling even
      when dry weight is far from being achieved. Therefore, an objective and accurate method to
      provide hydration state would be very useful for clinical practice. Whole body bioimpedance
      techniques have been used to measure body fluid volume for many years. However, it is
      difficult to accurately indicate the hydration state by body fluid volume of normal
      variations, and the accuracy of measurement is influenced by various body compositions.
      Recently, the investigators have proposed that hydration can be approached using a calf
      bioimpedance technique by monitoring change in resistance during HD. Since the lower limbs
      tend to contain more fluid than other body segments in ambulatory people due to the effect of
      gravity, measurement of the calf provides more accurate information about body hydration in
      the HD patient.

      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Since the degree of hydration is greater in the leg than in the arm and the trunk due to
           the effect of gravity, monitoring change in resistance in the whole or part of the leg
           will provide information as to whether optimal hydration status (a state in which excess
           extracellular fluid is absent) has been attained. The investigators postulate that a
           change in the slope of resistance curve (CSR) in the calf approaches zero as optimal
           hydration status is achieved.

        2. Optimal hydration status can be approximated by comparison of two values: (1)
           measurement of local electrical resistivity in the interstitial compartment and (2)
           known range of resistivity in healthy subjects (HS). Combination of the normalized
           resistivity (Î¼) and CSR are considered as indicators of physiological optimal hydration
           status. Physiological optimal hydration status, as an objective index, is a major goal
           of hemodialysis so that the excess body water can be maximally removed according to this
           value. In practice this can be approached but should never be exceeded.

      Because flattening of the curve should be verified by the near normal resistivity, a group of
      healthy subjects would have to be added to provide a normal range of resistivity at all ages
      and both sexes.

    <description>Dialysis patients will have their estimated dry weight measured with calf segmental bioimpedance. Based on these measurements, their dry weight will be adjusted and the amount of fluid removed during subsequent dialysis treatments will be increased by 200-300mL. The additional fluid removal will occur during 3 consecutive hemodialysis sessions. In addition, these subjects will also use VStim during these treatments. to prevent common intradialytic symptoms by promoting vascular refilling.</description>

      During every study day, 1 tube (3.5mL) will be collected before and 1 tube (3.5mL) after HD.
      This will be done at each study day until the subject reaches optimal hydration status. These
      samples will be used to assess Na+, K+, Ca++ concentrations and conductivity of the blood.
      We'll also measure aldosterone monthly.In case of technical issues (which may include device
      malfunction, transportation of samples, or scheduling of personnel), samples may be frozen
      temporarily. Samples may also be frozen and kept for future biochemical studies (see &quot;Consent
