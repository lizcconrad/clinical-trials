    <textblock>
      In Israel, data is lacking regarding the long-term effectiveness of Adalimumab in outpatient
      real life setting. Moreover, the association between long-term effectiveness of Adalimumab
      and patients' functional status as well as cultural aspects of sick leaves and visits to
      physician's clinics has not been demonstrated in this population. This study will collect the
      required data in real life settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is eligible to Adalimumab treatment according to the Israeli National Health
             Basket and for whom a decision of initiating Adalimumab has already been taken.
             Patients that are naïve to Adalimumab therapy, that have been prescribed adalimumab in
             accordance to physician's clinical decision and according to local guidelines, up to
             30 days prior to screening.

          2. Patient has performed tuberculosis (TB) screening and treatment according to national
             guidelines for TB screening prior to anti Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) treatment.

          3. Patient has been diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and has disease duration &lt; 3
             years.

          4. Patient has moderately to severely active RA defined by Disease Activity Score (DAS)
             (moderately (3.2 ≤ DAS ≤ 5.1) severely (DAS ≥5.1))

          5. Patient is able to sign written informed consent.

          6. Patient is treated with Methotrexate (MTX) alone or in combination with other Disease
             Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs)

          7. Patient might have been treated with another anti-TNF inhibitor agent if discontinued
             due to secondary loss of efficacy or side effects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with known hypersensitivity to Adalimumab, or any of its components.

          2. Patients suffering from serious infection, latent TB or other conditions prohibiting
             the use of Adalimumab.

          3. Patient had previous non-response to an anti-TNF agent.

          4. Patients currently treated with other biologic therapy.
