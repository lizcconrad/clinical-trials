      Phase I, randomized, parallel group, placebo control, unicentric, interventional study.
      Thirty two healthy male volunteers aged between 18-35 years will be randomized into the eASCs
      or placebo group if they meet all the inclusion criteria at a 3:1 ratio.

      The treatment administration will be infused intravenously to the following groups after
      randomization:

        -  First arm: 250,000 cells/kg

        -  Second arm: 1 million cells/kg

        -  Third arm: 4 million cells/kg

        -  Fourth arm: placebo according to their weight.

      An hour after the end of the eASCs administration, all subjects will be given an intravenous
      dose of LPS. Subjects will be allowed to leave in the evening once deemed clinically stable
      by the investigator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Healthy, as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests carried out
             within 28 days prior to administration of eASCs (if applicable) and LPS. A subject
             with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter outside the reference range may be
             included only if the investigator judges that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

             consent

          3. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) must agree to use barrier
             contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in activity in which conception is
             possible while on study medication and for at least 28 days after taking the last dose
             of study medication

          4. Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form prior to the conduct of

          8. The subject has received an investigational product within three months prior to day 1
             of the current study

          9. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs and herbal and dietary supplements
             within 6 months unless in the opinion of the investigator the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety

         10. Transfusion of blood or blood products within 6 months prior to the inclusion in the
             study.

         11. Subject has difficultly in donating blood or accessibility of a vein in left or right
             arm.

         12. Subject has donated more than 350 mL of blood in last 3 months

         13. Body mass index &gt;28 kg/m2

         14. Presence of a severe bleeding or thrombotic disorder

         15. History of known pulmonary embolism or known secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome

         16. Subjects known or suspected of not being able to comply with a study protocol (e.g.
             due to alcoholism, drug dependency or psychological disorder)

         17. Known allergies or hypersensitivity to antibiotics, HSA, DMEM, materials of bovine
             origin, and Ringer's Lactate Solution

         18. Any other issue that, in the opinion of the investigator, could be harmful to the
             subject or compromise interpretation of the data.
