  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this first step of the study the investigators will assess the needs, disease burden and
      current treatments of long-term stroke patients (phase MAS-I).

      The ultimate aim of the complete MAS project (MAS I, II &amp; III) is the development of a model
      of stroke aftercare delivery that can be evaluated to estimate effects in both our local and
      the wider stroke population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After discharge from hospital the current healthcare system in Germany allows considerable
      flexibility (therefore complexity) of patient access and mobility between multiple care
      providers in the community setting. The investigators believe this aftercare could be better
      coordinated by a specialized coordinated stroke aftercare service. Comprehensive coordinated
      multidisciplinary care is a proven concept with proven benefits in both acute and
      rehabilitation care provided in stroke units and neurorehabilitation centres. In this study
      the investigators postulate that a similar coordinated approach to care can be extended to
      the phase after in-patient rehabilitation has ended (i.e. &quot;long-term management&quot; as opposed
      to &quot;early supported discharge&quot;) for disabled patients with stroke living in the community.
