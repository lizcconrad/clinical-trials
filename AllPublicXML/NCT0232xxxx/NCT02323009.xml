      This is a study to evaluate whether PEEP adjusted by use of an esophageal balloon to overcome
      negative transpulmonary pressure; or adjusted by use of &quot;CStat&quot; to achieve the best effective
      static compliance will have any effect on outcomes with respect to ventilator weaning in
      tracheotomized morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt;=40) with at least one failed prior weaning
      attempt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheotomized morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt;= 40) who had failed an initial attempt at
      ventilator weaning (defined in the investigators study as ventilator dependent) were randomly
      assigned to one of two methods for setting Positive End Expiratory Pressure (PEEP).

      Patients randomized to the esophageal balloon arm (ESO group) had their PEEP adjusted to
      overcome negative transpulmonary pressure and maintain a positive transpulmonary pressure
      (Ptp) of 0 to 10 cm H20 - targeting as close to zero as possible.

      Patients randomized to the static effective compliance arm (CStat group) had their PEEP
      adjusted to achieve the best static effective compliance as automatically calculated and
      displayed on the graphic interphase of the hamilton G5 or Galileo ventilator. For this group,
      the PEEP was adjusted in increments of 3 cm H20 until there was a less than 5% observed
      improvement in the static effective compliance. the PEEP with the best Cstat was chosen.

      At the end of the intervention period, this intervention cohort (termed &quot;PEEP intervention
      cohort&quot;) will be compared to a group of historical controls to compare the efficiency of a
      PEEP-based weaning protocol to traditional weaning methods.

      The investigators hypothesized that PEEP levels titrated by use of an esophageal balloon to
      maintain a positive transpulmonary pressure between 0 to 10 cm H20, would lead to improved
      outcomes with respect to ventilator weaning in this subset of patients.

    <measure>Number of patients weaned by day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>30-days</time_frame>
    <description>A patient was considered successfully weaned and &quot;ventilator independent&quot; if they were spontaneously breathing without ventilator support for at least 24 hours, and remained off the ventilator by day 30. If ventilator support was subsequently required, the patient was returned to their original group and considered not weaned. The patients were considered to be weaned or not, after a period of thirty days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to wean</measure>
    <time_frame>30-days</time_frame>
    <description>The time to wean/ time to achieve ventilator independence was measured from the date of randomization to the date of final successful liberation from mechanical ventilation. If patient had an unsuccessful initial wean, he was not considered weaned. Only patients who were considered weaned by day 30 accrued &quot;time to ventilator independence.&quot;</description>

    <description>Esophageal balloon was used to measure esophageal pressure (Paux) which was used as an estimate of pleural pressure. Transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) was calculated as the difference between airway pressure (Pao) and Paux. Applied PEEP was then adjusted to overcome negative Ptp which we maintained between 0 to 10 cm H20. All measurements were made at end-expiration.</description>
