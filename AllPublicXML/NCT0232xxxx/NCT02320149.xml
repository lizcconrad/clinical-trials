    <measure>Absolute Change in Facial Inflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Inflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: papule: a solid, elevated lesion &lt; 0.5 centimeter (cm) in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; pustule: an elevated lesion containing pus &lt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; nodule: palpable solid erythematous lesion &gt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection); has depth, not necessarily elevated. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of inflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Investigator Global Assement (IGA) Success at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator assessed the participant's inflammatory lesions on the face using the IGA 5-point scale. The scale ranges from 0 (best): clear, no evidence of papules or pustules to 4 (worst): severe, inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulocytic lesions. Success was defined as at least a 2-point decrease (improvement) from Baseline on the IGA assessment as well as a score of clear (0) or almost clear (1). The percentage of participants who achieved success is reported.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Facial Inflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 12</title>
        <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Inflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: papule: a solid, elevated lesion &lt; 0.5 centimeter (cm) in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; pustule: an elevated lesion containing pus &lt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; nodule: palpable solid erythematous lesion &gt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection); has depth, not necessarily elevated. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of inflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Investigator Global Assement (IGA) Success at Week 12</title>
        <description>The investigator assessed the participant’s inflammatory lesions on the face using the IGA 5-point scale. The scale ranges from 0 (best): clear, no evidence of papules or pustules to 4 (worst): severe, inflammatory lesions are more apparent, many papules/pustules, there may or may not be a few nodulocytic lesions. Success was defined as at least a 2-point decrease (improvement) from Baseline on the IGA assessment as well as a score of clear (0) or almost clear (1). The percentage of participants who achieved success is reported.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Facial Inflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 12</title>
        <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Inflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: papule: a solid, elevated lesion &lt; 0.5 centimeter (cm) in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; pustule: an elevated lesion containing pus &lt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; nodule: palpable solid erythematous lesion &gt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection); has depth, not necessarily elevated. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of inflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on ANCOVA model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Facial Inflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 3</title>
        <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Inflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: papule: a solid, elevated lesion &lt; 0.5 centimeter (cm) in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; pustule: an elevated lesion containing pus &lt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection) with surrounding erythematous halo; nodule: palpable solid erythematous lesion &gt; 0.5 cm in diameter (by inspection); has depth, not necessarily elevated. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of inflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on ANCOVA model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Noninflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: open comedones (blackheads): noninfected plugged hair follicle with a dilated/open orifice, black in color; closed comedones (whiteheads): noninfected plugged hair follicle with a small (microscopic) opening at the surface of the skin. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of noninflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on ANCOVA model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Facial Noninflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 9</title>
        <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Noninflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: open comedones (blackheads): noninfected plugged hair follicle with a dilated/open orifice, black in color; closed comedones (whiteheads): noninfected plugged hair follicle with a small (microscopic) opening at the surface of the skin. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of noninflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on ANCOVA model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline in Facial Noninflammatory Lesion Counts at Week 9</title>
        <description>Facial area lesion counts were made at the forehead, left and right cheeks, nose, and chin at baseline and at each treatment period visit. Noninflammatory lesion counts were based on the following definitions: open comedones (blackheads): noninfected plugged hair follicle with a dilated/open orifice, black in color; closed comedones (whiteheads): noninfected plugged hair follicle with a small (microscopic) opening at the surface of the skin. A negative change from Baseline indicates that the number of noninflammatory lesions decreased. Analyses were based on ANCOVA model for the endpoint with treatment group and pooled study center as factors and baseline value as a covariate.</description>
