    <textblock>
      In this study, all patients with ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure) with grade III/IV HE
      (Hepatic Encephalopathy) getting admitted in our institute will be enrolled after the
      fulfilment of inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent of the patient's attendants.
      Investigation of the patient (as mentioned in the proforma) will be done.

      Intervention step 1:

      liq Lactulose 100 mL stat followed by 30 mL/ hourly through NG/NJ route + Lactulose enema 3rd
      hourly - till 4 time soft stool is passed, then 30 mL through enteral route 6th hourly (If
      patient has no bowel sounds, only enema will be given)

      Intervention step 2:

      (after 24 hours of introduction of step 1, if no rapid reduction in ammonia to &lt;70mcg/dL)
      Randomization to L or R arm R Arm (Addition of Rifaximin) Continuation of Lactulose +
      addition of Rifaximin 400 mg 8th hourly through enteral route L Arm (Lactulose only)
      Continuation of Lactulose therapy for further 48 hours.
