  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is a highly prevalent nutrient deficiency which is a public health problem,
      especially in developing countries. There are several strategies to correct iron deficiency
      in populations: besides supplementation with tablets, one of the most sustainable and
      effective strategies on medium term has been iron fortification, the addition of iron to
      regularly consumed foods. In fortification, the chemical nature of the compound to be added
      plays an important role: depending on the compound sensory qualities of the fortified foods
      can vary as well as the iron absorption. Iron pyrophosphate (FePP) and ferrous sulfate
      (FeSO4) are two commonly used iron fortification compounds in foods such as rice, breakfast
      cereals, pasta, flour and others. We want to test the effect of addition a food stabilizer on
      the absorption of ferric pyrophosphate (FePP) and ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) when added to
      bouillon, as was recently suggested by in vitro experiments in the laboratory.
