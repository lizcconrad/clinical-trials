  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and to establish the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D) for the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in participants with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), follicular cell lymphoma (FL)
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Once the dose is optimized, the combination will
      be assessed for Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy, further safety
      in participants with CLL/SLL, FL or DLBCL and in participants with Richter syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, which consists of Part A (Dose Optimization Cohorts) and Part B
      (Expansion Cohorts). Part A consists of two dose optimization cohorts (cohort A1 and cohort
      A2) will determine the RP2D for the combination based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamic assessments in participants with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL or B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Part B consists 3 participant populations to further evaluate
      the safety and clinical activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab: Cohort B1
      (participants with CLL/SLL with del 17p or del 11q), Cohort B2 (participants with FL), Cohort
      B3 (participants with DLBCL) and Cohort B4 (participants with Richter syndrome). Part A and B
      will consist of Screening Period (28 days before enrollment), Treatment Period and Follow up
      Period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). Participants will receive nivolumab
      intravenously (Day 1 of every cycle) and ibrutinib orally once daily on a 14-day cycle.
      Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (IWCLL) and International Working Group (IWG) for lymphoma guidelines. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study. Further exploration of
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and biomarker information will be assessed throughout the
      trial.

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
