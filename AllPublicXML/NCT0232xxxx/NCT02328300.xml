  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center study of 15 patients with brain lesions being treated at
      UNC Hospitals. Subjects will undergo one (1) FLT-PET-MRI scan before their scheduled surgical
      biopsy of their brain lesion(s).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identifying imaging biomarkers of metastatic brain tumor treatment response could allow early
      modification of treatment by determination of tumor progression vs. treatment related effects
      (pseudo-progression, radiation necrosis). Earlier treatment response assessment could reduce
      cost, improve clinical trial efficiency and allow better assessment of prognosis. The
      development of PET/MRI offers the possibility of combining the functional imaging of PET with
      the exquisite soft tissue contrast and physiologic imaging capabilities of MRI. Combining
      FLT-PET imaging with MRI may allow better evaluation of new and unclear lesions in brain
      metastatic disease. The goal of this study is to explore FLT-PET imaging combined with
      dynamic MR imaging techniques for the identification of tumor response markers in metastatic
      brain tumors.
