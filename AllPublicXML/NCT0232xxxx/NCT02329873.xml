  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a respiratory
      rehabilitation exercise training package on dyspnea, cough, exercise tolerance, and sputum
      expectoration of hospitalized elderly patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Using purposive sampling, 61 participants were recruited and
      randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 30) or the control group (n = 31).
      The experimental group participants received the respiratory rehabilitation exercise training
      twice a day and 10-30 minutes per session for four days. The control group participants
      received usual care and health education. Data were collected at baseline and at the end of
      the four-day intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The respiratory rehabilitation exercise training package included: (a) Disease awareness: The
      doctor explained the disease to patients and their families through the chest X-ray, (b)
      Sputum clearance treatments: Easily understood postural drainage cards were provided to the
      patients and families to assist with proper sputum clearance procedures, (c) Pursed lip
      breathing training: Devices were provided to the patients to ensure that the breathing
      exercises were completed properly, (d) Upper-limb exercise with breathing pranayama: Towels
      were provided to the patients to assist with upper-limb exercises properly, (e) Walking
      training with breathing pranayama: Legs were elevated while inhaling, and returned to the
      position while exhaling, and (f) Assign a pulmonary rehabilitation program coordinator:
      Coordinators were assigned to assist the patients in nutrition management and health
      education.
