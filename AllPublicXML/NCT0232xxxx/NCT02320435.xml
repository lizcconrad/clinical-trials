  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label extension study designed to provide pertuzumab
      to patients who continue to derive benefit from pertuzumab, as well as to collect long-term
      safety and efficacy data of pertuzumab therapy. Patients receiving pertuzumab as an
      investigational medicinal product (IMP) in a Roche-sponsored Global study who continue to
      receive pertuzumab at the time of the Parent study end are eligible for continued treatment
      in this extension study. Patients with solid tumors who have not experienced progressive
      disease in the Parent study and, in the Investigator's opinion, may potentially benefit from
      continued Perjeta treatment will continue to receive pertuzumab until disease progression,
      unacceptable toxicities, Investigator decision, patient non-compliance, patient death,
      patient request to withdraw, or study termination by the Sponsor.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent

          -  Prior eligibility for, and receiving pertuzumab as an investigational medicinal
             product in, a Roche-sponsored study (either as a single agent or in combination with
             other anti-cancer drugs used in the Parent study) at the time of the Parent study
             closure

          -  Investigator's opinion that the patient continues to benefit from treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets any of the exclusion criteria of the Parent protocol at the time the patient is
             considered for entry in the extension study

          -  Evidence of disease progression assessed according to Parent protocol before
             enrollment in to the extension study

          -  Permanent discontinuation of pertuzumab for any reason during the Parent study, or
             between the end of the Parent study and before enrollment into the extension study

          -  Any unresolved or irreversible toxicities during the Parent study that require
             permanent discontinuation of pertuzumab, according to Parent protocol or local label.
             Delay of treatment to wait for resolution of toxicities is allowed as long as it is
             within the guidelines of the respective Parent protocol and does not contradict
             exclusion criterion below.

          -  More than 9 weeks between the last dose of pertuzumab in the Parent study and the
             first dose pertuzumab in the extension study

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;/= 50%

          -  Any serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of
             pertuzumab or that would put the patient at high risk for treatment-related
             complications

          -  Treatment with any anti-cancer treatment (other than any treatment given as permitted
             in the Parent protocol) in the time period between last treatment in the Parent study
             and the first dose pertuzumab in the extension study (i.e. up to 9 weeks)

          -  Positive serum pregnancy test

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active and do not agree to use a
             highly effective, non-hormonal form of contraception or two effective forms of
             non-hormonal contraception (such as barrier method in conjunction with spermicidal
             gel) during and for at least 6 months after the last dose or pertuzumab or 7 months
             after the last dose of trastuzumab or trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), if being used in
             combination

          -  Concurrent participation in any therapeutic clinical trial (other than the Parent
             study)

          -  Assessed by the Investigator to be unable or unwilling to comply with the requirements
             of the protocol
