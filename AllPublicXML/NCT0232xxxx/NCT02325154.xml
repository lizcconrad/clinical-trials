      We plan to investigate the relationship between hypotensive epidural anesthesia for hip
      arthroplasty and cerebral oxygen saturation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between cerebral oxygenation and blood pressure in patients undergoing
      hypotensive epidural anesthesia has not been completely elucidated. Previous publications
      have demonstrated a low incidence of post-op cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing
      hypotensive epidural anesthesia for total hip replacement (1-3) and that cerebral blood flow
      velocity is preserved as measured by transcranial Doppler (4). An earlier investigation by
      Dr. Yadeau demonstrated infrequent cerebral oxygen desaturation in spontaneously breathing
      patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy, even in the presence of hypotension (4), but did
      not investigate outcomes in the cognitive domain or have a control group of patients
      undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. There has only been one study looking at cerebral
      oxygenation and hip surgery, which was performed in elderly patients with fractures. It
      demonstrated that patients with low pre-op regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) had
      higher incidence of delirium (5) but many of those patients had surgery under general
      anesthesia. Given the costs associated with post-op delirium, cognitive dysfunction and
      stroke (6) and based on the fact that previous publications from this institution have
      demonstrated both a low incidence of cognitive dysfunction and preservation of cerebral blood
      flow velocity using this anesthetic technique, we hypothesized that cerebral oxygen
      desaturation will not occur in this population.
