  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational study aimed at evaluating the clinical impact of a standardised diagnostic
      procedure for the investigation of patients with suspected mild bleeding disorder (MBD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The working hypothesis of this prospective diagnostic study is that a standardised procedure
      in investigating patients with suspected MBD will lead to a better discrimination between
      patients with and without MBD and a more precise characterisation of MBD.

      The primary objective of this diagnostic study is to evaluate the efficiency of a
      standardised procedure of MBD in children and adults referred to their respective outpatient
      clinics for bleeding symptoms. The following endpoints will be evaluated:

        1. The relative number of precise diagnosis (according to recognised classification of
           haemostatic disorders) in each clinical probability category;

        2. The number of biological tests performed per patient in each clinical probability
           category;

        3. The relative number of patients with no specialised investigations in the low risk
           group.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the bleeding events during a one-year follow-up.
      Follow-up will be performed with a phone call one year after the last consultation of the
      patient. The definition of a bleeding event will be any bleeding that promotes any specific
      medical attention (consultation, hospitalisation, transfusion, re-intervention in case of
      surgery). The detailed clinical history regarding each event will be collected. Bleeding
      events will be correlated to the clinical probability assessed at inclusion.

    <description>Defined by:
a bleeding score &gt;= 4 in adults;
a bleeding score &gt;= 2 in children (for girls, up to menses);
a past medical history that include menorrhagia, haemorrhage from the umbilical stump, bleeding at circumcision, cephalhematoma at birth, hematuria, whatever the bleeding score is;
a past medical history suggestive of a MBD with no haemostatic challenge and a low bleeding score.
In this group, the second step of investigations will be performed.</description>

In this group, no further investigation will be performed if the first step is normal. The second step of investigations will be performed only in case of significant abnormalities in the first step of investigation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients aged more than two years-old referred by their physician (gynaecologist,
             paediatrician, general practitioner, surgeon, etc.) for investigations of a possible
             bleeding tendency will be included in this study. This prospective study will include
             consecutive patients attending the four outpatient clinics (Division of Angiology and
             Haemostasis and Paediatric Onco-Haematology Unit, University Hospitals of Geneva).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded because of modifications of the known modifications of
             the haemostasis system during pregnancy. Adult patients without discernment capacity
             will be excluded.
