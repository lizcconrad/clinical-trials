      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered
      at a dose of 100 mg once weekly as an add-on to insulin therapy (SYR-472 100 mg
      combination/SYR-472 100 mg combination group) using insulin preparation alone/ SYR-472 100 mg
      combination group as a control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate
      glycemic control despite treatment with insulin preparations in addition to diet and/or
      exercise therapy; and to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when
      administered at a dose of 100 mg once weekly as an add-on to insulin therapy in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with insulin
      preparations in addition to diet and/or exercise therapy.

      Period I) and a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, long-term study (Treatment Period II) to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of SYR-472 when administered at a dose of 100 mg as an
      add-on to insulin therapy (SYR-472 100 mg combination/SYR-472 100 mg combination group) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with
