        Inclusion Criteria:

        -• Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histological or cytologic diagnosis of cancer (NSCLC) with predominantly squamous
             histology stage IV non-small-cell lung.

          -  ECOG performance status between 0 and 2.

          -  Patients who have progressed to a first line of advanced disease and are eligible for
             a second line with Erlotinib.

          -  Patients that grant informed, preferably in writing, or oral consent before witnesses
             independent of the research team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -• Patients with uncontrolled or severe systemic disease, an active infection, neoplasia
        concomitant or secondary neoplasia to primary disease, except for carcinoma in situ of
        cervix or adequately treated skin carcinoma.

          -  Disease with mutated EGFR, according to local laboratory. The determination of the
             EGFR is not mandatory. Those patients from centers where there is the determination of
             the EGFR or those patients that the EGFR is unknown may be included in.

          -  Inability to take oral medication or previous surgical procedures that affect the
             absorption and imply the need for intravenous or parenteral feeding.

          -  Interstitial lung disease clinically active.

          -  Unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction.

          -  Brain metastasis uncontrolled and progressive.

          -  Patients who are participating in a clinical trial.

          -  Use of an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase in first line of treatment.

          -  Patients whose estimated life expectancy does not reach the 2 months.

          -  Any condition, situation which, in the opinion of the investigator, may endanger the
             safety of the patient, or could interfere significantly with the involvement of the
             subject in the study or evaluation of the results of the study.
