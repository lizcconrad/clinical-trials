    <textblock>
      Serious medication administration errors are common in hospitals. Various interventions were
      developed to help prevention of such errors such as bar-code technology. Investigators aimed
      to study the effect of bar-code-assisted medication administration (BCMA) system on the rate
      of medication errors in two hospitals.

      They will conduct a randomized controlled trial in 6 care units of two hospitals in Paris,
      France. Each unit will be randomized in either the control group or the intervention group
      using the bar-code system to help drug administration. The observation method will be used to
      evaluate the error rates in the 2 groups at baseline and when BCMA will be implanted. Nurses
      of the unit will be randomized to determine who will be observed during the administration
      rounds.

      Considering the results of a passed observational study in 4 units (Berdot, BMC Health Serv
      Research 2012) and the results of the study by Poon and al. (NEJM 2010), investigators
      estimated that 5.981 TOE (Total Opportunities for Errors) are needed to detect a relative
      reduction of 45% of error rate.

      The ADIM system (Aide a la Distribution Informatisee des Medicaments) consists of 2 machines
      with photographic reconnaissance and readers: one for preparation assistance that can be
      placed at the pharmacy or in the clinical service and one to assist the administration by the
      nurse in the clinical service.

      The system ADIM preparation consists of a working area with 2 reader devices (a RFID reader
      and a bar code reader) and a touch screen . It allows selection from the list of patients,
      the patient's prescription for which the preparation will be made. It is linked to the drug
      data base.

      The system ADIM administration is composed of a laptop with touch screen, 2 readers (a RFID
      reader and a barcode reader) , the elements needed to care and a work plan and drawers
      containing unit dose drugs for patients for a specific nurse. The nurse scans her/his badge,
      the patient's wristband and each dose administered and prepared by the pharmacy. If the dose
      is not prepared by the pharmacy, the nurse takes the dose in the automat cabinet. The nurse
      scans the drug's barcode or select on the touch screen the drug and the required dose of the
      drug. In case of discrepancy with the prescription, there is a visual alert. However, the
      alert can be override by the nurse if she/he gives a justification.

    <description>Investigators will use the direct-observation method to measure error rates. Observers will shadow staff nurses while administering drugs to patients, without knowing the physician's medication orders, and will record details about the administration. After completing the observation session, medication administration errors will be assessed, by two senior pharmacists, blinded to the unit allocation, by comparing the observed medication administered to the medication intended for that patient. The rate of medication administration errors will be calculated by dividing the number of errors by the total opportunities for errors (TOE). The TOE is defined as the sum of observed administrations and omitted medications. As wrong-time errors are generally considered less severe, overall error rate will be calculated without this type of error.</description>

    <description>Each administration error will be classified by the two senior pharmacists according to the type of error using the ASHP classification in 9 categories. Wrong-time error is defined as an administration that is early or late by more than 1 hour.</description>

    <description>Satisfaction with the bar-code system will be assessed using a validated questionnaire. It will be filled anonymously by nurses at the end of the observation period in the unit. Evaluation of administration rounds time will be studied also to evaluate satisfaction with the system.</description>

    <measure>Relevance of the system</measure>
    <time_frame>One month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Relevance of the system will be assessed by studying the system alerts: false negative rates, rates of modifications in preparation/administration of drugs in case of system alerts, rates of unjustified or wrong alerts. During the observation in the intervention group, number and causes of non-use of the bar-code system will be assessed.</description>
