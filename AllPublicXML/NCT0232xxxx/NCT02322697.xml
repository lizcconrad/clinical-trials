  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on chronic hemodialysis without obstructive coronary artery disease identified by
      coronary angiography were randomly divided into the two groups: carnitine group and control
      group. SPECT using FFA analogue, BMIPP, was performed before and one year after intravenous
      administration of L-carnitine (1000 mg on every dialysis session). Control group received the
      examination of BMIPP SPECT at the same time of the carnitine group. The effects of chronic
      intravenous administration of L-carnitine on myocardial fatty acid metabolism were
      investigated among this population.

      Patients on chronic hemodialysis in Toujinkai hospital who had no obstructive coronary artery
      disease identified by coronary angiography and left ventricular dysfunction were randomly
      divided into the two groups: carnitine group and control group. To evaluate the possible
      effect of carnitine administration on myocardial fatty acid metabolism, SPECT using FFA
      analogue, BMIPP, was performed before and one year after intravenous administration of
      L-carnitine (1000 mg on every dialysis session). Control group received the examination of
      BMIPP SPECT at the same time of the carnitine group. Circulating concentrations of total,
      free, and acyl L-carnitine were measured every three months in the carnitine group. Clinical
      data including blood chemistry, blood pressure, or cardiac functions by echocardiography were
      obtained every 6 months in both groups. The effects of chronic intravenous administration of
      L-carnitine on myocardial fatty acid metabolism and cardiac functions were investigated among
      this population.
