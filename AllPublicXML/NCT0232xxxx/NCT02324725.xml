    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the biological markers of treatment of opioid dependent individuals with
      an extended release formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. The biological measures
      include functional MRI, blood levels of naltrexone and its metabolites, urine toxicology and
      behavioral tests probing various aspects of personality, memory, reward processing and
      attention.

      This study is using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain predictors of adherence and outcomes of opioid antagonist
      therapy. Opioid-dependent intravenous heroin users are offered up to 3 monthly injections of
      the extended-release naltrexone (XRNTX) contingent upon successful outpatient non-opioid
      detoxification, with an additional 4 weeks of follow up. Brain responses to heroin-related
      pictures are recorded using fMRI prior to the 1st XRNTX injection and approximately 2 weeks
      thereafter the 1st XRNTX injection. Primary clinical variables include the number of
      injections (maximum of 3) accepted by participants, change in self-reported craving for
      opioids after exposure to drug-related visual cues during the brain fMRI sessions, urine
      levels of ten commonly abused substances and self-report of cigarette use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of opioid dependence, active opioid use, confirmed by urine
             toxicology screen and self-reported monthly intravenous heroin use for more than 2
             weeks in the past 3 months

          2. urine toxicology screen negative for opioids after detoxification

          3. good physical health as indicated by history and physical examination, screening blood
             work-up and urinalysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. chronic medical illnesses;

          2. current use of medications potentially confounding brain activity, such as
             anti-dopaminergic agents, anti-depressants and beta-blockers;

          3. current DSM-IV-TR Axis I psychiatric disorders other than opioid and nicotine
             dependence;

          4. life time history of concurrent IV cocaine and heroin (speedball) administration;

          5. pregnancy or breastfeeding;

          6. history of clinically significant head trauma;

          7. contraindications for naltrexone treatment including medical conditions requiring
             opioid analgesics, e.g. chronic pain or planned surgery, obesity, elevated liver
             enzymes (&gt; 3 times upper limit of normal), failure to complete opioid detoxification

          8. contraindications for MRI, i.e. indwelling magnetically active foreign bodies and
             phobia to enclosed spaces
