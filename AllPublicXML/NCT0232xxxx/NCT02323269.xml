  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the annualized relapse rate (ARR) over a
      12-month period in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) who are
      treated with dimethyl fumarate (DMF) as their initial therapy (treatment-naïve), or switching
      from interferon (IFN) or glatiramer acetate (GA) (after suboptimal response defined as
      suboptimal efficacy, intolerance, or poor adherence to IFN or GA), as determined by the
      Prescribing Physician. The secondary objectives of this study in this study population are:
      To assess the impact of DMF over a 12 month period on patient reported outcomes (PROs) and
      health economic related outcomes; and to evaluate additional clinical outcomes at Month 12.

        This study will be conducted in male and female patients with relapsing-remitting MS who
        satisfy the therapeutic indication for DMF per the Canadian Product Monograph, and who are
        either treatment-naïve or responding suboptimally to MS platform therapies (e.g., IFN or
        GA), as determined by the Prescribing Physician.

             per the Canadian Product Monograph.

          -  Are either treatment-naïve or being treated for RRMS with IFN or GA but, per the

             intolerance, or poor adherence) to IFN or GA or have stopped treatment with IFN or GA

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have major comorbid conditions that would preclude their participation in the study as
             determined by the Prescribing Physician.

             completely excised prior to study entry remain eligible.)

          -  Are receiving disease modifying therapies other than IFN or GA or have initiated
