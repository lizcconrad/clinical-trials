      Purpose: 1) To investigate differences in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines
      and growth factors in the circulating blood (and cytokine levels only in saliva) of patients
      with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) before and after acupuncture; 2) To determine
      differences in cytokine profiles between real and sham acupuncture in circulating blood of
      patients with chronic TMD; and 3) To explore correlations between these changes and clinical
      outcomes.

      Participants: Patients with chronic TMD pain recruited through the University of North
      Carolina-Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) Orofacial Pain Clinic.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will complete a self-administered questionnaire assessing
      TMD-related comorbidity. During the initial visit, study examiners will record clinical
      characteristics of muscles and joints of the head, neck and body according to newly
      recommended diagnostic criteria (DC) for TMD. Clinical outcomes include a pain index
      (computed from numeric rating scales) of masseter, temporalis and the supplemental painful
      muscles, and patient-reported symptoms (using the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile;
      MYMOP) and pain intensity (using the Pain Scale). Blood (5 cc) will be taken before and after
      acupuncture treatments. Participants will self-collect pre-treatment and post-treatment
      saliva samples. Patients will receive 4 acupuncture treatments, once per week for 4 weeks.
      The primary outcome measure is change in IL-8 levels in circulating blood and saliva after 4
      weeks of real acupuncture compared with sham acupuncture. Secondary outcome measures include
      comparing changes in levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha
      (TNFα),vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF),
      basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and IL-1α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10, before and
      after real acupuncture at Week 1 compared with sham acupuncture and before and after real
      acupuncture at Week 4 compared with sham acupuncture. The exploratory outcome measure is
      correlation between changes in cytokine levels and clinical variables after 4 weeks of real
      acupuncture compared with 4 weeks of sham acupuncture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is known to be the second most frequent musculoskeletal pain
      condition following low back pain. According to the NIDCR, TMD affects 5%-12% of the
      population at an annual cost estimated at 4 billion dollars in the US. Recent studies that
      have investigated acupuncture as a treatment for musculoskeletal pain have reported various
      results. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials suggest
      that acupuncture treatment improves TMD-related pain. Its mechanism of action in improving
      TMD pain, however, is largely unclear.

      Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., MCP-1 and IL-8 have been found in
      circulating blood of patients with TMD. Upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine levels have
      been correlated with greater sensitivity to pain evoking stimuli. Abnormalities in levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines are often accompanied by alterations in levels of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1ra, which are associated with reductions in pain and
      inflammation. The effects of acupuncture on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth
      factors, and clinical pain and function have not been reported in a prospective cohort of TMD
      patients at multiple time points in the clinical setting. The proposed mechanistic study
      seeks to ascertain if acupuncture compared to sham acupuncture produces measurable changes in
      circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in a manner that is
      associated with patient self-reports of pain and function over a 4-week treatment period.
      Cytokine and growth factor levels will be measured in blood and saliva; saliva will be used
      to measure cytokine levels only.
