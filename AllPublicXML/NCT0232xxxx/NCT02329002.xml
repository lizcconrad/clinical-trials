      Rationale: Hereditary retinoblastoma survivors have an increased risk to develop second
      primary tumors (SPT) at a later age (with the highest risk in their teens), especially when
      they have been irradiated for retinoblastoma. The investigators hypothesize that regular
      screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could lead to early detection of SPTs leading
      to improved survival.

      Objective: To evaluate the potential benefit of craniofacial MRI screening for early
      detection subclinical secondary cancers in patients previously irradiated for hereditary
      retinoblastoma.

      Study design: Prospective multicenter non-invasive screening study. The total study duration
      will be four years of screening plus five years of follow-up.

      Study population: Irradiated hereditary retinoblastoma patients 8-18 years old Main study
      parameters/endpoints: To evaluate the ability of craniofacial MRI for early detection of
      SPTs, the investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of MRI at detecting
      SPTs in irradiated hereditary retinoblastoma patients.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Included patients will undergo yearly craniofacial MRI for a period of 4 years.
      They will also be asked to fill out a psychological burden assessment form each visit. A
      potential risk of screening might be associated anticipatory anxiety, but screening also
      could be reassuring for patients and their parents; the investigators are not sure which will
      outweigh. False-positive results from MRI screening could lead to unnecessary further
      diagnostics leading to possible added anxiety and diagnostics (e.g., biopsies). However, this
      group of patients have a high risk of developing SPTs, with poor 5-year survival statistics.
      Early detection and therefore treatment of earlier stage (smaller) tumors, might therefore
      increase survival of this patient group.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the benefit of early detection of craniofacial second primary tumors with MRI in previously irradiated hereditary retinoblastoma survivors. The main outcome measure for assessing the benefit of screening will be the diagnostic accuracy of MRI for detecting craniofacial SPTs: sensitivity (true-positive and false-negative results) and specificity (true-negative and false-positive results).</description>

    <description>MR imaging protocol should include a thin-slice (3-4 mm) short TI inversion recovery (STIR) sequence or fat-saturated T2-weighted images in axial direction. Furthermore, a 3D-T1 weighted sequence with isotropic voxels will be obtained, with reconstruction in 3 directions. If suspicious lesions are detected, additional MR imaging has to be performed, including contrast-enhanced images.</description>

        The potential study population will be irradiated hereditary retinoblastoma survivors in
        the Netherlands and joining centers from other countries. Currently, there is no screening
        program for these high-risk patients. The age of patients at highest risk of developing
        craniofacial SPTs is 8-18 years.
