  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The new drug BMN 673 (talazoparib) has been shown to fight tumor cells in animals and some
      people. It is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. It works on tumor cell
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage repair process. Researchers want to see if BMN 673 shrinks
      cancer again in women with ovarian cancer and whose cancer initially got shrunk but grew back
      on the first PARP inhibitor.

      Objective:

      - To study BMN 673 (talazoparib) in people with ovarian cancer born with a breast cancer
      (BRCA) mutation and whose cancer got shrunk but became worse after they took a similar drug.

      Eligibility:

        -  Women at least 18 years old:

        -  with recurrent and/or metastatic germline breast cancer mutation (gBRCAm)-associated
           ovarian cancer AND

        -  whose disease is growing after already being treated with PARP inhibitors AND

        -  with no other treatment(s) in between the first PARP inhibitors and a screening visit.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and heart and blood
           tests.

        -  Participants will take the study drug by mouth once daily. They will take the drug in
           28-day cycles.

        -  They will keep a diary of doses and any side effects.

        -  Participants will have 4 study visits in cycle 1, then 1 visit every cycle. Visits may
           include:

        -  Blood tests

        -  Physical exam

        -  Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants will
           lie in a machine that takes pictures of their body.

        -  Ultrasound

        -  Participants will have a biopsy before starting the study drug. A small piece of tumor
           tissue will be removed by needle, guided by a scan. They may have two more biopsies
           later.

        -  Participants will be followed for 30 days after taking the last dose of study drug. A
           physical exam, blood tests, and CT or other scans will be done.

        -  Participants will have follow-up calls to ask about any side effects.

      Background:

        -  Patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (gBRCAm) demonstrate repeated therapeutic
           susceptibility to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damaging agents, especially platinums,
           even if they have previously progressed on a similar (platinum-based) regimen.

        -  Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have clinical activity in
           gBRCAm-associated malignancies, although patients eventually develop progressive
           disease.

        -  BMN 673 (talazoparib) is a novel PARPi, with excellent oral bioavailability and greater
           anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo at lower concentrations than first generation
           PARPi.

        -  It is unknown whether secondary BRCA mutations or other potential mechanisms of clinical
           resistance portend cross-resistance to a highly potent PARPi.

      Objectives:

      -To determine the objective response rate (complete response (CR)+partial response (PR)) of
      single agent BMN 673 (talazoparib) in ovarian cancer patients with gBRCAm who have progressed
      on prior PARPi therapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Women with recurrent and/or metastatic gBRCAm-associated ovarian cancer, with
           progression on PARPi monotherapy within the immediate prior 2 months of the time of
           screening visit.

        -  Patients should have responded to their prior PARPi therapy (CR, PR or stable disease
           (SD)&gt;4months).

        -  Patients cannot have received another therapy between stopping their first PARPi
           therapy\ and initiating therapy on this trial, but must be off the prior PARPi for at
           least 4 weeks.

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and
           marrow function.

      Design:

        -  This is an open label, single arm phase II trial to examine activity of BMN 673
           (talazoparib).

        -  Patients will receive BMN 673 (talazoparib) at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
           1mg p.o. once daily on 28 day cycles.

        -  Research samples including whole blood, plasma, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and
           tumor biopsies will be obtained for progressive disease (PD) endpoints at baseline,
           cycle 1 day 29 (prior to cycle 2 day 1), and/or at progression in all patients.

        -  Patients will be evaluated every two cycles for response using Response Evaluation
           Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1 criteria and every cycle for safety using Common
           Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE)v4.0.

        start of the study.

          -  Patient must be able to swallow pills.

          -  Integral biomarkers: all patients who are eligible for the study due to a history of
             positive BRCA1/2 mutation must provide documented evidence of their deleterious
             germline mutation status, obtained in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment
             (CLIA)-certified laboratory, including but not limited to Myriad Genetics prior to
             study enrollment. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) of BRCA1/2 and BRCA1/2
             somatic mutations are not considered deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations. Due to
             the long acceptance of BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 mutation testing through Myriad, Myriad

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had prior BMN 673 (talazoparib) therapy.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases diagnosed within 1 year will be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events. Exception: patients with brain metastases diagnosed greater
             than 1 year prior to study entry may be considered if they received sterilizing
             therapy to the central nervous system (CNS) (resection or radiation) and have been CNS
             progression-free for the 1-year period.

          -  Lack of recovery of prior cancer therapy-related adverse events to Grade less than or
             equal to 1 (National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) v4.03; except alopecia). Stable persistent grade 2 peripheral
             neuropathy may be allowed as determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of
             the PI. Patients with platinum-related grade 2 or greater hypomagnesemia (on
             replacement) will be eligible.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, clinically
             significant gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or hemoptysis within 28 days prior to the
             start of the study, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patients with active infection will not be eligible, but may become eligible once
             infection has resolved and they are at least 7 days from completion of antibiotics.

          -  Another previous or current invasive malignancy within the last 2 years, with the
             exception of curatively treated stage Ia cervical carcinoma, or resected stage Ia
             endometrial cancer, and noninvasive nonmelanoma skin cancers.

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             BMN 673 (talazoparib). HIV- positive patients who are not on combination
             antiretroviral therapy (cART) and have cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts &gt; 500
             are eligible.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to BMN 673 (talazoparib)

        Patients who are receiving any other investigational or commercial agents with the intent
        to treat the malignancy.

          -  Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug
             intolerability or poor drug absorption.

          -  Use of nasogastric or gastric (G)-tube administration.

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) on BMN673 (Talazoparib) to PFS From First Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor (PARPPi) Exposure</title>
        <description>The median time to progression after receiving BMN673 will be compared informally to the time of progression for the same patients after receiving an initial PARPi exposure. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
        <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
        <population>This outcome measure was not done because the study was prematurely closed by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) sponsor following the enrollment of 3 subjects. We were unable to analyze biomarker endpoints due to insufficient number of samples after premature closure of the study.</population>

          <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS) on BMN673 (Talazoparib) to PFS From First Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor (PARPPi) Exposure</title>
          <description>The median time to progression after receiving BMN673 will be compared informally to the time of progression for the same patients after receiving an initial PARPi exposure. Progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
          <population>This outcome measure was not done because the study was prematurely closed by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) sponsor following the enrollment of 3 subjects. We were unable to analyze biomarker endpoints due to insufficient number of samples after premature closure of the study.</population>
