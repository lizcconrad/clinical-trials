      The purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of ADC value of diffusion
      weighted MRI in comparison of conventional treatment assessment criteria in evaluation of
      chemotherapy. Moreover, the investigators aim to clarify the correlation of ADC value with
      histologic type and grade of lung cancer and survival of patients.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, lung cancer is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease, Advances in surgical
      and chemotherapeutic approaches have been made, but the long-term survival rate remains low.
      Although effective mass screening of high-risk groups could potentially be of benefit,
      randomized trials of screening with the use of chest radiography with or without cytological
      analysis of sputum specimens have shown no reduction in lung-cancer mortality. Currently,
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by CT is the most commonly used to
      evaluate chemotherapy of lung cancer patient, but patients have to be exposed to radiation.
      For this reason, the investigators aim to assess the diagnostic accuracy of apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, a specific parameter of radiation-free diffusion weighted
      MRI, in comparison of RECIST, and its correlation with histologic type and grade of lung
      cancer as well. Furthermore, the investigators investigate its correlation with Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in patients.

    <description>Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a form of magnetic resonance imaging based upon measuring the random Brownian motion of water molecules within a voxel of tissue. The relationship between histology and diffusion is complex, however generally densely cellular tissues or those with cellular swelling exhibit lower diffusion coefficients, and thus diffusion is particularly useful in tumour characterisation</description>
