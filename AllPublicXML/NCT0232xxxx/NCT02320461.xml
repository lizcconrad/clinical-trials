    <textblock>
      The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) aims to contribute with
      relevant information regarding the development and progression of clinical and subclinical
      chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The investigators
      enrolled 15,105 civil servants from predefined universities or research institutes. Baseline
      assessment (2008-2010) included detailed interviews and measurements to assess social and
      biological determinants of health, as well as various clinical and subclinical conditions
      related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mental health. For the ascertainment of
      incident events, annual telephone surveillance is being conducted since 2009, and a second
      visit of interviews and exams is under way (2012-2014). Long-term biological sample storage
      is provided for sera, plasma, urine and DNA. Baseline data is available for analyses, and
      collaboration via specific research proposals directed to study investigators is welcome.

      This multicenter study is chaired by a steering committee, made up of the coordinators and
      vice-coordinators of each of the six centers. No individual center coordinates the study. The
      six institutions listed in the contact details all sponsor the study.

        ELSA-Brasil is a cohort study of 15,105 civil servants. All active or retired employees of
        the six institutions (and, in a few instances, also of related educational or health
        institutions), of both sexes, and with ages between 35 and 74 years, were eligible for the
        study. The six institutions, located in three different Brazilian regions, are: the Federal
        Universities of Bahia, Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, the University
        of Sao Paulo and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation.
