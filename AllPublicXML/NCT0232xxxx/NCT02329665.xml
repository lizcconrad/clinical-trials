      The study will collect anonymized data in support of further development of the NeedleWays
      System.

      The collected data will be:

        1. Anonymized CT scans with Patient Reference Frame (PRF) placed upon the scanned area,
           outside of the sterile field.

        2. Screen captures of the NeedleWays Procedure console display as the intervention needle
           is placed on the patients body, outside of the sterile field.
