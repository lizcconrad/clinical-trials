  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if the addition of the MedclineTM Sleep Assist Device
      will decrease night-time gastroesophageal reflux disease events.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MedcineTM Sleep Assist Device was recently developed by Amenity Health, Inc and is
      designed to elevate the head and torso and maintain a patient in the left-lateral position in
      order to decrease night-time/nocturnal acid reflux. The MedcineTM Sleep Assist Device is
      composed of a 9-inch incline base and a wrap-around body pillow. Traditionally wedge pillows
      have been recommended for patients with acid reflux. The addition of the body pillow helps to
      maintain the patient in the left-lateral position (LLP) during sleep, which has been shown to
      reduce night-time reflux compared to wedge alone, right lateral position and/or sleeping
      flat.

      In healthy controls, sleeping in the left-lateral position with this device system
      significantly decreased esophageal acid exposure and overall episodes of acid reflux. To
      date, there has been no study in patients with extra-esophageal reflux (EER) and nocturnal
      heartburn.

      Primary Objectives The primary objective of the this study is to evaluate the effect of a
      reflux pillow on esophageal acid exposure in patients complaining of nocturnal EER.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the effect of the reflux pillow on nocturnal EER symptoms,
      sleep quality, daytime EER symptoms, and overall quality of life.

    <description>This is a non-randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of the MedclineTM Sleep Assist Device on patients who experience nocturnal extraesophageal reflux. All patients will receive the device. Participants will serve as their own controls while undergoing 96-hour pH monitoring. Participants will follow their regular sleep position patterns on Days 1 and 2 of the study and will use the sleep assist device on Days 3 and 4. pH data and patient report of symptoms will be evaluated during the initial 96 hours of the study to capture physiologic results. All participants will use the sleep assist device for the remainder of the study to determine if a reduction in overall reflux symptom index (RSI) is achieved.</description>

    <intervention_name>MedclineTM Sleep Assist Pillow</intervention_name>
    <description>The pillow is designed so that the sleeper can have proper upper-body elevation while sleeping on his or her left side without the need for placing blocks under the head of the bed and bothering anyone else who may be sleeping in the bed. The pillow supports the patient's head, back and body to provide comfort while reducing or relieving acid reflux symptoms during sleep.</description>
