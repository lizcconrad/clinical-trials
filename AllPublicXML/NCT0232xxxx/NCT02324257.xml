  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study BP29541 is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation Phase I clinical
      study of single-agent RO6958688 in participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic
      carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) positive solid tumors who have progressed on standard
      treatment, are intolerant to standard of care (SOC), and/or are non-amenable to SOC. The
      study will be conducted in two parts. Part I of the study will investigate the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of RO6958688 in single participant cohorts with dosing
      starting from a minimal anticipated biological effect level dose of 0.05 milligrams (mg) and
      up to a maximum dose of 2.5 mg. Part II will establish the appropriate therapeutic dose based
      on safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of RO6958688 for the once
      per week (QW) regimen, every three weeks (Q3W) regimen, and for the step up dosing regimen.
      The overall target sample size is approximately 185 evaluable participants.

             tumor in participants who have progressed on a standard therapy, are intolerant to
             SOC, and/or are non-amenable to SOC and other solid tumors expressing CEA. Only
             locally advanced and/or metastatic colorectal cancer participants should be included

          -  Radiologically measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1

          -  Life expectancy, in the opinion of the investigator of greater than or equal (&gt;/=) to
             12 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0-1

          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical procedure
             must have resolved to Grade less than or equal to 1 or returned to baseline except
             alopecia (any grade) and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy

          -  Adequate hematological, liver, and renal function

          -  Participants must agree to be willing to use effective methods of contraception as
             defined in the protocol

          -  Non-GI solid tumors (like non-small cell lung cancer or breast cancer) should have
             confirmed CEA expression in tumor tissue &gt;/= 20% of tumor cells staining with at least
             moderate to high intensity of CEA expression are required (immunohistochemistry
             [IHC]2+ and IHC 3+). For CRC, pancreatic and gastric cancer participants, the CEA
             assessment will be performed retrospectively and the result is not needed to enroll
             the participant. For the biomarker cohort, only participants with moderate/low CEA
             expression (&lt; 20% of tumor cells with IHC2+/3+ and/or &gt;/= 20% of tumor cells with
             IHC1+) and very low CEA expression (&lt; 20% of tumor cells with IHC1+) will be enrolled.
             CEA expression should be determined prior to enrollment, if no archival tumor tissue
             is available, a fresh biopsy will be collected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases that could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results or contraindicate the use of
             an investigational drug, including diabetes mellitus, history of relevant pulmonary
             disorders, and known autoimmune diseases

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] greater than [&gt;] 150
