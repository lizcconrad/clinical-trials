  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if candidate polymorphisms in brain-derived
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) are predictive of
      psychosis disorder severity, symptomology, and resolution in patients at BCPP. A secondary
      objective will be to form a biorepository of blood and saliva samples from patients at BCPP
      so that further genetic, proteonomic and pharmacogenomic studies may be done to gain insight
      into the genetic basis of differences in psychosis disorder presentation and manifestation,
      and differences in response to antipsychotic drug treatment.

      This is a population-based, genetic-association, candidate polymorphism study. It will
      involve a prospective and a retrospective component. A blood draw or saliva sample will be
      performed during the participant's admission to BCPP, which may occur at any point during the
      participant's length of stay. When a participant has been deemed 'Ready for Discharge' by
      his/her attending psychiatrist at BCPP, a full phenotype will be obtained via retrospective
      chart review. Genetic analyses and determination of protein levels will be performed after
      chart review. Following fulfillment of the primary study objective, the remaining blood and
      saliva samples will be stored in the biobank over the long-term.

    <description>Participant will receive one blood draw whereby two samples will be extracted. If the participant wishes to participate in the study but is fearful of needles, they may be given the option to provide a saliva sample. A retrospective medical chart review will be performed after participant is discharged from BCPP in order to obtain a full phenotype. Genotyping of BDNF and COMT will be performed. Protein levels of BDNF will be determined. The remaining blood or saliva samples will be stored over the long-term in a biorepository at the BC Mental Health and Addictions Research Institute. A retrospective medical chart review will be completed after the participant is discharged.</description>

        The population will include all patients who have been admitted to the British Columbia
        Psychosis Program (BCPP). BCPP provides intensive inpatient care for individuals who have
        psychosis-related treatment challenges, including pharmacologic, biophysical, and
        psychosocial services. Admission criteria to BCPP include the following: 1) Must be 18
        years or older; 2) Diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with
        psychosis; 3) History of no response or inadequate response of positive symptoms to at
        least 2 adequate trials of antipsychotics (one of which is a second generation agent) by
        health authority tertiary clinical teams; 4) Incomplete recovery of social, vocational, and
        occupational functioning and 5) If present, substance use disorder, pervasive developmental
        disorder, developmental disability, personality disorder, aggression, or head injury are
        not the primary focuses of treatment.
