  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to contribute data to ongoing research activities focused on identification
      of EKG waveform changes in the context of clinical conditions and maternal medication use.
      Additionally, to develop the capacity to measure contractions more accurately and more
      reliably using skin-surface electrodes.

      Specific Aim 1: To develop a technique for the quantitative analysis of fetal heart-rate
      (FHR) data recorded during labor using advanced mathematical techniques, including
      pattern-recognition analysis.

        -  Specific Aim 2: To develop the capacity to measure fetal cardiac data using EKG sensors
           applied to the maternal abdomen during labor.

        -  Specific Aim 3: To validate prenatal non-invasive measurement of the fetal QTc interval.

        -  Specific Aim 4: To develop and validate the capacity to measure uterine contractions
           using the uterine EMG signal recorded from maternal skin-surface electrodes.

        -  Specific Aim 5: Collect clinical data related to medication usage and hypoxia.

    <measure>Uterine contractions</measure>
    <time_frame>During labor</time_frame>
    <description>Uterine contractions will be identified by analyzing data from surface electrodes to identify patterns consistent with uterine muscle coordinated shortening. These data will be compared to data from either the external tocometer or the internal IUPC. Cross correlation analysis will be used to compare the two signals and validate the analysis of uterine EMG signal.</description>
