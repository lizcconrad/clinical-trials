  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable disease and despite an improvement of the
      effect of systemic treatments. After relapse on first-line non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor,
      current clinical practice and treatment guidelines include tamoxifen, fulvestrant (an ER
      antagonist) and exemestane as available options (NCCN treatment guidelines 2012), but in this
      context of resistance, their efficacy are poor.

      Some results confirm the possibility to improve the efficacy of tamoxifen in metastatic
      setting by a combination with therapy targeting signal transduction pathways. Other
      transduction pathways seem to be involved in endocrine sensitivity/resistance, such as
      RAS/RAF/MEK/MAK pathway.

      LY2228820 inhibits the activity of p38 MAPK (selective inhibitor of the α and β isoforms of
      p38 MAPK in vitro) and reduces phosphorylation of its cellular target, MAPK-activated protein
      kinase 2 (MAPKAP-K2).
