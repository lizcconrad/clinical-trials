  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related upper extremity disorders are common problems in working populations in western
      countries. Lateral epicondylitis (LE) or tennis elbow is the most frequent type of soft
      tissue syndrome of the elbow, with an annual incidence of four to seven cases per 1000
      patients in general practice, and as high as 15 % of workers in highly repetitive hand task
      industries.

      LE is a painful condition, leading to loss of function of the affected limb. Therefore it can
      have a major impact on the patient's work and personal life. If untreated, it persists for an
      average of six to 24 months and associated with significant sickness absence in 5 % of
      affected working-aged adults. The cost is therefore high, both in terms of loss of
      productivity and health care utilization.

      Many treatments have been advocated in the management of LE, possibly implying that much is
      unknown about its etiology and how it best should be treated. Systematic reviews have failed
      to draw any firm conclusions as to what treatment is most effective in managing this
      condition.

      Over the past 10 years acupuncture has gained wider acceptance for treating pain, by both
      clinicians and consumers of health, and there is some evidence suggesting that acupuncture
      treatment is effective in of acute symptoms in LE. A recent study supports that also elbow
      manipulation have a short-term relief of acute symptoms in LE, especially when combined with
      eccentric exercise. Our study will therefore explore the clinical effectiveness of
      physiotherapy versus acupuncture treatment of LE, compared with watchful waiting.

      The study design is three armed and randomized, single blinded. The study aims, in a pilot
      stydy, to test if physiotherapy or acupuncture treatment of lateral epicondylitis, compared
      with watchful waiting, is useful means in pain relief for patients with lateral
      epicondylitis.

    <description>Treatment will be performed according to traditional Chinese methods (STRICTA: Standards for reporting interventions in controlled trials of acupunc-ture). Therapists will select points frequently recommended for the treatment of LE. As local point, LI11 and LI10 over the muscular origin of the lateral extensor group of the forearm will be used, and LU5 in the cubical region. LI4 and TE5 will be regional points for pain therapy in the upper limb, GB34 will be used as a distal point for treatment of tendinosis in general, and ST36 for treatment of pain. Needles will be inserted down to the musculature and obtaining De Qi sensation and will remain in situ for 20 min. All patients will receive four treatment sessions; this may be extended to eight depending on patient's pain report and the therapists' clinical evaluation. Maximum treatment period is 4 weeks. Patients will also be instructed in eccentric strength exercises for daily home training from enrolment and 12 weeks forward.</description>

    <description>Manual techniques as gliding mobilization of elbow, therapists are spezialised in manual therapy. At least four treatment sessions will be performed, but depending on the patient's perceived intensity of pain and the therapists' clinical evaluation, a maximum of eight treatment session can be given. All treatment session will be performed during a period of maximum 4 weeks.
In addition, patients will be instructed in eccentric strength exercises for daily home training from enrolment and 12 weeks forward.</description>
