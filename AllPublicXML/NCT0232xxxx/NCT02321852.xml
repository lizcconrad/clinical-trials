  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the eNOS activating agent
      triflusal on episodic memory and cognitive functions in healthy participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomised, placebo controlled, double blind, cross-over design

      Primary study outcomes are:

      Performance in picturial and verbal memory tasks.

      Main secondary outcomes are: Performance in working memory and cognitive tasks and influence
      on mood, depression and anxiety and motivation.

      Once daily oral administration of placebo mannitol for 7 days in a cross-over trial with a
      washout period of at least 14 days between the two periods. Each participant will take
      triflusal as well as placebo
