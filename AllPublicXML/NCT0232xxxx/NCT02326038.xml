  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, memory impairments in the elderly population are treated using cholinesterase
      inhibitors, although impairments remain after treatment. Dopamine (DA) is also involved in
      cognition and is especially of interest in healthy ageing because of the role in processing
      speed and cognitive control. To what extent dopamine treatment improves memory and attention
      in older impaired individuals is unknown. However, such an effect is conceivable because of
      the close relationship between memory and attention in aging and since improved processing
      speed and cognitive control may lead to improved memory.

      The investigators aim to examine, in the impaired older population, whether a treatment using
      methylphenidate, a DA re-uptake inhibitor that enhances DA, improves attention and memory.
      The study will be conducted according to a cross-sectional, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      2-way cross-over design. 20 male and female patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),
      amnestic type, aged above 60 years of age; 20 male and female patients with MCI, non-amnestic
      type, will be recruited from the Orbis Medical Centre. Participants will be treated once with
      20 mg methylphenidate (MPH) and once with placebo. All medications will be administered
      orally with a capsule. The treatment order will be established by counterbalancing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant has been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment, either of the
             amnestic or the non-amnestic type.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the participant is capable of understanding and
             complying with protocol requirements.

          -  The participant signs and dates a written informed consent form.
