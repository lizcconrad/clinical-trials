    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the LAA-CLOSURE trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of surgical
      closure of LAA in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. This randomized, prospective,
      open-label international multicenter trial will enroll 1040 patients undergoing aortic valve
      replacement with CHA2DS2-VASC score ≥2 but without an indication for anticoagulation at the
      time of enrollment. Patients will be randomized in 1:1 fashion to standard therapy + surgical
      closure of LAA vs. standard therapy alone. The duration of the study is five years (plus
      additional 10 years).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have concluded that ≥90% of AF related left atrial thrombi are located in
      the left atrial appendage (LAA). Surgical closure of LAA can be performed using ligation,
      stapler or other devices designed for this purpose during cardiac surgery. However, current
      evidence for surgical closure of LAA is scarce and no large scale randomized prospective
      clinical trials addressing this issue have been published. American College of Cardiology
      (ACC)/ American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines state that LAA exclusion should be
      considered in patients with recurrent and persistent AF who remain symptomatic with heart
      rate control and where antiarrhythmic medication is not tolerated or no longer effective.
      Current European Association of Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines conclude that there
      is no proven benefit of surgical LAA exclusion in terms of stroke reduction or mortality
      benefit (level of evidence 2a B), and if exclusion is contemplated, devices designed for
      appendage exclusion should be used rather than a cut-and-sew or stapling technique. These
      guidelines are based on small poorly designed descriptive trials and only one small
      randomized trial.

      LAA-CLOSURE trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of prophylactic surgical closure of LAA
      in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.
