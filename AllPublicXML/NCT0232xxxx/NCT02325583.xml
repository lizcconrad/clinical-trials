    <textblock>
      Newborn often sedated during MRI but sedation itself creates adverse events and management is
      more challenging in the MR environment. The investigators describe the investigators initial
      experience with oral 30% glucose administration through a pacifier during MRI for imaging of
      newborns. Using this technique, majority of newborns can complete MRI examination without the
      need for sedation and also offers the availability of administering sedatives to unsuccessful
      patients.

      19 consecutive newborns over 10 months period were assessed retrospectively. 0.5-1 mL 30%
      glucose solution was administered orally and after suckling, the motionless and sleepiness of
      newborn was evaluated. If the target conditions was not achieved, 0.5-1 mL increments of
      glucose was added. After 2 consecutive oral glucose administration the newborns who did not
      keep motionless or sleep and had motion artefacts sedated with midazolam. The outcome measure
      was the success of the procedure which was determined by providing qualitative images
      appropriate for interpretation following 30% glucose administration. The routine blood
      glucose level measurement of the newborns after imaging procedures in the ICU was also
      performed for each patient.
