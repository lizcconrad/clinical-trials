  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effects of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services'
      Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative on physician practices, practice staff, Medicare
      and Medicaid costs and service utilization, quality of care, and patient outcomes. CPC
      provides financial resources, timely feedback on key practice outcomes, and a learning
      network to support practice transformation to improve quality of care and lower costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMS selected 7 regions (states or substate areas) to include in this study, based on
      commitment of other (ie, nonMedicare) payers in the area to provide financial resources to
      participating practices to support practice transformation to improve quality of care, reduce
      costs, and improve population health. 497 practices were selected from roughly 1000
      applicants in the 7 regions to participate in the study. CMS pays participating practices a
      per member per month care management fee for each Medicare patient attributed to the
      practice. The practices also receive quarterly feedback on trends in their Medicare patients'
      use of hospital and emergency room services, Medicare expenditures, and patient outcomes from
      periodic surveys. Practices are expected to improve patient outcomes and lower Medicare costs
      per patient by using the additional resources to improve: risk-stratified care management,
      access and continuity of care, planned chronic and preventive care, patient and caregiver
      engagement, and coordination across the medical neighborhood. To remain in the study,
      practices must meet annual milestones for meaningful use of electronic health records and
      other practice features. The intervention period, which began in Fall 2012, will continue for
      4 years.

    <description>Practices assigned to the treatment group received per member per month care management fees for each Medicare beneficiary attributed to their practice. They also received quarterly feedback reports on their patients' average Medicare expenditures and use of hospital and emergency room services. Practices also had access to regional learning faculties for technical assistance with transformation activities and to share lessons across practices.</description>

    <description>Within each of the 7 regions, this group is comprised of practices that were matched to the treatment practices on a wide range of baseline characteristics of the practices (including their service utilization patterns) and their patients. Comparison practices were selected from a pool of practices including those that applied to participate but were not selected, and practices serving nearby external comparison areas.</description>

    <description>Each participating practice received quarterly reports showing the practice's trend in key outcomes during the pre-intervention and intervention periods. The risk adjusted average Medicare expenditures of their patients were also shown in relation to all of the other CPC practices in their region, and to those with a similar average risk profile. Unadjusted hospitalization rates and emergency room visits were also plotted over time and compared to those of other CPC practices in the region</description>
