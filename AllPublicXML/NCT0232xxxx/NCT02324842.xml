  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1.To examine whether the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin can
      prevent the increase in HGP following institution of canagliflozin therapy and produce an
      additive or even synergistic effect to lower the plasma glucose concentration and A1c.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin
      can produce an additive, or even synergistic, effect to promote weight loss and reduction in
      hepatic and visceral fat content.

      Specific Aim 3. To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin
      can produce an additive or even synergistic effect to reduce systolic/diastolic blood
      pressure and 24-hour integrated blood pressure.

      Specific Aim 1.To examine whether the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin can
      prevent the increase in HGP following institution of canagliflozin therapy and produce an
      additive or even synergistic effect to lower the plasma glucose concentration and A1c. We
      will examine this hypothesis by comparing the effect of administration of liraglutide alone,
      canagliflozin alone, and the combination of liraglutide plus canagliflozin on:(i) the rate of
      HGP; (ii) decrease in fasting plasma glucose concentration; (iii) counter-regulatory hormone
      response and (iv) A1c. We anticipate that the addition of liraglutide to canagliflozin will
      prevent the increase in plasma glucagon concentration, augment insulin secretion, and
      blunt/block the increase in HGP in response to canagliflozin, resulting in a greater decrease
      in fasting plasma glucose concentration and A1c than observed with each therapy alone.

      Specific Aim 2: To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin
      can produce an additive, or even synergistic, effect to promote weight loss and reduction in
      hepatic and visceral fat content.

      Specific Aim 3. To examine whether combination therapy with liraglutide plus canagliflozin
      can produce an additive or even synergistic effect to reduce systolic/diastolic blood
      pressure and 24-hour integrated blood pressure.

    <measure>Change in HGP</measure>

    <description>Primary end point of the study is the change in the rate of HGP during the last hour of the study (i.e. from 300-360 minutes) following drug administration compared to the basal rate of HGP (before drug administration). This change in HGP will be compared among the 3 different treatments (canagliflozin, liraglutide, canagliflozin plus liraglutide) with ANOVA. Post hoc analysis will be performed with paired t-test.
Under steady-state post absorptive conditions, the basal rate of endogenous (primarily reflects hepatic) glucose appearance (Ra) equals the 3-3H-glucose infusion rate divided by the steady state plasma tritiated glucose specific activity. After drug administration, non-steady conditions for 3-3H-glucose specific activity prevail and the total rate of glucose appearance (Ra) is calculated from Steele's equation. Ra will be calculated for each time point after the drug administration and compared to Ra in the placebo study.</description>
