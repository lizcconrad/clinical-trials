  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to address barriers to the use of patient reported
      outcome (PRO) data in the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blinded study that compares outcome data in patients
      for whom PRO data either is or is not made available to the treating physician. The question
      addressed by this proposal is whether patient reported outcome (PRO) data change patient's
      outcomes. The hypothesis is that the availability of these data in the form of the
      patient-completed MDHAQ/RAPID3 questionnaire will change patient-centric outcomes such as
      patient reported well-being, patient satisfaction and medication compliance.

    <measure>medication compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of medication compliance. Medication compliance will be assessed by the medication possession ratio (MPR) of Methotrexate (MTX), a drug most RA patients are prescribed. The VA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) database collects information on medications dispensed and when refills are needed. Thus, a delay in refill will reflect MTX non-compliance. If it MTX is discontinued due to an adverse reaction, it is noted in the electronic medical record. The MPR is calculated as the number of days of prescribed MTX divided by the total number of days of a course.</description>
