      The main objective is to compare efficacy, in terms of antifungal activity of Loceryl Nail
      Lacquer associated with a Cosmetic Varnish and Loceryl Nail Lacquer alone, in the treatment
      of mild to moderate toenail Distal Subungual Onychomycosis.

      The second objective of this study will be photographic follow-up of clinical improvement and
      cure after the initial treatment period of 12 weeks, for 15 additional months.

      Study center:

      A two period study: A total of 50 subjects were to be included in 1 site in Iceland.

      Methodology:

        1. Treatment period:

             -  Group Loceryl Nail Lacquer+ Cosmetic Varnish:

                  -  Loceryl Nail Lacquer to be applied once weekly for 12 weeks on all affected
                     toenails,

                  -  Cosmetic varnish to be applied once weekly for 12 weeks on all affected
                     toenails and/or all toenails.

             -  Group Loceryl Nail Lacquer alone:

                  -  Loceryl Nail Lacquer to be applied once weekly for 12 weeks on all affected
                     toenails.

           At week 12 if no clinical sign of clinical aggravation of Onychomycosis, subjects could
           enter into a Follow-up period.

        2. Follow-up period:

      Subjects were to apply Loceryl Nail Lacquer alone, once a week for 15 additional months (or
      less in case of complete cure).
