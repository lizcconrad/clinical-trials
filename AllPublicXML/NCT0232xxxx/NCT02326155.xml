      An observational, prospective cohort study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Remsima™ in

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Remsima™ by evaluation of
      Events of Special Interest (ESI) in IBD patients, who have active Crohn's disease (CD),
      fistulizing Crohn's disease (CD), or Ulcerative Colitis (UC) for up to 5 years for each
      patient.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate additional safety and efficacy of
      Remsima™ in IBD patients, who have active CD, fistulizing CD or UC. Health-economic
      parameters will also be assessed

      Blood samples will be collected for IGRA assessment and immunogenicity analysis (optional).
      Where appropriate, the serum should be transferred into a sufficient number of transfer vials
      prior to freezing. Additionally, blood samples for immunogenicity should be retained at the
      central laboratory (PPD Global Central Labs) up to the End of the Study, in case additional
      analysis is required.
