  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this small randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the impact of a
      brief (16 hour) 3rd trimester mindfulness-based childbirth education program, &quot;Mind in Labor
      (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth,&quot; with a standard care/&quot;treatment as usual&quot; (TAU)
      active control condition of standard hospital- and community-based childbirth education. The
      MIL group is expected to demonstrate a reduction in fear of labor (less pain catastrophizing
      and greater childbirth self-efficacy), less perceived pain in labor, less use of pain
      medication in labor, greater birth satisfaction, and better prenatal and postpartum
      psychological adjustment compared to the TAU group.

    <intervention_name>Mind in Labor (MIL): Working with Pain in Childbirth</intervention_name>
    <description>The Mind in Labor (MIL) mindfulness intervention for pregnant women and their partners integrates mindfulness strategies for coping with labor pain and fear and formal mindfulness meditation with traditional childbirth education. The MIL intervention is held over 3 consecutive weekend days (Friday - Sunday) for a total of 16 hours of mindfulness skills training for childbirth preparation and labor pain management. Mindfulness strategies for coping with labor-related pain and fear are taught in an interactive, experiential format, with periods of didactic instruction.</description>
