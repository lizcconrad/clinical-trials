  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      Multiple Sclerosis and clinical outcomes.

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center patient sponsored study of ADSC
      implantation using an IV delivery system. The study will provide therapies to up to 100
      qualified patients who match the inclusion/exclusion criteria, agree to the follow up program
      and who have provided a signed consent for each procedure.

      The treatment is a combination of (a) general detoxification, (b) lymphatic massage/drainage,
      (c) therapeutic massage, reflexology and acupuncture and (d) cellular infusion therapy in
      which cells will be deployed via IV injection over two treatments of 60 minutes each during
      the five (5) day treatment period.

      Follow-up data based upon MSIS-29, a modified SF-36 and standard complication questionnaire
      will be collected at 3, 6 and then annually post treatment by the patients' local physician
      and reported back to the sponsor where it will be logged into a HIPPA-compliant outcomes
      database.

      Additional safety data, based upon a standard complication questionnaire will be collected
      via survey of patient at intervals of 3 and 6 months and then annually for a minimum of five
      (5) years.
