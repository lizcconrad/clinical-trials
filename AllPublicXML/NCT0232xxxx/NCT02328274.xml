    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy (LASH) for benign uterine lesion has regained its
      popularity in the past decade due to its minimal invasiveness that results in less operation
      time, less blood loss and quicker return to normal activity. The standard surgical procedure
      in LASH includes separation of adnexa and round ligament from pelvic sidewall or uterus,
      dissection of the vesico-uterine peritoneum and opening of the paravesical space; followed by
      amputation of the uterus with energy-producing modalities (such as Harmonic Scalpel,
      monopolar electrocautery, bipolar electrocautery). Large uteri may result in longer operative
      time and higher possibility of conversion to laparotomy due to technical difficulty and
      excessive blood loss. In order to overcome these difficulties, we introduce a modified
      surgical technique of LASH which incorporated two methods of vessels ligation and
      laparoscopic in situ morcellation.
