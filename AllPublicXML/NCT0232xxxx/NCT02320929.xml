    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of postoperative intermittent closed-catheter irrigation on
      the recovery from the purulent flexor tenosynovitis. One group of patients suffering from
      acute purulent flexor tenosynovitis is treated using intraoperative irrigation only and the
      other group having both intra- and postoperative irrigation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The foundation of the successful management of purulent flexor tenosynovitis is the surgical
      debridement followed by an intravenous antibiotic treatment. Several surgical methods have
      been described to remove the purulent debris from the flexor tendon sheath. Closed-catheter
      irrigation involves irrigation of the tendon sheath from proximal to distal direction
      facilitated by two small incisions; one proximal to A1 pulley and one distal to A4 pulley.
      Lille et al. (J Hand Surg Br. 2000;25(3):304-307) conducted a retrospective study that
      implied that intraoperative closed-catheter irrigation without postoperative irrigation might
      be as effective as the combination of intra- and postoperative irrigation.

      The hypothesis of this prospective randomized trial is that the intraoperative
      closed-catheter irrigation alone is as effective as the combination of intraoperative and
      postoperative intermittent closed-catheter irrigation in the treatment of purulent flexor
      tenosynovitis.
