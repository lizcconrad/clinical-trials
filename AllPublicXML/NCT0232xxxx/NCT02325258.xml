      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of health-care professionals in
      addressing sepsis, and the impact of a telephone call upon receival of blood cultures in the
      clinical microbiology department, from a clinical microbiologist, in the early management of
      sepsis.

      Sepsis is one of the major challenges of modern medicine. It is an important health problem
      with a high incidence, morbidity and mortality that affects population worldwide. Without an
      early recognition and a prompt management, patients can develop more severe stages of the
      disease and even death. An appropriate and aggressive management can significantly improve
      outcomes. Thus, it is necessary to develop early warning systems of sepsis in the hospital.

      In recent years, several campaigns and guidelines have been developed to help health care
      professionals in the management of sepsis. However, these have mainly focused on management
      protocols for severe sepsis and septic shock in intensive care units or emergency
      departments. To the best of the investigators knowledge, none of these have examined in depth
      either the impact of a sepsis alert system in general wards, nor the impact of a telephone
      call from a specialist in Clinical Microbiology, upon blood culture request, in the early
      recognition of sepsis.

      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of health-care professionals in
      addressing sepsis, and the impact of a telephone call upon receival of blood cultures in the
      clinical microbiology department, from a clinical microbiologist, in the early management of
      sepsis.

      For this, the investigators performed a prospective study based on telephone calls followed
      by a phone interview to physicians and nurses in charge of patients whose blood cultures had
      just been received at the clinical microbiology department in a tertiary hospital.

    <description>Aug-Dec 2012. Prospective study in patients who had blood cultures drawn and sent to the Microbiology Lab during the morning shift (9 am to 3 pm, Mon- Fri) to evaluate sepsis recognition. The investigators allocated 300 patients to 2 groups of 150 patients each, by opportunity sampling: patients whose clinical history number ended in odd numbers were assigned to group A (intervention) and those whose clinical history number ended in even numbers were assigned to group B (no intervention, control group). For patients in group A, the investigators attempted a telephone contact with the physician and/or nurse in charge and an interview, issuing recommendations regarding the convenience of further biochemical, microbiological or extra radiologic tests, and management and antimicrobial therapy.</description>
