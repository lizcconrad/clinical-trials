    <textblock>
      The most popular surgical treatment of peritoneal cancer is the type known as hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC), a type of cytoreductive surgery for which a
      significantly high survival rate has been demonstrated by several studies. It is widely known
      that HIPEC entails severe physiological changes and precautions during anesthesia. However,
      very few studies have systematically outlined and organized these changes for each system,
      and most existing studies only report retrospective data or are limited to gynecological
      surgeries. Therefore, the present researchers planned a prospective observational study to
      determine the physiological changes that occur in patients during HIPEC cytoreductive
      surgeries performed in the colon and rectal surgery department of the investigators hospital.
      The investigators planned to monitor the patients' body temperature, metabolism,
      cardiovascular and respiratory changes during HIPEC cytoreductive surgery and analyze the
      anesthetic methods applied to identify the optimal anesthetic management strategy for HIPEC
      cytoreductive surgeries.

    <description>At least 30 minutes prior to the prospective conclusion of the surgery, 1 Î¼g/kg of fentanyl is administered for postoperative analgesia and 0.075mg of palonosetron is IV-infused for the prevention of nausea and vomiting. Desflurane and remifentanil administration is ceased after the surgery is concluded, muscle relaxation is evaluated by train of four (TOP) monitoring using a nerve stimulator, and the neuromuscular blockade is reversed with 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate and 1 mg of neostigmine. When the patient recovers consciousness and begins spontaneous respiration, extubation is performed and the patient is transferred to the ICU with monitoring of their vital signs.</description>
