    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve, it cause blindness if not diagnosed
      and treated properly. The major risk factor for the development and progression of glaucoma
      is increased intraocular pressure. Colonoscopy is one of the most preformed world wide
      screening exam. It is used to detect colon cancer at its early stages. As part of this
      examination, the examiner inflates the inspected colon with air in order to increase the
      colon lumen for better visualization of the colon. As a consequence of the insufflation the
      intrabdominal pressure increases as well. the increase in intrabdominal pressure could
      increase intraocular pressure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the intraocular pressure
      increase while preforming colonoscopy.
