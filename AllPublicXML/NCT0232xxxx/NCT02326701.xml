    <textblock>
      Echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular function is an important diagnostic tool,
      and is a challenge due to the unique structure and anatomy of the right ventricle. Lately a
      new technique has been developed and used for evaluating both the left and the right
      ventricle function. This technique, called two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking, is based on
      detecting speckles in the myocardial tissue and using them as acoustic markers. The movement
      of these speckles represents the movement of the tissue, and allows us to evaluate its
      function, contraction and relaxation, this by calculating the strain rate, which is the speed
      of the speckles, and the strain, which is the distance between them.

      In the last few years this technique has been used to evaluate the systolic function of the
      right ventricle in several pathological conditions, such as pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary
      embolism and amyloidosis. Nonetheless, so far there has been little data on the normal RV
      strain and strain rate values.

      In this study the investigators aim to validate two dimensional (2D) speckle tracking
      measurements of the RV function by comparing them to strain measurements by cardiac MRI. Each
      patient performing cardiac MRI for any indication will perform an echocardiography
      examination in addition, and strain analysis performed on the cardiac MRI will be compared
      with two dimensional speckle tracking analysis performed on the echocardiography.
