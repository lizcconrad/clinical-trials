  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, randomized, 4 period, crossover, single-center trial. The
      purpose of this trial is to assess the relative bio-availability of racemate Oral Dispersible
      Tablet praziquantel (ODT-PQZ) (MSC1028703A) 150 milligram (mg) versus the current marketed
      praziquantel (PZQ) (Cysticide® 500 mg) formulation in healthy male volunteers.

        <population>The pharmacokinetic (PK) population included all subjects who completed the study and for whom primary PK parameters could be calculated for the first two treatment periods. Here, ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies those subjects who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. The term TEAE is defined as AEs starting or worsening after the first intake of the stud drug.</description>
