  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Losing the ability to walk can lead to fewer opportunities to socialize with friends and
      family and participate in the community. When this happens, powered wheelchairs can provide
      access to homes and communities, contributing to health and well-being. Training by a
      qualified occupational therapist allows an individual to use a powered wheelchair safely and
      effectively. Learning to drive a powered wheelchair can be difficult, frustrating and time
      consuming for people with cognitive and physical challenges. In this study, we will ask
      participants with cognitive impairments to complete training with an occupational therapist
      using either a shared control wheelchair or training methods according to the standard of
      care. We believe shared control training, entitled Collaborative Powered mobility Innovative
      Learning OpporTunity (CoPILOT) will enhance driving skill while maximizing safety learning.
      CoPILOT has the potential to enable people to participate more in their day to day lives and
      regain mobility independence.

      Background: Powered wheelchairs can improve participation in daily life, increase quality of
      life, and add 'life to years' for individuals with SCI. Cognitive limitations, associated
      with advanced age at the time of a spinal cord injury or comorbid traumatic brain injury,
      impair learning and may prevent an individual from acquiring or maintaining skills necessary
      to drive a powered mobility device. Standard power wheelchair training, limited by time,
      equipment and budget constraints, may not meet the learning needs of individuals with
      cognitive impairment, preventing an individual from obtaining use of a powered wheelchair,
      impacting independence and quality of life. The total system cost of procuring a power
      wheelchair can range from $10,000 - $30,000; suboptimal use resulting from inadequate
      training is a poor use of resources and comes at a substantial social price. The
      Collaborative Power mobility Innovative Learning OpporTunity (CoPILOT) is a training approach
      utilizing shared control wheelchair technology and allows a therapist to provide an
      error-free learning experience for individuals in their own environments, while maintaining
      safety of the user and the individuals around them. Using shared control technology, the
      wheelchair user remains in control of the wheelchair while learning to drive, except in cases
      where the trainer overrides the control (using a remote controlled interface) to maintain
      safety and provide targeted learning opportunities.

      Purpose and Objectives: Our purpose is to obtain pilot data for a larger randomized control
      trial of a shared control power wheelchair training program (CoPILOT) for improving power
      wheelchair mobility skills among novice power wheelchair users with comorbid cognitive
      impairment compared to standard of care. Collection of pilot data is necessary prior to
      moving forward with a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Hypotheses: We expect the intervention protocol will be feasible for a larger randomized
      control trial. Compared to the standard of care group, we expect the CoPILOT group will
      experience significant improvement in power wheelchair skill capacity. We also expect the
      CoPILOT group will experience improvements in wheelchair skill safety, confidence, capacity
      for divided attention tasks, and health related quality of life, compared to the standard of
      care participants.

      Methods: Our feasibility study will use an evaluator blind parallel RCT. New power wheelchair
      users with mild to moderate cognitive impairment will be recruited from the GF Strong or
      Vancouver General Hospital Spinal Cord Injury patient population. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to a CoPILOT (shared control training) group or standard of care group. All
      training will be completed by qualified occupational therapist trainers. Participants in both
      groups will receive 12 hours of training in a standard powered wheelchair; however, the
      CoPILOT groups will use remote control technology we have developed. Post-Treatment
      Qualitative Interviews will be conducted. Questions will be related to protocol
      administration and use of the CoPILOT approach and shared control technology, including
      necessary modifications.

    <measure>Change in Power-mobility Indoor Driving Assessment (PIDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization), 5 weeks (immediate post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The PIDA covers specific tasks required for functional indoor driving, which are specific to the environment (i.e. accessing the bed from the right and left, and approaching the closet and dresser in the bedroom). The PIDA has been evaluated for content and face validity, has good inter-rater (ICC 0.87) and fair intra-rater (ICC 0.67) reliability.55. We aim to explore the potential usefulness of this outcome measure for this population, in this environment, for inclusion in future clinical trials.</description>

    <measure>Change in Wheelchair Skills Test Questionnaire (WST-P-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization), 5 weeks (immediate post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The WST-P-Q is a standardized subjective evaluation of the capacity, performance, and confidence for 30 powered wheelchair skills. Total percent scores (0-100%) are calculated for both capacity, performance, and confidence. The WST was selected as a secondary measure because it is a standardized tool for evaluating wheelchair capacity, the primary construct of interest.</description>

    <measure>Change in Wheelchair-use Confidence Scale (WheelCon-P )</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization), 5 weeks (immediate post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement for power wheelchair users is a 59-item self-report scale (0-100) with documented reliability and validity. Responses indicate current level of perceived confidence (%) to navigate the physical environment in a wheelchair, perform activities in a wheelchair, problem solve, advocate for specific needs, and manage social situations and emotions. The WheelCon was selected as a secondary outcome measure because confidence for using a wheelchair has been shown to influence wheelchair skills capacity.</description>

    <measure>Sensory data</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-randomization), 5 weeks (immediate post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>A variety of anonymized sensor data will be collected (not linked to participant files). Data will be used to characterize situations which were deemed unsafe by the trainer, and to analyse steering and intervention behaviours. The following sensor data will be collected from the wheelchair control system (computerized): Joystick movements and button presses (both trainer and participant) and wheelchair movements (odometry). The following sensors data will be collected from sensors attached to the wheelchair: distance to obstacles (laser rangefinders), environmental context (outward looking RGBD cameras), wheelchair movements (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass).</description>

    <description>Participants in both groups will receive twelve hours of training in a standard powered wheelchair however the CoPILOT groups will use remote control technology we have developed. The technology provides the trainer with remote control of wheelchair speed and direction allowing the trainer to override the participant's actions as needed to ensure safe error-free shared controlled wheelchair training. The CoPILOT approach will accommodate varied learning needs, as per adult learning principles, while decreasing trainer input until the participant can complete tasks independently.</description>
