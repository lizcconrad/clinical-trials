      RELAX Anaesthetics is a randomised clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of using an
      iPad app with art, music and games to relax and distract children, reduce anaesthetic
      induction time and make drug cost savings prior to surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most distressing part of a parent's experience in hospital is watching a child undergo
      intravenous cannulation.1 This is commonly performed in the anaesthetic room prior to
      induction of anaesthesia. At Chelsea and Westminster Foundation Trust (CWFT) over 5000
      children undergo operations every year. Traditional methods of distracting the child during
      have included blowing bubbles, storybooks, and a variety of toys and games. These methods are
      not always effective and may present an infection risk due to inability to clean between
      uses.

      The use of an android/iPad provides a platform for effectively distracting the child with a
      choice of games, video and music, with the advantage of being cleaned between uses. Users of
      this platform are required to select the application that is most appropriate for the age,
      sex, method of anaesthesia, and compliance level of the child. To assist with this, the
      investigators have developed an application system that will select a range of entertainment
      applications appropriate for each child based on these four variables and hopefully help to
      keep children calm before their operations.

    <description>On entry to the anaesthetic room, children will be given an iPad (the intervention) with art, music and games to distract them. A nurse will help them engage with the iPad whilst the anaesthetists complete the anaesthetic. Once the child falls asleep, the iPad will be removed. This process is anticipated to last between 3 and 30 minutes depending on the time taken to anaesthetise the child.</description>
