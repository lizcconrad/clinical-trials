      The study objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Permanent Polymer
      Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent Resolute Integrity™ to the Polymer Free Amphilimus-Eluting Stent
      Cre8™ compared in an all-comer patient population. 1 month of dual antiplatelet duration will
      be applied in stable angina pectoris patients. Myocardial infarction patient population will
      be treated with 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy.

      A Prospective, Multi-Center, Open Label, Randomized Controlled, two-arm Study to Evaluate the
      Safety and Efficacy of the Permanent Polymer Zotarolimus Eluting Stent 'Resolute Integrity™'
      Compared to Polymer Free Amphilimus Eluting Stent 'Cre8'. Dual Antiplatelet Therapy duration
      of 1 Month will be applied in stable angina pectoris patient population. Myocardial
      infarction patient population will be treated with 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy
      (DAPT).

      One thousand five hundred thirty-two (1532) patients (1:1 randomization Cre8 stent: Resolute
      Integrity™ stent) will be enrolled in the study, with clinical follow-up at 12 months to
      assess the primary end point.

      After a period of 12 months, a clinical registry will be implemented Information will be
      collected at 3-years post procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        General Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All-comer patients aged 18 years and older

          2. Patient has been informed of the nature of the trial and agrees to its provisions and
             has provided either oral during emergency procedure, followed by written informed
             consent, or written informed consent in case of an elective procedure as approved by
             the Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) of the respective investigational site

          3. Patient is eligible, according to heart team decision if applicable, for PCI with
             implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES)

          4. Patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, angina pectoris, myocardial
             infarction, or silent ischemia

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All de-novo lesions and all restenotic lesions (whether native coronary or bypass
             graft), not amenable for treatment with drug eluting balloons

          2. All lesions types are allowed: calcified lesions (lesion preparation with

             or intolerance to aspirin, clopidogrel, Ticagrelor, Prasugrel, heparin/bivalirudin,
             contrast agent (that cannot be adequately premedicated) or component of DES

          5. Female of childbearing potential, who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant

          6. Life expectancy of less than 12 months
