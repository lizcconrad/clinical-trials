    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Eziclen is non-inferior to Fortrans® (the
      reference colonic lavage in Russia) administered in adult subjects scheduled to undergo
      colonoscopy for a routinely accepted diagnostic indication.

               2. Polyp or neoplasm history

               3. Diagnostic procedure for occult bleeding or anaemia

               4. Diarrhoea or constipation of unknown aetiology

               5. IBD if not in severe acute phase

               6. Abnormal ultrasound exam (i.e. mass in abdomen)

               7. Evaluation of barium enema or computed tomography (CT) scan results

          -  In good clinical condition (physical exam and medical history)

          -  Subjects with an adequate fluid balance, and adequate electrolyte balance (measured
             during screening K, Na, Cl, bicarbonate within normal/near normal range)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has abnormal baseline findings, any other medical condition(s) or laboratory findings
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might jeopardise the subject's safety or
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data needed to achieve the objective(s)
             of the study.

          -  Has an advanced carcinoma or any other colon disease leading to excessive mucosal
             fragility.

          -  Has a known or suspected gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction, gastric retention,
             gastroparesis, or disorder of gastric emptying.

             stapling).

          -  Has impaired consciousness predisposing to pulmonary aspiration.

          -  Underwent previous incomplete colonoscopy.

          -  Has a known severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;30
             mL/min/1.73 m2).

             jelly, foam suppository, or film; diaphragm with spermicide; or male condom and
             diaphragm with spermicide), or injectable contraception or an intra-uterine device.
             Nonchildbearing potential is defined as postmenopause for at least one year, surgical
             sterilisation or hysterectomy at least three months before the start of the study.

          -  Has any known hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the preparation
