  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to characterize the effects of high energy radiation on bone
      breakdown, with a specific interest in reducing the rate of sacral fractures. Although
      radiation is very important in managing tumors, it is related to complications such as bone
      fractures. In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine changes in
      blood markers, bone density, and bone structure following radiation and to better understand
      the reason for these changes.

      Participants in the Surgical Arm of the study will be treated according to the schedule
      outlined in protocol for a combined treatment with surgery and adjuvant high dose
      radiotherapy. Patients in the non surgical arm of the the study will be treated according to
      the protocol being treated with radiotherapy alone.

    <description>The standard treatment includes pre-operative radiation of 50.4 Gy, followed by a recovery period of approximately 4 to 5 weeks. Surgery involves removing the malignant tumor in the sacrum in one piece, preferably with a cuff of normal tissue around the tumor. After approximately 6 weeks of recovery, the patient is treated with another 19.8 Gy up to 27 Gy of radiation postoperatively depending on the final margin status (higher for gross residual disease). If the wound is not healed or there is another medical reason to delay adjuvant radiation, then radiation may begin later.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All laboratory tests that are a part of the eligibility criteria must be completed
             within 14 days prior to the date of registration. Diagnostic tests that are a part of
             the eligibility criteria must be performed within 30 days of the date of registration.
             Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible
             to participate in the study:

          -  Study participants must have histologically confirmed primary malignant bone tumor in
             the sacrum for which surgery and radiation or radiation alone are planned.

          -  Age 18 years or older. In children under the age of 8, tetracycline derivatives have
             been reported to stain tooth enamel yellow color. These considerations lead us to
             exclude young persons under the age of 18 from the study.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  Aspartaataminotransferase (AST) (SGOT)/ Alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT) &lt;
                  2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 60
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal
                  limit

          -  The effects of tetracyclines and radiation used in computer tomography on the
             developing human fetus are known to be detrimental. For this reason, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Participants must be able to read and understand English language and have the ability
             to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible
        for admission into the study.

          -  Participants who have had surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy of the sacrum prior
             to entering the study

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to tetracyclines.

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Uncontrolled inter current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements
