Percutaneous antenna will be placed into the target tumor under CT image guidance. Target tumor will be ablated and the antenna will be removed.
Once the ablation procedure was completed, the scheduled surgical tumor resection was performed. Adverse event data was collected starting from the initial administration of anesthesia until conclusion of the first post-operative follow-up visit.</description>

Percutaneous antenna will be placed into the target tumor under CT image guidance. Target tumor will be ablated and the antenna will be removed.
Once the ablation procedure was completed, the scheduled surgical tumor resection was performed. Adverse event data were collected starting from the initial administration of anesthesia until conclusion of the first post-operative follow-up visit.</description>
