  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate if advanced image-analysis of diagnostic scans, can be used
      to predict how aggressive brain tumors (glioblastoma) respond to standard chemo- and
      radiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generally, response prediction models seeks to predict time to an event, e.g.
      time-to-progression and/or overall survival. The aim of this study is to explore the
      feasibility of establishing an individualized response model, that, based on several
      morphologic, physiologic and metabolic parameters extracted from computed tomography (CT),
      positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is able to predict
      the tumor response at the level of an imaging voxel, using machine learning techniques.

      Imaging modalities include MRI, PET/CT with 18F-fluroethyltyrosine (18F-FET), and PET/MRI
      with 64Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM).
