  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, controlled, switching, open-label, parallel cohort study.
      Smoking subjects will be confined to a clinic for 9 days. During their stay, baseline
      assessments during ad libitum smoking will occur for the first 3 days. Following baseline,
      subjects will be switched to either an Electronic Cigarette or Nicotine Gum, and post-product
      switch assessments will occur for 6 days.
