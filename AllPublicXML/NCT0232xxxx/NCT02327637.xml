  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bed rest has been a commonly prescribed intervention for high risk pregnancies, despite the
      lack of data to support its benefits, and increasing evidence pointing to potential harms. In
      this study, the effects of bed rest compared to moderate activity will be on maternal mood
      and muscle strength will be evaluated in patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes
      (PPROM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, bed rest has been considered a beneficial treatment option for patients with
      high risk pregnancies. The definition of bed rest varies between providers, and can mean
      anything from being completely bed-bound for months at a time (sometimes called strict bed
      rest) to walking around within the home a few times a day (sometimes called modified bed
      rest). Recent studies have highlighted potential harmful effects from bed rest. However,
      scientific studies need to be carried out to compare the effects of bed rest and moderate
      activity on the health of mothers and babies.

      PPROM is defined as rupture of membranes prior to 37 weeks gestation prior to the onset of
      labor, and affects approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the Unites States. Women with PPROM
      are routinely managed in the inpatient setting from the time of diagnosis until delivery.
      Therefore, PPROM patients are a closely supervised and easily accessible cohort of women.

      In this study, participating patients with PPROM will be randomized into two groups: bedrest
      or moderate activity. Maternal mood and muscle strength will be assessed at enrollment and
      after delivery to determine whether there are significant differences in these outcomes in
      the two groups.

    <description>Bedrest is a standard recommendation for patients with PPROM. Subjects randomized to this arm of the study will undergo the following:
Receive recommendation for bedrest (standard of care).
Have maternal mood and muscle strength evaluated on enrollment and after delivery (observational study procedure).
Wear a pedometer to measure activity when out of bed (observational study procedure).</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to this arm of the study will undergo the following:
Receive recommendation to ambulate 150 feet, twice per day (interventional study procedure). Prior to each session of ambulation, an ultrasound will be performed to ensure adequate amniotic fluid volume and appropriate fetal position, and a fetal heart rate tracing will be obtained to ensure that there is reassuring fetal status (observational study procedure). During each session of ambulation, the fetal heart rate tracing will be monitored continuously (observational study procedure).
Have maternal mood and muscle strength evaluated on enrollment and after delivery (observational study procedure).
Wear a pedometer to measure activity when out of bed (observational study procedure).</description>
