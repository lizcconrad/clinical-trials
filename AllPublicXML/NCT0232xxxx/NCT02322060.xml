  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators used the newly developed technique i.e. in vitro activation
      of dormant follicles (IVA) to promote ovarian follicle growth much more efficiently than
      natural, in vivo process for women with Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).Firstly, the
      investigators remove one ovary under laparoscopic surgery. Then, we dissect ovarian cortex
      from the ovarian medulla. The ovarian cortex is cut into small cubes and cultured with medium
      containing drugs to activate dormant follicles. After 2 days of culture, the ovarian cubes
      are transplanted mainly beneath the membrane of Fallopian tubes under laparoscopic surgery.
      The ovarian cortex could be cryopreserve for future re-transplantation and in some cases, for
      convenience to arrange second surgery. Once frozen, the ovary can be preserved
      semipermanently. After transplantation, patients receive ultrasound monitoring together with
      measurement of serum hormone levels for 10-12 months. If growing follicles are detected,
      follicle growth is stimulated by injection of hormones (gonadotropins). Using the same &quot;ovum
      pick up&quot; approach used in IVF (in vitro fertilization), we pick up oocytes from the follicles
      and fertilize them. Fertilized eggs are cultured and then cryopreserved for future embryo
      transfer.

      1. Remove one ovary (maybe both ovaries depending on the condition) is performed by
           laparoscopic surgery. (Depending on the condition of patients, the investigators remove
           both ovaries to increase a chance to obtain residual follicles. Also, in some cases, the
           investigators need to perform laparotomy, i.e. open surgery, depending on the patient's
           condition).

        2. Quickly dissect ovarian cortex from the ovarian medulla and cut into small stripes.
           Histological analyses are performed using small parts of the ovarian stripes to find
           residual follicles.

        3. Optional: Cryopreserve the ovarian stripes by a vitrification method. Two days before
           the day of reimplantation, thaw the ovarian stripes.

        4. The ovarian stripes are cut into small cubes (1 x1 mm2). The ovarian cubes are cultured
           with medium containing drugs to activate dormant follicles for 2 days before
           transplantation. After washing, the cubes are transplanted beneath the membrane of both
           Fallopian tubes and the remaining ovary under laparoscopic surgery.

        5. Monitor follicle growth by ultrasound and serum hormone assays. Once follicles reach &gt;16
           mm in diameter, patients receive hCG, followed by egg retrieval in ~36 hours. Then the
           investigators will perform intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using the husband's
           sperm. When embryos reached the four-cell stage, they were cryopreserved, waiting for
           frozen-thaw embryo transfer.

    <description>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; also known as premature ovarian failure/dysfunction/insufficiency or premature menopause) is characterised by amenorrhoea, sex hormone (oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone) deficiency and elevated gonadotrophins levels in a woman aged more than two standard deviations below the mean age of menopause estimated for her reference population. POI is defined as a disorder in ovarian function in any woman before the age of 40 years, irrespective of the cause.
In our study, we mainly recruit POI patients who also desire to have a baby of their own.</description>
