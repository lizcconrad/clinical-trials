      This study is a phase Ib add-on study of the combination of LDE255 to azacitidine in patients
      without marrow response after at least 6 cycles of azacitidine.

    <textblock>
      Dose escalation of LDE255 will be performed over time using a rolling 6 design to determine
      the safety of the combination with azacitidine. The starting dose will be 400 mg. Azacitidine
      will be continued at maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Evaluation will be based on cycle 1
      toxicity profile. Once MTD will be determined, 20 additional patients will be treated at
      recommended dose.

             inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP)isoenzyme 3A4/5 (CYP3A4) or drugs
             metabolized by CYP isoenzyme 2B6 (CYP2B6) or CYP isoenzyme 2C9 (CYP2C9) that have
             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment
             with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued at
             least 7 days and strong CYP3A4/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             treatment with LDE225.

         14. Patients are excluded if the use of warfarin (substrate of CYP2C9) is necessary and
             cannot be substituted since LDE225 is competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9 based on in
             vitro data.

         15. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin laboratory test (&gt; 5 milli-International Unit
             (mIU)/mL).

         16. Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the study
             and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment.

             Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and
             through 6 months after the final dose of study treatment. Highly effective
             contraception is defined as either:

               -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (i.e., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Sterilization: Patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients, the
                  vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient].

               -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                    -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                       intrauterine system (IUS).

                    -  Barrier method of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository.

             Note: Hormonal contraception methods (i.e. oral, injected, implanted) are not allowed
             as it cannot be ruled out that the study drug decreases the effectiveness of hormonal
             contraception.

             Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
             have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
             profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40
             mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
             without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
             when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

             Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
             (i.e., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
             continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
             following the study drug. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in
             order to prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid.

         17. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity.

         18. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.
