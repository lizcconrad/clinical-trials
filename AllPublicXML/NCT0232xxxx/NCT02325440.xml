      A trial in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS)

      Main objectives:

        -  To evaluate changes in the reconstitution of immune surveillance over time upon
           switching from natalizumab to fingolimod assessed by a change in the expression of
           CD49d.

        -  To evaluate changes in the migratory capacity of immune cells/peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon switching from natalizumab to fingolimod in an in-vitro
           model of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB).

        -  To evaluate changes in paraclinical disease activity over time upon switching from
           natalizumab to fingolimod assessed by MRI (changes in Gd+, T2w lesions and DTI).

        -  To evaluate changes in T1w / FLAIR lesions upon switching from natalizumab to
           fingolimod.

      Patients are screened and must sign informed consent at visit 1. At the 2nd visit, all
      patients receive a baseline infusion of Natalizumab, which is followed by an 8 week washout
      Phase. After the washout Phase all patients receive fingolimod for 32 weeks.
