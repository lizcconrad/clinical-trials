      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of misoprostol versus uterine
      straightening by bladder filling for pain relief in menopausal patients undergoing office
      hysteroscopy.

    <textblock>
      Several studies revealed that cervical ripening with misoprostol is effective in reducing
      pain especially in postmenopausal patients. A recent randomized controlled trial revealed
      that uterine striating by bladder filling prior to office hysteroscopy is associated with
      reduced pain perception and easier introduction of hysteroscope through the cervix.

      straightening by bladder filling for pain relief in menopausal patients undergoing office
      hysteroscopy.

    <description>Misoprostol (400µg) will be administered vaginally 12 hours before office hysteroscopy. A rigid 2.9 mm hysteroscope with 30° forward oblique lens and outer sheath diameter of 5 mm will be used in the procedure. The uterine cavity will be distended by warm saline at a pressure between 60-80 mmHg. All the procedures will be performed during the proliferative phase using the vaginoscopic approach as described by Betocchi and Selvaggi in 1997 . All the procedures will be diagnostic.
Pain intensity will be assessed by visual analogue scale during the examination and 30 minutes after the procedure. A visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 will be used (zero indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst possible experienced pain).</description>

    <description>Patients in bladder filling group will be instructed to drink one liter of water and to avoid urination during the one and half hour period before office hysteroscopy procedure..A rigid 2.9 mm hysteroscope with 30° forward oblique lens and outer sheath diameter of 5 mm will be used in the procedure. The uterine cavity will be distended by warm saline at a pressure between 60-80 mmHg. All the procedures will be performed during the proliferative phase using the vaginoscopic approach .
