  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of IBS is very problematic. Despite the wide range of pharmacological and
      non-pharmacological therapies, there is no universally accepted approach. In recent years,
      the low FODMAP diet has been developed, a dietary approach that aims to relieve the symptoms
      of IBS. FODMAPs (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Di-saccharides, Mono-saccharides and Polyols)
      are a group of dietary sugars that may be poorly absorbed in the small intestine and
      fermented by bacteria to produce gas. Ingestion of FODMAPs may also result in alterations in
      fluid content in the colon and trigger functional gut symptoms in some individuals. This
      study aims to examine the effectiveness of the FODMAP diet in Israel in improving symptoms of
      IBS compared to the standard dietary advice.
