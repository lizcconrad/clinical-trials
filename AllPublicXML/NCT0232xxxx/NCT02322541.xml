    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a single 5-day dietary treatment period. Subjects will consume an
      Allium-free diet for 3 days. Alliums are vegetables such as garlic, onions, chives, shallots,
      and leeks. On day 4, subjects will consume a breakfast consisting of garlic and will then
      provide blood and urine samples for 10 hours, and on the following morning.
