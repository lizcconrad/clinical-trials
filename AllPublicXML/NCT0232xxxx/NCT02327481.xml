      The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of 3D Laparoscopic Surgery for
      Gastric Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized comparison of 3D and 2D laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer will
      be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical
      experience for the extensive application of the 3D laparoscopic technique. The evaluation
      parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function
      and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
