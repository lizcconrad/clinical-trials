      A Phase 1/2 multicenter, dose determining, open-label study of ADXS31-142 monotherapy and a
      combination of ADXS31-142 with Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer. Part A will be dose-determining of ADXS31-142
      monotherapy. Part B will be dose-determining of ADXS31-142 and Pembrolizumad (MK-3475) in
      combination. Part B expansion will treat additional patients with the recommended dose from
      Part B.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1, multicenter, non-randomized,
      dose-determining trial of ADX31-142 monotherapy in subjects with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The dose determining phase is intended to
      select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for Part B.

      Part B of the study will be an open-label, Phase 1-2, multicenter, non-randomized
      dose-determining trial of ADXS31-142 in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in subjects
      with mCRPC. Part B will consist of a dose-determination phase followed by an expansion cohort
      phase. The dose-determining phase is intended to select a RP2D for the combination.

      Dose escalation/de-escalation for this study will be explored by applying the mTPI design.

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

          2. Be 18 years of age or older on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Have progressive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, on androgen
             deprivation therapy, based on as least one of the following criteria:

               1. PSA progression defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in
                  the absolute value of at least 2 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level
                  with a minimum of a 1 week interval with a minimum PSA of 2 ng/ml.

               2. Progression of bi-dimensionally measurable soft tissue (nodal metastasis)
