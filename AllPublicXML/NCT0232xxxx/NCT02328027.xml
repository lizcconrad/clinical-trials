    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are:

      Primary objective:

      - To determine the safety and tolerability of medical imaging with 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry of
           99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128

        -  To demonstrate the time-dependant distribution and localization of 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128
           both in RA and AS patients

        -  To determine ability of early imaging with 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 to evaluate the
           presence of lesions before and after short term treatment of either RA or AS patients.

      Study hypothesis:

      99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 could be used as an adjunct for the diagnosis of early stage rheumatoid
      arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and for the assessment of response to treatment of these
      diseases.

    <description>Dosimetry outcome will be based upon the two following endpoints measured thanks to the medical images obtained (plannar and SPET/CT), and calculated following the MIRD committee guidelines :
Radiation dose to the organ of interests (particularly the kidneys)
Effective dose The images will be performed at the mentioned time-points for the first 3 patients who will take part in the dosimetry and pharmacocinetic sub-study. Depending upon the results in those 3 patients, time-points will be confirmed or modified with assessments at T+ 3hrs (instead of T+2 hrs) and T + 6 hrs (instead of T+4 hrs) in the next 7 enrolled patients in the sub-study.</description>
