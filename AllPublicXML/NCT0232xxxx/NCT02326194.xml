  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since its first outbreak occurred in 1976, Zaire Ebola virus have been associated with 14
      outbreaks reported up to 2014. The Zaire Ebola virus in 2014 causing the most serious
      outbreak was considered to be a new epidemic strain, with GP homology of the gene was only
      97.6%, compared to the GP gene of the strain in 1976. This investigational Ad5-EBOV vaccine
      was developed according to the 2014 epidemic Zaire strain and formulated as freeze-dry
      products which could be stored at 4â„ƒ.

      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo control, dose-escalation phase 1 clinical
      trial. This study will determine the safety and side-effect profile, and immunogenicity of an
      investigational Ad5-EBOV vaccine.
