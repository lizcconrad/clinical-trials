  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The age-related increase in falls is strongly associated with a decline in muscle strength by
      the mechanism of sarcopenia. There has been great interest in developing approaches to
      counteract the effects of sarcopenia, and thereby reduce the age-related decline in muscle
      mass with vitamin D that have muscular effect. However, a limited number of studies
      demonstrate a vitamin D analog (alfacalcidol) increase in lower body muscle strength in
      adults with vitamin D deficiency. A double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted
      in order to determine the effect of alfacalcidol on the upper-body muscle strength in
      Indonesian elderly women in age group of 60 or more who had low handgrip strength.

      A total 122 elderly women were enrolled to this study. It was determined subjects with
      handgrip strength less than 22 kg and measured using handheld dynamometer. There were 95
      subjects fulfilled the eligible criteria. These subjects were randomized into two groups, one
      group of 47 subjects received alfacalcidol 0.5 mcg/day and the other group received placebo.
      Each subject was given calcium 500 mg/day. After 12 weeks of intervention, 88 subjects had
      the second muscle strength measurement (7 dropped out).
