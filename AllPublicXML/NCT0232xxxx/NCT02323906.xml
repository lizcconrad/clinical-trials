      CC-122-HCC-001 is a Phase 1b dose escalation and expansion clinical study of CC-122 in
      combination with sorafenib for subjects with unresectable HCC who have received no prior
      systemic therapy for HCC. The dose escalation phase of the study will explore several dose
      levels of CC-122 in combination with sorafenib, followed by an expansion part of the study
      using the optimal combination dose regimen.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of CC-122
      administered orally in combination with sorafenib, and to define the non-tolerated dose
      (NTD), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      The secondary objective of the study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of CC-122 in
      combination with sorafenib, based on response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST
      1.1)
