    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN
      0702 protocol (NCT01109004), &quot;A Trial of Single Autologous Transplant with or without
      Consolidation Therapy versus Tandem Autologous Transplant with Lenalidomide Maintenance for
      Patients with Multiple Myeloma&quot;. It is hypothesized that use of novel anti-myeloma agents
      will improve long-term progression-free survival (PFS) after high-dose melphalan followed by
      autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as compared to a second autologous
      transplantation.

      This study is designed to compare long-term outcomes among patients randomized on the BMT CTN
      0702 protocol (NCT01109004). All patients who consent will be followed for death,
      progression, Second Primary Malignancies (SPMs), and Quality of Life (QOL). Patients who do
      not consent to the long-term follow-up mechanism or who have experienced progression on the
      BMT CTN 0702 study will be followed through the standard Center for International Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) long-term follow-up mechanism. Additionally, patients who
      are eligible and are willing to continue with lenalidomide as maintenance therapy will be
      provided lenalidomide free of charge. These patients will continue to receive lenalidomide as
      maintenance therapy until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or
      withdrawal from the study. The endpoints assessed will include progression-free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), incidence of second primary
      malignancies (SPM) and health quality of life (QOL).

    <description>The primary analysis will include all randomized subjects from the BMT CTN 0702 protocol, classified according to their randomized treatment allocation, irrespective of treatment actually received [intent-to-treat]. The time to this event is the time from randomization on the BMT CTN 0702 protocol to progression, initiation of non-protocol anti-myeloma therapy, or death from any cause. Patients will be censored at loss to follow-up or end of 2018, whichever comes first. Deaths without progression are treated as failures no matter when they occur. The analysis will be conducted once all living patients have been followed for 5-years post randomization on the BMT CTN 0702 protocol.</description>

The duration of maintenance was three years in all treatment arms. Lenalidomide will be administered initially at the patient's last documented dose prior to discontinuation of BMT CTN 0702 lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Cycle duration is 28 days. Patients will continue lenalidomide until disease progression, or discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or withdrawal from the study.</description>
