    <description>CZP 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, 4, followed by CZP 200 mg every two weeks (Q2W) from Week 6 to Week 14.
Treatment received from Week 16-48 is based on initial treatment and response to treatment:
PASI50 responders at Week 16 continue to receive CZP 200 mg Q2W.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 16 will be removed from blinded study medication and escape to unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W. Subjects who receive unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W for 16 weeks and do not achieve a PASI50 response will be withdrawn from the study.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 32 or a later time point will be withdrawn from the study.
Subjects who complete the Maintenance Period (with PASI50 response at Week 48) enter the Open-label Extension Period on CZP 200 mg Q2W.
Week 48 completers in the escape arm continue to receive CZP 400 mg Q2W or may switch to CZP 200 mg Q2W.
Depending on PASI50 or PASI75 responses at Week 60 or a later time point, subjects may switch to CZP 400 mg Q2W or withdraw from the study.</description>

PASI50 non-responders at Week 32 or a later time point will be withdrawn from the study.
Subjects who complete the Maintenance Period (with PASI50 response at Week 48) enter the Open-label Extension (OLE) Period on CZP 200 mg Q2W. Week 48 completers in the escape arm continue to receive CZP 400 mg Q2W or may switch to CZP 200 mg Q2W.
Subjects who achieve a PASI75 response during the OLE Phase may switch to CZP 200 mg Q2W.</description>

Treatment received from Week 16 - 48 is based on initial treatment and response to treatment:
PASI50 responders at Week 16, who do not achieve a PASI75 response at Week 16 receive CZP 400 mg at Weeks 16, 18 and 20 (loading doses) followed by CZP 200 mg Q2W starting at Week 22.
PASI75 responders at Week 16 continue to receive Placebo.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 16 will be removed from blinded study medication and escape to CZP 400 mg Q2W. Subjects who receive unblinded CZP 400 mg Q2W for 16 weeks and do not achieve a PASI50 response will be withdrawn from the study.
PASI50 non-responders at Week 32 or a later time point will be withdrawn from the study.
Subjects who complete the Maintenance Period (with PASI50 response at Week 48) enter the Open-label Extension Period on CZP 200 mg Q2W. Week 48 completers in the escape arm continue to receive CZP 400 mg Q2W or may switch to CZP 200 mg Q2W.</description>
