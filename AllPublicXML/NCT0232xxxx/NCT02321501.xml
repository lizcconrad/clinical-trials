    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of ceritinib
      (LDK378) and everolimus that can be given to patients with NSCLC or head and neck cancer. The
      safety of the drug combination will also be tested.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to part in this study, the dose of LDK378 you receive will
      depend on when you join this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest
      dose level of LDK 378 and everolimus. Each new group will receive either higher dose of LDK
      378 or a higher dose of everolimus than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of LDK 378 and everolimus is
      found.

      Once the high tolerable dose is found, up to 30 participants will receive the drug at this
      dose level.

      You will take 2 to 4 capsules (depending on the dose) of LDK 378 by mouth 1 time each day for
      each 28-day study cycle.

      LDK 378 should be taken in the morning right after (within 30 minutes) a low-fat meal (about
      1.5 to 9 grams of fat [no more than 15 grams] and about 100 to 330 total calories [no more
      than 500 total calories]). You should swallow the capsule whole with a cup of water (about 8
      ounces) over as short a time as possible (not slower than 1 capsule every 2 minutes). Do not
      chew or open the capsules.

      If you vomit or miss a dose, do not take another dose to make it up. That day's dose should
      be skipped, and you should take your next dose on the following day.

      You will take 1 or 2 capsules of everolimus (depending on the dose) tablets by mouth 1 time
      each day for each 28-day cycle. Everolimus should be taken at about the same time every day
      with a glass of water, either consistently with or without food

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a check of your blood oxygen level.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your cholesterol
           levels. You must fast for at least 12 hours before the draw.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons at each draw) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) and
           biomarker testing before your dose of LDK378 and then 6 more times over the next 24
           hours after the dose. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at
           different time points.

      On Days 8, 15, and 21 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your cholesterol
           levels. You must fast for at least 12 hours before the draw.

        -  On Days 15 and 21 only, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and biomarker
           testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a check of your blood oxygen level.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your cholesterol
           levels. You must fast for at least 12 hours before the draw.

        -  You will have an EKG before you take the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons at each draw) will be drawn for PK testing before and 6 more
           times between 1-24 hours after your dose of study drugs.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a check of your blood oxygen level.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your cholesterol
           levels. You must fast for at least 12 hours before the draw.

        -  You will have an EKG before you take the study drug.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and biomarker testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3 and every other cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7 and so on), you will have
      a CT scan or MRI of your chest, abdomen, and brain to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 4 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a check of your blood oxygen level.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your cholesterol
           levels. You must fast for at least 12 hours before the draw.

        -  You will have an EKG before you take the study drug.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      If at any time the disease appears to get worse while you are on study, you will have an FNA
      or core biopsy for biomarker testing.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have extra EKGs.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 28 days of your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a check of your blood oxygen level.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your cholesterol
           levels. You must fast for at least 12 hours before the draw.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK and biomarker testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      This is an investigational study. LDK 378 is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic lung cancer
      (NSCLC) who have progressed on or intolerant to crizotinib.

      Everolimus is also FDA approved or commercially available for the treatment of advanced
      hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, advanced neuroendocrine tumors of
      pancreatic origin (PNET), advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), renal angiomyolipoma and
      tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) with
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).

      The combination of the drugs is being used for research purposes only.

      Up to 66 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

         14. Patients who have a history of another primary malignancy unless the patient has been
             disease free for &gt;/= 3 years;

         15. Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study;

         16. Patients who are currently part of or have participated in any clinical investigation
             with an investigational drug within 1 month prior to dosing (except ALK inhibitors);

         17. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

         18. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable
             of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Highly
             effective contraception methods include: a. Total abstinence (when this is in line
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
             calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not
             acceptable methods of contraception. b. Female sterilization (have had surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six
             weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
             assessment. Exclusion criteria continued in #19.

         19. Exclusion criteria #18 continued: c. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to
             screening)with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in
             the ejaculate. For female subjects on the study the vasectomized male partner should
             be the sole partner for that subject. d. Combination of any two of the following (i+ii
             or i+iii or ii+iii): i. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
             contraception or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy
             (failure rate &lt; 1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
             contraception. ii. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
             (IUS). iii. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
             cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.
             Exclusion criteria continued in #20.

         20. Exclusion criteria # 18 continued from #19: In case of use of oral contraception,
             women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking
             study treatment. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing
             potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
             appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or
             have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
             ligation at least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
             only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         21. Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 3 months after the last dose of study treatment. Male patients for 3 months
             should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by
             vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid. Also male
             patients whose sexual partner(s) are WOCBP who are not willing to use adequate
             contraception during the study and for 3 months after the end of enrollment
