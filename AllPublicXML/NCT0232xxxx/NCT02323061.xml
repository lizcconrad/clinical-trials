      A BCI system for stroke subjects will be designed in an attempt to train the motor-related
      areas in their brains responsible for hand open/close function. A robot hand will be used and
      controlled by the system in real time based on EEG pattern for identification of motion
      intention for hand movements in the motor cortex. A randomized controlled trial study design
      will be adopted. All subjects will be assessed by clinical assessments including FMA and
      neuroimaging assessments using multimodal MR techniques before and after the training to
      evaluate training effectiveness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions, as well as understand the content
             and purpose of the experiment;

          2. Subcortical ischemic lesion within the territory of the middle cerebral artery;

             Fugl-Meter Assessment (FMA), Modified Ashworth Score of fingers (MAS), and Action
             Research Arm Test(ARAT)).

          4. Hemiparesis resulting from a single unilateral lesion of the brain with onset at least
             6 months before data collection.

          2. Visual field deficits;

          3. Aphasia, neglect, and apraxia,

          4. Participation in any therapeutic treatment (&quot;outside therapy&quot;) performed with the
             paralyzed arm during the planned study - including baseline and follow up.
