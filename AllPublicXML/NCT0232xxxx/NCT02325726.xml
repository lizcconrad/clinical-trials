  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative acute renal failure is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery. The
      current practice cannot predict Acute Kidney Injuries (AKI) early enough to reduce a
      significant kidney assault and prevent an organic dysfunction leading to cortical tubular
      necrosis.

      Several recent studies in cardiac surgery have shown that, both sonographic criteria, such as
      the Renal Resistive Index (IRR) and urinary biomarkers can predict AKI promptly. These
      urinary biomarkers are the 'tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases' (TIMP-2) and the
      'insulin-like growth factor binding protein' (IGFBP7). These two proteins are sought
      noninvasively, directly in the urine, within the same test called 'NephroCheckTM'. These
      markers, ultrasonographic and biologic, have the advantage of being easy to perform,
      accessible and seem to have both high sensitivity and specificity to predict AKI promptly
      after cardiac surgery. Thus, the IRR and the NephroCheckTM test could become essential tests
      to guide clinicians in determining rapidly whether a patient will develop AKI. However, so
      far, no study has compared these markers yet.

      Therefore, the aim of this prospective observational study will be to compare the
      effectiveness of the IRR with the NephroCheckTM to predict AKI promptly after cardiac
      surgery. The secondary outcome will be to determine the threshold of these markers from which
      patients will be likely to develop AKI
