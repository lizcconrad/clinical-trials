      This study is a multi-center, randomized, prospective, open-label Phase III Clinical trial to
      assess the efficacy and safety of combination and sequential treatment with Y peginterferon
      Alfa-2b,entecavir and GMCSF in chronic hepatitis B patients nucleotides or nucleosides
      experienced. Patients were randomized to one of 3 groups to receive different antiviral
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been pretreated with and responded to one or two nucleotides or nucleosides
      for at least one year, with HBV (Hepatitis B Virus) DNA less than 1000 copies/ml and HBsAg
      less 3000 IU/ml were randomized to one of 3 groups, to receive Y peginterferon Alfa-2b
      180mcg/week for 96 weeks, entecavir 0.5 mg po daily for 48 weeks plus GMCSF
      (Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) for 48 weeks, or Y peginterferon Alfa-2b
      180mcg/week for 96 weeks and entecavir 0.5 mg po daily for 48 weeks, or only ETV for 96
      weeks.
