    <textblock>
      The investigators of the current study aimed to evaluate the effect of spinal anesthesia with
      low dose bupivacaine combined with femoral blockade on duration of anesthesia and time of
      first analgesic requirement during postoperative period

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients undergoing arthroscopic meniscus repair were included to the current study.

      The patients were allocated to two groups as the spinal anesthesia with conventional dose of
      heavy bupivacaine or spinal anesthesia with low dose heavy bupivacaine combined with femoral
      blockade.

      Blood pressures and heart rates were recorded at the beginning, at the 0th minute following
      femoral block, at the 0th minute and in two-minute intervals following spinal anesthesia for
      20 minutes and in five-minute intervals till the end of surgery.

      The sensorial block and motor block in both extremities were recorded in two-minute intervals
      following spinal anesthesia and in five-minute intervals till the end of surgery The time of
      sensorial blockade to reach T12, maximum level of sensorial blockade level and the time to
      reach maximum level of sensorial blockade and the time for regression of sensorial blockade
      to L2, the time for regression of motor blockade were recorded.

    <description>Ultrasound-guided femoral blockade with 15 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% diluted in 15 mL saline was performed in supine position. Then the patient was turned to lateral decubitus position with the operated extremity on dependant position and intrathecal injection of heavy bupivacaine 1 mL (5 mg) was administered from L3-L4 intervertebral space at a rate of 1 mL/20 second.</description>
