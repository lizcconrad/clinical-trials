  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 3-month face-to-face Partners in Care intervention will be community-based and
      community-led by trained community peer educators from these four partnering community
      organizations. The intervention involves 12 weekly, group lessons with each lesson lasting
      about 1 and 1/2 hours. Individuals with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; average blood sugar levels)
      greater than or equal to 7% will be recruited for the study because they represent the most
      at-risk for diabetes-related complications. Over a 3-year accrual period, the community
      partners will recruit and enroll 150 eligible NHs and PPs, as well as deliver and evaluate
      the intervention in their respective community settings. The primary outcomes of our study
      are hemoglobin A1c and self-reported diabetes specific quality of life. Secondary outcomes
      are cholesterol levels (including HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, and triglycerides), blood
      pressure, body mass index, and psychosocial adaptation.

    <description>The diabetes self-management intervention is titled, &quot;Partners in Care,&quot; emphasizing that there are many individuals and groups that one can call upon to assist with managing one's diabetes. The content includes practical behavioral strategies to improve diabetes self-management practices. The 12 week curriculum provides a basic overview of diabetes and self-management activities, standards of care recommended by the American Diabetes Association, strategies to improve patient-provider communication, support needed for diabetes self-management, information about diabetes medications, and ways to avoid diabetes-related complications.</description>
