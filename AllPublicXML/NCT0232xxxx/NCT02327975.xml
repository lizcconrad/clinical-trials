  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is a health problem that affects people worldwide and has been identified
      as the fourth largest risk factor for overall mortality (contributing to 6% of deaths
      globally). Many researchers have tried to increase physical activity (PA) levels through
      traditional methods without much success. Thus, many researchers are turning to mobile
      technology as an emerging method for changing health behaviours.The study consists of a
      physical activity intervention through a mobile application in elderly. The study is a 3x2
      model, in which the sample is distributed in three study groups (over 53 years) and were
      evaluated at 10 weeks from baseline.

      Objectives of the study:

        -  Evaluate effectiveness of a physical exercise program for 10 weeks to improve fitness,
           cardiovascular, anthropometric and body composition parameters in people over 53 years.

        -  Examine effects of exercise intervention delivered through a mobile application
           (WhatsApp) on fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric and body composition
           in people over 53 years.

      Hypotheses of the study:

        -  An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective
           in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in people over 53 years.

        -  An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective
           to increase physical fitness in people over 53 years.

        -  An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective
           in reducing BMI, percent body fat; and in increasing the percentage of muscle mass in
           people over 53 years.

        -  10-weeks face-to-face intervention of physical exercise obtains greater improvements in
           fitness parameters than an intervention delivered via mobile application in people over
           53 years.

        -  10-weeks face-to-face intervention of physical exercise obtains greater improvements in
           anthropometric and body composition than an intervention delivered via mobile
           application in people over 53 years.

    <description>Participants in this group received twice-weekly non-consecutive sessions of physical exercise for 10 weeks. Each session lasted approximately 60-70 minutes. Exercise program consisted of strength training and aerobic exercise. Each session began with a warm low intensity (10 min), then the main part of the session (25 min) and aerobic training and recovery period (25-35 min) was performed. The equipment used during the procedure was the Thera-Band elastic band.</description>

    <description>Intervention content was the same in both intervention arms; only the delivery mode differed. Participants in this group received two podcast (digital multimedia file available for download in a media player) per week for 10 weeks of the intervention, each podcast lasted about 5 min. Participants in this group received a weekly message with the aim of fostering motivation toward physical activity. Subjects in this group performed two sessions per week on non-consecutive days, the days could be chosen by the participants themselves.</description>

    <description>The main part of the session included a whole-body strength training, which incorporated chest press, shoulder press, lateral pull-down, seated row, shoulder flexion, chest pulley, hammer curl, biceps curl, triceps curl, triceps pushdown, leg extension, leg curl, lunge, squat, abdominal crunch. To control and equate the intensity between the TG and MG, a method based on the combined use of the prescribed number of repetitions and the OMNI Resistance Scale for the active muscles was used. Previous studies have described the method used for controlling exercise intensity (Colado et al., 2012; Colado et al., 2014).
During 1-3 weeks subjects performed 25 min of exercise at 60% maximum heart rate (HRmax), during weeks 4-6 subjects performed 30 min of exercise at 70% HRmax and during weeks 7-10 subjects performed 35 min of exercise at 80% HRmax.</description>
