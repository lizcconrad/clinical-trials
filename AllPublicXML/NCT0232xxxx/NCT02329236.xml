      The aim of the our study is to investigate whether there is an increased incidence of ADHD (
      based on self reports and questionnaires) among children with short stature due to
      constitutional growth delay (CGD) in comparison with children with Familial short stature.

      Filling out the study questionnaire by ADHD diagnosed and suspected children (have a positive
      DBDRS (Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale Questionnaire) result) who were referred to
      the pediatric endocrine clinic of our hospital for short statue evaluation. The study
      questionnaire will be filled by child's guardian.

      The study and the DBDRS questionnaires will be filled only after obtaining an informed
      consent.

      The required data including growth statistics, age at puberty, bone age and other relevant
      data will be collected from the child's medical records.

      The data on patients will be processed anonymously.
