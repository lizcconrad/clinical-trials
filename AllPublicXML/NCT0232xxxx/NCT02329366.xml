      This project aims to result in the identification of such markers, and the development of a
      feasible quantitative method of distinguishing between tissue that has the capacity to heal
      and tissue that does not, thus identifying a non-healing phenotype.

      The goal of this project is to identify objective, quantitative biological and molecular
      markers that correlate with healing outcomes for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) using debrided
      tissue of patients with wounds. This project aims to result in the identification of such
      markers, and the development of a feasible quantitative method of distinguishing between
      tissue that has the capacity to heal and tissue that does not, thus identifying a non-healing
      phenotype. The ability to differentiate between healing and non-healing tissue at the onset
      of wound care will allow for the use of targeted therapies and earlier initiation of
      aggressive treatments where indicated.
