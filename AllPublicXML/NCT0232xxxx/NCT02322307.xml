  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HealthPROMISE is a mobile application (app) for patients that allows regular tracking of
      symptoms by patients and communicates them to physicians. The purpose of this randomized
      controlled trial is to determine the impact of the HealthPROMISE application on improving
      patient outcomes. The trial will look at how much patients use the application, whether
      physicians change treatment in response to new information from patients, and how the
      patients quality of life change over the span of the study. The investigators hypothesize
      that HealthPROMISE will enhance physician-patient communication and improve clinical
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will prospectively enroll about 300 patients with Crohn's Disease or Ulcerative
      Colitis presenting at the Mount Sinai Health System.

      Eligible participants who complete the informed consent will fill a Tablet or Web-based
      questionnaire at the end of which they will be given a pin and offered to download the
      HealthPROMISE app or an education app. Patients who download HealthPROMISE app will then be
      requested to provide updates on quality metrics, a quality of life questionnaire, and
      emergency visits and hospitalizations.

      Data will be collected continuously throughout the study using the mobile health app. Study
      endpoints will primarily be assessed using &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis. Additionally, per
      protocol analysis of data will be performed for patients who have logged into the application
      at least 4 times in 12 months. The total study duration will be 2 years (104 weeks). At 1
      year (52 weeks), an interim analysis will be done to determine if study needs to be continued
      for full 104 weeks. Furthermore, patients in either arm who login using PIN but not
      completing week 52 (or week 104) exit survey will be considered as &quot;lost to follow up&quot;.

    <description>The EuroQol (EQ)-5D questionnaire is a simple, generic instrument used to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL). In a health profile, respondents describe their current health state in 5 dimensions (EQ-5D descriptive system): mobility, self-care, usual-activities (UA), pain/discomfort (P/D), and anxiety/depression (A/D). Problems in these dimensions are classified as none (score = 1), moderate (score = 2), or extreme (score = 3).</description>

    <description>These are patients who will receive HealthPROMISE application. Patients will be asked to track their quality of life and quality of care using standardized metrics. A combination of different questionnaires (i.e. Short IBD Questionnaire), symptom updates, and IBD quality indicators will be the collected during this study through the HealthPROMISE application.</description>

    <description>After entering baseline questionnaire, control patients get a link to download education application along with PIN. Once patients install app on their devices and use the PIN, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial from intention to treat perspective. This control app allows access to patient education content only. There is not any direct feedback on Quality of Life, quality of care and resource utilization.</description>

    <intervention_name>HealthPROMISE users</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients using HealthPROMISE will be asked to use the application once every two weeks at a minimum to provide updates on health information. Providers can use the data entered by patients in real time. Patients will get alerts requesting them to contact their providers if their quality of life scores fall below a certain threshold or their symptoms scores are worrisome. Both patients and physicians are also sent regular notifications with data about their own health or health of their patient panel respectively. Both patients and providers are encouraged to use existing communication tools (phone, office visits, personal health records) since direct patient-physician messaging is not provided in the HealthPROMISE platform. Reminders through app, email and SMS will be used to facilitate patient engagement.
Physicians will also be encouraged to check the physician panel to see how patients are doing through weekly updates and monthly quality improvement meetings.</description>
