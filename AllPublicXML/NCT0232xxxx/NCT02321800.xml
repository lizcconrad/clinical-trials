      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous S 649266
      versus intravenous imipenem/cilastatin in hospitalized adults with complicated urinary tract
      infections with or without pyelonephritis or acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis caused by
      Gram-negative pathogens.

             identified uropathogen which is non-susceptible to the empiric treatment and is a
             Gram-negative uropathogen likely to be susceptible to IPM

          -  Subjects receiving antibiotic prophylaxis for UTI who present with signs and symptoms
             consistent with an active new UTI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Urine culture identifies only a Gram-positive pathogen and/or a Gram-negative
             uropathogen resistant to IPM

          -  Urine culture at study entry isolates more than 2 uropathogens or patient has a
             confirmed fungal UTI

          -  Asymptomatic bacteriuria, the presence of &gt;10^5 CFU/mL of a uropathogen and pyuria but
             without local or systemic symptoms
