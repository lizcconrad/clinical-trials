  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to determine if this new technique will detect and identify bacteria in
      the blood sooner than standard blood cultures or identify patients who may be septic without
      growing bacteria in their cultures. These will be correlated with the data collected from
      medical records on presumed sepsis. These results will be linked to data concerning infection
      that will be available as part of routine care including blood counts and other laboratory
      values that would be part of the routine medical care such as a white blood cell count. The
      earlier the bacteria are identified and the appropriate antimicrobials are administered the
      better the patient outcome.

      This study will involve additional blood samples to be taken during the routine clinical
      blood draw, while the subject is being treated for their burn/wounds. The additional research
      samples will be examined for bacteria. A second blood draw will be performed at approximately
      24 hours of initial blood collection. The blood is being collected and then correlate with
      results of routine medical care blood cultures and clinical status of the subject (diagnosis
      of sepsis, hemodynamic instability). Data that will be abstracted from the current electronic
      medical record includes whether there is any type of catheter indwelling (brand name and
      type), insertion methods including place of insertion (Intensive Care Unit, Operating Room,
      Emergency Department), adherence to bundle, complications during insertion, colonization of
      the subject with bacteria (MRSA), and culture results obtained as part of clinical care.
      Demographics (subject's age) and diagnoses will also be captured as some studies have shown a
      higher risk of infection with certain processes (burns) and percentage of burn.
