      Choroidal thickness represents blood-flowing of eyes. The investigators detect the choroidal
      thickness of the young participant using SD-OCT to see the effect of Resveratrol Based
      Nutritional Supplement on Choroidal Thickness.

      34 young, healthy participants were included in this study; They were randomly divided into
      two groups by age and gender matched.100 mg Longevinex® capsule was given to the study group
      and 100mg placebo capsule to the control group. All participants underwent OCT scanning with
      spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at baseline and 1 h following Longevinex®
      or placebo administration. The choroidal thickness was measured manually by the Heidelberg
      Eye explore software(version 5.3.3.0, Heidelberg Engineering) with a vertical line to the
      retinal pigment epithelial layer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 23-28 years of age. nonsmokers.

          2. Patients were considered to be healthy on the basis of electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             clinical laboratory safety tests (haematology, plasma biochemistry, urinalysis and
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV serology) performed at screening.

          3. Avoid ingesting grapefruit, grapefruit juice or other grapefruit juice containing
             products, and any herbal-based nutrient supplement or prescribed medications(
             grapefruit, cranberry, blueberry products, peanuts and peanut butter, grape and grape
             products, and red wine ) during the same period of time.

          4. patients should abstain from alcohol-containing beverages at least two days prior to
             and during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled Blood pressure exceeding diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg (sitting) during
             the screening period and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          2. Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial Renal failure
             requiring dialysis or renal transplant or liver dysfunction History of other
             disease,or other findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use an investigational drug, might affect interpretation of the
             results of the study, or render the subject at high risk from treatment complications.

          3. IOP over 30 mmHg.

          4. Any previous retinal laser photocoagulation to the study eye in treatment naive. Any
             previous intravitreal injection in study eye (triamcinolone or other) in treatment
             naive.

          5. Any previous vitrectomy in study eye (posterior or anterior associated with vitreous
             loss in cataract surgery).

          6. Intracapsular cataract extraction (posterior capsule needs to be present).

          7. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye, Structural damage to the
             center of the macula in the study eye preexisting to CRVO likely to preclude
             improvement in visual acuity following the resolution of macular edema, including
             atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, subretinal fibrosis, laser scar(s).
