    <textblock>
      The purpose of this First-in-Human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability after
      single ascending oral doses of GLPG1837 given to healthy subjects, compared to placebo. Also,
      the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending oral doses of GLPG1837 given to healthy
      subjects daily for 14 days compared to placebo, will be evaluated.

      Furthermore, during the course of the study after single and multiple oral dose
      administrations, the amount of GLPG1837 and its metabolite present in the blood and urine
      (pharmacokinetics) will be characterized.

      The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of GLPG1837 and its metabolite will also be
      evaluated.

      The potential of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 induction after repeated dosing with GLPG1837 will
      be explored as well.
