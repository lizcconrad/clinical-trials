  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is is to assess the safety and tolerability of curcumin in
      combination with EGFR-TKIs in selected patients with advanced non-resectable mutant EGFR
      NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open prospective cohort study to assess the safety and feasibility of using
      curcumin in conjunction with an EGFR-TKI in patients with advanced NSCLC. The investigators
      will use an enhanced bioavailable formulation of curcumin (CURCUViva TM at 80 mg/ 1 capsule
      per day) approved and licensed by Health Canada (NPN 80027414) that has been shown to have
      2-3 times higher curcumin concentration in the blood as compared to previous clinical trials.
      As primary objective, the investigators will recruit 20 patients for a duration of 8 weeks to
      monitor adverse effects according to the the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria.Exploratory objectives would include assessing changes in health-related quality of
      life using the standardized FACT-L questionnaire and evaluating anti-inflammatory properties
      of curcumin by measuring CRP. If tolerable safety data is obtained, an expanded phase II
      trial will be designed.

    <description>CurcuVIVA™ (NPN 80027414) at a single dose of 80 mg PO daily without any dose escalation to be taken in conjunction with an EGFR-TKI therapy.
CurcuVIVA™ is given in capsule forms. Unit strength of CurcuVIVA™ is equal to Turmeric Extract 25:1 348 mg (containing 80mg Longvida® Optimized Curcumin)
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors:
Gefitinib is a targeted therapy, given in a capsule form once daily. The daily dose is 250 mg .
Erlotinib is a targeted therapy, given in a capsule form once daily. The daily dose is 150 mg .
Study intervention is 8 weeks, following which the patients will continue taking their EGFR-TKI without curcumin until progression. The side effects of curcumin will be followed for another 8 weeks from the date of stopping curcumin.</description>
