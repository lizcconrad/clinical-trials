    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of daily sacral root magnetic stimulation
      for 10 sessions in patients with nocturnal enuresis.Eligible patients were randomized to
      receive either real or sham repetitive sacral root magnetic stimulation (rSMS; 15 Hz with a
      total of 1500 pulses/session) for 10 sessions. Evaluation was performed before starting
      treatment, immediately after the 5th and 10th treatment session, and 1 month later, using
      frequency of enuresis/week, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Quality of life. Cortical
      excitability of upper and lower limbs were done before and after the end of sessions.

    <description>The real group received biphasic rSMS using a Magstim Super Rapid (Magstim, Whitland, UK) stimulator connected to a 120-mm outer diameter figure-of-8 air film cooling coil positioned in the midline over the sacral vertebrae (approximately 5 cm above the natal cleft, which approximates to the level of S2). Stimulation was delivered at 15 Hz at 50% of maximum stimulator output (10 seconds on and 30 seconds off) with a total of 1500 pulses and the hand of the coil upward. The stimulation was repeated for 10 sessions, 5 sessions per week and 2 days off.</description>
