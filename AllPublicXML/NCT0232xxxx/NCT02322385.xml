  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disease. We plan DNA
      analysis using the next generation sequencer (NGS) and examine the relationship between
      mutational types and clinical phenotypes. The accuracy of DNA analysis with NGS is tested by
      Sanger's method. The kidney and life survival curves will be compared between PKD1, PKD2 and
      non-ADPKD family members.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      80 unrelated patients with ADPKD attending to the Kyorin University Hospital whose clinical
      data are compiled. DNA analysis is performed at Otsuka Pharmaceutical Laboratory.

      Clinical data include total kidney volume (TKV), TKV slope, eGFR, eGFR slope and other
      clinically relevant data.
