    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for this study include those with decompensated liver cirrhosis with a
      Child-Pugh score ≥7 (Child-Pugh B) in whom further improvement with current medical treatment
      is not expected. Other inclusion criteria are age 20 to 75 years and a serum total bilirubin
      of 3.0 to 5.0 mg/dL, or if the total bilirubin is &lt;3.0 mg/dL, patients who are still deemed
      unsuitable as a candidate for general anesthesia. About 30 mL of autologous bone marrow was
      collected from the bilateral iliac crests under local anesthesia, heparin was added after
      collection. In addition, at the Center for Regenerative and Cell Therapy at Yamaguchi
      University Hospital, a nucleated cell fraction was prepared. Next, a cell suspension was
      prepared by adding culture medium, and this was inoculated into a culture flask. After
      subculturing for 3 weeks, the cells were infused through a peripheral vein. The primary
      endpoint is the incidence of adverse events up to 24 weeks after ABMSC infusion.
