  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose effect of Phenylephrine
      Hydrochloride Injection on the treatment of clinically relevant decreased blood pressure in
      the pediatric population, ≥12 to 16 year old patients undergoing general and neuraxial
      anesthesia.

      The secondary objectives are to describe changes in blood pressure and heart rate, time to
      onset and to maximal response, and the duration of response; to assess the safety of the
      product in this population; and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of phenylephrine
      hydrochloride.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4 multi-center, randomized open-label study in 100 subjects aged ≥12 to 16
      years who experience a decrease in blood pressure during a procedure requiring general or
      neuraxial anesthesia. At least 300 subjects will be enrolled in this study. It is anticipated
      that up to 33% of enrolled subjects will actually experience a decrease in blood pressure
      that requires treatment and so will receive Phenylephrine Hydrochloride Injection (PHI).
      There are 12 possible randomization assignments: one of six initial treatments PHI will be
      initially administered to approximately 50 subjects as an intravenous bolus (IV-B) at Low (1
      μg/kg), Med (3 μg/kg), or High (5 μg/kg) level; PHI will be initially administered to
      approximately 50 subjects as a continuous intravenous infusion (IV-I) at Low (0.25
      μg/kg/min), Med (0.75 μg/kg/min), or High (1.25 μg/kg/min) level]; each initial treatment
      group will have two pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling schedules.
