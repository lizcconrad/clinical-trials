  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators evaluated molecular biomarkers which play a role in the
      development of generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) using gingival tissue samples
      through omics-based whole-genome transcriptomic while using healthy individuals as background
      controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive periodontitis (AgP) is an inflammatory periodontal disease which is complex,
      multifactorial, and destructive. Progression and severity of the disease depend on
      interacting risk factors such as: immunological, microbiological, environmental, and genetic
      factors, as well as age, sex, and race.Some patients are genetically predisposed to AgP; they
      have immunological abnormalities, which are thought to be under genetic control. However,
      high susceptibility for periodontal destruction and the relationship between inflammatory
      changes, and genetic factors remain unclear.

      Gene expression profiling is a powerful means of generating comprehensive genome-level data
      sets on diseases such as cancer, asthma, rheumatoid disorders and periodontitis, and provides
      significant insight information for these diseases. Gene expression profiling may provide an
      evidence for involving genes in the pathogenesis of AgP and generate further information
      other than clinical signs and symptoms of AgP.

      The aim of this study was to identify gene-expression patterns of patients with generalized
      aggressive periodontitis by whole-transcriptome gene-expression analyses.

        Aggressive periodontitis patients: The periodontal diagnosis of subjects with GAgP was
        established on the basis of clinical and radiographic criteria and was defined by the 1999
        International World Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and
        Conditions.(Lang et al., 1999) Patients were included if they were between 18 and 35 years
        of age and otherwise healthy. The bone loss estimation was radiographically performed in
        each patient for the assessment of the extent and severity of alveolar bone loss.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             Workshop for a Classification of Periodontal Diseases and Conditions.(Lang et al.,
             1999) Patients were included if they were between 18 and 35 years of age and otherwise
             healthy. The bone loss estimation was radiographically performed in each patient for
             the assessment of the extent and severity of alveolar bone loss.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded if they had any known systemic diseases or conditions that
             can/could influence the periodontal status (cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory
             diseases), any history of hepatitis and/or HIV infection, immunosuppressive
             chemotherapy, current pregnancy, planning a pregnancy or lactation, requirement for
             antibiotic prophylaxis, oral diseases other than GAgP, ongoing orthodontic therapy, a
             history of antibiotic therapy, or periodontal treatment within the preceding six
             months.
