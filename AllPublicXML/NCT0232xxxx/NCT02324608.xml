    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects and how well cetuximab before surgery
      works in treating patients with skin cancer that forms, grows, and spreads quickly and has
      spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways be targeting certain cells. Giving
      cetuximab before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate of cetuximab by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of skin (SCCS).

      II. To assess whether neoadjuvant cetuximab given in this patient population is both safe and
      feasible.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the progression free and overall survival of patients with advanced SCCS who
      receive neoadjuvant cetuximab.

      II. To determine the conversion to resectability of patients treated with neoadjuvant
      cetuximab and capture changes in reconstructive options rendered possible by neoadjuvant
      treatment.

      III. Analyze the relationship of known deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations in tumor per the
      FoundationOneTM genomic profile, and correlate to clinical endpoints such as clinical benefit
      and conversion to resectability to discover potential markers of response and/or resistance.

      IV. Measure the downstream activation of signaling pathways without a known driver, including
      the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway.

      V. Determine if tumor shrinkage with cetuximab is associated with increased apoptosis as
      evidenced by activated caspase-3, in pre- and post- treatment tumor tissues.

      VI. Determine whether cetuximab results in increased antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
      (ADCC) in post-, compared with pre-treatment tumor tissues.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes once weekly for 8 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
