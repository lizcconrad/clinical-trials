    <textblock>
      Routine data collection will be conducted during normal sinus rhythm and AV synchronous
      pacing for approximately 20 minutes. The data collected will then be processed and the P, R
      and T wave amplitudes will be measured.

      The purpose of this study is to collect atrio-ventricular electrograms using a sequence of
      tip-ring spacings in patients undergoing routine cardiac procedures (EP study,
      pacemaker/ICD/CRT implant). To collect these signals, a 20 pole catheter (Medtronic
      StableMapr intracardiac steerable electrode catheter) will be acutely placed in the RV apex
      during a routine cardiac procedure.

      Routine data collection will be conducted during normal sinus rhythm and AV synchronous
      pacing for approximately 20 minutes. The data collected will then be processed and the P, R
      and T wave amplitudes will be measured.
