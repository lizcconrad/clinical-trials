      Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined from demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 4 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study will be
      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before
      dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Urine collection is scheduled
      drug 12 hour before and 24 hour after midazolam administration. Subjects will be dosed study
      drug via intravenous around at 9 a.m. of Day 1. Subjects performed scheduled procedures.

      In period 2, Subjects will be admitted on Day 3-5. Subjects performed scheduled period 2
      (Itraconazole co-administration phase, 2 times administration of itraconazole 200 mg), and
      period 3 (rifampicin 150 mg co-administration phase) procedure. Study participation was
      terminated on post-study visit (Day 23~35).
