  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine the effect of vortioxetine treatment on ADHD symptoms in adult
      patients with ADHD in a 12 weeks study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study employed the Sequential Parallel Comparison Design (SPCD), a clinical study design
      which intend to increase signal detection by using two stages of treatment:

        -  Stage 1 - first 6 weeks of the 12-weeks treatment period (Visit 2/Baseline 1 to Visit
           5/Week 6)

        -  Stage 2 - last 6 weeks of the 12-weeks treatment period (Visit 5/Baseline 2 to Visit
           8/Week 12)

      In Stage 1, patients were randomized to placebo or vortioxetine 10 or 20mg. Patients on
      vortioxetine 10 or 20mg/day during Stage 1 remained on the same treatment in Stage 2.
      Responders to placebo in Stage 1 remained on Placebo in Stage 2. Patients who were placebo
      non-responders during Stage 1, defined as patients with a &lt;30% reduction in AISRS total score
      from Baseline 1, were re-randomized to placebo or vortioxetine 10 or 20mg/day in Stage 2.

The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and 3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scale, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment. The number of days lost and the number of underproductive days last from work/school due to symptoms are also captured. The total score is calculated as a sum of the 3 visual analogue scales, ranges from 0 to 30. A higher score represents more severe functional impairment. A reduction in score indicates less impairment.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Function/Global Executive Function: Change in BRIEF-A Using the Global Executive Composite Score</title>
        <description>BRIEF-A is a validated questionnaire composed of 75-item within nine non-overlapping scales: 4 scales in the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) (inhibit, shift, emotional control, and self-monitor), and 5 scales in the Metacognition Index (MI) (initiate, working memory, plan/organise, task monitor, and organization of materials). Each item is rated on a 3-point scale with the numeric score of 1 to 3. The BRIEF-A yields an overall score (Global Executive Composite) composed of two index scores, the MI and the BRI. Raw scale scores are used to generate T-scores. A reduction in score indicates less impairment.</description>

        <title>Overall Functioning: Change in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The SDS comprises a series of patient rated scales designed to measure impairment. The patient rates the extent to which his or her (1) work, (2) social life or leisure activities and 3) home life or family responsibilities are impaired on a 10-point visual analogue scale, on which 0 = normal functioning and 10 = severe functional impairment. The number of days lost and the number of underproductive days last from work/school due to symptoms are also captured. The total score is calculated as a sum of the 3 visual analogue scales, ranges from 0 to 30. A higher score represents more severe functional impairment. A reduction in score indicates less impairment.</description>

        <description>The WLQ is a patient self-rated scale designed to assess on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment. The WLQ consists of 25 items in 4 dimensions: limitations handling time (5 items), physical work demands (6 items), mental-interpersonal work demands (9 items), and output demands (5 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;All of the Time&quot; (score 5) to &quot;None of the Time&quot; (score 0), or &quot;Does Not Apply to My Job&quot;. The WLQ Productivity Loss Score is derived from the Global Productivity Index, which is calculated as a weighed sum of the 4 dimensions. Reduction in WLQ Productivity Loss score indicates less work limitation and represents the estimated percentage of productivity loss in the past two weeks due to presenteeism relative to a healthy benchmark sample. WLQ Productivity Loss Score ranges from 0% to 24,9%.</description>

The WLQ Productivity Loss Score is derived from the Global Productivity Index, which is calculated as a weighed sum of the 4 dimensions. Reduction in WLQ Productivity Loss score indicates less work limitation and represents the estimated percentage of productivity loss in the past two weeks due to presenteeism relative to a healthy benchmark sample. WLQ Productivity Loss Score ranges from 0% to 24,9%.</description>

        <description>The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) is a patient-rated scale designed to assess the ADHD symptoms in adults based on the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IVTM. The ASRS consist of 18 items, each rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Very Often&quot;. The categories “Never” and “Rarely” were combined when calculating the total score to mirror the scoring of the AISRS, with 0 representing “Never”/”Rarely” and 3 representing “Very Often”. The Total Score ranges from 0 to 54. A reduction in score indicates less severity of ADHD.</description>

          <title>Change in Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Total Score</title>
          <description>The Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) is a patient-rated scale designed to assess the ADHD symptoms in adults based on the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IVTM. The ASRS consist of 18 items, each rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;Never&quot; to &quot;Very Often&quot;. The categories “Never” and “Rarely” were combined when calculating the total score to mirror the scoring of the AISRS, with 0 representing “Never”/”Rarely” and 3 representing “Very Often”. The Total Score ranges from 0 to 54. A reduction in score indicates less severity of ADHD.</description>

        <title>Change in WLQ Using the Global Productivity Index</title>
        <description>The WLQ is a patient self-rated scale designed to assess on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment. The WLQ consists of 25 items in 4 dimensions: limitations handling time (5 items), physical work demands (6 items), mental-interpersonal work demands (9 items), and output demands (5 items). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;All of the Time&quot; (score 5) to &quot;None of the Time&quot; (score 0), or &quot;Does Not Apply to My Job&quot;. The Global Productivity Index is calculated as a weighed sum of the 4 dimensions, and ranges from 0.000 to 0.286. Reduction in score indicates less work limitation.</description>
