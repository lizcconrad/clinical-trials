      In this study, the investigators would like to compare a heparin-coated tubing system for
      minimized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) with the conventional tubing system for MECC,
      which does not contain heparin coating. The MECC system has been used since 14 years in the
      investigators' hospital as an extracorporeal system to support circulation and provide oxygen
      to the tissues during coronary artery bypass grafting. Until today, the investigators
      performed more than 5000 MECC procedures in their department.

      Background

      The investigators would like to investigate a new composition of their MECC system in
      patients receiving coronary artery bypass surgery. Normally, the MECC system induces
      complement system activation and coagulation cascade, which could have a negative impact on
      postoperative outcome. A tubing system containing heparin (rheoparin) could contribute to a
      better biocompatibility in terms of a diminished activation of inflammatory reactions and a
      reduction of cerebral embolic load, which is a regular issue during extracorporeal
      circulation due to formation of solid and gaseous microemboli in the tubing system.

      Objective

      The aim is to investigate biocompatibility (coagulation, inflammation) and influence on
      cerebral embolic load of the rheoparin-coated MECC system and to compare the results with the
      current MECC system containing a rheoparin-free tubing system.

      Methods

      Patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery are randomized to receive extracorporeal
      circulation using the MECC system with or without rheoparin coating. All procedures are
      performed according to the institutional standards.

    <description>Biocompatibility will be assessed by measuring different coagulatory and inflammatory parameters as determined in comparable studies. Especially, hte investigators assess in their central laboratory the thrombin-antithrombin complex and the d-dimer as measures of the activity of the coagulation/fibrinolysis system and furthermore the complement factors C3a-C5a, the interleukins IL 6, IL8, IL10, the tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), platelet factor 4 and the syndecan-1 activity as an expression of the inflammatory response to the different coating used for minimized extracorporeal circulation system.</description>
