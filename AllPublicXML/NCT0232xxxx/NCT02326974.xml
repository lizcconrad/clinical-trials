  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for breast
      cancer that has tested positive for a protein called HER2.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Trastuzumab emtansine (also called T-DM1)

        -  Pertuzumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved T-DM1 for
      pre-operative use in breast cancer but it has been approved for other uses in breast cancer.
      The FDA has approved pertuzumab as a pre-operative treatment.

    <description>Intratumor heterogeneity will be assessed from two core biopsies at baseline from different geographic areas, and a dichotomous determination of heterogeneity will be made. HER2 genetic heterogeneity will be defined as the existence of an area of tumor cells with a HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 or a gene copy number of &gt;6 and representing more than 5% but less than 50% of infiltrating tumor cells. HER2 regional heterogeneity will be defined as at least one of the six tumor areas being HER2 negative by ISH (HER2/CEP17 ratio &lt;2 and CN &lt;6, if IHC is &lt;3+). A HER2-positive tumor will be considered HER2 heterogeneous if genetic heterogeneity and/or HER2 regional heterogeneity is identified</description>

             imaging is required.

          -  HER-2 positive, confirmed by central testing (Clarient labs): IHC 3+ and/or FISH
             positive based on one of the three following criteria:

          -  Single-probe average HER2 copy number≥6.0 signals/cell OR

          -  Dual-probe HER2/CEP17 &lt;2.0 with an average HER2 copy number ≥6.0 signals/cell OR
