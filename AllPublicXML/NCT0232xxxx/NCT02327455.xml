      The specific aim of this clinical trial is to translate the investigators new 4DE (three
      sptial dimensions pluse time) stress echocardiographic method to patients with coronary
      artery disease referred for clinically indicated dobutamine stress/rest echo to evaluate the
      reproducibility of the technique in this clinical setting.
