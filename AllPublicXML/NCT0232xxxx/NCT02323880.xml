      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor in treating younger
      patients with solid tumors or high-grade gliomas that have come back (recurred) or do not
      respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as selinexor, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      the tablet formulation of selinexor in children with recurrent/refractory solid and central
      nervous system (CNS) tumors.

      II. To describe the toxicities of selinexor in children with recurrent/refractory solid and
      CNS tumors.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the tablet formulation of selinexor in children
      with recurrent/refractory solid and CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the antitumor effect of selinexor in a preliminary manner in children with
      recurrent/refractory solid and CNS tumors.

      II. To determine the pharmacodynamic properties of selinexor in children and adolescents with
      refractory solid tumors in plasma proteins and whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA).

      III. To explore the penetration, pharmacodynamic effects, and biologic effects of selinexor
      in tumor tissue of patients with recurrent/refractory high-grade gliomas (HGG) requiring
      resection.

      IV. To further assess the toxicity and antitumor effects of selinexor in children with
      recurrent/refractory HGG in expanded cohorts following dose-escalation by measuring rate of
      objective radiographic response (medical patients) and rate of progression-free survival
      (PFS) six months from the start of treatment (surgical patients).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO) twice weekly (days 1, 3, 8, 10, 15, and 17). Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
