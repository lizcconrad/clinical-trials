    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify features of the cumulative dose-volume histogram
      (DVH) for patients treated with trimodality therapy in oesophageal cancer and correlate these
      with postoperative complications.

      Intention to treat analysis in patients initially assigned to be treated with the trimodality
      protocol: neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery.

      The investigators will retrospectively evaluate several parameters of the treatment planning
      of patients treated with a preoperative regimen (CROSS regimen 41,4 Gy in 23 fractions or 50,
      4 Gy in 28 fractions ):

        -  PTV volume1

        -  MLD, V30, V20, V15, V10, VS5 (Volume lung less dan 5 Gy)2 (lung toxicity)

        -  MHD, V20, V30, V403 (heart toxicity)

        -  Mean stomach dose, V50 stomach

        -  Mitochondrial DNA if available per patient Pre-existing cardiac,pulmonary comorbidity,
           smoking behavior, BMI, type of surgery and chemotherapy (especially taxanes) will be
           scored and take into account in a multivariate analysis. The investigators will collect
           these data and correlate the data with the presence of postoperative complications, time
           of onset of complications and duration of hospitalization. These latter data are already
           scored in a prospective manner at the Atrium Medical Center in Heerlen.
