      The investigators evaluate the feedback of using swim down semen processing method during
      preparation for ICSI and compare the results of pregnancy and embryos quality with the cases
      used density gradient method for their semen processing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is different semen processing method, in this study we compared the ICSI output when
      the investigators used one method with higher separation method and minimum sperm stress or
      physical interface as swimming down using 100 % silica solution, with other more stressful
      procedure with high selection power as density gradient.

      The routine used method as density gradient (DG) includes about 30 min centrifugation at 1200
      RPM, and more working steps with more handling procedures. According to many references the
      investigators can approve that it is method to be indicated with all cases particularly with
      those severely decreases semen number or motility.

      Using 100 % silica solution for semen processing used for ICSi, shews lesser centrifugation
      time and minimum processing procedures. As swimming down time is about 30 min followed by 5
      min washing and finalized with other 3 minutes last wash. For that total interfering physical
      action is about 8 minutes compared with 30 min with DG method.

      In swimming down we are using the natural sperm behavior and own swimming power for separate
      itself from other seminal components. As well as only the one normally structure and motility
      direction the only can penetrate the interface surface of silica solution and swim inside
      higher density matrix using its speed and power.

        Cases collected were submitted for ART treatment using ICSI/IVF procedures. In two
        different IVF clinics at Manama-Bahrain and Sohag-Egypt. The groups of about 890 couple
