  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous catheters are necessary for the treatment of many patients. Showering with a venous
      catheter is often prohibited due to the infection risk when the insertion site becomes wet.
      Therefore these patients are challenged to keep the catheter insertion site dry and always
      covered with a dressing. Washing themselves is often impossible without assistance of a nurse
      or significant other. For patients with a catheter connected to an infusion line, it is even
      more difficult. Showerpatch is a newly developed dressing that safeguards the insertion site
      of an IV catheter from water during bathing activities. The purpose of this trial is to
      evaluate the impact of the availability of Showerpatch by comparing the outcomes in patients
      regarding the patient's autonomy in bathing activities, the material use and the time needed
      from caregivers in home care. Additionally qualitative data on patient's bathing activities
      and the use of Showerpatch will be collected.
