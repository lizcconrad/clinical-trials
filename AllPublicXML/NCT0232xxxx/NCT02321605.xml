    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to test the efficacy of a Positive Psychology Intervention (Best Possible
      Self) over optimism, future expectancies and positive affect at mid-term, in comparison to a
      control group. The principal hypothesis is that Best Possible Self intervention will enhance
      significantly the levels of optimism and positive affect in comparison to the control group
      at short and mid-term.

    <textblock>
      Over the last fifteen years, research in the field of positive psychology has increased
      exponentially (Bolier, Haverman, Westerhof, Riper, Smit &amp; Bohlmeijer, 2013; Sin &amp;
      Lyubomirsky, 2009). These studies have shown that positive moods and positive emotions lead
      people to think, feel, and act in favor of their approach goals, promoting their involvement
      in them (Lyubomirsky, 2001). One of the main arms of this framework, is the development of
      exercises and treatment protocols aimed to promote the appearance of different positive
      emotions and states, called Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs).

      In this sense, Best Possible Self (BPS) has been included as a PPI, since is aimed to enhance
      wellbeing. Specifically, BPS is a positive future thinking technique, which requires people
      to envision themselves in the future, after everything has gone as good as it possibly could.
      This exercise has shown efficacy improving optimism, future expectancies and positive affect
      compared to a control condition, in general population (Meevissen, Peters &amp; Alberts, 2011;
      Sheldon &amp;Lyubomirsky, 2012; Peters, Flink, Boersma &amp; Linton, 2010).

      Furthermore, the progress of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), has allowed
      the development of technology applications and devices that could enhance the quality of
      experience and the wellbeing levels. This approach is called Positive Technology (PT) and it
      can be used as a complement to PPIs. PT can be defined as the scientific and applied approach
      to improve the quality of our personal experience trying to increase wellness and generate
      strengths (Riva, Baños, Botella, Wiederhold &amp; Gaggioli, 2012).

      Taking into account the prior literature, the aim of the present study is to carry out a
      randomized controlled study in order to replicate the findings about the effects of BPS on
      optimism, mood and affect in young general population. The exercise will be applied through a
      Positive Technology system and the effects will be analyzed during four months. The design
      employed in this study is similar to the used in other studies (Meevissen et al, 2011;
      Renner, Schwarz, Peters &amp; Huibers, 2014; Sheldon &amp; Lyubomirsky, 2006).

    <measure>Subjective Probability Task (SPT; MacLeod, 1996).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures positive and negative expectancies about future events. It consists of 20 statements referring to negative expectancies and 10 statements referring to positive expectancies. Participants answer on a 7-point scale (Not at all likely to occur - Extremely likely to occur). Some studies have found an appropriate levels of internal consistency for positive and negative expectancies (α=0.80-0.82 y 0.91, respectively).</description>

    <measure>Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS, Watson, Clark &amp; Tellegen, 1988; Sandín et al., 1999).</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure analyzes the levels of positive (PA) and negative affect (NA). The instrument consists of 20 items, 10 for each level of affect. Participants rate on a 5-point scale (Not at all - Extremely). The Spanish version has demonstrated high internal consistency (0.89 to 0.91 for PA and NA in women and 0.87 for AP and 0.89 for AN in men) in college students.</description>

    <description>This scale measures positive and negative expectancies about future events. It consists of 20 statements referring to negative expectancies and 10 statements referring to positive expectancies.

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II; Beck, 1996)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is one of the most widely questionnaires used to evaluate severity of depression in pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. The instrument has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.76 to 0.95) and test-retest reliability of around 0.8. The Spanish version of this instrument has also shown a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.87) for both the general and the clinical population (Cronbach's alpha of 0.89). Summed to obtain the total score, which can be a maximum of 63 points.</description>

    <measure>Eysenck Personality Questionnaire - Revised - Neuroticism (EPQ-R-N; Eysenck, Eysenck &amp; Barrett, 1985; Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1997).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the neuroticism level of the individual, showing if he is stable or neurotic. This subscale is composed by 12 items of dicotomic response (yes-not). Regarding psychometric properties, Eysenck and Eysenck (1997) got an alpha coefficient between 0-73 and 0.82.</description>

    <description>Participants are asked to write and imagine about a future in which they have reached all their goals and they have developed all their potentialities in four different domains: personal, professional, social and health domain.
They carry out the exercise in a Positive Technology System called the &quot;Book of Life&quot;, which has shown efficacy in the enhancement of positive mood (Baños, Etchemendy, Farfallini, García-Palacios, Quero &amp; Botella, 2014). This application looks like a personal diary, where participants can write all that they want and these essays are supported by multimedia content (pictures, songs and videos). Additionally, they can continue doing the exercise in a web platform in which they can visualize all the content they had developed previously.</description>
