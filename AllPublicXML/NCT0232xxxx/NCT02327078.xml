  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open label study. Phase 1 consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a
      dose-escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of epacadostat administered with
      nivolumab in subjects with select advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. Part 2 will evaluate
      the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy in
      subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) and non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Phase 2 will include expansion cohorts in 7 tumor types, including melanoma, NSCLC, SCCHN,
      colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

             or HL, or glioblastoma

             measurable disease is not required.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 1

             Subjects who have received experimental vaccines or other immune therapies should be
             discussed with the medical monitor to confirm eligibility

          -  Untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases or CNS metastases that have
             progressed

          -  Subjects with any active or inactive autoimmune process

          -  Evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, noninfectious pneumonitis
