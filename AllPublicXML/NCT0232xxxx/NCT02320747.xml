  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tai Chi has been widely practiced as a Chinese martial art that focuses on slow sequential
      movements, providing a smooth, continuous and low intensity activity. It has been promoted to
      improve balance and strength and to reduce falls in the elderly, especially those 'at risk'.
      The potential benefits in healthy younger age cohorts and for wider aspects of health have
      received less attention.

      The present study documented prospective changes in balance and vascular responses for a
      community sample of adults.
