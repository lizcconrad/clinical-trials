        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female ages 18-80 years old

          2. Patients with asymptomatic myocardial ischemia symptom, stable or unstable angina
             pectoris or old myocardial infarction

          3. Patients with bifurcation lesions of coronary artery observed by angiography.

          4. The main branch of the vessels are suitable for PCI and stent therapy, and the side
             branch are intended to implement the kissing dilatation without considering dual stent
             implantation.

          5. De Novo bifurcation lesions and diameter stenosis are not less than70%;

          6. Referenced vessel diameters range from 1.25mm to 5.0mm, and lesions range are not more
             than 40mm

          7. Residual stenosis are not more than 50% after predilatation;

          8. Patients who understand the purpose of this trial, voluntary and sign informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Heavily calcified lesions which cannot be dalatated successfully, and the lesions
             which are not suitable by balloon angioplasty

          2. Left main coronary artery lesions without protection or related bifurcation lesions

          3. Patients with severe heart failure symptoms (above NYHA III) or Left ventricular
             ejection fraction (LVEF) below 35% (ultrasound or left ventricular angiography)

          4. Impairment of the renal function preoperative: Serum creatinine above 2.0mg/dlï¼›

          5. Patients with hemorrhagic tendency, the history of active digestive ulcers, the
             history of subarachnoid hemorrhage cerebral hemorrhage, antiplatelet and anticoagulant
             therapy contraindication and unable to anticoagulant therapy;

          6. Patients who are allergic to aspirin, ticagrelor, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, heparin,
             contrast agent and paclitaxel, and cannot 1-year tolerate dual antiplatelet therapy
             (aspirin + clopidogrel or ticagrelor)

          7. Patients whose expected lives are less than 1 year;

          8. Patients who are considered to have poor compliance and cannot complete the trial in
             accordance with requirements.

          9. In-stent restenosis lesions

         10. Patients who are enrolled in this trial and need stent therapy due to vascular
             laceration or severe stenosis, and those patients are calculated as fall off cases.
