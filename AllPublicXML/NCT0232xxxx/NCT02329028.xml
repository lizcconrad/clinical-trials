  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EEG is widely used in the diagnosis of central nervous system pathology, including
      epileptic seizures and epilepsy. Presently, EEG is available only during office hours in most
      hospitals, pending on the availability of a clinical neurophysiologist and the lack of oncall
      possibility outside these hours. Standard EEG devices are large and their operation require
      meticulous application of several leads. The department of clinical neurophysiology at
      Helsinki University Central Hospital has developed a mini-EEG device for use in the emergency
      department as well as in the prehospital setting. The aims of this pilot study is to evaluate
      the feasibility of the mini-EEG in the prehospital setting. Patients with a decreased level
      of consciousness, as evaluated by the emergency medical provider on the scene, are included.
      The mini--EEG device is to be used by a specially trained emergency medical supervisor. EEG
      is otherwise obtained in a normal fashion, but only three electrodes are used. The sample
      size is 30. Data are collected as a part of the clinical work in daily practice. The aim is
      to collect observational data on feasibility, no clinical interventions will be performed
      based on the EEG. No funding is needed as data is collected during daily work.

      The mini-EEG is a prototype EEG/EKG-adapter, designed by Helsinki Univeristy Central
      Hospital, and as such, does not have a trade name. It is to be connected to a
      monitor/defibrillator used by the EMS personel, currently the LifePak 15, manufactured by
      Physio-Control, Redmond, WA 98052. (www.physio-control.com)
