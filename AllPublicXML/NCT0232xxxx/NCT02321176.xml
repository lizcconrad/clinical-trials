      There is blood-eye barrier in eyes,but some oral medicines can enter in the tissues of eyes.

      The primary objective of the study is to study the Pharmacokinetics of Trans-resveratrol and

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

          2. Male and female patients 18-60 years of age.

          3. nonsmokers or who smoke&lt;10 cigarettes/day.

          4. BMI ranging from 19 to 30 kg/m^2 were eligible for the study.

          5. Patients were considered to be healthy on the basis of electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             clinical laboratory safety tests (haematology, plasma biochemistry, urinalysis and
             hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV serology) performed at screening.

          6. Women use measures to avoid conception during the study period (e.g. oral
             contraceptives, intrauterine devices [IUDs], and condoms).

          7. Avoid ingesting grapefruit, grapefruit juice or other grapefruit juice containing
             products, and any herbal-based nutrient supplement or prescribed medications(
             grapefruit, cranberry, blueberry products, peanuts and peanut butter, grape and grape
             products, and red wine ) during the same period of time.

          8. patients should abstain from alcohol-containing beverages at least two days prior to
             and during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled Blood pressure exceeding diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg (sitting) during
             the screening period and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          2. Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial

          3. Renal failure requiring dialysis or renal transplant or liver dysfunction History of
             other disease,or other findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition
             that contraindicates the use an investigational drug, might affect interpretation of
             the results of the study, or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications.5.IOP over 30 mmHg.

          4. Any previous retinal laser photocoagulation to the study eye in treatment naive. Any
             previous intravitreal injection in study eye (triamcinolone or other) in treatment
             naive.

          5. Any previous vitrectomy in study eye (posterior or anterior associated with vitreous
             loss in cataract surgery). Intracapsular cataract extraction (posterior capsule needs
             to be present).

          6. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule in the study eye, Structural damage to the
             center of the macula in the study eye preexisting to CRVO likely to preclude
             improvement in visual acuity following the resolution of macular edema, including
             atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, subretinal fibrosis, laser scar(s).
