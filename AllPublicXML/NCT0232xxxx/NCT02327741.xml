  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1010 patients post stenting were enrolled to receive Plavix more than 12 months and less than
      that and rate of bleeding, complication and major cardiovascular adverse events ( MACE) were
      compared to evaluate safety and feasibility of long term Plavix therapy post stenting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1010 patients from registry of angioplasty and stenting in Shiraz and Baghiatolah hospital
      were enrolled and long term Plavix therapy more than and less than 12 months were compared
      between two groups of patients prospectively and rate of major adverse cardiovascular events
      ( MACE) (death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents and revascularization) and
      rate of bleeding were compared between 2 groups.Syntax score and American heart association (
      AHA) score of coronary involvement were measured and MACE was compared to these scores.
