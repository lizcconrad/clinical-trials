  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea involves significant increases in disease and death, but its consequences in
      people over 65 years of age are incompletely recognized. Intraoral mandibular advancement
      appliances reduce the number of apneas and hypopneas. The investigators hypothesized that
      oral appliances provided to the elderly may prevent hypertension and other consequences of
      sleep apnea in large populations, at a favorable cost/benefit relationship for the public
      health system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders involve significant increases in morbidity and mortality, particularly in
      those over 60 years. Sleep apnea is the leading identifiable cause of hypertension, which is
      the main cause of cardiovascular disease. Some degree of sleep apnea is present in up to 95%
      of the elderly. Intraoral mandibular advancement appliances reduce the number of apneas and
      hypopneas.

      We hypothesized that reducing the number of sleep apnea events through oral appliances is
      effective in preventing high blood pressure and other consequences of sleep apnea in the
      elderly in the public health system setting. In this superiority parallel, randomized, and
      double-blinded study we will compare the effect of an intraoral appliance with mandibular
      advancement to a placebo device without mandibular advancement in preventing high blood
      pressure and other consequences of sleep apnea in the elderly. The duration of intervention
      will be of 12 months, with assessments at three, six months, and 12 months.
