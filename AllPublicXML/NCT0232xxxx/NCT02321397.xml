  <brief_title>To Demonstrate Equivalence in Analgesic Efficacy &amp; Bowel Function Between OXN PR Higher Dose &amp; Lower Dose Tablet Strengths in Subjects With Non-cancer or Cancer Pain</brief_title>
  <official_title>Randomised, Double-blind, Double-dummy, Cross-over Multicenter Study to Demonstrate Equivalence in Analgesic Efficacy &amp; Bowel Function Taking Oxycodone Equivalents of 120 &amp; 160 mg Per Day as Achieved With the Higher OXN PR Tablet Strengths (OXN60/30 mg PR, OXN80/40 mg PR) BID Compared to the Identical Daily Dose Taken as a Combination of Lower Tablet Strengths in Subjects With Non-malignant or Malignant Pain That Requires Around-the-clock Opioid Therapy.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to demonstrate equivalence between combinations of lower strength OXN PR
      tablets (OXN PR LST) and single higher strength OXN PR tablets (OXN PR HST) taken at the same
      overall daily dose.

      Study OXN3508 is a multicenter double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, cross-over, 2-period,
      phase III study in male and female subjects with severe non-malignant or malignant pain that
      requires around-the-clock opioid therapy at a daily dose of 120/60 mg or 160/80 mg
      oxycodone/naloxone prolonged release (OXN PR).
