      The purpose of this study is to determine whether point-of-care susceptibility testing
      improve correct choice of antibiotics, clinical and microbiological outcome in patients with
      uncomplicated urinary tract infection in general practice compared to point-of-care urine
      culture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      700-900 patients with symptoms of uncomplicated urinary tract infection, consecutively
      contacting their GP, randomized to either point of care test (POCT) urine culture and
      empirical treatment or POCT urine culture and susceptibility testing and targeted treatment.
      Patients are included until 440 with verified positive cultures are included. The two groups
      are compared with regard to correct choice of antibiotics, clinical remission and
      microbiological cure rates.

    <description>Urine culture and sensitivity testing will be performed on the intervention group by means of a POCT, the FLEXICULT™ SSI-Urinary Kit. The kit is designed as an ordinary Petri dish but with higher sides. The Petri dish is divided into 6 compartments: 1 large one for quantitative analysis and 5 smaller ones for susceptibility testing (Fig. 1). The agar in each of the smaller compartments contains 1 of 5 antimicrobials: trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, nitrofurantoin and mecillinam. The agar plate is flooded with the urine specimen for a couple of seconds and then incubated at 35°C over night. The following day the plate is read. When reading the compartment for quantitative analysis the lower limit is:103 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter.</description>

    <intervention_name>ID FlexicultTM</intervention_name>
    <description>Point of care culture will be performed using ID FlexicultTM,which is a chromogenic agar plate for identification and quantitation of urinary tract pathogens. The agar plate is for cultivation of urine, which makes it possible to identify the bacteria and quantitate the amount of bacteria. Based on bacterial colony color and size can be determined which bacteria are involved. For example, an E. coli bacteria will grow with big red colonies, and Enterobacter sp. will grow with large dark blue / purple colonies. The sample is seeded with a 10 uL inoculation needle, the lid is applied and the agar plate incubated with the lid down at 35 0C overnight. The plate is read the next day</description>
