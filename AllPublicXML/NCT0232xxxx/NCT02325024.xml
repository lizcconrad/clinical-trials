  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single oromucosal dose of
      Sativex® (i.e. how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolises and excretes the drug) when
      subjects have severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease (ESRD), compared with
      subjects who have normal renal function.

      The primary clinical hypothesis is that there will be an effect from severe renal impairment
      on the PK of Sativex® when administered as a single oromucosal dose.

      The study additionally aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the same single
      oromucosal dose of Sativex® in subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, single-dose study to evaluate the effect of renal impairment
      on the PK of an oromucosal dose (four sprays) of Sativex® (containing 10.8 mg Δ9
      tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and 10 mg cannabidiol [CBD]) in subjects with severe renal
      impairment or ESRD (with a creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min and not requiring dialysis)
      compared to matched subjects with normal renal function (with a creatinine clearance &gt; 80
      mL/min).

      Eligible subjects will be given a single oromucosal dose (four sprays) of Sativex® on Dosing
      Day 1. Serial blood and urine samples for determination of concentrations of THC, 11-hydroxy-
      Δ9 - tetrahydrocannabinol (11-OH-THC), CBD, and 7-hydroxy-cannabidiol (7- OH-CBD) will be
      collected from subjects with severe renal impairment or ESRD, not requiring dialysis, and
      matched subjects with normal renal function before and up to 48 hours after dosing at
      selected time points. Pre-dose blood samples will also be collected for protein binding
      measurement. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated from Day -2 through to the post-study
      follow-up visit.

      The Follow-up Safety visit will be performed 7 days after Sativex® dosing (+ 2 days).

      The expected maximum duration for study participation (including Screening, Inpatient Period,
      and Follow-up) for each individual subject is a maximum of 24 days.
