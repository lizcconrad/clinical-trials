      Research Hypothesis:

      There will be a greater proportion of VAS responders defined as those who achieve ≥ 50%
      reduction from baseline in VAS for low back pain at week 12 following intradiscal injection
      of YH14618 compared to placebo. Patients have been diagnosed as one or two symptomatic lumbar
      degenerative disc disease defined as Pfirrmann grade 2 to 4 using MRI. Patients have suffered
      from persistent low back pain with at least 3 months of conservative therapy and must have
      low back pain measured by VAS≥4 cm and modified Oswestry disability index (mODI) ≥30% at the
      baseline.
