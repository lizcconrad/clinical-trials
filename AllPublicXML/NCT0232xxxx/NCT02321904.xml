      The overall aim of this study is to confirm the utility of corneal confocal microscopy (CCM)
      as a new technique to rapidly and non-invasively assess diabetic neuropathy (DN) in children.
      This study will be divided into two phases: Phase 1 will be a cross-sectional study of
      children with type 1 diabetes and normal controls, while phase 2 will be a longitudinal
      assessment of a subgroup of children with type 1 diabetes recruited during Phase 1.

      In phase 1: To compare corneal nerve density (CND), length (CNL), and branching (CBD) by CCM
      between

        1. children with type 1 diabetes for 5 years or more to children without diabetes;

        2. children with type 1 diabetes with and without evidence of diabetic neuropathy;

        3. to examine the relationship between CND, CNL &amp; CBD and known risk factors of diabetic
           neuropathy

      In phase 2:

        1. to examine for changes in corneal nerve morphology two years after the initial CCM exam.

        2. to describe the evolution of diabetic neuropathy based on clinical symptoms,
           neurological deficits, and other tests of nerve dysfunction.

        3. to assess if changes in corneal nerve morphology correlate with changes in nerve
           conduction velocity and autonomic testing.

        4. To examine the risk factors associated with progression of diabetic neuropathy in our
           pediatric population.

    <description>To confirm the utility of corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) as a new technique to rapidly assess diabetic neuropathy (DN) in children. This non-invasive eye imaging method may be a superior alternative to traditional nerve conduction studies.
This study will be divided into two phases: Phase 1 will be a cross-sectional study of children with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and normal controls, while phase 2 will be a longitudinal assessment of a subgroup of T1D children recruited during Phase 1.</description>
