    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to investigate a possible correlation between
      abdominal wall function and subjective measures of QoL before and after laparoscopic repair
      of small- to medium sized incisional hernia.

      This prospective study includes 25 patients undergoing laparoscopic incisional hernia repair.
      Abdominal wall function is examined by determination of maximal truncal flexion and extension
      with a fixated pelvis using a Goodstrength dynamometer (Metitur Ltd., Jyväskylä, Finland).
      Subjective scores of QoL (HerQLes), pain (visual analogue scale) and physical activity
      (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) are assessed. Patients are examined before,
      one month after and three months after the operation. Furthermore, pulmonary function is
      examined preoperative and three months postoperative by standard spirometry (forved vital
      capacity, peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second) as well as maximum in-
      and expiratory pressure is measured.
