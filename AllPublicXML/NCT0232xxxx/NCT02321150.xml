  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to introduce a new surgical technique for the removal of pterygiums
      that entails the use of bipolar electrocautery to secure the graft, rather than sutures.

      With this, the objective is to evaluate the benefits of a new technique for pterygium surgery
      with respect to postoperative patient comfort, surgery time, cost and recurrence rate.

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Cautery</intervention_name>
    <description>Pterygium dissected off, corneal bed burred smooth and autograft harvested as per usual technique.
Conjunctiva undermined at the recipient site.
Relaxing incisions placed at the corners of the recipient site.
Graft is slid into place
Graft / host interface is gently dried with a Qtip
Bipolar cautery is applied after grasping the graft and host conjunctiva gently between cautery forceps.
Power setting: 25.
Duration of cautery: 4 -5 seconds; the tissue should whiten and contract as desiccation and coagulation take place. Some charring may occur.
Counter traction is applied to the conjunctiva as the cautery forceps are gently teased off
Cautery is applied at the 4 apices of the graft then in between these points.</description>
