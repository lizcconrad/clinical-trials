      The purpose of this study is to establish a tissue and data repository consisting of samples
      of human placentas, umbilical cord blood, and maternal blood, collected at the time of
      delivery. Specimens will be used in cellular, molecular, and functional studies to learn more
      about changes in placental structure and function, which can result in serious pregnancy
      complications and determine life-long health by programming the fetus for future metabolic
      and cardiovascular disease.

    <description>Human placental tissue, umbilical cord blood, and maternal blood samples will be collected from pregnant women at the time of their delivery. The samples will be used to enhance understanding of the role of the placenta in the development of pregnancy complications and in programming of adult disease.</description>
