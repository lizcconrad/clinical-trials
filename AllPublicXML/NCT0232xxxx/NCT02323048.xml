  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to extend our investigations of drug-associated conditioning with
      healthy volunteers. The investigators have recently completed a pilot study demonstrating
      that subjects show an increase in self-reported preference for a visual stimulus paired with
      stimulant drug administration. Furthermore, our pilot data suggest that methamphetamine acts
      synergistically with rewards in the environment, such that this conditioning effect is
      facilitated by experiencing the drug in the presence of rewarding, or positive events, such
      as earning money. The investigators now aim to extend these findings by assessing not only
      self-reported preference, but also attentional and psychophysiological (electromyogram; EMG)
      responses to the drug-associated stimuli.

      The study will consist of an orientation session following by 6 experimental study sessions.
      The first experimental session will consist of a &quot;Pre-test&quot;, where baseline data regarding
      attentional, psychophysiological, and self-reported responses tovarious stimuli will be
      collected. The following 4 sessions will consist of a drug (sedative or stimulant) or
      placebo. During these sessions, subjects will play simple computer games, as well as complete
      questionnaires regarding mood and potential subjective drug effects. The subjects will then
      complete a &quot;Test&quot; session, where attentional, psychophysiological, and self-reported
      responses to the stimuli will be assessed, as in the first experimental session.

    <description>Facial EMG will be recorded using 4 standard 4mm silver/silver chloride electrodes (2 at each site on the right side of the face), plus one ground electrode. Data will be relayed to a Biopac (Biopac Systems, Inc, Santa Barbara CA) EMG100C amplifier, which will amplify signals 5,000x, and band pass filter signals below 10 Hz and above 500 Hz.</description>

    <measure>Attention (attentional biases for the conditioned stimuli, electrooculogram (EOG) eyetracking)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of study (time 0 and approximately 4 weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>To examine attentional biases for the conditioned stimuli, electrooculogram (EOG) eyetracking equipment will be used to measure horizontal eye movement. A 4mm Ag/AgCl electrode filled with electrolyte (Biopac System Inc.) will be attached 1.5 cm from the outer canthus of each eye, using the same ground as the EMG signal. The EOG signal will be amplified using an EOG100C (Biopac Sysems, Goleta.CA), digitized using a Biopac MP150 system and sampled at 1000 Hz throughout the task using AcqKnowledge software.</description>

    <description>To examine self-reported preference of study stimuli, a visual analog scale (VAS) of image &quot;liking&quot; will both be collected. Subjects will rate how much they &quot;like&quot; each image using a 100mm VAS.</description>
