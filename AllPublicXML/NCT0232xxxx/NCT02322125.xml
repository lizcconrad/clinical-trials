  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Powered exoskeletons have emerged recently, promising to offer walking to individuals with
      severe spinal cord injury who are unable to walk. We will use the ReWalk exoskeleton to train
      walking in individuals with chronic, severe spinal cord injury. We will determine the
      characteristics of individuals who most benefit from such training, and identify the
      neuroplasticity induced by the training. We will further determine the feasibility of the
      ReWalk for home and community ambulation.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, pilot, cohort study design will recruit participants to train intensively for
      a 3 month period. The training sessions will be documented in detail, including number of
      steps taken, speed of walking, distance of walking. Once walking speed has plateaued, we will
      evaluate the feasibility of using the device in a home-like environment and in the community.

      At the end of this study, we will have a good idea of the capability of the ReWalk to assist
      walking in those with severe SCI. We will better understand which individuals are most likely
      to benefit from the ReWalk. We will know how training in the ReWalk changes the neural
      connections between the brain and the spinal cord so that we can better guide the training
      protocol. Finally, we will identify limitations of the ReWalk for home and community use, so
      that exoskeletons can be improved in the future to maximize their benefit to people with SCI.
