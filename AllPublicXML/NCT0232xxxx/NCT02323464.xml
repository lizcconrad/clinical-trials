  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      300 patients with colorectal cancer will be investigated before surgery and 60 of them will
      also be investigated in the same manner after surgery. Investigations will include
      polysomonographic sleep apnea recordings during one night, lung function measurements, blood
      gas samples and a questionnaire, but only before surgery including questions on sleep, sleep
      apnea, lung disorders.

      Outcome: side effects of surgery and mortality rate, association with cancer type.

      Prevalence of sleep apnea, sleep quality, hypoxemia and lung function before and after
      surgery.

      Group 1. Inclusion: 240 patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for surgery. Exclusion:
      Dementia, CPAP treated sleep apnea Methods: Patients are investigaged before surgery with
      Lung-function measurements, blood-gas sample, questionnaire, Overnight polysomnographic sleep
      apena recordings including oro-nasal airflow, thoraco-abdominal respiration belts, chin-EMG,
      EOG, EEG, ECG (V5) and body position.

      Outcome variables: complications of surgery including anastomosis insuficiency and wound
      infections. Short and long term mortality, Sleep apnea, hypxoia, hyprecapnia and effect on
      lungfunction (VC, FEV1). Detailed morphologic analysis of cancer type.

      Group 2. Inclusion: 35 patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for open surgery, Exclusion:
      Dementia, CPAP treated sleep apnea Methods: Patients are investigaged before and 2 days after
      surgery with Lung-function measurements, blood-gas sample, questionnaire (only before
      surgery), Overnight polysomnographic sleep apena recordings including oro-nasal airflow,
      thoraco-abdominal respiration belts, chin-EMG, EOG, EEG, ECG (V5) and body position.

      Outcome variables: Effect on sleep apnea, sleep parameters, blood-gas and lungfunction before
      and after surgery. Complications of surgery including anastomosis insuficiency and wound
      infections. Short and long term mortality. Detailed morphologic analysis of cancer type.

      Group 3. Inclusion: 25 patients with colorectal cancer scheduled for laparoscopic or robot
      surgery.

      Exclusion: Dementia, CPAP treated sleep apnea Methods: Patients are investigaged before and 2
      days after surgery with Lung-function measurements, blood-gas sample, questionnaire (only
      before surgery), Overnight polysomnographic sleep apena recordings including oro-nasal
      airflow, thoraco-abdominal respiration belts, chin-EMG, EOG, EEG, ECG (V5) and body position.

      Outcome variables: Effect on sleep apnea, sleep parameters, blood-gas and lungfunction before
      and after surgery. Complications of surgery including anastomosis insuficiency and wound
      infections. Short and long term mortality. Detailed morphologic analysis of cancer type.
