  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether separate- versus same-day preoperative
      consultation affects time to treatment (start to finish), utilization rate of Mohs, rate of
      case cancellations, cost, and patient satisfaction. The investigators hypothesize that
      patients with same-day preoperative consultation will have a shorter time between cancer
      diagnosis and removal but, only when coordination of care is needed, longer time between
      removal and consultation with other specialists, as compared to patients with separate-day
      consultation. The investigators anticipate that patients with same-day preoperative
      consultation will have a decrease in travel cost as compared to patients with separate-day
      consultation. The investigators expect that there will be no difference in various
      satisfaction matters between groups, with the exception of potentially greater convenience
      reported by patients in the same-day preoperative consultation group. Finally, the
      investigators hypothesize that there will be no difference between groups in regards to rates
      of surgery cancellation.

      Procedure: Prospective trial which randomly assigns patients to either separate- or same-day
      preoperative consultation for Mohs surgery. A phone consultation will take place, which will
      assist in determining whether the patient is appropriate for enrollment into the study. If
      so, the patient will be randomized to either separate-day or same-day preoperative
      consultation.

      Materials: Patient survey

      Methods of data collection: The patient-specific data obtained from the medical record will
      include: Patient age, number of previous skin cancers, preoperative size, history of
      cutaneous surgery, employment status, and distance between home address and dermatology
      facility. Outcome measures that will be obtained from the medical record will include: Time
      between cancer diagnosis, removal and defect repair, rate of proceeding with Mohs as opposed
      to other treatment options, and rate of cancelling surgery (due to site discrepancy,
      anticoagulation issues). A survey will be used to assess patient satisfaction.
