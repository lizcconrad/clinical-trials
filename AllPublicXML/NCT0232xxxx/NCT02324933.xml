    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the value of dosing pain medications based upon a patient's
      pre-operative tolerance to pain medications. Study participants will be assigned to one of
      two groups, a treatment group and a control group. The treatment group will be given pain
      medications after surgery based upon their measured response to pain medications prior to
      surgery. The control group will be given pain medications based upon the normal dosing
      routine as is currently practiced. Both groups will be closely monitored for side effects and
      have their pain scores recorded for the first 48 hours following surgery.

      This study will focus on patients who are opioid-tolerant pre-operatively, a patient
      population which typically has both higher pain scores and more complications related to
      analgesics than opioid na√Øve patients. Currently, there is no standardized system for
      determining an adequate pain control regimen for a patient post-operatively. At this
      institution, pain medications are dosed per physician preference. The most widely-discussed
      method for calculating tolerance to opioids relies on converting a patient's daily opioid
      consumption to a morphine equivalent dose and basing a pain regimen upon that number. This
      method does not account for variability of response to different medications or dosing forms
      however. It would be advantageous to have a method of dosing opioid pain medications in this
      population that is both safe and effective.

    <description>In the operating room a fentanyl infusion will be started at 2 mcg/kg/min. The time from start of the infusion to respiratory depression(rate &lt; 5 breaths/minute) will be used to calculate the effect-site concentration (Ce).Using the pharmacodynamic model calculated by the Stanpump PCA software, the infusion will continue intraoperatively to achieve a fentanyl Ce of 30%. In the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), the rate would be changed with the following parameters:
50% of the hourly dose is given as a basal infusion
The remainder of the hourly dose is ordered as a demand dose q 15 minutes. Post-operatively, the basal rate is adjusted according to the average demand dose use. In patients using &lt; 1 demand dose per hour, the basal rate is decreased by 20%. In patients using &gt; 3 demand doses per hour, the basal rate is increased by 20%. Patients whose pain cannot be managed by this protocol will be removed from the study and pain management will revert to the primary service.</description>

    <description>Patients in the best practice arm would receive pre-operative sedation in the operating room comparable to the dose normally given in the Ambulatory Surgery Unit as a &quot;simulated fentanyl challenge&quot;. Best practice (control) patients will be followed by the Pain &amp; Palliative Care team in order to make adjustments in pain management as required by the patients.</description>
