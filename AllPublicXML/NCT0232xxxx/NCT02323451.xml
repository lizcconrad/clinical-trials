  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of investigational products in the treatment of
      knee Osteoarthritis. Half of participants will receive medical chitosan, while the other half
      will receive sodium hyaluronate.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical chitosan and sodium hyaluronate each form the reticular layer to cover the joint
      surface, alleviate the joint friction and pain. For medical chitosan, its half-life is longer
      than sodium hyaluronate, so the interval time of intra-articular injection is longer.
