  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently conservative treatment for patients of childbearing affected by cervical cancer is
      reserved for women with FIGO stage IA2 - IB1 with tumor size less than 2 cm . The
      trachelectomy and the cone biopsy with pelvic lymphadenectomy are the choice for these
      patients wishing to preserve their reproductive function.

      In this context , recently literature show the results about the use of neo-adjuvant
      chemotherapy about the reduction of tumor volume and therefore the magnitude of the
      subsequent surgical treatment (including patients with tumors larger than 2 cm ). So it
      becomes crucial a prospective analysis on the possibility to include in this type of
      treatment patients with stage IB1 and IIA1 with tumor size greater than 2 cm ( up to 4 cm ) .

      The current study , in fact , would like to do a prospective evaluation on the advantages of
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the possibility of broadening the inclusion criteria to
      conservative treatment in women , suffering from cervical cancer, stage IB1 and IIA1 ( with
      tumor volume between 2 and 4 cm) and wishing to preserve their reproductive function.
