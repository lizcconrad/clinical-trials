    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder with chronic multi-system manifestations
      affecting 100,000 individuals in the US, largely of minority origin and associated with
      substantial morbidity, premature mortality, individual suffering, healthcare costs and loss
      of productivity. Disease modifying treatments such as Hydroxyurea, chronic blood transfusion
      and curative bone marrow transplantation are offered to patients based on physician
      preference and current practice informed by clinical trials. Decision aids are tools that
      could help translate evidence from these sources into practice by helping clinicians involve
      patients in making deliberate choices based on accessible information about the options
      available and their outcomes and to help them make decisions based on their values and
      preferences.

      The overarching goal of this project is to develop and implement a web based decision aid
      individualized to patient characteristics to help patients with SCD achieve more accurate
      perception of risks and benefits of treatment options and make decisions in congruence with
      their values and preferences.

      The investigators will conduct needs assessment interviews as indicated by the data for
      saturation and validation of findings. The investigators will conduct beta testing of the
      web-based decision aid to clarify development and validate findings. The investigators will
      use a randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of a web-based decision aid to give
      patients accurate information about risks and benefits of therapies and enable them to make
      decisions based on their individual values and preferences.

      To provide accurate information to patients and caregivers about the risks and benefits of
      various treatments for sickle cell disease and to enable them to make informed and involved
      therapeutic decisions based on their values, preferences and stated goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major public health problem in the United States with an
      estimated 100,000 individuals living with this disease. It is associated with significant
      morbidity caused by pain crises, acute chest syndrome, stroke, pulmonary hypertension, leg
      ulcers and irreversible organ damage. Quality of life is impaired in children and adults with
      this disease 3-6 and productivity is impaired, with a 40-60% unemployment rate in adult
      patients. The disease results in premature mortality, with a median age of death of 38 years.
      In 2010, there were approximately 100,000 hospital discharges in the United States for which
      SCD was the principal diagnosis. Mean hospital charges per admission were $15,000, with the
      total annual charges in the US exceeding $1.5 billion. Approximately 70% of the patients were
      on government sponsored medical insurance, predominantly Medicaid and Medicare. Sickle cell
      disease is thus the archetype of the chronic multisystem disease predominantly affecting a
      minority, disadvantaged population.

      Hydroxyurea (HU) has been demonstrated in placebo controlled multi-center clinical trials to
      be efficacious in reducing complications such as vasocclusive pain crises and acute chest
      syndrome in children and adults with SCD and in improving survival in adults. It is the only
      disease-modifying therapy and the only drug approved by the FDA for use in patients with SCD.

      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been demonstrated to be curative in patients with
      SCD. Only a minority of patients who meet eligibility criteria for transplantation, however,
      proceed with the treatment even when a matched sibling donor is available. The low
      utilization of curative strategies for SCD appears to be partly attributable to a lack of
      information about the technologies available to facilitate transplantation.

      There are minimal data about patient-related barriers to and attitudes towards, the use of
      curative therapies in SCD. A systematic review of the research on barriers to care in
      patients with SCD did not identify any studies that specifically addressed patient-related
      barriers to the use of Hydroxyurea. The attitudes of patients with SCD toward the use of
      hydroxyurea (HU) therapy may contribute to the underutilization of HU in the United States,
      yet our understanding of these attitudes is limited. Of patients who have never taken HU,
      half reported receiving no information about HU, and 85% report believing that they would
      receive no improvement if they were to take HU. In making choices regarding transfusion,
      transplantation or HU, families are most influenced by perceived efficacy and safety. Thus
      significant gaps remain in the understanding of patient perspectives, in the provision of
      accurate information about risks and benefits of therapies and of incorporating patients'
      values and preferences in offering treatment options. Thus, there is a need for research that
      helps to understand patient values and preferences and determines how to help patients make
      informed treatment decision in congruence with their values and preferences.

      Hypothesis

      The investigators overarching hypothesis is that a web based decision aid individualized to
      patient characteristics can improve knowledge and help patients with SCD achieve more
      accurate perception of risks and benefits of treatment options and is associated with lower
      decisional conflict than standard care. To test the hypothesis the investigators propose the
      following specific aims:

      Aim 1: Develop a health literacy sensitive, web based, decision aid to help patients with
      sickle cell disease make informed choices about treatment options such as hydroxyurea,
      chronic blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation and standard comprehensive care.

      Aim 2: To estimate in a randomized clinical trial the effectiveness of the decision aid
      tailored to individual patient characteristics on patient knowledge, patient involvement in
      decision-making and decision-making quality, when compared with usual care.

      Research Questions:

        1. What are the needs of patients with sickle cell disease and their parents/caregivers
           when considering treatment options for sickle cell disease?

        2. Does the use of a decision aid result in improvement of patient knowledge, patient
           involvement in the decision, the congruence of their decision with their values and
           preferences?

      Methods

      Study Design for Qualitative Interviews Decisional Needs Assessment:

      Consent in-person or via telephone and 30-45 minute interview using semi-structured
      open-ended question guide developed based on Ottawa Decision Support Framework workbook,
      Decisional Needs Assessment in Populations. Interviews audio recorded, transcribed verbatim
      and analyzed for merging themes. Demographics obtained include but not limited to age,
      gender, education level, role in sickle cell disease. Data results will inform development of
      a web-based decision aid tool.

      Study Design for Beta Testing:

      Consent in-person or via telephone and 30-45 minute interview using semi-structured
      open-ended question guide developed based on cognitive interview techniques while web-based
      decision aid tool is viewed via internet using a computer or tablet. Demographics obtained
      include but not limited to age, gender, education level, role in sickle cell disease. Data
      results will inform editing and revision of the web-based decision aid tool.

      Study Design for Testing Decision Aid:

      Cohort A: a randomized controlled trial using mixed methods for the use of a web based
      decision aid to give patients with sickle cell disease and parent/legal guardian of children
      with sickle cell disease accurate information about risks and benefits of therapies and
      enable them to make decisions based on their individual values and preferences. Participants
      will complete surveys before, soon after and within 4 months following discussion with an
      health care provider to determine impact of the decision aid on knowledge, involvement in the
      decision and on decisional conflict, quality and uptake and adherence with the therapies.
      Qualitative semi-structured interviews will be collected to gather additional information
      related to decision making. The control group will participate in a cross-over design,
      receiving the decision aid tool after completion of the initial phase of the study. An
      additional qualitative interview will be collected regarding decision making.

      Cohort B: a mixed methods descriptive study design to determine the impact of the decision
      aid on quality and comprehension of information, and impact on daily life relating to
      management of sickle cell disease in patients &lt;18 years of age.

      Cohort C - To better understand the effect of the decision aid in decision making and patient
      involvement as reported by the physicians consenting these patients (child and adult) for
      treatment will be asked to participate in the study. Health care providers will not be
      randomized.
