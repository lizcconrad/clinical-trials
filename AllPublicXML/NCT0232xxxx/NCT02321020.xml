      The present study aimed at evaluating mid-term results of radiofrequency modified maze
      procedure in mitral patients in terms of sinus rhythm and atrial contractility restoration

      Atrial fibrillation presents with different frequencies in patients affected by structural
      heart diseases requiring surgery, showing a peak incidence of up to 60-80% in mitral
      subjects. It causes an increased risk of systemic embolism, cardiac failure development and
      higher limitations due to dyspnoea and fatigue on exercise. Cox-Maze technique for surgical
      atrial fibrillation treatment was first used in 1987 and suffered lots of modifications since
      then. Nowadays, most centers have replaced the &quot;cut and sew&quot; technique by other methods using
      several power sources to achieve the same target in a much easier way. One of the alternative
      energy source currently used is radiofrequency ablation which has been demonstrated to be a
      simple, safe and reproducible procedure with an acceptable success rate in terms of sinus
      rhythm restoration. However, organized atrial activity (sinus rhythm on surface
      electrocardiogram) is not always accompanied by an effective mechanical atrial contraction,
      whose restoration represents one of the original Maze objective. Atrial contraction is
      effective when A waves are found in tricuspid and/or mitral transvalvular flow using Doppler
      echocardiography, allowing the patient to fully profit from hemodynamic and clinical
      advantages of an organized atrial contraction. Predictive factors of atrial contractility
      recovery and, more widely, of sinus rhythm achievement after modified Maze procedures have
      been investigated, but, at our knowledge, a parallel deep analysis and comparison of possible
      determinants of both surgical ablation goals is still lacking. In the present study, the
      investigators describe mid-term results of concomitant modified radiofrequency Maze in a
      large homogeneous population of mitral patients, focusing onto common predictors of sinus
      rhythm and atrial contractility restoring, their time course appearance and interrelation.

    <description>All patients were evaluated with 2-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography by the same cardiologist at 3,6,12 and 24 months in order to specifically monitor left atrial contractility presence. Transmitral flow velocity was measured with pulsed Doppler echocardiography, with a sample volume positioned at the level of the mitral tip in the apical four-chamber view and was recorded on a strip chart at a paper speed of 100 mm/s. Peak velocity and the time-velocity integral of the early filling wave (E wave) and of the late filling wave (A wave) were determined. A/E ratio, representing atrial contribution to ventricular diastolic filling, was obtained. Each measurement was obtained as an average of 6 to 8 consecutive beats. Atrial mechanical activity was considered present if an atrial filling (A wave) was detected in late diastole after the electrocardiogram P wave.</description>

    <description>Radiofrequency energy was used to create continous endocardial and epicardial lesions mimicking most of the left atrial incisions set as described in the Cox Maze III procedure. In the first 70 patients a monopolar technology was employed (Cardioblate Surgical Ablation Pen, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA - cooled tip cardioblate pen, power ranging from 25 to 35 W), while in the subset of patients who underwent surgery after July 2005 a bipolar device was used (Cardioblate BP2 Irrigated RF Surgical Ablation System, Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The tip of both types of RF probe was irrigated with saline at room temperature at a flow rate of 4-6 ml/min.</description>
