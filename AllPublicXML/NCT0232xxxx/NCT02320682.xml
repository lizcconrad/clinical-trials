  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study of 32 patients, age 50-69 years, healthy unless osteoarthritis in one hip,
      randomized in two groups (16 each) plus a reference group of same 32 patient´s contralateral
      healthy hip.

      Intervention will be surgery with a total hip arthroplasty. The four studied endoprosthetic
      components are:

        -  Cemented Exeter stem (Stryker Warsaw, USA) with a ceramic 32 mm head and Palacose cement
           with gentamycin, applied with 3:rd generation cementation technique.

        -  Uncemented Lubinus SP-CL stem (Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany) with a ceramic 32 mm
           head.

        -  Uncemented Delta PF cup (Limacorporate spa, Udine, Italy).

        -  Uncemented fibrous metal Delta TT cup (Limacorporate spa, Udine, Italy). Both cups will
           have cross linked Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHWMP).

      Clinical score, radiography and uptake of Fluoride tracer will be analyzed.
