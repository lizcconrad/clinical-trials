  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase II study is to evaluate the use of labelled RGD ligand in
      PET/CT to predict and/or to early assess the efficacy of chemotherapy including an agent with
      antiangiogenic effect.

      The predictive value of this approach will be determined by independent assessors on basis of
      data at the end of the treatment: RECIST 1.1 criteria for CT or MRI, PERCIST criteria for FDG
      PET/CT, clinical, endoscopic and histological findings.

      Prospective, multicentre, open label, phase II clinical trial with diagnostic
      radiopharmaceutical on efficacy and tolerability of 18F or 68Ga labelled RGD peptide for
      detection of malignant tissues expressing integrins, to predict the therapeutic response of
      lesions of advanced head and neck cancer or advanced non-small cells lung cancer to treatment
      including an agent with antiangiogenic effect.

    <description>The value of pretherapeutic and interim RGD PET/CT (Pretherapeutic: D -14 to -1 before the initiation of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent. Interim : 21 to 1 day before the third cycle of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent) to early predict the therapeutic response of head and neck cancer or non-small cell lung cancer to chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent. Final therapeutic response will be assessed at the end of the treatment, up to 24 weeks after first examination, according to criteria RECIST 1.1.
Potential risk for the patient: two intravenous administrations of investigational product (Pretherapeutic : D -14 to -1 before the initiation of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent. Interim : 21 to 1 day before the third cycle of chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agent) each of them followed by PET/CT acquisition</description>
