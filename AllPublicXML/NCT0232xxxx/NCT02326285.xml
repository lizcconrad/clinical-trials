      This study is designed as a single arm, un-controlled, open-label, multi-center hypothesis
      generating two-stage phase II trial. It is based on the assumption that the proposed
      treatment scheme doubles the rate of pathologic complete remission in Mutated epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFRmt) + NSCLC patients compared to historical control data from
      standard treatments.

      Patients with NSCLC and activating EGFR mutation in stages II, IIIA and IIIB eligible for
      induction therapy with docetaxel and cisplatin and gefitinib

      Patients will be treated for 12 days with gefitinib 250 mg/day p.o. (d -12 to -1) and induced
      with chemotherapy docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 d1+2 and intercalated gefitinib
      250 mg/day d4-20 (cycle 1 and 2) and d4-17 (for cycle3). Surgery is planned in the 4th week
      after d1 of the last cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the notion that neoadjuvant combination of Chemotherapy (CTx) and intercalated TKI
      is clinically beneficial, which can be inferred from prior study data and single case
      reports, this study aims to generate additional information on feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of this treatment approach in a larger group of EGFR mutated NSCLC patients. This
      study is a hypothesis generating two-stage trial for future phase III studies of neoadjuvant
      CTx with intercalated TKI. Hence, the study design relies entirely on a single treatment arm.
      To demonstrate efficacy it is sufficient to compare to historical data of the conventional
      treatments of NSCLC.
