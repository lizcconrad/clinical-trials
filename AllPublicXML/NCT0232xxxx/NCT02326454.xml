  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the safety and efficacy of a photosensitive drug (talaporfin sodium)
      activated by an intraurethrally placed drug-activating device. Two different light doses will
      be tested against placebo groups in this 4-arm study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 192 patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS caused by BPH will be randomized in a
      2:2:1:1 ratio to receive a single treatment of talaporfin sodium activated by light at one of
      two light doses or placebo (saline) with light at either dose. Follow-up is planned for 52
      weeks from the day of treatment, with assessment at 12 weeks for change in International
      Prostate Symptom Score and continued follow-up during the remaining 40 weeks to assess
      duration of effect, need for any intervention, and longer-term safety.

          8. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤10 ng/mL.

          9. Post-void residual (PVR) volume ≤200 mL measured by a urinary catheter or bladder

          1. Any minimally invasive or surgical treatment within the last 12 months, and is not
             currently undergoing intraprostatic injections for BPH or any other prostatic
             condition. In any case, all enrolled subjects must have, at Baseline cystoscopy, an
             appearance/presentation of the prostate that is consistent with BPH and compatible
             with possible response to the study test treatment.

          2. Subjects weighing &gt;200 Kg.

          3. Subjects with a history or current evidence of any of the following:

               1. A bladder disease or condition co-exists, such as idiopathic over-active bladder
                  (OAB) and is evaluated by the Investigator as the predominant etiology for the
                  subject's voiding symptomatology. A score of 4 points or greater on the 3 item
                  OAB Awareness Tool (OABV3) or a high rate of urinary frequency (&gt;13xday and/or
                  4x/night) would require investigator specific evaluation in ascribing these
                  symptoms to a bladder condition as opposed to lower urinary tract obstruction. i)
                  If the former is the assessment, then the subject requires exclusion from the
                  study. ii) If the latter is the assessment, then the subject may be deemed
                  eligible for inclusion.

                  signs of infection or negative urine culture. Must not have had a previous
                  symptomatic urinary tract infection within 4 weeks of the study.

               3. Urethral stricture or any other anatomical feature that would complicate

                  the last 12 months.

               7. Any other absolute indication for urosurgical intervention (such as acute or
                  frequent retention, currently untreated bladder or urethral stones, urethral
                  strictures/bladder neck contracture (BNC)).

               8. Damage to the bladder neck which could interfere with study procedures.

          4. PSA level in excess of &gt;10 ng/ml. If the PSA measurement is 2.5-10 ng/ml and/or has
             shown a clinically significant concerning increase in the last 6 months, local
             standard of care must be pursued to ensure the possibility of prostate cancer has been
             followed up and ruled out prior to study entry.

          5. Subjects who had had a prostate biopsy within 6 weeks prior to Screening.

          6. Any neurological condition affecting the bladder or a history of a neurogenic or
             chronically decompensated bladder i.e. neurogenic bladder, Parkinson's disease,

             pulmonary diseases that are clinically relevant.

             clinically insignificant will be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator, after
             discussion with the Sponsor's Medical Monitor/Study Physician, if appropriate. If a
             subject has 1 isolated test result outside the specific range that is deemed
             potentially clinically significant, rescreening may be allowed at the discretion of
             the Investigator, after discussion with the Medical Monitor/Study Physician

         18. Subjects with known disorders of coagulation, apart from those receiving anticoagulant

             until 28 days afterwards.

         21. Subjects with medical or investigation results deemed unfit for study treatment, as
             determined by medical history, clinical laboratory tests, ECG results, and physical
             examination that, in the Investigator's opinion, preclude entry into the study.

         22. Subjects who have received an investigational medicinal product within 30 days or 5
             half-lives of the investigational product prior to study entry (defined as the start
