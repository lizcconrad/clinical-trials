  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research for two reasons. The first is to see how the retina
      (back of your eye) changes when your blood sugar is treated with medication for the first
      time. This will help us better understand the progression of a condition known as Diabetic
      Retinopathy. The second reason is to provide diabetic blood samples, which will possibly help
      identify biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy. Biomarkers are things that indicate the
      presence of a specific condition, and indicate a higher likelihood of developing that
      condition.

      The goal of this research is to conduct a study that investigates (1) how diabetic
      retinopathy progresses when poorly controlled Type 2 diabetic patients initiate intensive
      blood sugar control and (2) to determine if there are biomarkers that predict progression of
      diabetic retinopathy. Typically, the retina is thought to undergo rapid progression of
      diabetic retinopathy, although this has been poorly characterized in a formal study.

      The first goal will be quantified by taking initial photos of the retina with the Pictor Plus
      hand-held fundus camera, as well as monthly photos (when the patient is scheduled for their
      endocrinology appointments, throughout a 90 day period). The second goal will be accomplished
      by testing the patient's blood. There will be an initial blood withdraw, as well as blood
      withdraws at monthly intervals throughout the same 90 day period as the fundus photos.

      This study will help us to understand the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, as well as
      potentially lead to an improved understanding of progression of diabetic retinopathy.
