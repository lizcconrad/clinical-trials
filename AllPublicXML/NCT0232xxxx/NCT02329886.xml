    <textblock>
      China, efforts are underway to respond to an unprecedented epidemiologic transition, with
      soaring rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart disease and stroke. Yet there
      may be limitations in translating observations and findings derived from Anglo-based
      population studies. As such, there is a critical need for population-based studies that
      provide insight into the risk factors, incidence, and outcomes of CVD in China. The Qingdao
      Port Health Study is a population-based prospective cohort study of employees of the Qingdao
      Port Group, China, designed to investigate the burden of CVD and risk factors (e.g.,
      sociodemographic, biological, environmental and clinical factors) associated with disease
      onset and outcomes.

      In Qingdao Port, annual health assessments are offered at 3 on-site health clinics. The
      annual health assessment consists of a questionnaire, physical examination, laboratory tests,
      bio-sampling, and imaging examinations.In each year, demographics information, medical
      history, medication use and adherence, family history,lifestyles (e.g., nutritional intake;
      physical activity; smoking; alcohol use/abuse), menopause (including hormone use) and quality
      of life were collected by trained researchers.In 2013, blood and saliva samples were
      collected. Follow-up health assessments are performed every year. The outcomes of
      cardiovascular disease (angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke,
      revascularization), non-communicable diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal
      failure, liver disease and cancer), and all-cause death are collected from local medical
      insurance database.This study aim to surveillance of cardiovascular and other
      non-communicable diseases (risk factors, health outcomes and trends) and investigate of
      socio-cultural, biological, behavioral, social, and environmental factors on work
      performance, cardiovascular disease onset and cardiovascular health outcomes.
