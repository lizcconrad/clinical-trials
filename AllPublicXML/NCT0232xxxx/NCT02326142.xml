  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of a single dose of OBE001, an
      oral oxytocin antagonist, given for up to 7 days to delay preterm birth by 7 days compared to
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a multi-centre, randomised, parallel group, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study in pregnant women with threatened preterm labour between 34^0/7 and
      35^6/7 weeks of gestation.

      The study will be in 2 parts as follows:

        -  from screening until the day of delivery (including a treatment period up to seven days)

        -  a maternal and neonatal follow-up period from the day of delivery until 28 days post
           expected term date (or until 28 days post-delivery should this be later).

      In addition, there will be an observational, safety follow-up of the infants for 2 years to
      evaluate developmental outcome.
