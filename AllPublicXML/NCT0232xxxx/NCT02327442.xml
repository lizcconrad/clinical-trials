      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, biodistribution, dosimetric properties of
      the positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical agent 68Ga-NOTA-NFB. To
      preliminarily evaluate its application in glioma diagnosis.

      To assess the application of 68Ga-NOTA-NFB PET/CT in the evaluation of the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer before and after the therapy.

      6 healthy volunteers with whole-body PET/CT scans 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 hours after
      tracer injection (mean dose, 4.93 Â± 0.10 mCi) will be performed. During the imaging period, 1
      mL blood samples will be obtained specifically at 1, 3, 5, 10, 30,60, 90, 120, 150, and 180
      minutes after the injection, for time-activity curve calculations. The estimated radiation
      doses will be calculated by using OLINDA/EXM software.

      8-10 patients with glioma will be enrolled for the clinical study of diagnosing glioma, they
      will be performed with both 68Ga-NOTA-NFB PET/CT and18F-FDG PET/CT scans before surgery. The
      preoperative images are compared and correlated with the pathologically report. Next, the
      expression of CXCR4 will be determined by immunohistochemical staining of the resected brain
      tumor tissues.

      30 patients with breast cancer will be underwent 68Ga-NOTA-NFB PET/CT and18F-FDG PET/CT scans
      before and after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SUV of lesions before and after therapy will
      be contrasted.
