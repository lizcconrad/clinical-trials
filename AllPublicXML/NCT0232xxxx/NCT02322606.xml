    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple ascending
      dose study in Japanese healthy male participants to assess the safety, tolerability and PK
      following single and multiple oral doses of TAK-137.

      This study is composed of 2 parts, a Single Dose part (Cohorts 1 to 3) and a Multiple Dose
      part (Cohorts 4 to 6). Up to 48 participants will be enrolled.

      Single dose part (Cohorts 1-3): Single Dose, 3 dose levels, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized,
      Double-Blind.

      Each cohort will include 8 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to either
      TAK-137 or placebo treatment group within each cohort with an allocation ratio of 6:2.

      The planned dose levels to be studied are 5, 10 and 20 mg. The principal investigator will
      consult with the sponsor and the medical specialist as needed and will determine go/no-go for
      the next cohort.. The dose in Cohorts 3 may be reduced to 2 mg/day instead of 20 mg/day if
      the principal investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, considers it appropriate.

      Multiple dose Part (Cohorts 4-6): Multiple Dose, 3 dose levels, Placebo-Controlled,
      Randomized, Double-Blind.

      Each cohort will include 8 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned to either
      TAK-137 or placebo treatment group within each cohort with an allocation ratio of 6:2.

      The planned dose levels to be studied are 5, 10,and 15 mg, however for Cohort 5 and 6, the
      dose level may be amended based on the safety and tolerability data obtained from either
      Cohorts 1-4 from this study or emerging data from the multiple rising dose study conducted,
      in parallel in the United Sates (TAK-137_102). The principle investigator, in consultation
      with the sponsor, will determine the dose levels for cohorts 5 and 6 (Not exceeding 20mg).

                  that suggest a clinically significant underlying disease, or the participant has
                  the following lab abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate
