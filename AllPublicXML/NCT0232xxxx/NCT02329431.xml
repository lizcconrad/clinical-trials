      The goal of this study is to develop an intervention to teach activation skills to Latino
      parents who bring children for mental health services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority population in the US; by 2050, 2 in 5
      children will be Latino. Latino children are disproportionately affected by poverty and other
      factors associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorder. However, Latino children with
      mental health needs are half as likely to use services as children in white non-Latino
      families. Latino families are more likely to report problems getting services, lack of a
      usual source of care and a medical home, and dissatisfaction with the care they receive.
      Unmet mental health needs, in turn, are associated with poor outcomes over the lifespan, both
      economic and social. Assessing the comparative effectiveness of interventions to overcome
      these disparities is a major national health priority central to PCORI's mission and mandate.

      Activation is a promising focus of research to eliminate disparities because it reflects a
      set of attitudes and skills that people can use to reduce disparities. Our work provides
      evidence that activation in Latino adults is associated with better quality health care and
      outcomes; and in African American parents with greater child mental health service use. There
      is need for further research on parent-focused interventions founded on culturally meaningful
      concepts to address these needs and disparities.

      Objectives:

      The long-term goal of this research is to improve the mental health care and outcomes of
      Latino children with mental health needs. The proposed study will examine the comparative
      effectiveness of an activation intervention for Latino families raising children with mental
      health needs by means of three aims:

      Aim 1. To identify parent-reported facilitators of Latino child mental health service use
      amenable to change through parental activation Aim 2. To test the comparative effectiveness
      of an adapted psycho-educational intervention to teach activation skills adapted for Latino
      mothers of children with mental health needs compared to a parent support group control Aim
      3. To enhance the intervention, based on parent input and lessons learned from the first
      trial, and test its comparative effectiveness with a parent support group control

      Methods:

      Qualitative and quantitative data from Latino mothers who have a child with mental health
      needs (n=294) will be used in a difference-in-difference mixed effects approach to address
      these aims.

      Projected Patient Outcomes:

      The proposed study will provide evidence of the comparative effectiveness of an enhanced,
      culturally sensitive, advocacy skills intervention to build activation among Latino families
      and improve service use of their children with mental health needs compared to a preliminary
      adaptation of an existing intervention and to a usual care discussion group. Activation
      skills are a promising strategy to improve child mental health service use and to bridge
      cultural differences and disparities with wide-ranging impacts consistent with PCORI's
      research agenda.

    <measure>Patient Activation Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) captured parent activation on behalf of their child. The PAM is an adult self-report 13-item scale with 4-level Likert responses and scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate higher activation. It is valid with excellent reliability. The PAM has been translated into Spanish and has been used successfully in Latina/o patient and general populations (mean=40). The PAM has also been used to measure activation of parents on behalf of their children (mean=70). A change of 4 points in the PAM is associated with improved health behaviors in the general population.</description>

    <measure>8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). The PHQ-8 is scored on a scale from 0 to 27; a higher score reflects greater severity of depression. It has excellent validity and reliability. The parent PHQ-9 has been translated into Spanish and used successfully in Latina/o populations. A change of 5 points in the PHQ-8 is associated with a shift in level of depression.</description>

    <measure>Parental Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parent stress was measured with the 17-item Parental Stress Scale. The Parental Stress Scale is scored on a scale from 0 to 75, where higher scores reflect greater stress. It has been translated into Spanish, and has been shown to have excellent validity and reliability (for women, mean=22).</description>

    <measure>Parent Activation, Qualitative</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>We collected qualitative data on parent-provider communication after completion of the 4-week MePrEPA (metas, preguntar, escuchar, preguntar para aclarar/goals, questioning, listening, questioning to clarify) and parent support groups, in an effort to capture observed activation. We coded when the parent disagreed with therapist and when the parent mentioned speaking with child's teacher.</description>

        <title>Patient Activation Measure</title>
        <description>The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) captured parent activation on behalf of their child. The PAM is an adult self-report 13-item scale with 4-level Likert responses and scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate higher activation. It is valid with excellent reliability. The PAM has been translated into Spanish and has been used successfully in Latina/o patient and general populations (mean=40). The PAM has also been used to measure activation of parents on behalf of their children (mean=70). A change of 4 points in the PAM is associated with improved health behaviors in the general population.</description>
