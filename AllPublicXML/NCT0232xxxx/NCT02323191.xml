  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, global study will evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and activity of emactuzumab and atezolizumab administered in combination in
      participants with selected locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that are not amenable
      to standard treatment.

      Participants who receive emactuzumab and atezolizumab will continue to receive study drug as
      long as they experience clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator or until
      unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as
      determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy
      results (if available), and clinical status, or withdrawal of consent.
