      This study included forty individuals divided into 3 groups. Group A; 10 systemically healthy
      control subjects not receiving medication.

      Group B; 15 Patients who were previously diagnosed with OLP presented in acute exacerbation
      were treated with topical corticosteroids; Triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog in orabase:
      Bristol-Myers, Squibb, Spain) applied topically 4 times a day i.e. following each meal and at
      bed time for one month.

      Group C; 15 Patients who were previously diagnosed with OLP presented in acute exacerbation
      were treated with both topical corticosteroids; Triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog in orabase:
      Bristol-Myers, Squibb, Spain) applied topically 4 times a day i.e. following each meal and at
      bed time for one month in addition to green tea tablets 200 mg (Green tea extract 5:1, El
      Obour For Modern Pharmaceutical Industries) as one tablet a day also for one month.
