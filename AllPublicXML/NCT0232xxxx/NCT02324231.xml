  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a multi-center open-label cluster-randomized controlled parallel-group multiple crossover
      non-inferiority trial in children and adolescents up to 20 years diagnosed with cancer
      requiring chemotherapy, primarily the safety, and secondarily the efficacy and other
      endpoints, of a high (39.0°C) versus low (38.5°C) temperature limit defining fever (TLDF) for
      the diagnosis of fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (FN) is studied. Safety is
      assessed by the rate of safety relevant events per chemotherapy exposure time, a composite
      endpoint including serious medical complications and bacteremia during FN. Patients are
      repeatedly randomized (cluster: study site) to the high or the low TLDF every month,
      resulting in possible multiple crossovers in one patient. The high TLDF is declared not to be
      inferior regarding safety compared to the low TLDF if non-inferiority of the rate ratio of
      safety relevant events is proven, with a single-sided non-inferiority margin of 1.33,
      applying mixed Poisson regression.
