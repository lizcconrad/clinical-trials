    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is one of the traditional Chinese practices widely used in China for more than
      3000 years. In recent years, the use of acupuncture within infertility has gained popularity
      all over the world, but there is no research describing the use of acupuncture in infertility
      of incompletely obstructive fallopian tube. In this paper, we present a research design
      evaluating the effects of acupuncture on incomplete fallopian tube obstructive infertility.
      This is a randomized, control acupuncture and signal-blind trial. A total of 120 patients
      will be enrolled in this study and will be randomized into two groups. True acupuncture plus
      hydrotubation or control acupuncture plus hydrotubation will be performed for 12 weeks. The
      purpose of this paper is to evaluate the additional value of acupuncture on the tubal patency
      rate and pregnancy rate beyond Hydrotubation ,therefore to guide clinical.

    <description>The treatment group will receive true acupuncture and hydrotubation,Hydrotubation (80,000 U gentamicin , 400U chymotrypsin , 5mg dexamethasone , 50ml 0.9% saline) will be performedwithin 3 7 days after the menstruation[12].We use a manometer to measure the pressure and record the number on a card, then calculate the gap of the first and last time,it continues 3 menstrual cycles. The points (points used for every participant of treatment group) include bilateral RN4、CV6、CV3、EX-CA1、ST36、SP6,All the needles will be keep in positions for 30 min.Acupuncture will be performed three times per week,for a total of 36 sessions (12 wk)</description>

    <description>The control group will receive control acupuncture and hydrotubation.Hydrotubation (80,000 U gentamicin , 400U chymotrypsin , 5mg dexamethasone , 50ml 0.9% saline) will be performed within 3 7 days after the menstruation[12].We use a manometer to measure the pressure and record the number on a card, then calculate the gap of the first and last time,it continues 3 menstrual cycles.Two needles will be inserted in each arm, one in each shoulder and one in each upper arm at nonacupuncture pointsAll the needles will be keep in positions for 30 min. Acupuncture will be performed three times per week,for a total of 36 sessions (12 wk).</description>

    <description>For RN4、CV6 CV3 and EX-CA1, needles will be inserted vertically to the abdominal muscles. The acupuncturist can feel resistance from the tip of the needle when touching the muscles and continues to insert it to a depth of 2-3 mm and stops. For ST36 and SP6, needles will be inserted vertically to a depth of 25 mm. The needles will be manipulated with an even lifting and twisting method three times to achieve the sensation of deqi.</description>
