  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 25 subjects will be enrolled and receive a standard WHO adult potency BCG
      immunization (1cc/50mg live mycobacilli) in the deltoid. Following a wait period after BCG
      vaccination, patients will then receive standard strength BCG intravesical therapy once a
      week for a total of 6 weeks. The BCG is instilled and held in the bladder for approximately 2
      hours. While the BCG is retained in the bladder the patient should be repositioned every 30
      minutes to maximize bladder surface exposure to the agent. Patients will undergo a cystoscopy
      every 3 months following most recent TURBT. Study duration last approximately 6 months.

    <description>Every patient meeting eligibility criteria will receive a standard WHO adult potency Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunization (1cc/50mg live mycobacilli) in the right or left deltoid. Following a 19 - 31day wait period after BCG vaccination patients will then receive standard strength BCG intravesical therapy returning once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. Cystoscopy will be performed at 3 and 6 months.
Interventions: BCG immunization in deltoid and BCG intravesical therapy once a week for 6 weeks.</description>
