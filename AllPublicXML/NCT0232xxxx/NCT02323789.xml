      To assess whether intravenously administered third-party bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
      stromal cells (MSCs) are safe and have an impact on disease severity in RDEB

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II clinical trial with a key objective of evaluating safety of third party
      bone MSCs intravenous infusions in 10 adults with the inherited severe skin fragility
      disorder, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The main objectives of our study
      are to: (1) to assess the spectrum of clinical responses in adults with RDEB receiving
      intravenous MSCs; (2) to identify the best cohort of individuals to target for future trials
      and therapies; (3) to improve our understanding of in vivo and in vitro responsiveness to
      MSCs; (4) to identify candidate molecules germane to activating MSCs and making them
      clinically more potent, independently of the permissive conditions of the patient and (5) to
      assess its impact on reducing disease morbidity/severity in this population.

      This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label study. All study participants will receive
      two intravenous MSC infusions at baseline Day 0 and Day 14 and will be followed up for a 12
      month period following the first infusion. Each subject will undergo an initial screening
      including physical examination, assessment of vital signs and disease severity assessment.
