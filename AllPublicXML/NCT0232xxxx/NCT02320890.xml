  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether the transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) improves the cognitive function in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment
      (MCI)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-four patients were recruited and randomized to receive either real- or sham-tDCS over
      the left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Their legally
      responsible caregivers were provided with mobile tDCS device, and were instructed to use it
      on the patients at the hospital. 30-minute session of the stimulation were applied 3 times a
      week for 12 weeks. The patients were evaluated at baseline and at Week 12.
