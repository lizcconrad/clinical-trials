  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Which is more adequate general anesthetic agent, desflurane or propofol, for emergence and
      recovery time, and perioperative oxygenation in lung resection surgery?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to investigate the effects of desflurane on oxygenation (prevention of
      HPV) of OLV compare with propofol which is used in general anesthesia for lung resection.

      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) wiill be used to measure pulmonary blood flow during
      surgery visible and successively. To confirm the effect of HPV by measuring the change in
      pulmonary blood flow. The correlation between the blood oxygen concentration and attenuation
      of blood flow will be investigated.
