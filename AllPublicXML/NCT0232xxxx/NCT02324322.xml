      in the device.

      Currently, the treatment of muscle and bone deterioration after SCI is very limited;
      therefore, there is a definite need to further understand the mechanism of breakdown in the
      musculoskeletal system after a SCI, and, more importantly, find a clinical strategy that will
      treat muscle and bone loss.

      This pilot research grant will collect results that will be used for the design of a
      multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether a Robotic Exoskeleton
      training [100 sessions; 1hr/session; 4-5 sessions/week] can improve musculoskeletal outcomes
      more than other current interventions. If the overall objective is to use the progression of
      technology to enhance functional ambulation for persons with a spinal cord injury, then the
      investigators need to evaluate the health benefits associated with continual use of the
      device.

      The study will be a prospective, single-group, repeated measure design using a 2 -month lead
      in to establish stability, 5-month intervention phase and 2 -month follow-up phase for
      retention will be performed. Each participant will be used as his or her own control. This
      project will be completed at two sites: Kessler Foundation will be the lead site that will be
      under the direction of Dr. Gail F Forrest (Principal Investigator) and Spinal Cord Damage
      Research Center, James J Peters VA Medical Center under the direction of Dr. Ann M. Spungen
      (collaborator). Both sites have exoskeletal-assisted walking programs.

    <description>To examine the effectiveness of robotic exoskeleton-assisted over ground walking (5 hrs. p/wk, 100 sessions, 20 wks = 100 hrs) to induce positive changes in muscle volume and structure of the lower limbs for non-ambulatory persons with SCI. Combined with our current training protocol where people step 1500-2000/session we predict that the 2,000 lower extremity muscle contractions will be sufficient in our proposed exoskeletal study.
MRI's will be performed to accurately assess muscle CSA of each lower limb to determine individual's muscle thigh and shank volume.
Muscle Biopsies for the quadricep muscle will be performed to determine changes in BMD and bone structure due to intensive exoskeleton assisted walking.</description>

    <description>Needle Biopsies for Quadricep Muscles will be performed to define changes in BMD and Bone structure with intensive exoskeleton assisted walking. This procedure includes having a trained physician make a small skin incision, after numbing the area over the muscle, and then removing a tiny sliver of muscle to study under the microscope. Three separate biopsies for one incision will be obtained. The biopsies will be performed at baseline, 7 days, and after the intervention.
