    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystemic autosomal dominant disease that is
      characterized by the development of benign neoplasms in brain, kidney, lung, skin and heart.
      TSC is caused by mutations in TSC1 and/or TSC2 genes, which encode, respectively, hamartin
      and tuberin, that are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle and
      protein synthesis. Most patients exhibit dermatological, renal, neurological and pulmonary
      (lymphangioleiomyomatosis, LAM) manifestations. Neurological involvement include subependymal
      nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas and cortical tubers. LAM is characterized by
      the proliferation of LAM cells around the airways, blood vessels and lymphatics, which result
      in vascular and airway obstruction and cyst formation. The most frequent TSC manifestation in
      the kidney is the development of angiomyolipomas (AML). Dermatologic lesions represent the
      most common manifestations of TSC, mainly hypomelanotic macules and facial angiofibromas. The
      most significant functional implication of the tuberin-hamartin complex is its regulatory
      role upon the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 lead to
      increased mTOR activity and favor tumor development and growth. All lesions associated with
      TSC, sporadic LAM and sporadic AML share a common molecular pathogenesis, based on TSC1/TSC2
      mutations and mTOR hyperactivity. Up to date, TSC patients have been followed in separated
      medical services in our institution, according to their predominant phenotype. The current
      knowledge, however, suggest that the ideal follow up of such patients should be conducted in
      an integrated fashion among the specialties associated with the main disease manifestations.
      Experts in TSC from each of these areas have recently created a TSC/LAM/AML integrated
      program in the University of São Paulo Medical Center, and his project will be initiated with
      the generation of an integrated TSC/LAM/AML registry, which intends not only to clinically
      characterize this patient population but also to document the employed treatment modalities.
      Once this first goal is achieved, clinical trials are planned to be performed. The central
      aim of this observational study is to clinically characterize the TSC/LAM/AML subject
      population followed and referred to the University of São Paulo Medical Center. Specific
      aims: To characterize the pulmonary, the neurological, the renal and the dermatologic
      phenotypes of this patient population.

      1. Introduction Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multisystemic autosomal dominant
           disease , that is characterized by the development of histologically benign neoplasms in
           brain, kidney, lung, skin, heart and eyes, as well as by central nervous system (CNS)
           disorganization. TSC is caused by mutations in TSC1 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1)
           and/or TSC2 genes, which encode, respectively, hamartin and tuberin, proteins that form
           a complex involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle and protein
           synthesis. Although the majority of organs are susceptible, most patients exhibit
           dermatological, renal, neurological and pulmonary manifestations.

           Involvement of the CNS responds for most of TSC morbidity and include subependymal
           nodules, subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA) and cortical tubers, alterations
           prone to lead to ventricular obstruction, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, intellectual
           disability and psychiatric problems.

           Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease that is characterized by the
           proliferation of LAM cells around the airways, blood vessels and lymphatics, which can
           result in vascular and airway obstruction and cyst formation. LAM occurs sporadically or
           in association with tuberous sclerosis complex. The main clinical features are dyspnea,
           pneumothorax and chylothorax.

           The most frequent TSC manifestation in the kidney is the development of angiomyolipomas
           (AML), a tumor derived from perivascular epithelioid cells that comprises abnormally
           organized blood vessels, smooth muscle cells and adipose tissue. AML affects 60-80% of
           TSC patients, but it also occurs sporadically. The main AML-related complication is
           renal hemorrhage, the most common cause of mortality in adults with TSC.

           Dermatologic lesions represent the most common manifestations of TSC, mainly
           hypomelanotic macules and facial angiofibromas.

           The most significant functional implication of the tuberin-hamartin complex is its
           regulatory role upon the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Mutations in TSC1
           or TSC2 lead to increased mTOR activity and favor tumor development and growth.
           Interestingly, all lesions associated with TSC, sporadic LAM and sporadic AML share a
           common molecular pathogenesis, based on TSC1/TSC2 mutations and mTOR hyperactivity.

           A number of studies have shown potentially beneficial effects of mTOR inhibitors on LAM
           and TSC patients with SEGA and AML, including sirolimus and everolimus. Such positive
           effects, however, are heterogeneous among these manifestations and critical pieces of
           information are lacking to define the true roles of mTOR inhibitors on each of TSC
           manifestations, as well as the sporadic forms of LAM and AML.

        2. Study rational The University of São Paulo Medical School is the main and largest
           medical complex in Latin America. Up to date, TSC patients have been followed in
           separated medical services in our institution, according to their predominant phenotype.
           The current knowledge and therapeutic perspectives, however, suggest that from this
           moment on the ideal follow up of such patients should be conducted in an integrated
           fashion among the specialties associated with the main disease manifestations, ie,
           neurology, pulmonary, nephrology, urology and dermatology. Experts in TSC from each of
           these areas have recently come together to create a TSC/LAM/AML integrated program in
           the University of São Paulo Medical School, with the aim of building a Brazilian TSC
           Reference Center. This center is expected to provide integrated clinical follow up of
           TSC patients. We also expect to bring this center to a reference status for the entire
           country.

           This project will be initiated with the generation of an integrated TSC/LAM/AML
           registry, including all TSC and LAM cases and selected AML patients according to
           potential severity. This database is planned to be fed and accessed by all physicians
           included in the current proposal. Such this registry intends not only to clinically
           characterize this patient population but also to document the employed treatment
           modalities. Once this first goal is achieved, strategic and well-designed clinical
           studies are planned to be performed, including clinical trials with mTOR inhibitors.

        3. Objectives 3.1. Primary objective The central aim of this observational study is to
           clinically characterize all patients with TSC, LAM and AML followed and referred to the
           University of São Paulo Medical School.

           3.2. Secondary objectives

           - To characterize the pulmonary phenotype of this patient sample, by integrating
           conventional clinical findings with radiological and pulmonary functional test features.

             -  To characterize the neurological phenotype of the analyzed patient population, by
                composing the clinical observations with radiological findings and surgical and
                post-surgery follow-ups.

             -  To characterize the renal phenotype of the evaluated patient population by
                integrating the clinical findings with radiologic alterations and surgical and
                post-surgery follow-ups.

             -  To characterize the dermatologic phenotype of this patient population.

             -  To establish data about loss of productivity and hospitalizations during the study
                in the analyzed patient population.

        4. Study design This is an observational study that aims to describe mainly respiratory,
           neurological, renal and dermatological features of the all patients with TSC, LAM or AML
           followed at the University of São Paulo Medical Center. The study also aims to establish
           the impact of these diseases on loss of productivity and also to establish data about
           hospitalizations during the study in the patient population. This proposal intends to
           expand the comprehension of TSC pathogenesis and manifestations and to create a robust
           platform to perform interventional clinical trials.
