  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory disease with the etiology of
      bacterial plaque and is associated with a number of putative bacterial species. The
      periodontal destruction is substantially mediated by the host, driven by the bacterial
      challenge. The presence of pathogenic bacteria with the absence of so-called &quot;beneficial
      bacteria&quot; and the susceptibility of the host are the main aetiological factors of periodontal
      diseases.
