        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of OSA, based on AHI 10~60 (as assessed per baseline PSG).

          -  Subject understands the study protocol and is willing and able to comply with study
             requirements and sign the informed consent form.

          -  BMI ≦ 28.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor nasal patency as evidenced by the inability to breathe through the nose with the
             mouth closed.

          -  Oral cavity infection or any other oral or dental condition or problem that would
             limit subject use of the device. (e.g. dentures, loose tooth/teeth, temporomandibular
             joint (TMJ) conditions, or any oral or dental condition that the Investigator believes
             could be exacerbated by the Sleep Therapy System.

          -  History of any OSA surgical treatment including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty surgery
             (UPPP), maxillomandibular advancement surgery (MMA), radio frequency (RF) ablation
             treatment, palatal stent devices, etc.

          -  History of allergic reaction to silicone.

          -  Any concomitant diagnosed or suspected sleep or chronic neurological disorders, other
             than OSA, including insomnia, and central sleep apnea.

          -  Currently working nights, rotating night shifts, planned travel across four or more
             time zones required during study period, or within two weeks prior to study
             enrollment, or sleep schedule not compatible with sleep lab practices.

          -  Current use of medication or other treatment which, in the investigator's opinion, may
             pose additional risk to the subject or confound the results of the study.

          -  Potential sleep apnea complications that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             affect the health or safety of the participant, including: low blood oxygen, recent
             near-miss or prior automobile accident due to sleepiness, reported history of severe
             cardiovascular disease (including New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV
             heart failure, CAD with angina or myocardial infarction (MI)/stroke in past 6 months,
             uncontrolled hypertension or hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias), reported respiratory
             disorders, or use of medication or other treatment which may pose additional risk to
             the subject or confound the results of the study.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant during the study period.
