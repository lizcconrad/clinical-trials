      This is an open-label sequential pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy glucose-6-phosphate
      dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal Thai subjects at Faculty of Tropical medicine, Mahidol
      university.

      The 16 subjects have already participated in a healthy volunteer studies in the past either
      i) Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally Administered
      primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) in Healthy Adult Subjects or ii)
      Comparison of the electrocardiographic effects in relation to Pharmacokinetic profile of
      chloroquine and piperaquine in healthy Thai subjects

      Every subject was administered a single dose of three tablets of DHA-PQP from previous
      studies. To avoid unnecessary exposure of DHA-PQP again, we propose to include the results of
      DHA-PQP arm from these previous studies and ask the healthy subjects to participate this
      study for receiving only single dose of three tablet of DHA-PQP (40mg/320mg) and two tablet
      of Mefloquine (250mg) on first admission and single dose of two tablet of Mefloquine on
      second admission.

      Artemisinin resistance poses the greatest threat to current global initiatives to control and
      eliminate malaria. The World Health Organisation recommends the use of the artemisinin
      combination therapy (one partner drug combine with artemisinin as the back bone) (ACTs)
      instead of the single drug. The reduction in artemisinin sensitivity has left partner drugs
      within ACTs exposed too much larger number of parasites and unsurprisingly cure rates with
      ACTs have begun to fall substantially.

      Recently, the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) has applied for and
      received funding for an extension of the TRAC project. The proposed extension project, named
      TRACII, will further map artemisinin and partner drug resistance in the South-East Asian
      region. Also, TRACII aims to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics and
      efficacy of a novel combination of an artemisinin-derivative and two long acting partner
      drugs, piperaquine and mefloquine.

      It is necessary that the potential drug-drug interactions of mefloquine and
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) are characterized. Piperaquine and Mefloquine are
      both metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (abbreviated CYP3A4) enzyme which potentially results
      in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse
      reactions or therapeutic failures because of the suboptimal drug exposures to the parasite.

      The study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction and safety profile focusing on the
      cardiogenic effect (QTc prolongation) of this triple combinations of DHA-PQP and mefloquine.
      Piperaquine and Mefloquine are both metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme which
      potentially results in clinically significant drug-drug interactions.

      These safety and pharmacokinetic data will be translated to support the intervention in the
      Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration II (TRACII) project.

      This is an open-label sequential pharmacokinetic study in 16 healthy G6PD normal Thai
      subjects. The 16 subjects have participated in a healthy volunteer studies in the past either
      i) Open-Label Study to Evaluate Potential Pharmacokinetic Interaction of Orally Administered
      primaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Healthy Adult Subjects or ii) Comparison of
      the electrocardiographic effects in relation to Pharmacokinetic profile of chloroquine and
      piperaquine in healthy Thai subjects in which they were administered a single dose of three
      tablets of DHA-PQP. To avoid unnecessary exposure of other healthy subjects to this study, we
      propose to include the result of these previous studies and ask the healthy subjects to
      participate from regimen 1 and onward.

      Subjects will be admitted in the inpatient ward to receive 2 drug regimens: regimen 1
      (Mefloquine with DHA-PQP) and regimen 2 (Mefloquine). Every subject will have 1 screening and
      2 admissions in the hospital

             the drug half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication
             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety; the investigator will take advice from the manufacturer
             representative as necessary.

          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-life, or twice the duration of the biological
             effect of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication.

          9. The subject is unwilling to abstain from ingesting alcohol within 48 hours prior to
             the first dose of study medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic
             sample during each regimen.

         10. Subjects who have donated blood to the extent that participation in the study would
             result in more than 300 mL blood donated within a 30-day period. Note: This does not
             include plasma donation.

         11. Subjects who have a history of allergy to the study drug or drugs of this class, or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.

         13. Aspartate transaminase (AST) or Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;1.5 upper limit of normal
             (ULN)
