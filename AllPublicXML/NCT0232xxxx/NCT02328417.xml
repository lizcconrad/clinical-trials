      This is a prospective non randomized study of two cohorts, one defined by the usual protocol
      and the other one by the application of accelerated recovery protocol. It's discarded a
      priori a prospective randomized trial, since it does not seem feasible to avoid byass of
      control group when synchronizing the active intervention and control. Subjects surgery will
      be followed after discharge for a minimum of 90 days, and thereafter according to protocol of
      each center. Patients will be provided with a satisfaction survey 90 days after surgery.

      The degree of compliance with the protocol will be assessed through a checklist indicating
      compliance with each of the steps of the protocol in both groups. All patients will sign an
      informed consent for the study authorizing the use of their clinical data for statistical
      analysis.
