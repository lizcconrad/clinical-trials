          -  Completion of, if applicable, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, antibodies and
             immunoconjugates including brentuximab vedotin and/or another investigational drug
             which could interact with this trial not less than 4 weeks (or 5 half-lifes of the
             drug, whatever occurs later) prior to first dose of study drug

          -  Completion of, if applicable, an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) at least
             3 months prior tofirst dose of study drug

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
