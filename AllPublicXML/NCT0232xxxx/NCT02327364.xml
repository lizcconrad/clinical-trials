      The purpose of this 3-year, multi-site, non-randomized, prospective, observational study is
      to characterize the natural history of Pearson Syndrome. The Syndrome is a rare mitochondrial
      disorder due to a large-scale mtDNA deletion. Children typically present in their 1st two
      years of life (most in infancy) with anemia and/or pancreatitis. Most individuals with
      Pearson Syndrome die in childhood. Those who survive evolve to Kearns-Sayre Syndrome/Chronic
      Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (KSS/CPEO) although accurate survival estimates are not
      yet known.

      All patients with confirmed Pearson Syndrome who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be offered enrollment into this study. Patients followed at participating NAMDC clinical
      sites will be enrolled at those sites. Patients who are not followed at participating NAMDC
      clinical sites and wish to participate may contact one of the member sites directly or their
      local doctor may direct them to one of the member sites. Both male and female patients from
      all racial and ethnic backgrounds who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      encouraged to participate. Children and adults will be eligible to be enrolled, but we expect
      the patient population to be mostly children.

      Each patient with Pearson Syndrome who enrolls in the NAMDC Clinical Registry will be
      encouraged to participate in this study. Each patient enrolling in this study will be
      required to enroll in the NAMDC Clinical Registry either prior to or upon enrolling in this
      study. Demographic, medical history, biochemical, histological, genetic, and other clinical
      data from the registry will be incorporated into this study.

      Every effort will be made to minimize the inconvenience to patients of participating in this
      study. The studyâ€”related activities at each patient visit will be kept to a maximum of one
      hour, and will, whenever possible, be scheduled to coincide with the patient's regular
      follow-up with his or her treating physician. This study is observational and has no
      associated medical procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All individuals of any age with confirmed Pearson Syndrome are eligible to
             participate. Pearson Syndrome requires the presence of a large-scale mtDNA deletion
             along with sideroblastic anemia with or without pancreatic insufficiency.

          2. All patients must agree to participate in the NAMDC Clinical Registry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient does not fulfill criteria for Pearson Syndrome

          2. Not willing to participate in the NAMDC clinical Registry
