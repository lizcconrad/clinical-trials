    <textblock>
      The goal of the current trial is to assess the feasibility of a newly developed prototype of
      a cell phone app called VillageWhere. VillageWhere is designed to improve clinical outcomes
      of youth with externalizing behavioral problems by improving parental monitoring of youth
      whereabouts and activities while increasing the delivery of rewards to teens for good
      behavior. This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) proposal seeks to develop
      and conduct initial feasibility testing of the VillageWhere prototype. The primary features
      of the prototype include location monitoring via smartphones' global positioning system (GPS)
      functionality as well as facilitating teen self-appraisal of meeting behavioral expectations.
      Good behavior is rewarded with points that are tracked by the app and can be used to redeem
      for real-world rewards. The investigators will conduct an 45-day open trial (N=20
      caregiver/teen dyads) to assess use, feasibility and acceptability for teens involved in the
      juvenile justice system or otherwise struggling with externalizing behavioral problems.
      Caregivers and teens will be assessed at baseline, before receiving the app, and at the end
      of the app use period (45 days). The therapist of each caregiver/teen dyad will also be
      assessed at the end of the app use period. Primary outcomes include: use of app features,
      monitoring of teen behavior and whereabouts, delivery of real-world rewards, and feasibility
      and acceptability. Secondary outcomes include: parenting behaviors, externalizing teen
      behaviors and internalizing teen behaviors.

    <textblock>
      VillageWhere was pilot tested with a sample of 16 youth and their primary caregiver
      participating in an EST for a serious conduct problem (Mean age 14.6 years, 52% male, 56%
      African American, 33% were previously arrested). After completing baseline self-report
      measures, dyads used the app as desired for 4 weeks, then participated in a post-assessment
      and qualitative interviews. App usage by both parents and youth was high with little
      diminished use over the four weeks of the trial. All parents set and used reinforcers for
      functional behavior and used the &quot;find my teen&quot; feature; 84% set geolocation expectations for
      youth's whereabouts at specific times; and 88% set other expectations for the youth (e.g.,
      finish homework), viewed notifications, and regularly used the &quot;Find My Teen&quot; feature. As
      expected, parents interacted with the app frequently: 2.4 times per day. Youth used the app
      on average four times per day. All youth earned and redeemed points for complying with their
      parent's expectations and routinely viewed their behavior plans (93.3%) and feedback
      notification messages (86.7%). Parents did not on average use coaching videos (20%).

      Although the study was not powered to detect statistical significance, a series of paired
      t-tests were conducted to examine pre- to post-changes on self-report measures. Changes for
      parents and youth all were in predicted directions, with effect sizes ranging from small to
      high (average d = .42, range .21-.80). Parents reported greater use of positive parenting
      behaviors (i.e., rewards and praise), greater discipline consistency, lower overall perceived
      stress, a higher feeling of influence over youth behavior, and greater parenting efficacy.
      Youth reported increases in parent use of positive behaviors, consistency, and knowledge of
      whereabouts. Parent- and youth-reported change in youth aggression and rule-breaking (as
      measured by the CBCL/YSR).

      Qualitative results were also positive. Using 7-point scales, parents and youth reported on
      app satisfaction three times/week. Parent ratings were high (M = 6.0) across items (e.g.,
      &quot;The app was helpful today,&quot; &quot;I have ways to intervene with my teen&quot;). Youth satisfaction
      scores were also high (M = 6.1; e.g., &quot;My parent is noticing &amp; rewarding my good behavior;&quot;
      &quot;I liked getting app prompts &amp; reminders&quot;). Parents reported that the app helped them trust
      their youth, increase their use of rewards, and made giving rewards easier; they also
      reported a reduction in youths' &quot;excuse-making.&quot; Youth perceived that the app allowed them
      more freedom, because parents had an objective way of verifying their whereabouts. Nearly all
      youth (89%) liked that their parent was more consistent in paying attention to their positive
      behaviors and rewarding them for it (versus only being punitive). Both parents and youth
      described significant improvements in their relationship.

      In addition, 16 therapists working with the parent-youth dyads also gave qualitative feedback
      that was highly positive. Therapists stated that they liked the extra accountability the app
      afforded to teens and the reduction in parent-youth communication issues.

    <measure>Achenbach System of Empirically-Based Assessment, Aggression Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post assessment (end of 45-day app use period)</time_frame>
    <description>The Achenbach System of Empirically-Based Assessment is a measure of youth problem behavior and psychiatric symptomatology that has parallel parent (report of teen) and youth (self-report) versions to allow for different perspectives on the problem. The parent version is called the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the youth version is called the Youth Self Report (YSR). Selected subscales from the CBCL and the YSR were administered before and after the 4 weeks of app usage, in this case, the aggression subscale. Higher values indicate worse symptoms. Possible range on this subcale is 0 - 36; a score of 13 or higher indicates clinically significant aggression, defined as aggression that is higher than that of 93% of teens in the United States.</description>

      <recruitment_details>We completed a four-week within-subjects pre-post trial to determine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility. MST therapists in Seattle, New York City, Hartford, and Washington, DC referred families to the study. Parents contacted the study team to indicate their interest. Therapists of referred families also were enrolled in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Initial App Set Up: Clinicians were solely responsible for assisting families to set up their app; however, many clinicians were uncomfortable with this because they were not “tech savvy”. Solution: Phase II will include a self-guided setup tool that will empower users (parents, youth) to complete the set up independently.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Achenbach System of Empirically-Based Assessment, Aggression Subscale</title>
        <description>The Achenbach System of Empirically-Based Assessment is a measure of youth problem behavior and psychiatric symptomatology that has parallel parent (report of teen) and youth (self-report) versions to allow for different perspectives on the problem. The parent version is called the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the youth version is called the Youth Self Report (YSR). Selected subscales from the CBCL and the YSR were administered before and after the 4 weeks of app usage, in this case, the aggression subscale. Higher values indicate worse symptoms. Possible range on this subcale is 0 - 36; a score of 13 or higher indicates clinically significant aggression, defined as aggression that is higher than that of 93% of teens in the United States.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events were informally monitored throughout the 4-week period during which time parents and teens were using the app. Also, most families had their baseline assessment sessions 1-2 weeks prior to the start of app use, and their post-assessment 1-2 weeks after finishing their use of the app. Thus, adverse events were informally monitored for the entire study period, for most families, approximately 8 weeks.</time_frame>
      <desc>Since the study was non-medical, participants were NOT at risk of a mortality event, i.e., the intervention involved use of a phone app only. Participants were also not at risk for a serious adverse event involving &quot;a life-threatening event, hospitalization, or incapacity/disability.&quot; As a social science study, our participants may have had some risk of Other including Not Serious Adverse events, such as embarrassment or discomfort answering psychologically- and behaviorally-oriented questions.</desc>

          <title>Use of VillageWhere App Prototype</title>
          <description>In this single-arm study design, all enrolled caregivers and teens used the VillageWhere App Prototype that was developed for this study. They were requested to use it as often as they would like throughout the duration of the trial. The app is designed to be used several times throughout each day. Thus, the risk was identical for both parents and teens, since both experienced the app as the only intervention (i.e., there was no comparison group who did not use the app).</description>
