  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the treatment of Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC), there
      remains an unmet medical need to identify and optimise additional treatment for those
      patients with early prostate cancer who are at greatest risk of relapse following first-line
      treatment with curative intent.

      This is a phase I study investigating the feasibility and tolerability of a short course of
      neoadjuvant treatment with olaparib, either as a monotherapy or in combination with
      degarelix) given in the window-of-opportunity prior to radical prostatectomy in men with
      early, localised intermediate-/high- risk prostate cancer. Our primary objective is to
      determine the pharmacodynamic biomarker effects of olaparib (a PARP inhibitor) in this
      patient population.

      Participants will receive either single agent olaparib or olaparib in combination with
      degarelix (androgen deprivation) for two weeks prior to routine radical prostatectomy. We
      will use immunohistochemistry to quantify changes in the levels of biomarkers of PARP
      inhibition, e.g. PAR, gamma H2AX, pH2A(s129) and Rad51 foci, using tumour samples taken at
      baseline and at the time of radical prostatectomy. An intra-operative prostate biopsy will
      permit us to examine biomarker variability between the samples.

      The incidence and severity of Adverse Events will be documented and we will assess the number
      of trial participants who undergo surgery on schedule. We will assess preliminary evidence of
      tumour response, e.g. pathological changes and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA). We also
      intend to investigate changes to the ctDNA profile by comparing blood samples collected
      throughout the study.

             entry into the trial.

          -  Patients who have received (within last 3 months of trial entry) an investigational
             drug within a clinical trial will not be eligible to participate.

             time points within a 24 hour period or family history of long QT syndrome

          -  Concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval (see Appendix 1) or with
             factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events (such

             undergone treatment with curative intent for prior malignancy with no evidence of
             active prior malignancy are eligible.

          -  With the exception of alopecia, any unresolved toxicities from prior chemotherapy
             should be no greater than CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade 1 at the time of starting
             olaparib treatment.
