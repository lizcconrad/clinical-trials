      International Pachyonychia Congenita Research Registry (IPCRR) is a patient registry for
      those suffering from Pachyonychia Congenita (PC). PC is an ultra-rare extremely painful skin
      disorder that causes painful blisters and callus on feet and sometimes hands, thickened
      nails, cysts and other features. The IPCRR consists of a questionnaire, patient photos,
      physician notes from telephone consultation to validate questionnaire, free genetic testing.

      HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN IPCRR

      Step One. Complete the IPCRR forms which are now available online. The Consent Form protects
      the patient's privacy. The Questionnaire gathers important details that distinguish PC from
      other conditions and helps to identify specific characteristics of each type of PC.

      Step Two. Take photos as shown in the Questionnaire sample photo page. You can upload the
      images online with the Questionnaire. If you prefer, you may email the photos. You may stop
      and start as often as needed before completing the forms. Since the physicians will not meet
      you in person, the photos of your PC are very important.

      Step Three. When the Consent Form, Questionnaire and Photos are received by PC Project, a
      telephone consultation will be scheduled with one of the PC physicians. The physician will
      review the photos and questionnaire responses, and will discuss any questions. There is no
      cost to patient/family for this consultation.

      Step Four. If genetic testing is requested, the physician will discuss it on the call and
      will make the referral for free testing. The patient will then be sent the special saliva
      test kit (no travel required). Usually only saliva is needed and from only one affected
      family member. The sample is collected by spitting into the vial in the kit and mailing it in
      the envelope provided. Genetic testing is complex and time-consuming. It is not like a sugar
      test or pregnancy test and can take many months to be completed, but the testing begins as
      soon as the sample arrives.

      In some cases, a second test must be completed before the testing results are finalized and a
      report can be sent. If the second test is needed, the family will be advised and a simple
      mouth swab kit will be sent for the testing. This requires simply swabbing the inside of the
      cheek with a soft brush from the kit and mailing to the laboratory.

      When the results are finalized, a full genetic testing report is provided to the patient with
      precise information and suggestions specific to their condition. Patients may find the report
      very valuable with physicians or other medical providers as well as for school personnel,
      employers, disability hearings or other special needs. All information is held confidential
      by PC Project and the research reported anonymously. There is no cost to the patient/family
      for any of these tests or for the consultation.
