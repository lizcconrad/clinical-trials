      Background:

      - Researchers want to learn more about breast cancer in Latin American women. They also want
      to learn how and why women respond differently to standard treatment. Tissue and blood
      samples from women with breast cancer are needed to study this disease in order to find new
      ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat it.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about the biology and genetics of breast cancer in Latin American women.

      Eligibility:

      - Latin American women age 18 and older of all ethnic backgrounds who have clinical stage II
      or III breast cancer. They must still be active and able to self-care.

      Design:

        -  Participants are only agreeing to have extra tissue or blood samples collected. They are
           also letting tissue left over from surgery be used for research. No procedures outside
           of standard care will be done.

        -  Participants may have a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests. They may have a
           pregnancy test. They may have an ultrasound, mammogram, and other scans. They may have
           an intravenous needle placed in an arm vein.

        -  Participants may have a core biopsy. For this, a needle is inserted into the breast. A
           piece of tissue is extracted.

        -  Participants who have chemotherapy may have blood taken after treatment/before surgery.
           Tissue may also be collected.

        -  Participants will complete a questionnaire. It will ask about their social and economic
           background. It will ask about their family history of cancer. It will also ask about
           access to diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

        -  Participants may be followed for up to 5 years.

      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the distribution of molecular profiles
      in Latin American women with AJCC 7 clinical stage II or III breast cancer. The molecular
      profiles will be correlated with epidemiological, histological, and clinical characteristics,
      including pathologic response to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, this study
      intends to define a molecular signature that will predict response to neoadjuvant therapy in
      breast cancer. This is a prospective cohort study in which no investigational drugs will be
      administered to participants. The study will be conducted at participating institutions in
      Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay.

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART A OF THE STUDY:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Women age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  AJCC 7 clinical stage II or III breast cancer. Clarification: Participants with
             clinical stage II breast cancer who are later classified as histologically-confirmed
             stage I will remain on study; participants who are later classified as
             histologically-confirmed stage IV breast cancer will be taken off study.

          -  Biopsy-accessible breast tumor or participant candidates for primary surgery.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 1.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Prior history of non-breast malignancy (excluding in situ cancers treated only by
             local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years
             prior to enrollment in this study.

          -  Bilateral invasive or in-situ breast cancer.

          -  Inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  Clinical or radiological evidence of distant metastases by computed tomography (CT),
             chest X-ray, abdominal/thoracic ultrasound, bone scan, and/or liver function tests
             including total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), within ranges defined in eligibility criteria
             for Part B of the study.

          -  Prior hormone therapy, chemotherapy, biologic, targeted therapies, or radiation
             therapy for this malignancy. Prior bisphosphonate therapy is allowed.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women: Effects on a developing human fetus of chemotherapeutic
             agents at the recommended therapeutic dose remain incompletely defined. For this
             reason and because these agents may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential
             must agree to use adequate contraception (double barrier methods of birth control or
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study treatment phase. Should
             a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her study physician immediately.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with chemotherapeutic agents, women who are
             breastfeeding will be excluded. If a participant is of child-bearing potential (women
             are not considered of childbearing potential if they are at least 2 years
             postmenopausal and/or surgically sterile), she must have documented negative serum or
             negative urine pregnancy tests within 14 days of entry to the study (i.e., within 14
             days of signing the informed consent document).

          -  Subjects with psychiatric illness and/or other specific situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements and compromise participant follow-up.

          -  Lack of ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Note: Subjects who were enrolled prior to this amendment will be considered eligible even
        if the HIV/Hep C and pregnancy test were not preformed due to each country standards.

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART B OF THE STUDY:

        Participants, who successfully enrolled into the first part of the study and who, according
        to local institutional guidelines, are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy will
        participate in Part B of the study. Participants must also meet the inclusion and exclusion
        criteria described below.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Histologically confirmed new primary adenocarcinoma of the breast AJCC 7 clinical
             stage II or III. All histological types are included Hormone status: Any tumor ER/PgR
             status, any HER2/neu status as measured by local hospital pathology laboratory
             following US LA CRN standard operating procedures (SOPs).

          -  Normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1500/microL

               -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/microL

               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits, unless participant has
                  Gilbert s disease, for which bilirubin must be less than or equal to 2.0 times
                  upper limits of normal (ULN)

               -  AST serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/ALT serum glutamic-pyruvic
                  transaminase (SGPT) less than or equal to 1.5 times institutional ULN

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiac disease. Baseline left ventricular ejection fraction

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness and/or other specific situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements and compromise participant follow-up.

        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:

        -Latin American women with breast cancer of all ethnic backgrounds will be included in this
        study as participants. There are no expected racial/ethnic differences in the recruitment
        effort.
