      This pediatric study is designed to provide safety information, dosing guidelines, and a
      pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of once-daily hydromorphone hydrochloride (HCl)
      extended-release (ER) tablets in children with chronic painful conditions who are
      &quot;opioid-tolerant&quot; prior to enrollment under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) of 2003.

             currently managed with stable dose of oral or injectable opioid corresponding to at
             least 6 mg of hydromorphone per day for at least 5 days prior to first dose.

          3. Female subjects of child bearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test
             result at Screening and Day 1. If sexually active must be surgically sterilized at
             least 12 months prior to Screening or use contraception at least 30 days prior to
             Screening and for the duration of study participation and for at least 30 days after
             the last dose of study drug.

          4. Male subjects, with reproductive potential, who are sexually active must agree to use
             an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study.

          5. Opioid-tolerant.

          6. Subjects must have established a favorable response to opioid therapy in reducing
             pain.

          7. Subjects must require a minimum dose of 4 mg (1 JURNISTA tablet) and a maximum dose of
             16 mg (1 EXALGO tablet) after determining 66% of the converted dose of hydromorphone
             HCl per day from an established conversion table.

          8. Able to swallow a whole tablet without breaking, crushing, chewing or dissolving.

          9. Expected to require extended opioid treatment for at least 1 week.
