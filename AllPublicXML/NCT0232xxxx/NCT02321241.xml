  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the TITAN study is to describe the clinical practices of a cohort of patients with
      wAMD refractory to ranibizumab (persistence of intra-retinal and/or subretinal fluid) who
      switch to aflibercept after less than 12 months of ranibizumab treatment.

      The study will be conducted in real-life conditions and will allow describing conditions of
      use of aflibercept in patients refractory to ranibizumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is both retrsopective and prospective to collect local real life data on patients
      under routine treatment.

      The observation periods starts on January 2014. Patients who initiated a treatment by
      Aflibercept between the 1st of january 2014 and the 31 December 2015 will be enrolled.
