    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of Polymyxin B for treatment Gram
      negative bacterial infection. The hypothesis of study is Polymyxin B would be the new
      antibacterial agents for Thai Gram negative infected patients in case of desirable outcomes
      and minimal side effects.

      -  Investigator is notified by doctors who take care of gram negative infected patients.

        -  Investigator inform patient or their relatives about all topics in project, eligible
           criteria, method, material and monitoring treatment.

        -  After patient or their relatives are appreciated to join this project, investigator
           collect data in case record form;electronics form, then implement the drug.

        -  Duration of treatment is determined by site and severity of infection, approximately
           7-14 days.

        -  Sample size calculation, by prevalence formula, we estimate the mortality rate about 50
           %, deviation 10 %,and 2-sided 95% Confidence interval, therefore,97 persons

        -  We estimate gather data about 100 persons.

        -  Statistical descriptive analysis for descriptive data.

        -  During the study is performing, all unexpected adverse event definitely report to
           Siriraj institutional Review Board immediately, in addition to subjects or their
           relatives.
