  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggests that repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for brief periods
      (termed intermittent hypoxia) is a safe and effective treatment strategy to promote
      meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The goal of
      the study is to understand the mechanisms by which intermittent hypoxia enhances motor
      function and spinal plasticity (ability of the nervous system to strengthen neural pathways
      based on new experiences) following SCI.

    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence suggests that repeatedly breathing low oxygen levels for brief periods
      (termed intermittent hypoxia) is a safe and effective treatment strategy to promote
      meaningful functional recovery in persons with chronic spinal cord injury. Repetitive
      exposure to mild hypoxia triggers a cascade of events in the spinal cord, including new
      protein synthesis and increased sensitivity in the circuitry necessary for breathing and
      walking. Recently, the investigators demonstrated that daily (5 consecutive days) of
      intermittent hypoxia stimulated walking enhancement in persons with chronic spinal cord
      injury.

      Despite these exciting findings, important questions remain. First, does intermittent hypoxia
      improve walking recovery by increasing strength or muscle coordination or both? Understanding
      its mechanisms will allow us to best apply intermittent hypoxia in the clinic. Second,
      initial studies indicate that the beneficial effects of intermittent hypoxia are greatest
      when intermittent hypoxia is used just prior to task training and that the benefits are
      greatest for the practiced task. The investigators will explore this possibility by examining
      the effects of intermittent hypoxia on walking ability and force production when applied
      alone and when applied in combination with walking training or strength training. The
      investigators expect that the greatest improvements in walking ability for intermittent
      hypoxia with walking training and the greatest improvements in strength in response to
      intermittent hypoxia with strength training. Third, studies suggest that intermittent hypoxia
      induces spinal plasticity by increasing the expression of a key plasticity-promoting protein,
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Mutations in the BDNF gene have been shown to
      impair BDNF functionality. Thus, the investigators will also explore the impact of BDNF
      polymorphisms on responsiveness to intermittent hypoxia therapy.
