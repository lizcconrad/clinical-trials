        Inclusion criteria:

        Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the Core Study
        (Prerandomization and Randomization Phases):

          1. Meets the core clinical research criteria of the NIA-AA for MCI due to AD (which is
             consistent with Prodromal AD) or AD dementia and is 'staged' or classified as either
             MCI or mild to moderate dementia.

          2. Amyloid positive Positron Emission Tomography (PET) image based on centralized PET
             scan reading.

          3. Male or female, age 50 to 85 years, inclusive at time of consent.

          4. Must have an identified caregiver or informant who is willing and able to provide
             follow-up information on the participant throughout the course of the study.

          5. If receiving an Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor (AChEI) or memantine, must have been on
             a stable dose for at least 12 weeks before the Baseline cognitive assessments, with no
             plans for dose adjustment in the foreseeable future. Treatment-naive participants can
             be entered into the study but there should be no plans to initiate treatment with
             AChEIs or memantine at the time of entry into the study.

          6. Must have been on stable doses of all other permitted chronically used concomitant
             medications (ie, not related to their cognitive decline) for at least 4 weeks before
             randomization.

        Participants must meet all of the following criteria to be included in the Open-Label
        Extension (OLE) Phase of the study:

          1. Participants who complete the 18-month treatment and the 12-week follow-up period
             (Visit 20) in the Core Study and whose Visit 20 falls within a 4-week window from the
             start of the OLE Phase (Visit 21). Permission must be obtained from the Medical
             Monitor if the Visit 21 is to occur more than 4 weeks from Visit 20.

          2. Participants must continue to have an identified caregiver or informant who is willing
             and able to provide follow-up information on the participant throughout the course of
             the OLE Phase.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from the Core Study:

         21. Malignant neoplasms within 5 years before Screening (except for basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma in situ of the skin, or localized prostate cancer that did not require
             systemic therapy; these do not exclude the participant).

         22. Medical conditions (eg, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal disease) that
             are not stably controlled, or which, in the opinion of the investigator(s), could

             renal disease) that are not stably controlled, or which, in the opinion of the
             investigator(s), could affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study
             assessments.

         10. Any other clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs, ECGs and laboratory
             tests that would, in the investigator's opinion, affect the particiapant's safety or
