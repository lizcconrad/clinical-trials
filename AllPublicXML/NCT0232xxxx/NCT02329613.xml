  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare 6-month calorie intakes between
      a group of patients receiving a standard dinner and a group of patients whose evening meal is
      &quot;improved&quot;; compliance will be assessed on a food card with 5 levels of consumption: no (0%),
      25%, 50%, 75%, all (100%). This per patient per meal food card will be prepared 3 days per
      month for 6 months and will, from the total calorie intake of each dish, estimate calorie
      intake ingested per day on all meals of the day.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the two groups for the following:

      A. The difference between 0 and 6 months in: the patient's weight, calorie intake, serum
      prealbumin, albumin and CRP, blood sugar for diabetic patients.

      B. Monthly evolution over 6 months: calorie intake, the patient's weight. C. The quarterly
      trend over 6 months: serum prealbumin, albumin and CRP, blood sugar for diabetic patients.

      D. Comorbidities and mortality. E. the risk of morning hypoglycaemia for diabetic patients.
