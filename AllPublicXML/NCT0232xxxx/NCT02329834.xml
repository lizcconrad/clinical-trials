  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of intravenous
      and subcutaneous Furosemide. Although these regimens are not intended to be bioequivalent,
      they are both expected to achieve therapeutic plasma levels and induce effective diuresis.

      The test formulation in this study is a buffered solution, Furosemide Injection Solution at 8
      mg/mL at pH 7.4 (range 7.0 to 7.8) and is intended for SC injection according to the
      instructions in the protocol. A commercial formulation of Furosemide Injection, USP will
      serve as the reference drug in this study, which will be administered by IV bolus. It
      contains furosemide 10 mg/mL in solution at alkaline pH of 8.0 to 9.3 and is marketed for IV
      and IM injection.

      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of furosemide administered by continuous
           subcutaneous infusion using a biphasic delivery profile.

        -  To estimate the absolute bioavailability of furosemide administered by continuous
           subcutaneous infusion compared with an equivalent dose of furosemide administered by
           intravenous bolus administration.

      This study will be an open-label, single-center, single-dose, randomized, two-way
      (two-period) crossover study in 16 adult subjects previously diagnosed with mild to moderate
      heart failure (NYHA class II/III) being treated concomitantly with oral furosemide therapy at
      a dose of ≥ 40 mg/day. Each subject will complete Screening, Baseline, Treatment, and
      Follow-Up Phases. The Screening Phase will be conducted on an outpatient basis between 14 and
      3 days prior to Baseline. Subjects will be instructed to maintain a &lt; 2 gm sodium diet within
      3 days prior to Baseline. Baseline (Day 0) consists of clinical research unit (CRU) admission
      and final qualification assessments. The Treatment Phase will comprise two crossover periods
      separated by a 7-day outpatient fluid re-equilibration washout. Following CRU admission,
      subjects will discontinue oral furosemide at least 24 hours prior to administration of study
      drug for each Crossover Period. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2
      treatment sequences to receive both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) furosemide in
      Crossover Periods (i.e., IV followed by SC or vice versa). Subjects will remain domiciled in
      the CRU for each Crossover Period during the Treatment Phase through 24 hours after
      administration of study drug, after which time they will be discharged if safety parameters
      are acceptable to the Investigator. Oral furosemide therapy will be re-initiated at discharge
      after Crossover Period 1 (i.e., during the 7-day fluid re-equilibration washout) and after
      Crossover Period 2. The Follow-Up Phase will occur 7 days (± 1) after discharge from the CRU
      following Crossover Period 2, completing subjects' study participation.

    <description>Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived using noncompartmental methods. Compartmental modeling of the pharmacokinetic data may be conducted if necessary. Furosemide concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (including N, mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum, and maximum) for each treatment. Derived plasma PK descriptive statistics will be tabulated by dosing group and summary statistics. Descriptive statistics for PK parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUClast, AUCinf, λz, t½, Vz/F, and CL/F) will include the arithmetic and geometric mean (for Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf, only), CV%, SD of the arithmetic mean, median, minimum, maximum, and N.</description>
