  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, approaches that show the most promise for preventing and/or reversing the course of
      childhood obesity involve the delivery of intensive lifestyle interventions within a
      family-based context, emphasizing the necessity of parental involvement and making changes in
      family routines and the home environment. Considering that the current demand for pediatric
      weight management programs far exceed availability, as well as the high attrition rates
      observed in such programs, there is a great need for more accessible and efficient means of
      delivering these interventions to reduce the burden of childhood obesity.

      The goal of this study is to understand whether text messaging and social media platforms can
      be leveraged to address the important issue of childhood obesity by engaging parent/guardians
      in one of these strategies, and whether these strategies produce similar outcomes. No
      existing study has compared these strategies head-to-head, and the investigators believe that
      this project will be instrumental in understanding the determinants of success in these
      strategies and allow us to collect sufficient intelligence to be able to deploy these
      meaningfully to patients as part of usual care.

      The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate and compare the feasibility and effectiveness of
      two platforms, text messaging and Facebook, for delivering an evidence-based, family-centric
      childhood obesity intervention to parent/guardians of children between the ages of 3-6 with a
      BMI of 90th percentile and above. The investigators hypothesize that the use of both
      platforms for delivering a childhood obesity intervention will help establish healthier
      family routines and be equally engaging and accepted by parent/guardians and children.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effect of the intervention on:

        -  Parent/guardian knowledge of healthy family routines (i.e., nutrition, frequency of
           family meals, child's screen time, bedtime routines, physical activity, and sleep hours)
           and of parenting strategies that are preventive of child overweight and obesity

        -  Parent/guardian readiness, confidence, and perceived self-efficacy to make and maintain
           changes in family routines known to be associated with healthy weight outcomes

      The secondary aims of the study are to assess the effect of the intervention on:

        -  The adoption of healthy family routines and parenting strategies that are preventive of
           child overweight and obesity

        -  Daily objective physical activity in the index child by accelerometry (using a physical
           activity tracking device)

        -  Index children's BMI percentile, using data collected during regular clinic visits from
           the electronic medical record

        -  To assess the level of engagement with the intervention, measured via daily activity
           tracker wear by the index child, parent/guardian views of Facebook posts or responses to
           2-way text messages

    <description>The intervention consists of evidence-based information on healthy family routines and parenting strategies adapted for Facebook posts on a private study Facebook group.
Participating parents/guardians will have access to all features of the secret study Facebook group (e.g., create and view postings, comment and like existing posts and view user names of other members of the group (existing study participants and staff) for the duration of the study.
All index children will be provided with a Physical Activity Monitor to wear during waking hours for the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of evidence-based information on healthy family routines and parenting strategies adapted for 140-character text messages.
The automated text-messaging algorithm consists of the delivery of two types of text messages: 1-way messages, in which participating parents/guardians will receive a piece of education or motivation on the dimension topic that they're being coached on and 2-way messages, in which participants are able to respond to an educational message containing a number response prompt that will provide them with personalized feedback regarding a dimension they are being coached on.
All index children will be provided with a Physical Activity Monitor to wear during waking hours for the duration of the study.</description>
