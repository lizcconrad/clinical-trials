  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results after interventions on lifestyle in the secondary prevention of ischemic heart
      disease are not always consistent, and the Guidelines multidisciplinary measures aren't
      easily achievable.

      Therefore, the purpose of this research project is the identification of an interventional
      approach to effective secondary prevention and realistic feasibility, in a field of
      multifactorial risk. The study is open to patients who totaled a double chronic disease,
      obesity/overweight and coronary heart disease, and who experienced a first event of ischemic
      cardiac infarction (AMI). The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a group educational
      intervention in a sample of overweight and obese patients (BMI &gt; 24.9) incurred in a first
      episode of acute myocardial infarction (non-STEMI and STEMI), comparing with the classic
      approach of prescriptive diet therapy.

    <description>The group educational food intervention: it provides the delivery of information leaflet and inclusion in groups on a weekly basis for the first 3 meetings, and then, there are other 2 meetings on the third and sixth month by the AMI.
The meetings will cover education to self-nutrition, physical activity and learning techniques for stimulus control and management of high-risk situations.</description>
