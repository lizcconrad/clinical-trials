      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of antiviral medicine (acyclovir) in
      complete recovery of facial Palsy. Fifty patients (Males and females) with acute Facial Palsy
      within the first 3 days of onset with age ranged from 15-60 years old. Each patient submitted
      to the following clinical evaluation using House and Brackmann6 facial function scoring
      system and Synnybrook grading system neurophysiological assessment of facial nerve and
      muscles before and after the end of treatment and then after the end of first and second
      month of treatment. EMG will be done for facial muscles of both sides beside measuring facial
      nerve excitability to determine the excitation threshold by recording the minimum electrical
      stimulus required to produce visible muscle contraction. A difference greater than 3.5 mA
      between the affected and unaffected side is considered to be significant in terms of poor
      prognosis. Nerve conduction study of facial nerves of both sides using concentric needle
      electrode. Trigeminal Blink reflex for both side of the face. Facial functional recovery was
      defined as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;complete&quot; using the same criteria used in the 2001 practice guideline.
      Using the House and Brackmann6 facial function scoring system, we considered an outcome of
      grade I or II a good recovery.
