    <textblock>
      Ocular chemical burn is one of the cause of vision loss in our country, and there are no
      satisfactory treatment. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the biological
      characteristics of self-renewal, immune regulation, multidirectional differentiation and
      tissue repair. Our preliminary research showed that in corneal alkali injury rats, the MSC
      can accelerated the cornea repair, inhibited angiogenesis. The aim of this study is to access
      the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cell in the treatment of corneal burn in human.

      Corneal burn is a ocular damage disease included chemically burned and thermally burned.
      Surgery of corneal transplantation，amniotic membrane transplantation are some of
      effective,however,these therapy are expensive and the transplantation resources are limited.
      To arrest the inflammatory phase, several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been
      investigated. Corticosteroids also is important, however, long time usage of corticosteroids
      often cause severe side-effects. Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have the
      biological characteristics of self -renewal, immune regulation, multidirectional
      differentiation and tissue repair. Our preliminary research showed that in corneal alkali
      injury rats, the MSC can accelerated the cornea repair, inhibited angiogenesis. Many animal
      research also revealed that MSC have effect on the ocular alkali burned. And subconjunctivity
      injection is efficient, the clinical study of MSC on treating other disease have been
      developed rapidly recently, in further ,the outcome are encouraging, and no side-effect
      related MSC was reported, MSC can come from bone marrow, Umbilical cord blood，Adipose tissue
      and so on, but bone marrow MSC is mostly common used. The investigators propose to assess the
      efficacy and safety of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in the treatment of corneal
      burn in human.
