  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims primarily to measure the expected paramedic consultation announcement
      benefits for the patient, at different levels. It will measure improvements in the management
      of patients treated with chemotherapy. Indeed, paramedical consultation ad aims to provide a
      better understanding of the disease and treatment incurred, which should lead to the
      implementation of joint strategies between the healthcare team and the patient to prevent the
      effects of and treatment of the disease by the patient and caregivers.

      This improvement is to promote the fair treatment by reducing patient anxiety and / or carers
      and involving them in the management of their disease. In this context, it is shown a profit
      of paramedical consultation for the patient, it will work, based on the recommendations of
      the Cancer Plan, strengthen the need to routinely offer paramedic Ad consultation.

      This work should also help measure the impact of ad paramedical consultation on optimizing
      care consumption off-line therapy and to assess the associated costs.

      For patients who received paramedic ad or not consultation, it will therefore be of
      particular compare intercurrent hospitalizations, commuting structure of care, the number of
      consultations with the doctor, the reports of cure, additional biological monitoring or other
      health care consumption.

      With the participation of several centers in the fight against cancer, this study will
      provide valuable information on the practice of paramedical consultation ad in several tumor
      sites.

      It will objectify the benefit provided by the Medical device announcement for both patients
      and the organization and use of care prerequisite to encourage better integration of this
      device in the course of patient care, the consultation paramedical ad remaining poorly
      understood by many health professionals.
