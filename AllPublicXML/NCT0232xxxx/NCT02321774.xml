      Monitor stress response in a virtual reality environment using a wearable sensor to analyze
      and track heart rate variability (HRV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wearable sensor technology is being developed that may allow, for the first time, the ability
      for individuals to better recognized their level of stress in any given situation on a
      continuous basis. A major focus of many of these wearable sensors is being able to accurately
      analyze and track heart rate variability (HRV), which is indicative of primarily
      parasympathetic/vagal tone and emotional state.3 However there is a need to validate the
      reliability of this measured response and understand any inter-individual variability.

      The present study will take advantage of virtual reality scenarios to expose healthy
      volunteers to controlled stressful situations during monitoring with several standardized
      lab-based non-invasive physiological sensors as well as a novel wrist band sensor device to
      track individual response to stress.

        The study population will be made up of 50 adult men and women who are in general good
        health. Individuals will be recruited locally through fliers, word of mouth and email
        blasts to the Scripps community.
