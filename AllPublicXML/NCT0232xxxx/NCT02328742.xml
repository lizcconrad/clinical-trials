  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to describe the level of expression of the biological
      factors involved in the formation of adhesions (Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A,
      inhibin) at the time of a first diagnostic hysteroscopy among women with synechia, another
      intracavitary disease or no intracavitary disease.

      The secondary obectives are:

      A. For women who are found to have synechia or another intracavitary pathology at the time of
      resection: To describe the levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin
      involved in synechia at the time of resection.

      B. For women who are found to have synechia or another intracavitary pathology at the time of
      resection:To describe the levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin
      involved in synechia at the time of a follow-up hysteroscopy following resection.

      C. For women who are found to have synechia at the time of resection:To describe the change
      in levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin involved at the time of a
      follow-up hysteroscopy following resection whether or not the patient converts back to &quot;no
      synechia&quot;.

      D. For women who are found to have another intracavitary pathology at the time of resection:
      To describe the change in levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin
      involved at the time of a follow-up hysteroscopy following resection whether or not the
      patient converts to &quot;synechia&quot;.

      E. To estimate the intra-individual variation in the measured factors (initial biopsy levels
      versus levels at time of resection).

      F. To create an intrauterine map of factor levels according to biopy position (riosteal /
      medium / proximal) for patients with synechia or another intracavitary pathology at the time
      of resection and then follow-up hysteroscopy.

      G. To describe the levels of Transforming growth factor beta, Activin A and Inhibin as a
      function of pregnancy 6 months after resection.

      H. Create a tissue bank associated with the study.
