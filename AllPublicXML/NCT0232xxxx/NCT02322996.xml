      The goal of the current study is to combine existing and new tools for quantifying patient
      self-report to characterize changes in acute pain. The ability to quantitatively measure
      self-report provides behavioral pain phenotypes that can serve as the basis for clustering
      patients into sub-groups based on their self-report of their symptoms, eliminating observer
      based perceptions of patients' pain.

    <textblock>
      Pain is a therapeutic challenge as well as a public health problem that is estimated to
      affect over 116 million American adults [1]; reduces quality of life; and is estimated to
      cost up to $635 billion annually. Growing recognition of the need for evidence-based,
      individual-centered treatment strategies raises expectations that health care will be
      improved by matching proven effective treatments with knowledge of patients' unique
      characteristics to optimize efficacy and safety. Essential to the goal of matching treatments
      to patients to enhance analgesic drug development and therapy is identification of
      intermediate phenotypes that capture the mechanistic complexity, genetic expression and
      epigenetic changes of hundreds of ongoing processes and mediators that influence treatment
      efficacy and safety and may form the basis for differential responses to drug therapy. The
      ability to identify functional variants in the genomic responses to pain and therapeutics at
      the sub-group and patient levels, however, has been limited to date by lack of thorough
      phenotyping for patients with pain.

      The need for a more comprehensive understanding of human phenotypes has spawned a new method
      of phenotyping studies referred to as &quot;deep phenotyping.&quot; Deep phenotyping for
      pharmacogenomic studies requires both breath and depth to better interpret the complexities
      of genomic variations that may underlie individual differences in pain report. One approach
      to address this complexity is to use quantitative testing of clinical features to identify
      more homogeneous subsets within a group of patients with a given diagnosis or characteristic.
      Variations in quantitative measures may identify intermediate phenotypes that are genetically
      less complex yet have potentially stronger signals closer to the site of gene action. In
      pain, quantitative testing is often termed &quot;quantitative sensory testing&quot;, or QST.

    <description>After the surgery and the onset of moderate-severe pain, QST and PROMIS questionnaires will be repeated. Throughout these procedures, patients will rate their pain perception using a numeric rating scale. Approximately 2-3 hours after surgery at the onset of moderate pain, the rescue analgesic (toradol) will be administered via intramuscular injection. Again, QST and PROMIS protocols will be repeated after the drug is given and when patients report pain relief. A standard naproxen dose of 500 mg will be given to patients upon leaving the clinic and they will be instructed to take one pill orally each day before returning for evaluation after 48 hours.</description>
