    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if early administration (i.e. within 12 weeks
      after stroke) of Dysport® 500 U injections may delay the appearance or the progression of
      upper limb symptomatic spasticity.

    <measure>Time Between the Initial Injection and the Appearance of Reinjection Criteria as Evaluated by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Spasticity Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 4 up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The appearance of increased muscle tone was assessed using the MAS (scale ranges from 0 [no increase in muscle tone] to 4 [affected part rigid in flexion or extension]). For confirmation of reinjection criteria appearance, a subject had to have a MAS score in the primary targeted muscle group of ≥2 and at least 1 of the following 4 criteria confirming signs of symptomatic spasticity in the UL:
A Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) pain score ≥ 4 (NPRS ranges from 0 [no pain] to 10 [severe pain])
An impact on passive function measured by a score of ≥ 1 on the 4-point Likert scale (scale ranges from 0 [no impact] to 3 [severe impact])
An impact on active function measured by a score of ≥ 1 on the 4-point Likert scale
An involuntary movements score ≥1 on the 4-point Likert scale in relevant upper limb.
Results are reported overall for subjects with both symptomatic and asymptomatic spasticity.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in MAS of the Primary Targeted Muscle Group.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Increased muscle tone in the primary muscle group (selected by the investigator at the first visit, based on his/her clinical judgement and in agreement with the subject, in one of the following muscle groups: elbow flexors or pronators, wrist flexors, or finger flexors) was assessed using the MAS. Scale ranges from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (affected part rigid in flexion or extension). Least Squares (LS) mean change from baseline to each subsequent visit (including the subject's last study visit) of the MAS score is reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Evaluation of UL Motor Impairment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer assessment is a validated tool for measuring motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning in the upper or lower limbs of subjects with post-stroke hemiplegia. The assessment scale is comprised of 155 items across 5 domains: motor functioning, sensory functioning, balance, joint range of motion and joint pain. For this study, only the UL motor part was assessed using the following criteria:
A. Upper Extremity (from 0 to 36) B. Wrist (from 0 to 10) C. Hand (from 0 to 14) D. Coordination / Speed (from 0 to 6)
Total motor function scores (A-D [from 0 to 66]) were calculated and LS mean changes from baseline up to (but not including) the visit when the reinjection criteria were met were reported.
Higher values for change from baseline indicated a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Changes at Last Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 4 up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Global assessment of changes was assessed by the investigator from Week 4 up to (but not including) the visit when the reinjection criteria were met. This endpoint was assessed by the investigator using a 5-point Likert scale to answer the following question: How does your patient feel compared to his/her condition at the first visit?
Much better
Better
No change
Worse

    <measure>Number of Concomitant Non-drug Therapy Sessions.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The number of non-drug therapy sessions that the subject received for UL spasticity in combination with injections of either Dysport® or placebo - up to and including the subject's last study visit - were recorded in the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) as part of concomitant medications and therapies evaluation at all study visits (Prior and Concomitant Non-Drug Therapies eCRF page). All concomitant therapies in the indication of &quot;Post Stroke UL Spasticity&quot; were counted by subject from first administration of Dysport® or placebo to last study visit. Concomitant non-drug therapies were defined as received any time during study (on or after the day of the first injection of Dysport® or placebo) regardless of the start or stop date. For each subject, overlapping sessions were defined as one therapy session using the earliest start date as the start date and the latest start date as the stop date.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 42 adult subjects with upper limb (UL) spasticity were enrolled into a multicentre, prospective, double-bind, randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study, conducted in four countries (Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The first visit was scheduled within 2 to 12 weeks post-stroke and subjects were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive either Dysport® 500 Units (U) or placebo. Dysport® was expected to have a beneficial effect in these subjects so the unbalanced randomisation ratio was chosen in order to expose the minimum number of subjects to inactive placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Dysport ® 500 U</title>
          <description>Dysport® 500 U was administered at the clinic in a single intramuscular (IM) injection in the targeted UL. The investigator was allowed to adjust the dose per targeted muscle, depending on the level of hypertonicity, as long as the total fixed dosage per subject was 500 U/2.5 millilitre (mL).
Evaluation of reinjection criteria started at Week 4 post-injection of Dysport®. Assessments were then performed every 2 weeks until Week 12. Following Week 12, assessments were performed every 4 weeks until Week 28. The subject’s last study visit was the visit when reinjection criteria was met, Week 28, or early withdrawal visit.</description>

        <title>Time Between the Initial Injection and the Appearance of Reinjection Criteria as Evaluated by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Spasticity Symptoms</title>
        <description>The appearance of increased muscle tone was assessed using the MAS (scale ranges from 0 [no increase in muscle tone] to 4 [affected part rigid in flexion or extension]). For confirmation of reinjection criteria appearance, a subject had to have a MAS score in the primary targeted muscle group of ≥2 and at least 1 of the following 4 criteria confirming signs of symptomatic spasticity in the UL:
A Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) pain score ≥ 4 (NPRS ranges from 0 [no pain] to 10 [severe pain])
An impact on passive function measured by a score of ≥ 1 on the 4-point Likert scale (scale ranges from 0 [no impact] to 3 [severe impact])
An impact on active function measured by a score of ≥ 1 on the 4-point Likert scale
An involuntary movements score ≥1 on the 4-point Likert scale in relevant upper limb.
Results are reported overall for subjects with both symptomatic and asymptomatic spasticity.</description>

            <description>Dysport® 500 U was administered at the clinic in a single IM injection in the targeted UL. The investigator was allowed to adjust the dose per targeted muscle, depending on the level of hypertonicity, as long as the total fixed dosage per subject was 500 U/2.5 mL.
Evaluation of reinjection criteria started at Week 4 post-injection of Dysport®. Assessments were then performed every 2 weeks until Week 12, Following Week 12, assessments were performed every 4 weeks until Week 28. The subject’s last study visit was the visit when reinjection criteria was met, Week 28, or early withdrawal visit.</description>

        <description>The Fugl-Meyer assessment is a validated tool for measuring motor functioning, balance, sensation, and joint functioning in the upper or lower limbs of subjects with post-stroke hemiplegia. The assessment scale is comprised of 155 items across 5 domains: motor functioning, sensory functioning, balance, joint range of motion and joint pain. For this study, only the UL motor part was assessed using the following criteria:
A. Upper Extremity (from 0 to 36) B. Wrist (from 0 to 10) C. Hand (from 0 to 14) D. Coordination / Speed (from 0 to 6)
Total motor function scores (A-D [from 0 to 66]) were calculated and LS mean changes from baseline up to (but not including) the visit when the reinjection criteria were met were reported.
Higher values for change from baseline indicated a better outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>From baseline up to Week 28</time_frame>
        <population>This analysis was performed on the ITT population and includes all randomised subjects who provided informed consent.</population>

            <title>Dysport ® 500 U</title>
            <description>Dysport® 500 U was administered at the clinic in a single IM injection in the targeted UL. The investigator was allowed to adjust the dose per targeted muscle, depending on the level of hypertonicity, as long as the total fixed dosage per subject was 500 U/2.5mL.
Evaluation of reinjection criteria started at Week 4 post-injection of Dysport®. Assessments were then performed every 2 weeks until Week 12, Following Week 12, assessments were performed every 4 weeks until Week 28. The subject’s last study visit was the visit when reinjection criteria was met, Week 28, or early withdrawal visit.</description>

            <description>Placebo was administered at the clinic in a single IM injection in the targeted UL. Evaluation of reinjection criteria started at Week 4 post-injection of placebo. Assessments were then performed every 2 weeks until Week 12. Following Week 12, assessments were performed every 4 weeks until Week 28. The subject’s last study visit was the visit when reinjection criteria was met, Week 28, or early withdrawal visit.</description>

          <title>Mean Duration of Concomitant Non-drug Therapy Sessions.</title>
          <description>The duration of non-drug therapy sessions that the subject received for UL spasticity in combination with injections of either Dysport® or placebo - up to and including the subject’s last study visit - were recorded in the Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) as part of concomitant medications and therapies evaluation at all study visits (Prior and Concomitant Non-Drug Therapies eCRF page). Overall duration of concomitant therapies in the indication of “Post Stroke UL Spasticity” was computed for the period from first administration of Dysport® or placebo to last study visit. Concomitant non–drug therapies were defined as received any time during study (on or after the day of the first injection of Dysport® or placebo) regardless of the start or stop date. For each subject, overlapping sessions were defined as one therapy session using the earliest start date as the start date and the latest start date as the stop date.</description>
