    <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the asthma daily diary. Symptoms were recorded using a scale of 0-3, where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms. The daily asthma symptom total score was calculated by taking the sum of the daytime score recorded in the evening and the nighttime score recorded the following morning. The weekly total asthma score was averaged from the daily scores over a 7 day period, with score ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms. The changes from baseline of weekly total asthma score are compared between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo by using the mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/μL or &lt;300 cells/μL), protocol specified visit, region (Europe or North America) and treatment*visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline total asthma score as a covariate.

    <description>Nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms and requiring rescue medication use was recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary each morning. Proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings was defined as the number of nights with awakenings due to asthma and requiring rescue medication divided by number of nights with data for awakening due to asthma. The outcome variable for proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings was the change from baseline at Week 12 in weekly proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings. The changes are compared between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo by using the mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/μL or &lt;300 cells/μL), protocol specified visit, region (Europe or North America) and treatment*visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings as a covariate.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in AQLQ(S)+12 Total and Domain Scores at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The asthma quality of life questionnaire for 12 years and older, AQLQ(S)+12, consists of 32 questions; all assessed on a 7-point scale from 7 to 1, where 7 represents no impairment and 1 represents severe impairment. The 4 individual domain scores (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains. The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. The changes from baseline of AQLQ(S)+12 score are compared between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo by using the analyse of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/μL or &lt;300 cells/μL) and region (Europe or North America) as fixed effects and baseline AQLQ(S)+12 score as a covariate.
Changes at Week 12 were calculated based on patients with both baseline and Week 12.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>After enrollment, eligible patients entered a 2- to 4-week screening/run-in period and were converted to budesonide dry powder inhaler twice daily for the duration of the study.
Patients who continued to meet eligibility criteria at the end of the run-in period entered a 12 weeks double-blind treatment period followed by two follow-up visits.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible adult patients were stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count (&lt;300 cells/μL or ≥300 cells/μL) and by region (USA versus Rest of the World per the IVRS). Patients were then randomized to either benralizumab 30 mg Q4W or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Asthma Symptom Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded by the patient each morning and evening in the asthma daily diary. Symptoms were recorded using a scale of 0-3, where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms. The daily asthma symptom total score was calculated by taking the sum of the daytime score recorded in the evening and the nighttime score recorded the following morning. The weekly total asthma score was averaged from the daily scores over a 7 day period, with score ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 indicates no asthma symptoms. The changes from baseline of weekly total asthma score are compared between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo by using the mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/μL or &lt;300 cells/μL), protocol specified visit, region (Europe or North America) and treatment*visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline total asthma score as a covariate.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Proportion of Nights With Nocturnal Awakenings at Week 12</title>
        <description>Nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms and requiring rescue medication use was recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary each morning. Proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings was defined as the number of nights with awakenings due to asthma and requiring rescue medication divided by number of nights with data for awakening due to asthma. The outcome variable for proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings was the change from baseline at Week 12 in weekly proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings. The changes are compared between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo by using the mixed-effect model repeated measures (MMRM) with baseline blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/μL or &lt;300 cells/μL), protocol specified visit, region (Europe or North America) and treatment*visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline proportion of nights with nocturnal awakenings as a covariate.
Changes at Week 12 were calculated based on patients with both baseline and Week 12.</description>

        <description>The asthma quality of life questionnaire for 12 years and older, AQLQ(S)+12, consists of 32 questions; all assessed on a 7-point scale from 7 to 1, where 7 represents no impairment and 1 represents severe impairment. The 4 individual domain scores (symptoms, activity limitations, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains. The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. The changes from baseline of AQLQ(S)+12 score are compared between benralizumab 30 mg Q4W and placebo by using the analyse of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline blood eosinophil count (≥300 cells/μL or &lt;300 cells/μL) and region (Europe or North America) as fixed effects and baseline AQLQ(S)+12 score as a covariate.
Changes at Week 12 were calculated based on patients with both baseline and Week 12.</description>
