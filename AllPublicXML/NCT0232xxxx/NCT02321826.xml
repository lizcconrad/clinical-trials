      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of listening to music on sleep quality
      (subjective and objective), daytime dysfunction and neurophysiological arousal in patients
      with insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep problems are highly prevalent in modern society and poor sleep is associated with
      impaired physical and mental health with large costs for both individuals and society.
      Pharmacological treatment is recommended only for short-term use, and there is a need to
      study promising drug-free aids to improve sleep. Furthermore, the mechanisms of insomnia are
      not well understood. In the present project we will investigate if listening to music can
      improve sleep quality in persons suffering from insomnia. We will use a randomized controlled
      trial design including both subjective and objective measures of sleep.
