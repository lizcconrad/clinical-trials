  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims at investigating the effect of ingesting 2 cereal products differing
      by their SDS content on the kinetics of glucose in healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the effect of consuming cereal products alone on :

        -  the rates of appearance and disappearance of exogenous and total glucose

        -  the glycemic and insulinemic responses

        -  the postprandial GIP concentrations
