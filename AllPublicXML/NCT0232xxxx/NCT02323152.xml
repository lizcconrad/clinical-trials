    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression is a disease with a prevalence of 10% which has not only deleterious
      consequences for the mother but also for the baby and can delay the physical, social and
      cognitive development of the baby. Therefore we consider very important to prevent this
      disease as from the centers of care for women with a multidisciplinary approach. The aim of
      this study is to determine whether psychoeducation oriented in problem solving is effective
      in preventing the development of postpartum depression in women with very high risk.

      Methodology: screening of 1000 women in 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We expect that 25% have
      at least one risk factor for postpartum depression (250). Of these women, aproximately a 50%
      will have a very high risk of developing postpartum depressión and will be included in the
      study (n = 125). These women will be randomized to two groups: treatment with psychotherapy
      focused on problem solving (6 sessions: 1 individual session + 5 group sessions) or usual
      care control group (usual postpartum control).

      After treatment, women will be evaluated twice, at the end of therapy and at 6 weeks.
      Survival curves will be used tu assess the time it takes patients to develop major depression
      in the postpartum.

    <description>IPAQ: The International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) provides a set of well-developed instruments that can be used internationally to obtain comparable estimates of physical activity. The long version we use provide more detailed information often required in research work or for evaluation purposes (Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2005)
GPAC : The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire was developed by WHO for monitoring physical activity in countries. Collects information about participation in physical activity and sedentary behavior in three frames (or fields). These fields are:
activity at work
activity at displacement
leisure activity</description>

        Inclusion criteria

          1. General criteria for inclusion in the study:

               1. Pregnant women in the 3rd quarter. In the case of inclusion of children in the
                  study were notified each case their participation to the Department.

               2. Signature of informed consent.

          2. Inclusion criteria for treatment group:

               1. Submitted one or more risk factor for developing postpartum depression:

                    -  Depressive or anxious pathology during pregnancy.

                    -  Personal history of severe mental disorder (schizophrenia and other
                       psychoses, bipolar disorder, depressive disorder).

                    -  Family history of severe mental disorder.

                    -  Concomitant medical diseases associated with depression (diabetes, heart
                       disease, hypertension, obesity).

                    -  Low or very low socioeconomic status.

                    -  Lack of support for women (couples, family, friends or others).

               2. Submit a score ≥7.5 in the EPDS questionnaire. According Vega-Dienstmainer
                  (Vega-Diesnstmainer JM, 2002), there weren't women with lower score than 7.5 that
                  had been diagnosed with DPP (sensitivity and positive predictive value of 100%).
                  Therefore, we considered selecting those patients with higher score of 7.5 on the
                  EPDS scale.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Mental Retardation.

          2. Severe mental disorder decompensation that prevents understanding of the objectives of
             the study.

          3. Submit language difficulties that impede verbal comprehension / reading-writing.

          4. Submit a major depressive episode according to DSM-IV TR (depressive symptoms of
             sufficient intensity and longer duration than 2 weeks).

        All participants will be informed that they will be randomized to on of the two study
        groups and will only be included if they give their informed consent to participate in the
        study. Women in both groups will be evaluated at baseline (pre-intervention) at 6 and 12
        weeks (postinternveción).
