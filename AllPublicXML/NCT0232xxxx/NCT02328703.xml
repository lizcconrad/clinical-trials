  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeated measures study
      with intention-to-treat that involves exposure to Reiki therapy or a placebo control
      intervention for a total of six treatments, three treatments per week for two weeks, with a
      2-week follow-up for the decrease of neuropathic pain in extremity trauma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty participants will be randomized to either receive three 30-minute standardized
      treatments per week for two weeks of Reiki therapy (n=30) or a placebo intervention (n=30).
      All participants will complete the same outcome measures (Brief Pain Inventory, Neuropathic
      Pain Scale, Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale, Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep
      Scale, and McGill Pain Questionnaire-SF) at established times. Any opioid and other analgesic
      requirements will also be collected.

      Aim 1: Test the efficacy of a 2-week course of Reiki therapy on pain outcomes (present,
      average and worst pain intensity levels and perceptions of pain relief from the Brief Pain
      Inventory (BPI) and Patient Global Impression of Improvement-PGI-I) compared to placebo Reiki
      interventions in combat-injured service members with major limb trauma experiencing
      neuropathic pain.

      Aim 2: Examine effects of a 2-week course of Reiki therapy compared to placebo Reiki
      interventions on the quality of sleep measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI),
      pain interference (BPI), character and quality of pain (Neuropathic Pain Scale and McGill
      Pain Questionnaire-Short Form) in combat-injured service members with major limb trauma
      experiencing neuropathic pain.

      Aim 3: Describe the differences in pattern of responses to Reiki therapy and placebo Reiki
      interventions for pain outcomes (pain intensity, perception of relief and PGI-I) based on
      neuropathic pain type, pain duration, and the presence or absence of a diagnosis of PTSD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from start of treatment to up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI Short Form assesses the time relation sensory component of pain intensity (average over the last week, worst and least, and present pain) using a numeric rating scale (0 [No pain] to 10 [Pain as bad as you can imagine]), percentage of pain relief (0 [No relief] to 100% [Complete relief]), and 7 pain interferences concerning work, activity, mood, enjoyment, sleep, walk and relationships are assessed using 0-10 numeric scales (0 [No interference] to 10 [Complete interference])</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from start of treatment to up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NPS assesses two pain domains (intensity and unpleasantness), six qualities (sharp, hot, dull, cold, sensitive, and itchy) and two locations (deep and surface).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from start of treatment to up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MPQ-SF is a brief screening tool for pain and has 3 subscales: Sensory (11 word items), Affective (4 word items), and a composite Evaluative score. Fifteen words represent acute, intermittent and chronic pains, and are scored on a four-point Likert-type scale from 0 = none to 3 = severe. A total score of 45 is possible by summing the Sensory and Affective subscales and scoring them separately.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from start of treatment to up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval will be evaluated using the PSQI (Appendix J). Nineteen items generate seven &quot;component&quot; scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and day time dysfunction. The sum of scores yields one global score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale (PGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed from start of treatment to up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-I consists of a 7-point Likert scale with 1 = &quot;very much improved&quot; to 7 = &quot;very much worse&quot; to capture overall changes related to a study medication or intervention</description>

    <description>Reiki is a biofield energy therapy that is based on the idea that there is a universal energy that supports the body's innate healing abilities. A trained Reiki Master uses their hands as a conduit of the energy that goes naturally to any area of the recipient's body where it is needed. This provides a means for life force energy to recharge and rebalance the human energy fields, creating optimal conditions needed by the body's natural healing system.</description>
