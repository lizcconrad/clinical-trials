      The aim of this study is to evaluate the survival benefit of low-dose aspirin use for stage
      II-III esophageal cancer patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that low-dose aspirin can improve survival
      in stage II-III esophageal cancer patients, and to evaluate whether this effect is influenced
      by PIK3CA, KRAS, BRAF mutation and COX-2 expression. Eligible participants will be randomized
      to either aspirin treatment arm (100 mg aspirin OD for 3 years), or non-aspirin user arm in
      1:1 ratio. After randomization, participants will receive 3 monthly assessments during
      treatment and follow-up.
