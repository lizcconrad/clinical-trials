  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study. Subjects agreeing
      to participate in the study and meet the entry criteria assessed at the screening visit, will
      begin a 28 day baseline period to confirm their diagnosis, as well as establish baseline
      migraine characteristics. During this baseline period, subjects will continue treating their
      migraines as usual, simply recording the information in a daily headache diary. Subjects who,
      after completing the baseline, continue to meet entrance criteria will be eligible to enter
      into the treatment phase and be randomized according to the Clinvest generated randomization
      schedule. Approximately 142 subjects (71 subjects per arm) will be randomized and enter the
      treatment phase receiving MLD10 or placebo in a 1:1 design at 6 United States sites. Diary
      assessments will collect study medication adherence, pain severity, headache symptoms, acute
      medication usage, and unusual symptoms. Serum samples will be collected and analyzed for
      ionized magnesium, electrolytes, and creatinine.

      This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study of MLD10
      for the prevention of migraine headache. The study population will consist of approximately
      142 male and female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age with frequent episodic migraine
      as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders-3beta criteria. Two MLD10
      (243 mg (milligrams) of elemental magnesium) or placebo caplets will be taken twice daily for
      a total daily dose of 486 mg.

      VISIT 1 - SCREENING

      The following will be completed at Visit 1:

        1. Obtain written Informed Consent. The informed consent will be obtained in accordance
           with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and all applicable regulatory requirements from each
           subject prior to participation in the study.

        2. Verify Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Subjects will meet all the inclusion and none of
           the exclusion criteria.

        3. Obtain demographics (race, ethnicity, sex, date of birth)

        4. Obtain medical, medication, and headache history. Data collected will include medical
           history and diagnoses, age at onset of migraine and other pertinent migraine/headache
           history, history of acute and prophylactic headache medications within the past 30 days,
           and history of other recent/concomitant medications.
