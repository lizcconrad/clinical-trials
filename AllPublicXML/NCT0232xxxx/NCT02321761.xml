  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the drugs given at rehabilitation programs to people who
      suffered Acquired Brain Injury in order to expedite recovery and improve functioning.

      A previous study examined the spatially asymmetric allocation of attention in patients with
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients demonstrated significantly worse performance with
      leftward than with rightward cross-hemi field shifts of attention. This is reminiscence of
      neglect patients. This difference was significantly reduced during and following treatment.
      Our objective is to investigate whether Amantadine Hydrochloride is effective in improving
      allocation of spatial attention and improving function in people with Traumatic Brain Injury.

    <description>The study paradigm is based on The Posner Cueing Task, a visual spatial attention task. Identification rates were measured after pre cuing attention to different visual field loci. After pre cuing to a locus 5 degrees into the left or right hemi field, target patterns were presented briefly at the cued location (valid) or on the opposite side (invalid) requiring an attentional shift</description>
