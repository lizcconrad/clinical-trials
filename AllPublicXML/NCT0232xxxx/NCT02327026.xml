  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve the management of patients in cardiac arrest, and this by
      comparing two initial airway management methods: Tracheal intubation and bag-valve-mask
      ventilation.

      The survival rate at 28-day with favorable neurological function will be compared in the
      tracheal intubation group versus the bag-valve-mask group
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter prospective non-inferiority open randomized controlled trial in patients
      with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest carried out in physician-staffed emergency medical
      services.

      The investigators hypothesis is that basic airway management (i.e. bag-valve-mask
      ventilation) is safe and may avoid the deleterious effects of tracheal intubation including
      interruption of chest compressions.

      On medical team's arrival at the scene and after verification of participant's eligibility,
      patients will be enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either initial bag-valve-mask
      ventilation or tracheal intubation. After the hospital admission, all patients will be
      intubated whatever the initial airway management.
