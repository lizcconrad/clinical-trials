  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injuries are the leading cause of death and disability in children in America. Most injuries
      can be prevented when parents implement effective child safety practices. This project will
      create a behaviorally based program to teach parents what to do to prevent injuries to their
      school aged child, in an effort to reduce the number of injuries, hospitalizations, medical
      costs, and missed work days.

      This project will produce a comprehensive, interactive multimedia (IMM) program to teach
      childhood injury prevention skills to parents of children 6 through 11 years of age. This is
      one of a four-part series of funded programs to address injury prevention issues for three
      age groups of children (birth through 24 months, 2-5 years of age and 6-11 years of age). The
      program will be created in three formats: Internet/intranet, CD-ROM, and linear video (DVD)
      suitable for use in homes, worksites, medical settings, service agencies, and health
      information Web sites. On-screen narrators will guide the user through program material
      comprised of short video presentations, modeling vignettes demonstrating desired behaviors,
      supportive testimonials, and suggestions for modifications to home and recreational
      environments.

    <time_frame>Immediate posttest and 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Parents viewed 2 car seat installations and were asked whether 7 car booster safety seat situations (e.g., age of the child for the seat) and 7 seat belt installations (e.g., placement of the seat belt) were correct or incorrect. Parents also viewed a bicycle helmet on a dummy and were asked to identify whether 2 helmet situations were correct or incorrect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of injury prevention strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate posttest and 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An injury prevention knowledge scale was created across all content areas. The injury prevention knowledge scale contained 39 items (e.g., &quot;To prevent scald injuries, hot water heaters should be set to â€¦&quot;) for all age groups. The injury prevention knowledge scale represented the percent of items correctly endorsed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitudes and beliefs about injury prevention strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate posttest and 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An injury prevention attitudes &amp; beliefs scale was created across all content areas (e.g., &quot;A family emergency plan is extremely important strategy to keep your family safe in case of a fire.&quot;). Twenty-five items assessed attitudes &amp; beliefs for the 6-9 year age group and 24-items the 10-11 age group (alpha = .81 for both younger and older children). All items were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</description>

    <measure>Self-efficacy for engaging in injury prevention strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate posttest and 30-day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An injury prevention self-efficacy scale was created from 29 items across all content areas for all age groups (e.g., &quot;How confident are you that you know how to test the temperature of your water heater?&quot;) (alpha = .91 for all age groups) All items were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The basic lower age limit for parents or guardians of children aged 6-11 for this
             study was 18. Parents or legal guardians could potentially be as old as 65 or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Only English-speaking participants were accepted because the program was developed
             only for English speakers. All English-speaking parents or guardians living in the
             U.S., with children aged 6-11 years old, who wished to participate were included.
             Parents under 18 were excluded from this online study because parental consent cannot
             be obtained online.
