    <textblock>
      2QG1 is a Phase IIa study aiming to assess the blood pressure lowering effect of 4-week
      administration of QGC001 oral doses in patients with grade I or II essential hypertension
      compared to placebo, to assess the safety and tolerability, to obtain preliminary PK
      information for QGC001 given as multiple oral doses and to determine preliminary PD profile
      of QGC001 multiple oral doses on plasma and urine hormones, which will be compared to that of
      placebo.
