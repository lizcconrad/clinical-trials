    <textblock>
      Open-label, multicenter study in adults with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) designed to
      evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of daily dosing with LUM001.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study in subjects with PBC who previously completed the LUM001 201
      (CLARITY) study. The study is designed to investigate the long-term safety and tolerability
      of LUM001 treatment, with daily dosing for up to 2 years. Changes over time, compared to
      baseline, in liver enzymes, other biochemical markers associated with PBC, pruritus, and
      other quality of life measures will also be assessed.
