    <measure>Change From Baseline in Worst Ocular Itching Score During the 24 Hours Prior at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of ocular itching was evaluated as the worst score observed in the past 24 hours prior to each study visit. Ocular itching was assessed by the participant on a scale from 0-4, where 0=None and 4=Incapacitating itch. One eye (study eye) contributed to the analysis.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events (AEs) were collected from the time of informed consent and for the duration of participation in the study (2 weeks). This analysis group includes all participants who received study treatment. Ocular adverse events are presented for both study eye and non-study eye combined. AEs are reported as pre-treatment and treatment-emergent.</time_frame>
      <desc>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is administered a study treatment regardless of whether or not the event has a causal relationship with the treatment. Reports of AEs were obtained through solicited and spontaneous comments from the participants.</desc>
