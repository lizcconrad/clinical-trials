  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose implementing a bundle of communication interventions - Patient and
      Family-Centered I-PASS - to improve the quality of information exchange between physicians,
      nurses, and families, and to better integrate families into all aspects of daily decision
      making in hospitals. The investigators believe that doing so has the potential to
      substantially improve both patient safety and patient and family experience.

      The specific aims of the project are - To test the hypothesis that a) rates of serious
      medical errors (including both preventable adverse events and near misses), determined both
      by an established, systematic daily hospital surveillance methodology (primary outcome) and
      family reports (secondary outcome); as well as b) poor verbal handoffs during family centered
      rounds (FCRs - assessed through direct observation - secondary outcome); rates of discordant
      understanding of the care plan between healthcare providers and families (assessed through
      survey instruments - secondary outcome); and rates of family (primary outcome) and nurse and
      physician dissatisfaction (secondary outcomes) will decrease following implementation of
      Family-Centered I-PASS, as compared with current practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bundle includes changes to family centered rounds, written communications with families
      and further communications throughout the day.

      Data will be gathered pre vs. post intervention using a well established surveillance process
      for measuring rates of medical errors and adverse events, as well as survey instruments and
      direct observational methods.
