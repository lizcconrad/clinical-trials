    <textblock>
      To confirm the acute performance and safety of the Lotus™ Valve with the Next Generation
      Delivery System for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in symptomatic patients
      with severe calcific aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical valve
      replacement.

      This clinical study is a prospective single-arm study designed to demonstrate that the acute
      performance and safety of the LOTUS Edge Valve System when used with the iSleeve Introducer
      Set or current Lotus Introducer Set are consistent with the results of the Lotus Valve System
      used in the REPRISE II study, when delivered and deployed in symptomatic subjects who have
      severe calcific aortic valve stenosis and who are at high risk for surgical aortic valve
      replacement (SAVR).
