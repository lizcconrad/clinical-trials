  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to visualize biodistribution of a PET tracer called [18F]F-AraG
      through time in healthy human volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer will be intravenously injected into
      healthy human volunteers who provide informed consent. Following injection of this tracer
      each volunteer will have four whole-body PET scans inside a PET scanner to obtain images of
      tracer biodistribution at four different time points. This will allow studying the kinetics
      of the tracer as well analysis of tracer dosimetry. Safety of the tracer will also be
      analyzed in each volunteer.

    <description>Whole-body [18F]F-AraG PET scans will be performed at 4 different time points following intravenous injection of the PET tracer. Four whole-body images will be obtained that will reveal biodistribution of [18F]F-AraG at 4 different consecutive time points after intravenous injection.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Time-Activity curves will be graphed by measuring activity in various organs at the 4 time points after tracer injection. From these time activity curves absorbed radiation will be calculated.</description>

    <description>Blood and urine samples may be collected at baseline and at 1 and 8 days after injection of [18F]F-AraG to perform metabolic panel, CBC and urine analysis. Vital signs and EKG will be measured and recorded at baseline, within 3 hours after tracer injection and at 1 and 8 days after tracer injection.</description>
