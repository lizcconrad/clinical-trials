      The ACT - OA Knee Clinical Trial is a prospective, randomized, multi-center device trial
      intended to assess safety and feasibility of intraarticular administration of Celution
      processed Adipose Derived Regenerative Cells (ADRCs). The study will include 90 patients in
      up to 15 sites in the United States.

      Subjects that have chronic knee pain due to idiopathic osteoarthritis of the knee (confirmed
      clinically and radiologically) will be evaluated for eligibility in this study. Following
      informed consent and screening evaluations, eligible subjects will undergo pre-operative
      testing. Subjects will then undergo fat harvest through small volume liposuction under local
      anesthesia. Lipoaspirate will be processed in the Celution System to isolate and concentrate
      ADRCs for immediate intraarticular administration. A dose escalation approach has been
      designed wherein the study is divided into two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
      parts as follows:

      Part A:

      Low Dose (20,000,000 cells): 30 patients OR Placebo: 15 patients

      Part B:

      High Dose (40,000,000 cells): 30 patients OR Placebo: 15 patients

      Subjects randomized to placebo will undergo fat harvest and intraarticular injection of a
      placebo that has been visually matched to the active test substance. All subjects will
      undergo imaging studies, clinical evaluations, and laboratory testing prior to and after the
      procedure; patients will be followed for 48 weeks after intraarticular injections are
      performed.
