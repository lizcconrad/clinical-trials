  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised control trial to assess the visual and clinical outcomes of
      collagen cross linking in fungal keratitis. Fungal keratitis is a major cause of corneal
      blindness in India and the therapeutic options available are minimal to handle the advanced
      complications and sequalae caused by the disease.The antimicrobial and tissue remodeling role
      of corneal cross linking was demonstrated by several studies earlier,we anted to specifically
      assess the role of corneal cross linking in non resolving fungal keratitis in prevention of
      perforation and enhancement of healing process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with culture positive deep stromal fungal keratitis not responding to appropriate
      medical therapy for a period of two weeks were randomized to receive or not receive adjuvant
      CXL. The medical therapy was continued in both the groups and were followed up for 6 weeks
      after randomization. Healing of the ulcer was taken as successful outcome, while perforation
      and increase in ulcer size of more than 2 sq.mm from the baseline was considered as treatment
      failure.
