  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide important information concerning the used of mindfulness-based
      relapse prevention (MBRP) as a continuing care strategy for Veterans who have completed
      primary treatment for a SUD. Most research is focused on the acute care of SUDs, but the risk
      of relapse to substance use is highest during the period immediately following treatment and
      attention to continuing care is critical. If this trial demonstrates that MBRP promotes
      sustained abstinence and improved functional outcomes, this will provide a valuable treatment
      to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery for Veterans with SUDs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of substance use disorders (SUDS) are high among military personnel and Veterans. While
      much research is focused on the acute care of SUDs, the risk of relapse to substance use
      following treatment is high and attention to continuing care is critical. New continuing care
      strategies targeting life-style change and improved coping mechanisms are important in
      facilitating maintenance of abstinence, promoting rehabilitation and functional recovery for
      Veterans with SUDs. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP), a manualized treatment
      integrating cognitive-behavioral relapse prevention therapy with mindfulness practices, has
      shown promise in continuing care for SUDs. The proposed project will compare MBRP to a
      12-Step Facilitation treatment as a continuing care strategy following primary treatment for
      SUDs. Participants will be randomized to participate in 8-weeks of weekly 90-minute,
      group-based MBRP or 12-Step Facilitation followed by a 10-month follow-up period with regular
      assessments of substance use, mood/anxiety symptoms, quality of life and functional outcomes.
      Two VAMC sites (Charleston and Tuscaloosa) with a history of successful collaboration will
      work together to recruit an adequate sample size to address the primary study questions
      within a 4-year period and to ensure generalizability of the results. If this trial
      demonstrates that MBRP promotes sustained abstinence and improved functional outcomes, this
      will provide a valuable treatment to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery for Veterans with
      SUDs.

    <measure>Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The TLFB will be used to obtain retrospective self-report of alcohol, nicotine, illicit drug (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, stimulants, sedatives, opioids), and prescription drug use using calendar and memory prompts to stimulate recall. The TLFB yields consistently high test-retest correlations and correlates well with other self-reports and collateral reports (Carey, 1997). Quantity and frequency assessments as well as time-to-event measures can be obtained. At baseline, drug/alcohol use in the month before enrollment in treatment will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urine Drug Screen</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Observed urine samples will be collected with a RapidCHECK Multi-Drug 10 Panel Test, which allows detection of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)/marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine, opiates, methamphetamines, methadone, amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and uses concentrations levels established by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Osmolality and temperature assessed at collection time to insure sample validity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Breathalyzer Test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Breathalyzer tests will be used to measure subjects' blood alcohol concentration (BAC) before treatment sessions. Individuals who test positive will not attend group sessions. Samples &gt;0.01 g/dl will be considered positive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EtG</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The conjugated alcohol metabolite ethyl glucuronide (EtG) remains positive in urine for several days following cessation and is a useful biomarker of recent drinking in outpatient settings (Dahl 2011). This will be used as the primary biologic assessment of drinking status as breathalyzer tests only assess very recent alcohol use. The assay will be done in the Charleston VAMC laboratory on samples collected at baseline, end of treatment and 3-, 6-, and 10-month follow-up visits.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindfulness Acceptance and Awareness Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 15-item self-report instrument rating the frequency of experiencing impaired moment-to-moment attention on a 6-point Likert scale. This measure will be done at baseline and end of treatment and used to explore the relationship between MAAS scores and treatment response.</description>

    <measure>Addiction Severity Index, Lite</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This standardized, multidimensional, semi-structured interview provides information concerning functioning in six domains commonly impacted by substance abuse: alcohol/drug, medical, psychiatric, legal, family/social and employment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Days Engaging in Structured/Productive Work Activities (PWAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PWAC will be used to assess self-reported days engaged in structured, volunteer, or employed work activity of at least 1 hour in duration. VISTA queries using Compensated Work Therapy and Veterans Enrichment Program stop codes will be run for medical record corroboration. Activities outside of the VA will be included.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Engagement: Treatment Attendance Calendar (TAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The TAC will be used to assess number of days treated for a substance abuse/mental health problem in the VA or any other outpatient aftercare setting, number of 12-step or self-help group meetings attended and physician contact and/or hospitalization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life Scale (QOLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This 16-item scale, used to assess satisfaction with major areas of life function, has convergent and discriminant construct validity in chronic illness as evidenced by high correlations between the QOLS total score and Life Satisfaction Index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This brief, well-validated instrument will be used at baseline to screen for cognitive impairment that could interfere with ability to benefit from MBRP. A cut-off of 26/30 is considered normal.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The MINI is a well-standardized structured interview which is similar in sensitivity, specificity, and inter-rater reliability to other more lengthy diagnostic interviews, such as the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. A DSM-V version of the MINI is not available, so DSM-IV criteria will be utilized. The MINI will be used at baseline to assess psychiatric diagnoses for inclusion/exclusion and urn randomization purposes.</description>

    <description>The Introductory session provides an orientation to the intervention, basic mindfulness techniques and general description of group sessions. Each session has a central theme/topic and consists of in-session experiential practice, discussions and homework assignments. Sessions begin with a check-in followed by a 20-30 minute meditation (i.e. body scan). The therapist reviews homework assignments, discusses challenges and participants are taught a variety of mindfulness meditation (MM) practices such as breath meditation, urge surfing, walking or movement meditation.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Introductory session covers the 12-Step view of addiction and therapy overview. The manual, originally developed for individual sessions, has been adapted for group delivery (Brown et al., 2002). The eight selected sessions include four topics chosen by the manual developers as core topics and four elective topics. The intervention involves helping participants understand and incorporate core principles of 12-Step approaches while encouraging active participation in 12-Step meetings and related activities. The primary goal is to promote abstinence by facilitating the patient's acceptance and surrender of addiction. Sessions begin with a check-in during which participants introduce themselves, report on meeting attendance and participation in related activities, any alcohol/drug use or craving to use. The remainder of the session focuses on discussion of the topic content followed by a &quot;take home&quot; summary and homework assignment.</description>
