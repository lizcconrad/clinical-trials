  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to estimate the bioavailability of montelukast from the 5 milligrams
      (mg) montelukast sodium (GW483100) test formulations relative to 5 mg montelukast sodium
      reference chewable tablets (innovator product). It is an open-label, randomized, single dose,
      three-way cross over, six sequence study in 18 healthy human subjects. Each subject will
      participate in all three treatment periods. Subjects will be randomized to one of six
      sequences and administered one of the three treatments A, B or C in each treatment period,
      where Treatment A is 5mg chewable tablet of reference 5 mg montelukast sodium reference
      chewable tablets (innovator product), Treatment B is test formulation 1: 5mg montelukast
      sodium (GW483100) chewable tablet and Treatment C is test formulation 2: 5mg montelukast
      sodium (GW483100) chewable tablet. The treatment periods will be separated by a washout
      period of 7 to 14 days. Total duration in the study for each subject will be approximately 8
      weeks from screening to the follow-up visit.
