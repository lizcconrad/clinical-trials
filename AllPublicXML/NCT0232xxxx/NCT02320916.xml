  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arterial blood-gas (ABG) measurements are the gold standard to evaluate pulmonary gas
      exchange. However, arterial punctures are more painful than venous punctures and, in ICU
      patients, cause greater anxiety than tracheal aspiration. The only technique that has been
      shown to effectively reduce pain during arterial punctures is the subcutaneous injection of
      lidocaine. However, this technique is more time consuming and is poorly used.

      Topical anesthesia is widely used during arterial punctures despite the lack of proof of
      efficacy.

      While performing arterial punctures with small gauge needles is feasible, to the best of the
      investigators knowledge no studies have assessed the effect of needle gauge on arterial
      puncture related pain.

      The aim of the present study was to compare the pain experienced during arterial punctures
      performed with a 25 G or 23 G needle. The secondary endpoints were the characterization of
      the pain and the anxiety associated with the arterial punctures.
