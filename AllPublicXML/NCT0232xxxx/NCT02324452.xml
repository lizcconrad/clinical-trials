  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study it will be determined whether the rate of severe toxicity associated with
      fluoropyrimidine treatment (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) can be significantly diminished
      by individualized dosing of fluoropyrimidines based on upfront genotypic assessment of
      dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

      In addition to the genotyping, the DPD phenotype of all patients will be determined by
      measuring the baseline dihydrouracil/uracil (DHU/U) ratio, in order to investigate whether
      phenotype-guided treatment can further improve patient safety. In a subgroup of patients,
      other phenotyping methods will be tested: measuring the plasma levels of uracil after a
      uracil test dose and a uracil breath test after a dose of [2-13C] -labeled uracil. To
      validate these tests, these phenotyping results will be compared with the results of a DPD
      activity assay (which measures DPD enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells),
      which is considered the gold standard in measuring DPD phenotype.
