        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of VMT/sVMA, with evidence of focal VMT visible on Spectral Domain - Optical
             Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT).

          -  Read, sign, and date an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee-approved informed
             consent form.

          -  Willing and able to attend all study visits.

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential if pregnant, test positive on a urine pregnancy test,
             intend to become pregnant during the study period, breastfeeding, or not in agreement
             to use adequate birth control methods to prevent pregnancy throughout the study.

          -  Hypersensitivity to ocriplasmin or any of the JETREA excipients.

          -  Active or suspected intraocular or periocular infection in either eye.

          -  Participation in any interventional clinical trial within 30 days prior to baseline.

          -  Presence of epiretinal membrane (ERM) over the central macula in the study eye.

          -  Broad VMT/sVMA &gt; 1500 microns in the study eye.

          -  History of vitrectomy in the study eye.

          -  History of laser photocoagulation to the macula in the study eye.

          -  Any relevant concomitant ocular condition in the study eye that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could be expected to worsen or require surgical intervention during the
             study period.

          -  Macular hole of &gt; 400 microns diameter in the study eye.

          -  High myopia in the study eye.

          -  Pseudo-exfoliation, Marfan's syndrome, phacodonesis, or any other finding in the study
             eye that, in the Investigator's opinion, suggests lens/zonular instability.

          -  History of retinal detachment in the study eye.

          -  Recent ocular surgery or ocular injection in the study eye within the past 90 days
             (including laser therapy).

          -  Proliferative diabetic retinopathy or ischemic retinopathies in the study eye.

          -  Retinal vein occlusions in the study eye.
