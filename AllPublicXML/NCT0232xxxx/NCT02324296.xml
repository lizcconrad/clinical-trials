      ABSTRACT Objectives Combination chemotherapy is very active in small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
      although no improvement in overall survival (OS) has been done in the last 25 years , with
      Cisplatin-Etoposide (PE) still considered the world-wide standard, with an average median
      survival of about 7-8 months in patients with extended disease (ED).

      In 1995, a randomized trial of the Hoosier Group in 171 ED patients showed a significant
      advantage in overall survival in patients treated with PEI (Cisplatin, Etoposide and
      Ifosfamide), compared to PE. Despite that, PEI regimen has not become a commonly used regimen
      in SCLC.

      Materials and Methods Here we present a series of 46 consecutive patients (30 males and 16
      females) with SCLC that were treated at our Institution with PEI regimen: Cisplatin 20mg/m2,
      Etoposide 75mg/m2 and Ifosfamide 1200mg/m2, day 1 to 4, every 3 weeks.

      Patients received a total of 219 cycles of chemotherapy, with a mean of 4,7 cycles per
      patient. Median age was 63 (range 59-70); performance status (PS) was 0 in 29 patients (63%),
      1 in 13 patients (28%) and 2 in 4 patients (9%).
