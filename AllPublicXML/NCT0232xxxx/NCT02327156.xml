    <textblock>
      The investigator evaluated the motor and sensory block durations and the postoperative
      analgesic effects of adding dexmedetomidine to levobupivacaine for sub-Tenon's anesthesia in
      patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery. Motor and sensory block durations were considered
      as a primary endpoint.

      Background: The investigator evaluated the motor and sensory block durations and the
      postoperative analgesic effects of adding dexmedetomidine to levobupivacaine for sub-Tenon's
      anesthesia in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery. Motor and sensory block durations
      were considered as a primary endpoint.

      Methods: The investigator investigated 60 patients subjected to vitreoretinal surgery under
      sub-Tenon's anesthesia. The patients were randomly divided equally into 1 of 2 groups
      conferring to the local anesthesia (LA) solution used to receive either 4 mL of
      levobupivacaine 0.75% plus hyaluronidase 15 IU diluted with 1mL normal saline (group L) or 4
      mL of levobupivacaine 0.75% plus hyaluronidase 15 IU and dexmedetomidine 20 μg diluted with
      1mL normal saline (group LD). The total volume of the LA solution used was 5 mL. Motor block
      (akinesia) and sensory block durations were evaluated until the return of normal motor and
      sensory function. The sedation level was assessed during the surgery period and 24 hours
      postoperatively together with the degree of postoperative pain and the efficiency of
      postoperative analgesia. The sleep quality of the first postoperative night was assessed
      using the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD).
