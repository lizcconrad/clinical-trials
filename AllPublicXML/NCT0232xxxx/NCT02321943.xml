  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to explore the longitudinal course of self-disturbances (SD)
      in schizophrenia. The main aim of the study is to investigate, in a 6-7-year follow-up of a
      representative sample of patients with first-episode schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
      other psychoses. The overall aim is to expand our knowledge about the role of SDs in
      psychotic disorders. Increased knowledge here will aid diagnosis and treatment. The current
      study is a seven year follow-up of this representative cohort, with baseline measures of SDs
      and a comprehensive clinical and neurocognitive assessment battery.
