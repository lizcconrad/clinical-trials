  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phosphorus is a mineral that is naturally present in our foods and is required by our bodies
      for normal function. It has been found that phosphorus supplementation taken before meals has
      the potential to reduce meal size. However its long term effect has not been measured yet. It
      is well accepted that changes in body weight require about 3 months. Using body weight as the
      outcome, which is the ultimate outcome of weight loss approaches, would provide robust
      information on the role of phosphorus.

      A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 63 adults aged 18 to 45 years with a
      body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher and normal kidney function at the American
      University of Beirut. Participants were randomly assigned to the placebo or phosphorus group
      where daily placebo or phosphorus supplements were ingested with three main meals (breakfast,
      lunch, and dinner) for a period of 12 weeks. Primary outcomes were changes in anthropometric
      measures, blood metabolites (including lipid profile, glucose, and insulin), and subjective
      appetite scores.
