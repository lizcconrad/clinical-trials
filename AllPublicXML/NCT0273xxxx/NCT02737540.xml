  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to confirm the existence of risky decision making in a
      non strategic situation (Iowa Gambling Task) and a deficit of decision making in social
      situations, linked to greater sensitivity to injustice (Ultimatum Game) and a lower level of
      trust (Trust Game) in elderly depressed patients with a history of suicide attempts in
      comparison with older depressed patients without a history of suicidal acts and healthy
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>

      The secondary objectives are to confirm or explore the deficits of certain cognitive
      processes involved in potentially suicidal behavior in depressed elderly persons but that
      have been little or not studied to date. These include:

      A. cognitive control and sensitivity to interference (Victoria Stroop test, incompatibility
      test, flexibility test, Go / No-Go);

      B. Strategic recovery of semantic memory (verbal fluency test);

      C. Working memory (TEA);

      D. Insight related to depression (Mood Disorders Insight Scale);

      E. Recognition of facial emotions;

      F. Emotional regulation;

      G. Negative attitudes;

      H. Self-perception and;

      I. Time perspectives.

      Finally, patients will be contacted by telephone at month 6 to assess the occurrence of a
      suicidal act during this period and thus calculate the predictive ability of cognitive and
      psychological factors.

        The study population consists of patients over 60 years of age with or without a personal
        history of suicide attempts, hospitalized in the Nîmes University Hospital psychiatry
        department or the Sophoras clinic for a major depressive episode. Healthy subjects over 60
        years, not depressed and without personal history of severe mental illness or suicide
        attempts will also be recruited.

          -  Patients with or without a personal history of suicide attempts. A suicide attempt is
             defined as any act performed with some intent to die (Mann 1998). Suicidal threats,
             aborted or interrupted gestures as well as self-mutilating acts without suicidal
             intent will not be considered as suicidal acts.

          -  Patients hospitalized (or followed as outpatients) in the Nîmes University Hospital
             psychiatry department or the Sophoras clinic in Nimes

          -  The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study

          -  The patient is under judicial protection

          -  The patient (or his/her legal representative) refuses to sign the consent

          -  It is impossible to correctly inform the patient or his/her legal representative

          -  The patient has a known MMSE score &lt;24 (elimination of probable dementia pathology)

          -  Known central neurological disease including degenerative disease, severe head trauma
             and severe cerebral vascular disease

          -  Known schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse in the last 12 months

          -  Electroconvulsive therapy in the 12 months preceding the study because of the risk of
             mnesic side effects

          -  Inability to perform neuropsychological tests because of a language problem, poor
             understanding, a major tremor, inability to sit still, a major sight problem that can
             not be corrected, or other severe cognitive impairment

          -  The subject presents an acute somatic decompensation incompatible with the completion
             of this study

          -  The patient has current confusion

          -  The subject is under judicial protection

          -  The subject (or his/her legal representative) refuses to sign the consent

          -  It is impossible to correctly inform the subject or his/her legal representative

          -  The subject has a known MMSE score &lt;24 (elimination of probable dementia pathology)

          -  Known central neurological disease including degenerative disease, severe head trauma

             of this study

          -  Thesubject has current confusion

        Pharmacological treatment is not a criterion for exclusion in itself but it will be left to
        the judgment of the evaluator to choose to include a subject or not (or to postpone
        inclusion) depending on the drug (eg. after weaning daytime sedative treatment and
        benzodiazepines).
