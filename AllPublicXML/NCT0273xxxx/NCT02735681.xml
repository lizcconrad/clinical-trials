  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meibomian glands (MG) are modified sebaceous glands associated with the tarsus (collagenous
      structural component) of the upper and lower eyelids. Meibomian glands produce lipid-based
      secretions which are an integral and stabilizing part of the tear film. In blepharitis and
      ocular rosacea (two known causes of obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (o-MGD),
      inflammation of the lid margins causes blockage of the meibomian gland orifices, changes in
      glandular secretions, and dropout of the glands themselves. This limits the production,
      secretion, and quality of meibum. With less oil in the tear film, the aqueous portion of
      tears is not stable and evaporates quickly which leads to dry eye.

    <textblock>
      Meibomian gland probing is a relatively new, safe, and effective technique for treating
      obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (o-MGD). It involves topical anesthesia of the eyelid
      margins and insertion of a 2 mm or 4 mm sterile, beveled, solid stainless steel probe at the
      slit lamp. Meibomian gland probing has been reported to alleviate symptoms (lid tenderness /
      lid margin congestion) of o-MGD (Maskin, 2010). It has also been shown to improve meibum
      lipid levels, viscosity, and tear breakup time (Nakayama, Kawashima, Kaido, Arita, &amp; Tsubota,
      2015). Though probing has been investigated in a few small studies of o-MGD, only one small
      study of 10 participants has investigated meibomian gland probing in ocular rosacea (Wladis,
      2012). This study showed improvement in ocular surface disease index (OSDI, a standardized
      questionnaire assessing dry eye) but did not show objective improvement by way of examination
      findings or analysis of meibum (Wladis, 2012).

      In our study, Investigators intend to further investigate meibomian gland probing in
      participants with diagnosed ocular rosacea. Investigators hypothesize that after probing of
      one eye, Investigators will note improvements in participants symptoms as reflected in
      improvement in OSDI scores, Reductions in Inflamma-Dry measures (measure of matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP-9), an inflammatory marker elevated in tears of participants with dry
      eye), decreased tear fluid osmolarity, decreased meibum viscosity on expression . Objective
      improvement in lid margin disease (noting collarettes, pitting, telangiectasia of lid
      margins, thickening / irregularity of lid margins, lid margin tenderness; improvement in tear
      break up time (TBUT); and improvement in corneal fluorescein / lissamine green staining).
