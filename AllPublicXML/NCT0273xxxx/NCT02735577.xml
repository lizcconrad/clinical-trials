    <textblock>
      This study combines functional MRI with medication treatment in order to understand the
      neural mechanisms by which disulfiram, a currently approved medication for alcohol use
      disorder, changes behavior. Disulfiram is a medication that prevents drinking by causing a
      highly unpleasant physical reaction when alcohol is consumed while it is being taken. Thus,
      it provides a means for studying the general neural mechanisms by which awareness of risks
      impacts behavior change in alcohol use disorder.

      The overall goal of this project is to combine functional brain imaging and clinical methods
      in order to examine how treatment with disulfiram (DIS) alters neural activity related to
      alcohol-seeking motivation in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). DIS is an
      established, effective, FDA-approved medication for AUD that causes a highly aversive
      physical reaction if alcohol is consumed while it is being taken. The mere awareness of the
      risk or threat the DIS-alcohol reaction deters alcohol use, i.e. it is not necessary to drink
      alcohol while taking DIS to change behavior. By uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying
      this risk/threat-based psychological effect, it will be possible to integrate DIS with
      biologically based treatments targeted at these neural mechanisms, with the goal of improving
      the efficacy of DIS. Furthermore, the results will shed light on the general neural
      mechanisms by which awareness of risks of substance use impacts addictive motivation. This is
      a core process in a number of behavioral treatments for substance use disorders, such as
      Motivational Interviewing and Contingency Management, as well as in behavior change in
      non-treatment settings.

    <description>Patients will be hospitalized on an inpatient psychiatric unit for 1-7 days to initiate abstinence. An fMRI scan will be performed to examine neural mechanisms of alcohol motivation. Prior to discharge, patients will receive the first dose of disulfiram 500 mg. They will then attend an outpatient clinic every other day for 14 days. At each clinic visit, they will receive 500 mg of disulfiram under supervision. Another fMRI scan examining alcohol motivation will be performed. Following this, all patients will attend the clinic weekly, and will be prescribed disulfiram 250 mg daily to take at home. This will be followed followed by an optional extension of weekly visits taking disulfiram 250 mg daily for another 28 days, for a total of 70 days of disulfiram treatment.</description>
