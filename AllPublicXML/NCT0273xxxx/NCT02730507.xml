  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar degenerative diseases (LDD) are an increasingly common condition affecting millions of
      patients worldwide. LDD can impact not only function, but can also become markedly disabling
      and cause severe chronic pain. Recent studies support the idea that analysis of sagittal
      balance is a crucial keypoint to optimize the management of lumbar degenerative diseases,
      especially when spinal instrumentation is intended.

      The first treatment of these pathologies is a medical treatment (medications, physical
      therapy and exercise). Surgical treatment is frequently necessary if the symptoms worsen and
      is generally a posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation (screws, hooks and rods) and bone
      graft. Basic principle of the surgery is to realign the spine along the rod.

      Despite documented techniques for surgical planning, it appears that a significant number of
      patients are ultimately under-corrected after surgery Realignment failure has not only been
      associated with poor functional outcome but also major complications, such as pseudoarthrosis
      and rod breakage, which often results in additional surgical procedures.

      From a pragmatic point of view, there are two main reasons for realignment failure: poor
      surgical planning and poor execution. One of the assumptions is that perioperative manual
      bending of the rod may not always allow the surgeon to restore the sagittal parameters as
      intended.

      A new concept of patient-specific rod (PSR) is now being proposed by a French manufacturer in
      order to enable an optimal correction and surgical stabilization of the spine. PSR are
      designed to fit with the patient's unique sagittal spine profile and with surgeons' surgical
      planning. However, no relevant clinical data is currently available to support the expected
      medical benefit of this new technology.

      The objective of the study is therefore to carry out a study hypothesizing that the use of
      PSR could improve the percentage of patients whose sagittal profile is optimally corrected
      after spinal surgery, as well as the patient's quality of life.

    <description>The primary end point is the proportion of patients whose sagittal profile is optimally corrected 12 months after a spine-surgery. The optimally corrected sagittal profile definition is based on the following composite criteria:
Lombar Lordosis (LL), measured between the superior endplate of L1 and the sacral plate, is equal to the Pelvic Incidence of the patient ± 10° (-10°≤ LL - Pelvic Incidence≤10°)
Pelvic Tilt is less than 20°
Sagittal Vertical Axis is less than 40mm. These 3 criteria will be measured and combined to define an optimal sagittal profile, by 3 members of an independent committee. Radiographic parameters will be measured on sagittal full-spine x-rays. The patient positioning will be standardized in order to obtain comparable and reproducible images. The positioning is standing both feet on the same alignment, 20-25 cm between the two feet, upper arm fingers tip on the clavicle.</description>

Except for the bending procedure (patient specific rod or conventional rod with perioperative manual bending), the characteristics of implantable devices (biomaterial and diameter of the rod, design, type of screw, etc.) will be the same in each center.</description>
