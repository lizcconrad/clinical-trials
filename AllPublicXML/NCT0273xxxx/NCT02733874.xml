    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, single blind, positive controlled trials that assess the
      effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness analysis in patients with mild to moderate
      psoriasis vulgaris and compare Compound Clobetasol Propionate Ointment to Calcipotriol
      Betamethasone Ointment.

      Objectives of Study：

        1. Compare Compound Clobetasol Propionate Ointment to Calcipotriol Betamethasone Ointment
           in the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris in effectiveness and safety;

        2. Compare the cost-effectiveness analysis of two treatment programs.

    <description>The improvement of psoriasis area and severity index scores(PASI scores) are a system that assesses the damage of psoriasis severity and treatment response . The system is used to classify and evaluate according to the severity of lesions, areas of skin lesion and body surface area ratio of various body parts.</description>

    <measure>The overall evaluation of the researchers (Physician Global Assessment,PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>On every visiting viewpoint , researchers give a mark of the infiltration / hypertrophy (I), erythema (E) and scales (s) according to the level.PGA scores are acquired by the average of above three kinds of scores.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Symptom score reduce index (SSRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>1)According to the improvement of psoriasis area and severity index scores(PASI scores) before and after treatments, the symptom score reduce index (SSRI) was calculated.
2）The symptom score reduce index (SSRI) = (the PASI scores before treatment - the PASI scores after treatment) / the PASI scores before treatment x 100%</description>
