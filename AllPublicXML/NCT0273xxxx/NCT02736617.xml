    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well obinutuzumab works in combination with ibrutinib in
      treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or that does not
      respond to treatment (refractory). Obinutuzumab binds to a protein called cluster of
      differentiation (CD)20, which is found on B cells and some types of leukemia and lymphoma
      cells and help the immune system kill cancer cells. Ibrutinib blocks a protein called
      Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may help keep cancer cells from growing. Giving
      obinutuzumab in combination with ibrutinib may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Best overall response of complete response/partial response (CR/PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity defined as any adverse event (AE) grade 3 and higher. II. Progression free
      survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Gene expression profiling using Lymph5Cx test. II. Sequencing using the ion torrent
      platform (76 gene panel for known mutations in lymphoma).

      III. Sequencing of BTK to evaluate for BTK mutations. IV. Minimal residual disease testing
      (MRD by flow cytometry and targeted sequencing post treatment).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 (course 1)
      and day 1 (courses 2-6). Patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD)
      beginning on day 1 (course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial response (PR)
      continue to receive obinutuzumab IV every 2 months and ibrutinib PO QD for up to 2 years in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
