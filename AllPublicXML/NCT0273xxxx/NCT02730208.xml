    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of study is to evaluate the treatment effect of VX-661 in combination
      with ivacaftor (VX-661/ivacaftor) on chest imaging endpoints using low-dose computed
      tomography (LDCT) at Week 72, and to evaluate the safety of VX-661/ivacaftor through Week 72

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CF

          -  Percent predicted forced expiratory volume (ppFEV1) â‰¥70% of predicted normal for age,
             sex, and height during screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound

             subject.

          -  An acute upper or lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in
             therapy (including antibiotics) for pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1
             (first dose of study drug)

          -  Pregnant or nursing females.

          -  Sexually active subjects of reproductive potential who are not willing to follow the
             contraception requirements.
