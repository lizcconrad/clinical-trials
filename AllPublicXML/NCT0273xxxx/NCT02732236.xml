      Marginal zone lymphoma is a rare of subtype of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. Because of its rarity,
      prospective clinical trial is difficult to conduct. Therefore we want to make prospective MZL
      patients' cohort for several observation study

    <textblock>
      Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) is a distinct subgroup of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which is
      typically characterized by an indolent clinical course and long survival duration. MZL is
      responsible for approximately 7~8% of all NHL. In Korea, MZL accounts for 21% of all B-cell
      lymphoma and is the second most frequent histologic subtype following diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma. Annually, an estimated 500 patients are newly diagnosed with MZL. According to the
      previous large-scale analyses, MZL is usually a quiet indolent malignancy, which generally
      presents with limited stage of disease. Localized disease may be controlled with local
      treatment, and a high response rate can be achieved. Advanced MZL is associated with less
      favorable survival, and appears to be incurable with the currently available therapy.
      Transformation to large cell aggressive lymphoma may occur in the first recurrence or in
      subsequent relapses.

      Because of its rarity, prospective clinical trial is difficult to conduct. Therefore we want
      to make prospective MZL patients' cohort for several observation study especially related
      with Rituximab use (ex, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation)
