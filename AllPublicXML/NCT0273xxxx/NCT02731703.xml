  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will identify and enroll patients already scheduled to receive guided maxillary
      implant placement with palateless overdenture. Standard clinical practice will be followed
      for this multi-stage process. The study purpose is to evaluate the degree of satisfaction
      during the standard progression in order to determine at which post edentulous stage patients
      achieve maximum satisfaction using the Oral Health Impact Profile 49 (OHIP 49).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OHIP 49 will be administered at pre-treatment (edentulous condition) and after each visit
      (i.e., newly fabricated conventional denture, conversion to a 4 implant retained overdenture
      and finally a 4 implant retained palateless overdenture). Additionally they will be recalled
      yearly for 5 years.

      Participants will have an interim denture fabricated to be worn for 10-12 weeks. During this
      time, participants will have 4 implants placed and continue wearing the interim denture. At 8
      weeks after implant placement, participants will have locator attachments placed on implants
      and the interim denture snapped into place, termed the 'overdenture.' After 10-12 weeks of
      wearing this overdenture, patients will receive a new denture, termed 'final palateless
      overdenture,' which consists of a denture snapped into the 4 implants without a palate.
      Participants will be evaluated at a 10-12 week followup from insertion of this prosthesis.
      Participants will complete questionnaires at each stage of treatment.

      One year after delivery of the final palateless overdenture and for five consecutive years
      patients will be asked to return for a follow up appointment.

      Estimated duration of patient participation is approximately 5 years and 8 months (271
      weeks). Estimated time for active clinical treatment is 8 months (32 weeks) with
      understanding of flexibility based on laboratory fabricated denture frameworks and
      adjustments needed for approval of esthetics.

    <description>The OHIP 49 provides a measure of social impact of oral disorders by providing a comprehensive measure of dysfunction, discomfort and disability resulting from oral cavity conditions. The OHIP 49 is based on the adaptation of the World Health Organization classification. Responses on the OHIP 49 questionnaire are made on a patient satisfaction survey consisting of 49 items organized into 5 subscales (not at all satisfied, not very satisfied, reasonably satisfied, very satisfied, totally satisfied) and responses are based on a Likert scale.</description>
