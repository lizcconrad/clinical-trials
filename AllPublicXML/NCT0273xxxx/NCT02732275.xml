      This will be a First-in-Human, Phase 1, multi-center, non-randomized, open label study of
      DS-3201b, Histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH1/2 dual inhibitor to assess its safety and
      tolerability, identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ tentative recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D), and assess its pharmacokinetic/dynamic properties in Japanese subjects with
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
