      This study compares the efficacy of the ultrasound with fluoroscope in guidance of lumbar
      sympathetic block (LSB). The goals of the study are; 1) To show that US-guided LSB results in
      shorter performance time compared to fluoroscope-guided LSB, 2) To evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of US-guided LSB, and 3) To verify that US-guided LSB has similar success rates to
      fluoroscope-guided LSB. 50 patients who are supposed to undergo LSB due to sympathetically
      maintained pain, satisfy criteria of inclusion and exclusion, and voluntarily sign the
      informed consent will be enrolled.

    <description>Using Ultrasound, the L3 is identified by locating the lumbosacral junction on a paramedian sagittal scan and then counting cranially. After marking the level of L3 vertebra, the modified transverse scan through lumbar intertransverse space (ITS) is obtained with the transducer positioned 4-6 cm lateral to the mid-line at the L2-L3 intervertebral level. The needle is inserted from a lateral to medial direction using in-plane technique. The needle tip is inserted towards the anterior fascia of the psoas major muscle as close as paravertebral space.</description>

    <description>Briefly, fluoroscopic guided LSBs are performed at the lower third of the L2 or the upper third of the L3 vertebra. A targeted lumbar vertebral is identified by AP fluoroscopic imaging and the fluoroscopic C-arm is adjusted 25-35° laterally to avoid the transverse process over the needle pathway. After the skin infiltration, the needle is advanced toward the anterolateral edge of the target lumbar vertebra under fluoroscopic guidance using the tunnel vision technique.</description>
