  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic treatment of pancreatic necrosis complicated by trans digestive track (duodenal or
      gastric) has become a standard technique validated. The rate of high technical and clinical
      success (76 to 91% in 3 months) and the lower morbidity in the literature explains that
      validation. However this treatment is done at the cost of a higher median number of treatment
      sessions (4-5) explaining prolonged hospitalization, delays in rehabilitation and potentially
      high costs. The constant improvement of therapeutic endoscopy equipment was allowed to see
      the advent of metal prosthesis completely covered by a membrane allowing them endoscopic
      extraction with ease. It has thus been recently developed short prostheses, of large diameter
      (up to 15/16 mm), with broad flange (or stent &quot;diabolo&quot;) to be considered for use in the
      drainage of digestive peri collections. Few studies respectively determined the effectiveness
      of this type of prosthesis in the drainage of peri digestive collections Under echo endoscopy
      and treatment of necrosis of pancreatic origin. The purpose of this work is to evaluate
      multicenter prospective clinical and technical efficiency of laying completely covered stent
      &quot;diabolo&quot; in echo endoscopy for the treatment of necrosis of pancreatic origin.

        Recruitment is in hospital, all patients being hospitalized in case of complicated
        pancreatic necrosis requiring treatment. The treatment will be done like habitually by
        using a Diabolo prothesis. Investigators physicians will all doctors gastro enterology
        experts in interventional endoscopy supports daily basis patients with acute pancreatitis.
        Further investigation centers are tertiary referral centers authorized to support acute
        complicated pancreatitis.
