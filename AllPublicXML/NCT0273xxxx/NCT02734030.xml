  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the knee extensors' mechanical, morphological and myoelectric
      properties between subjects affected by anterior knee pain and a healthy control group. The
      investigators hypothesis is that patients with anterior knee pain present a reduction in the
      knee extensors' mechanical, morphological and myoelectric properties due to chronic muscle
      inhibition produced by the syndrome. In addition, the study also aims to evaluate whether
      there are differences in methodology for application of the Interpolated Twitch Technique for
      evaluation of the quadriceps muscle inhibition by comparing the use of supramaximal
      electrical stimulation on the femoral nerve (gold standard) with stimulation on the motor
      point (new methodology) in healthy subjects and individuals affected by anterior knee pain.
      The investigators hypothesis is that the stimulation on the motor point is less
      discomfortable than on the femoral nerve and muscle inhibition results are less variable
      (with lower dispersion) due to such lower discomfort

      Participants were divided in two groups (control group, n=16 and anterior knee pain group,
      n=16). Prior to participation, informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The
      evaluation was performed at the lower limb with severe symptoms of anterior knee pain in the
      patients, and at the dominant limb in the control group. Quadriceps Muscle inhibition was
      estimated using the Interpolated Twitch Technique, which involves applying a single
      electrical twitch stimulation to the femoral nerve (gold standard) during a maximal isometric
      knee extensor contraction. Muscle inhibition measurements were obtained with the aid of a
      Grass S88 (Quincy, MA, USA.) Muscle Stimulator in combination with and isolation unit
      approved for human use. Isometric and isokinetic knee extensor torques were obtained with a
      Biodex System 3 dynamometer (Biodex Medical System, Shirley - NY, USA). Electromyographic
      muscle activity was measured with bipolar surface electrodes (Kendall, Meditrace - 100;
      Ag/AgCl) that were placed on the muscle bellies of vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and
      rectus femoris. Muscle architecture was measured with a B-mode ultrasonographic system (SSD;
      Aloka Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with a linear-array probe (60 mm, 7.5MHz; Aloka). Single Leg Squat
      was used for clinical evaluation of the lower limb functionality.
