  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the Sentimag/Sienna+ System (Sentimag®) in clinical
      routine practice. On the one hand this allows evaluation of the equivalence of the two
      techniques. On the other hand this ensures that patients do not experience any possible
      disadvantages by participating. The hypothesis behind this evaluation is that Sentimag is as
      efficient as conventional sentinel node mapping.

      The programme will compare the Sentimag® with the conventional sentinel lymph node detection
      with radioactive tracer combined with blue dye (in centres using the combined technique) and
      thereby determine whether the new technique is equivalent to the standard technique for SLNB.

      Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now the standard technique used in breast cancer
      patients with a clinically and radiologically negative axilla. SLNB for breast cancer was
      introduced in the 1990s3 and it significantly reduces the morbidity associated with axillary
      node dissection (ALND) including lymphedema, seroma, numbness, wound infection, reduced
      shoulder motility, and chronic pain.2 The gold standard for sentinel node detection is the
      'combined technique'; using both blue dye and radioisotope injection. After allowing both
      radioisotope and blue dye to localize in the lymphatic system, the clinician uses a 'gamma
      probe' (a handheld scintillation counter) to locate the SLNs. The blue dye assists in
      localisation post-incision, with lymph nodes that are blue and/or radioactive are judged as
      'SLNs' and excised. Some centres use either radioisotope or blue dye alone. Although
      detection rates are lower, they can still reach satisfying values in experienced centres.

      The use of radioisotope exposes patients and healthcare workers to radiation, is heavily
      controlled by legislation (both on the specific training for operators and subsequent
      disposal of surgical waste), and provides poor pre-operative imaging. As a result, many
      centres have stopped undertaking routine pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy. There is thus a
      clinical need to develop new techniques for detecting sentinel nodes without these drawbacks.
