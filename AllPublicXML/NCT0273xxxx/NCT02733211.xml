  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MD-Logic Automated Insulin Delivery System is intended for patients with type 1 diabetes
      mellitus for subcutaneous infusion of insulin and the continuous measurement of interstitial
      glucose to aid in the management of their diabetes. The product automatically adjusts basal
      insulin delivery and delivers correction boluses in response to real-time glucose
      measurements by CGM to maintain blood glucose within the desired range, to improve metabolic
      control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.

      The proposed study is an open-label, two-center, randomized, cross-over study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of night closed-loop control using the MD-Logic automated insulin
      delivery system compared to sensor augmented pump therapy in poorly controlled patients with
      type 1 diabetes at home The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of 4 weeks glucose control using the MD-Logic System in individuals with poorly
      controlled type 1 diabetes at patient's home
