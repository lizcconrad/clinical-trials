    <textblock>
      This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial is evaluating superiority of
      Letrozole-palbociclib combination versus letrozole-placebo combination in ER positive
      endometrioid adenocarcinoma of endometrium

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study is
      evaluating the efficacy of letrozole-palbociclib combination against letrozole-placebo
      combination in women with ER+ advanced or relapsed endometrial cancer.

      Stratification

      Patients are stratified according to:

        1. Number of prior lines of therapy (primary advanced disease vs. 1st relapse vs. ≥2
           relapses)

        2. Measurable vs. evaluable disease

        3. Prior use of MPA/Megace

      Randomization 1:1 randomization The patients with prior MPA/Megace treatment will be capped
      to a maximum of 50%.

      Study arms

      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: (comparator) letrozole-placebo combination therapy until progression.

        -  Arm B: (experimental arm): Letrozole- palbociclib combination therapy until progression
