      Objective: To evaluate what factors contribute to activity limitations in subjects with
      rheumatoid arthritis considering the International Classification of Functioning, Disability
      and Health model.

      Methods: A cross-sectional study on 81 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using
      instruments to measure five constructs of the component activities.

    <textblock>
      The investigators used the ICF model to analyze factors reported to be associated with
      functioning and disability in individuals with RA, including dexterity fatigue, stiffness ,
      pinch, handgrip, strength, range of motion (ROM) deficit, deformities , mental health,
      vitality, and pain .

    <measure>Model 1- Test d´Evaluation dês Membres Supérieurs de Personnes Agées, - TEMPA rheumatoid arthritis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to thirty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The TEMPA is assessing the performance of the upper extremities and consists of eight standardized tasks. Scoring of the task analysis dimension ranges from zero to 150 (a score of zero indicates no disability). The TEMPA is scored according to the time required (in seconds) to complete each task; the higher the score, the greater the disability</description>

    <description>The SF-36 has eight scales and a final score ranging from zero to 100 for each of the eight dimensions (a score of 100 represents the best state of health). The Brazilian Portuguese version of the SF-36 in patient population with RA has been demonstrated to be a reproducible and valid.</description>
