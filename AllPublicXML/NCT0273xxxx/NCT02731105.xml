      Study to compare two gels that are used to treat acne vulgaris. It will be compared the
      tolerability and effectivity following application of two combination topical acne products
      clindamycin 1% and 0.025% tretinoin gel (Acnatac® Gel), adapalen 0,1% and benzoyl peroxide
      2,5% gel (Epiduo® Gel).

      At baseline, data will be collected regarding demographics and medical/medication histories,
      lesions will be counted and a medical examination will be done. Female patients who could be
      pregnant will be tested by using a pregnancy test. Each patient receives two tubes with
      different medication that has to be applied on the left or right side of their face each by
      themselves at home once a day(Acnatac® Gel, Duac® Gel, Epiduo® Gel).

      Patients and study-center staff will be instructed not to reveal the treatment allocation to
      the investigator, and patients will be instructed not to apply the product in their presence
      Follow-up visits will be conducted on days 0, 7 and 21. On these days the investigator
      measures erythema and dryness/scaling using the Investigators´Global Assessment, the severity
      of burning/ stinging and itching by using Study Subject Self-Assessment, records the number
      of acneiform lesions, measures health-related quality of life using DLQI-Score, skin
      hydration using Corneometer, transepidermal water loss (TEWL) using Tewameter®, skin surface
      pH using pH-Meter and skin sebum excretion using Sebumeter.

      On days 0, 7, and 21 it will be collected information about current use of any other
      medication. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be monitored at each
      visit. On day 21 there will be made a last pregnancy test. Checking compliance will be made
      regularly.
