      A Phase III Double Blinded, Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate Efficacy of Protection
      Against HPV-16 and 18 Related Diseases, Immunogenicity and Safety of Recombinant Human
      Papillomavirus Virus-like Particle Vaccine (Type 16 and 18 L1 Proteins, Yeast) in Healthy
      Females Aged 18-30 Years.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled study. The study
      vaccine is recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent (types 16 and 18) vaccine (Yeast), the
      placebo is aluminium phosphate diluent.

      This study planned to enrol 12000 healthy female aged 18-30 in 10 study sites. Each
      participants will received a three-dose schedule of vaccine or placebo randomly but with the
      proportion controlled as 1:1 for vaccine group and placebo group. After each inoculation, the
      immediate reaction will be observed for 30 minutes, and the local and systemic reaction will
      be systematically observed for 7 days. After the first inoculation, adverse event will be
      collected until one month after the final inoculation, while serious adverse event will be
      collected until 6 months after the final inoculation. Blood samples will be collected before
      the first inoculation, and one month after the final injection, blood samples will also be
      collected in a group of participants containing 800 people to detect antibody titer.

      Follow-up visit will be conducted 14 times: month 0, month 0 + 8 days, month 2, month 2 + 8
      days, month 6, month 6 + 8 days, month 7, month 12, month 18, month 24, month 30, month 36,
      month 48, month 60. When cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) is indicated,
      the participant will receive standard treatment and drop out from the study.

    <description>Among the 14 follow-up visits which will be conducted during the study, 9 visits are gynecological follow-up visits. In these gynecological visits, cervical samples will be collected to conduct HPV DNA detection and cytological detection to evaluate whether occurred cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and what grade of neoplasia occurred.</description>
