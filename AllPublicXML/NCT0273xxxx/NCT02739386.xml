      The research questions to be addressed by this study are as follows:

        1. What is the prevalence of ipilimumab use among adults with a history of autoimmune
           disease that received treatment with ipilimumab for advanced melanoma?

        2. Do melanoma patients with a history of autoimmune disease experience complications that
           require hospitalization related to their underlying autoimmune disease following
           treatment with ipilimumab?
