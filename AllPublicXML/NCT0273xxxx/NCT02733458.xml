      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine, etoposide,
      pegaspargase and dexamethasone (GELAD) chemotherapy and sandwiched radiotherapy as first-line
      treatment in patients with de novo stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma,
      nasal type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL), nasal type, is a rare subtype of
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. Radiotherapy alone for
      stage IE/IIE diseases has good response rate but with high relapse rates, ranging from
      20-50%. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved the long-term survival for
      patients with stage IE/IIE diseases. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been
      established. This study is designed with two cycles GELAD chemotherapy, followed by 50-56Gy
      radiotherapy, and completed with additional two cycles GELAD chemotherapy. The efficacy and
      safety of this sandwiched chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of stage IE/IIE ENKTCL will be
      measured.
