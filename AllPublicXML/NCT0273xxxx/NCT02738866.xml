  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the role of continuing palbociclib treatment in
      combination with another type of hormonal therapy (fulvestrant) after disease progression of
      palbociclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II trial, the primary objective is to determine the progression-free survival
      (PFS) of the cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) palbociclib with fulvestrant in
      women and men with estrogen or progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive, HER2-negative
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who progressed on treatment with palbociclib and an aromatase
      inhibitor (AI). The study will also determine the prevalence rate of estrogen receptor α
      (ESR1) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) mutations in the study population.

      The secondary objectives include evaluating the progression-free survival (PFS) in
      participants with and without ESR1 mutations, and PI3K mutations through analysis of tumor
      biopsies and circulating plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) samples. The study will also describe other
      alterations in genes and gene products relevant to the cell cycle, drug targets, tumor
      sensitivity and resistance, and identify novel protein kinases activated in biopsies from
      participants with hormone refractory MBC who progressed on prior palbociclib and AI. The data
      will be correlated with tumor subtypes, expression profiles, and candidate phosphoprotein
      expression with PFS in the study population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women may be premenopausal or postmenopausal

             with curative intent

          -  ER-positive and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative tumor

             disease is allowed in addition to any number of prior lines of endocrine therapy; no
             prior treatment with fulvestrant, everolimus, or any agent whose mechanism of action
