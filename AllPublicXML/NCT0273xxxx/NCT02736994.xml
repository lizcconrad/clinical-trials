  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of PIP toothbrush cleaner® on the microbial
      composition and Candida albicans colonization of denture biofilm formation. Additionally, its
      effect will be compared to that of cleansing tablets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therefore the present study intended to compare a probiotic denture cleaning protocol with
      the current protocols. It was aimed to examine, in institutionalized older individuals with
      removable complete dentures, if the microbial composition and C. albicans colonization of the
      denture biofilm differs when overnight stored in a probiotic cleaning product compared to
      water or a cleanser. Additionally the influence of brushing on these protocols was
      investigated.
