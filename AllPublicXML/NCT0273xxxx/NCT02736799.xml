  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Vibrant capsule is a novel vibrating device for the treatment of gastrointestinal
      disorders. The effect of different vibrations on the motor functions of the gastrointestinal
      tract are unclear. The study will focus on the stomach in healthy volunteers.

      The study will compare the effects of Vibrant capsule treatment and Sham capsule treatment on
      gastric emptying and gastric motility in healthy volunteers.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures, and be willing
             and able to comply with study procedures

          2. No medical problems or chronic diseases, specifically, no type 2 diabetes mellitus

          3. Body mass index of 18-35 kg/m2

          4. Female subjects must have negative urine pregnancy tests and must not be lactating
             prior to receiving study medication and radiation exposure. For females able to bear
             children, a hormonal (i.e., oral, implantable, or injectable) and single-barrier
             method, or a double-barrier method of birth control must be used throughout the study.
             Female subjects unable to bear children must have this documented in the medical
             record [i.e., tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal (defined as a minimum
             of one year since the last menstrual period)].

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable or unwilling to provide informed consent or to comply with study procedures

          2. Diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases

          3. Structural or metabolic diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system

          4. Unable to avoid the following over-the-counter medications 48 hours prior to the
             baseline period and throughout the study:

               1. Medications that alter gastrointestinal transit including laxatives, magnesium
                  and aluminum containing antacids, prokinetics, erythromycin

               2. Analgesic drugs including Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and COX-2
                  inhibitors NOTE: stable doses of thyroid replacement, estrogen replacement,
                  low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection, and birth control (but with adequate
                  backup contraception as drug-interactions with birth control have not been
                  conducted) are permissible.

          5. History of recent surgery (within 60 days of screening)

          6. Acute or chronic illness or history of illness which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could pose a threat or harm to the subject or obscure interpretation of
             laboratory test results or interpretation of study data, such as frequent angina,
             Class III or IV congestive heart failure, moderate impairment of renal or hepatic
             function, poorly controlled diabetes, etc.

          7. Any clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory
             abnormalities identified in the medical record, as determined by the investigator

          8. Acute gastrointestinal illness within 48 hours of initiation of the baseline period

          9. Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding

         10. History of excessive alcohol use or substance abuse

         11. Participation in an investigational study within the 30 days prior to dosing in the
             present study

         12. Any other reason, which in the opinion of the investigator, would confound proper
             interpretation of the study
