  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a score based on glycosaminoglycan (GAG) profiling in subjects with suspicion
      of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is hypothesized to distinguish malignant masses when early
      actionable clinical decisions are desirable. For example to screen population at risk or to
      distinguish benign masses from RCC before patient is referred to surgery. To this end, the
      plasmatic and urinary GAGs will be measured in prospectively enrolled subjects and the
      resulting scores correlated to the post-surgical definitive diagnosis and eventual RCC size.
      A positive significant correlation is suggestive that GAG profiling can be used to guide
      clinical intervention in a subject at risk or referred to nephrectomy because of suspicion of
      RCC. The biomarker in patients with high risk RCC will be monitored to observe its
      correlation with disease progression. Also, the biological significance of this positive
      correlation will be evaluated using gene expression profiling. This data may also be used to
      improve further the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed biomarker.
