  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ubenimex is being developed for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (World
      Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to improve exercise capacity and delay clinical worsening.
      This study is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, extension study to evaluate long-term
      safety and efficacy of ubenimex in patients with PAH (WHO Group 1) who complete Study
      EIG-UBX-001 (Study EIG-UBX-001 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial) and meet the eligibility criteria for Study EIG-UBX-002. The primary
      objective for this study is:

      - to obtain long-term safety and tolerability data for ubenimex (150 mg administered three
      times daily [TID]) in patients with PAH (WHO Group 1).
