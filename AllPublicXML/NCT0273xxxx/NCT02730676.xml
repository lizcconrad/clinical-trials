    <textblock>
      This study assesses the nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in adopters of electronic
      cigarettes following a 12-hour tobacco and nicotine abstinence. The PK results of this study
      will be compared to historical data on smokers obtained in prior studies, as well as on naïve
      and short-term users of electronic cigarettes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, open-label study to assess the nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK)
      parameters over a 6-hour period in adopters of electronic cigarettes with respect to an
      in-clinic 10-minute ad libitum period following a 12-hour tobacco and nicotine abstinence. In
      addition to PK parameters, subjective effects of urge for product will be assessed over a
      6-hour period concurrently with the collection of the PK blood samples following a protocol
      defined schedule. The results of this study will be compared to historical PK and urge for
      product data obtained from smokers as well as naïve and short-term users of electronic
      cigarettes. In addition to the PK parameters and urge for product outcomes, plasma will be
      assessed for cotinine concentration prior to the 12-hour abstinence period.
