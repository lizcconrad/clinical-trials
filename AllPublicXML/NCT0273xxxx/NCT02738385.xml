  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown relationship between exercise intensity and improvement
      cardiometabolic health. It has been suggested that high intensity interval training and also
      moderate training generate positive effects on metabolic risk factors. For these reasons, it
      is necessary to clarify which type of training, is more effective to improve cardiometabolic
      health in latinamerican population.
