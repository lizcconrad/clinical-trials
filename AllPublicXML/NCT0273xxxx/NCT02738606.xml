    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effect of having liver resection
      with standard of care chemotherapy to having standard of care chemotherapy alone in patients
      whose colorectal cancer has spread to their liver and lungs.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance to be
      assigned to either group.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will have liver resection surgery, followed by
           standard of care chemotherapy. The chemotherapy you receive will depend on what the
           doctor thinks is in your best interest.

        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will receive standard of care chemotherapy that your
           doctor thinks is in your best interest.

      You will sign a separate consent form explaining how the standard of care chemotherapy works,
      the chemotherapy schedule, and its risks.

      Group 1:

      If you are in Group 1, you will have standard of care liver resection surgery. A portion of
      the liver that is affected by the tumor will be removed either with many small incisions or
      one large incision. An ultrasound device will be used to help the doctor see the affected
      area. The study doctor will explain this procedure in more detail and you will sign a
      separate consent form explaining the standard of care surgery and its risks.

      Study Visits:

      Both groups will have study visits every 3-6 months while on study. The following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a chest x-ray or CT scan to check status of disease.

        -  You will have an abdominal and pelvic CT scan, PET/CT scan, or an MRI scan to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

        -  You will complete the quality of life survey you completed during screening.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for up to 3 years. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse
      or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Liver resection surgery for patients with colorectal cancer
      that is able to be resected can be done with standard techniques using FDA-approved devices.
      Liver resection surgery for patients with colorectal cancer that can only be partially
      resected is considered investigational.

      Up to 80 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with synchronous or metachronous diagnosis of resectable liver metastases by
             computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen: a)
             Patients requiring percutaneous or intraoperative ablation of liver metastases &lt; 2 cm
             in size are eligible. b) Patients who underwent prior liver resection or ablation for
             colorectal liver metastases are eligible.

          2. Patients previously treated with systemic chemotherapy and/or biologic agents for
             colorectal cancer are eligible.

          3. The primary tumor in the colon or rectum may be intact or resected.

          4. Low-volume lung metastases are defined as solid pulmonary nodules &lt; 2 cm with
             non-spiculated contours, no benign-appearing calcifications, and &lt;/= 14 in number,
             diagnosed by computed tomography of the chest or positron emission tomography (PET).

          5. Lung metastases will be unresectable due to anatomic location, distribution, or
             patients' comorbidities, as determined by review of imaging by a faculty member in the
             Department of Thoracic &amp; Cardiovascular Surgery.

          6. Patients 18 years of age and older.

          7. Patients must sign a study-specific consent form.

          8. Patients will undergo CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate lung
             and liver metastases within 30 days of registration. For patients who cannot tolerate
             CT contrast or have hepatic steatosis that reduces the sensitivity of CT, MRI of the
             liver will be performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiographic evidence of disease other than liver and lungs, with the exception of
             mediastinal lymph nodes &lt; 2 cm and hepatoduodenal ligament lymphadenopathy, diagnosed
             by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography.

          2. Inadequate liver function, as evidenced by serum bilirubin &gt;/= 2 mg/dL, international
             normalized ratio (INR) &gt;/= 1.7, and/or platelet count &lt; 50,000/microL.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 3-4.

          4. Patient refusal to participate in randomization.

          5. Pregnant women are excluded from this study.

          6. Planned stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for the pulmonary metastases.
