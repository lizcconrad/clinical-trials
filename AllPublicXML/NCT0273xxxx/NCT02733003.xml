      This study seeks to implement the Women's Health CoOp (Cooperative) (WHC) intervention into
      HIV treatment centers (HCT), antenatal, and substance treatment clinics in South Africa to
      translate the evidence-based intervention into real-world settings. Implementation, service,
      and patient outcomes will be evaluated through an iterative stepped wedge design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This five-year implementation science study is using cluster-randomized stepped-wedge design
      to evaluate the implementation, service, and patient outcomes associated with the WHC for
      alcohol and other drug (AOD)-using HIV positive women in usual care settings.

      A list of four substance use treatment clinics and four HTC/healthcare clinics, which have
      been identified and approved by the City of Cape Town, South Africa will be randomized to
      begin the intervention during one of the four cycles. Each HTC/healthcare clinic will be
      paired with a substance rehab center based on geographic proximity, and each pair was
      randomized by computer into four succeeding 6-month implementation cycles where
      implementation of the WHC is taking place simultaneously at the paired sites. Up to 120 HIV
      positive participants will be recruited in each cycle (60 from each clinic) for the patient
      level outcomes.

      Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to assess the appropriateness of
      marketing plans developed through formative methods, as well as the acceptability, adoption,
      feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of the WHC intervention implementation as well as
      service outcomes (comprehensive services and timely service linkages) during each
      implementation cycle.

      Each implementation cycle will last 6 months, with a &quot;1-month formative lesson learned&quot;
      evaluation. Subsequently, we will collect post-intervention data from each cycle. The process
      repeats itself over each cycle and these formative periods between cycles will be used to
      inform backward- and forward- implementation strategies, make modifications to the WHC, and
      leave time for site-specific training for the next cycle. Consequently, the sites randomized
      to the first cycle will have the longest post-intervention observation period whose
      implementation sustainability will be checked through fidelity forms and sustainability
      questionnaires, and sites in fourth cycle will benefit the most from the pre-intervention
      data because of lessons learned and information shared in pre-focus groups.

      The intervention will be implemented in a group, however there may be instances when only one
      participant is available and therefore the intervention will be implemented one-on-one. The
      WHC has previously been tested in group and one-on-one formats and both have demonstrated
      consistent significant intervention effects. Research staff will train clinic staff members
      to deliver the intervention. The intervention will be delivered by clinic staff and will not
      be part of the research. The research questions are related to the feasibility of
      implementing the intervention in clinics and its acceptability to clinic staff and patients.
      We will collect information on patient-level outcomes to determine if the intervention is
      effective when it is delivered by clinic staff to patients in the clinic. Also, to assess
      acceptability of the intervention sessions among patients, we will conduct
      post-implementation focus groups with a randomly selected sub-sample of participants who
      participated in the intervention and completed their final 6-month appointment in each
      implementation cycle.

      Implementation of the WHC in usual care settings has the potential to reach more vulnerable
      women and could have a high public health impact if implementation is shown to be effective
      and sustainable in these real-world settings.
