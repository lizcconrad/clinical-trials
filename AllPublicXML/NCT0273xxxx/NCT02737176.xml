      This study is to verify the efficacy of tobacco cessation in patients with oral diseases;
      periodontitis, dental implant and oral mucosal diseases by a multicenter prospective trial.
      Tobacco cessation intervention is implemented for 12 weeks. During the tobacco cessation
      intervention for the subjects, attending doctors implement standard treatments for their oral
      diseases. Improvement of each disease is evaluated between smoking cessation intervention
      group and non-cessation intervention group.

      It has been concluded that available evidence suggests that behavioral interventions for
      tobacco cessation conducted by oral health professionals incorporating an oral examination
      component in the dental office or community setting may increase tobacco abstinence rates
      among both cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco users (Cochrane Database Syst
      Rev.6:CD005084.) However, efficacy of tobacco cessation for oral diseases by oral health
      professionals are not elucidated. There are few studies on tobacco cessation intervention by
      dentists but none in terms of reduction of oral diseases or further disease prevention.
      Association for the Japanese Academy of Maxillofacial Implants, Association for the Japanese
      Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, Association for the Japanese Society of Oral
      Implantology, Japanese Society of Oral Medicine, Japanese Society of Periodontology, Japanese
      Academy of Clinical Periodontology, Japanese Society for Oral Health, Japanese Society of
      Dentistry for Medically Compromised Patient and Japanese Society of Oral Oncology conduct a
      study to verify the efficacy of tobacco cessation in patients with oral diseases;
      periodontitis, dental implant and oral mucosal diseases by a multicenter prospective trial.

    <description>Tobacco cessation intervention is implemented for 12 weeks. The nicotine dependence status is evaluated by the FTND (Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence) test. The point 3 or more is regarded as a moderate or high tobacco dependence and determining a cessation intervention. During the tobacco cessation intervention for the subjects, attending doctors implement standard treatments for their oral diseases. Even if participants fail to abstain from smoking, the oral treatment is continued. In case of the use of the NRTs (nicotine patch and/or gum), the investigators supply it for 2 weeks as a free of charge, and later the subjects themselves purchase it as over the counter (OTC) drugs at a pharmacy.</description>

During the study, attending doctors implement a tobacco cessation intervention with standard treatments for above oral diseases.
Even if the subjects failed to abstain from smoking, the treatment is continued.
In case of the use of the nicotine replacement therapy, The investigators supply NRTs (nicotine patch or gum) for 2 weeks as a free of charge, and later the subjects themselves purchase it as over the counter (OTC) drugs at a pharmacy.</description>
