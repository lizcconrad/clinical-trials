  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Novus system intended to provide ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion or extension in
      individuals with foot drop and thigh muscle weakness, following an upper motor neuron injury
      or disease. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the usability of the Novus
      system among these patients and to gain subjects' feedback regarding the device when used on
      a daily basis.The secondary objective is to obtain information about the performance of the
      system as a gait assistive device and to evaluate the subject's Quality of Life while using
      the system.

      The study will be carried out in two phases. Phase one (4 weeks) will focus on evaluating the
      usability of the Novus system. Phase two (8 weeks) will enable continued clinical follow up.
      The study will include sixteen (16) subjects suffering from foot drop and thigh muscles
      weakness due to upper motor neuron injury or disease; eight (8) subjects will be new users
      with no Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) experience and the other eight (8) will be
      experienced Ness L300/Ness L300 Plus users. Phase two of the study will include only the new
      users.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the usability of the Novus system among
      these patients and gain subjects' feedback regarding the device when used on a daily basis.
      The secondary objective is to obtain information about the performance of the system as a
      gait assistive device and to evaluate the subject's Quality of Life while using the system.
      System usability will be evaluated by adapted 5 point Likert scale usability questionnaire
      and patient's feedback questionnaire. Quality of life (QoL) will be measured through
      Participation scale questionnaire and functional ambulation assessments; modified Emory
      Functional Ambulation Profile (mEFAP) that will be performed with and without the system and
      2 minute walk test (2MWT) with and without the system.

    <description>System usability will be evaluated by a usability questionnaire that was constructed according to the system's requirements. Subjects will be asked to complete a series of actions regarding the overall operation of the system. Each action will be rated in a 5 point likert scale, according to the performance. An average score will be calculated for each question.</description>
