  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to assess the anti-infective efficacy of D-PLEX over a period of 3 months
      post operation as well as the safety over a period of 6 months, by preventing sternal
      infection post cardiac surgery in patients above the age of 18, including high risk patients
      for infection. This study is a 2 parts study: part 1 is a single arm, part 2 is randomized
      controlled study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      D-PLEX is a new formulation of extended controlled release Doxycycline, which is impregnated
      into a synthetic, β Tri-Calcium Phosphate (β-TCP).

      The components of the extended controlled release antibiotic formulation are doxycycline
      hyclate, poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or PLGA, and a lipid matrix comprised of cholesterol,
      and 2 phosphatidyl-choline phospholipids, specifically dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)
      and distearoyl phosphatidylcholine (DSPC).

      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and provide signed informed consent, will be
      enrolled into the study and will be treated with D-PLEX concomitantly with standard of care.

      D-PLEX will be administered as a single application during a cardiac surgery (index
      procedure) immediately prior to sternal closure, as an adjunct to the standard care.

      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of the controlled release antibiotic
      (doxycycline) by the reduction in the number of sternal infections observed during the
      treatment period in any subject above the age of 18 years, including patients with high risk
      for infection.

      Additional follow up for prolonged safety assessments only, will be done as follows until 24
      weeks.

Study population include subjects above the age of 18 years, that undergoing cardiac surgery through mid-sternotomy, including patients with high risk of infection, such as diabetes (Insulin and/or non-insulin dependent), patients with Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), heavy smokers, Bilateral Mammary artery harvesting, and subjects administered chronic steroid treatment.
Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and provide signed informed consent, will be enrolled into the study and will be treated with D-PLEX concomitantly with standard of care (part 1) or randomized 2:1 to D-PLEX concomitantly with standard of care vs. standard of care only (part 2).</intervention_model_description>
