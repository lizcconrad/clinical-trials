  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the clinical effects of the addition of metronomic oral
      vinorelbine to letrozole and anastrozole. The study will compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of oral metronomic vinorelbine administered in combination with letrozole or
      anastrozole, as treatment for hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      without resistance to Aromatase Inhibitors (AI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Letrozole and Anastrozole are AI generally used as the first line of therapy for women with
      HR+ breast cancer.

      Furthermore, present hormonal treatments of advanced breast cancer (ABC) or Metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) are sub-optimal, as only approximately one half of patients with oestrogen
      and/or progesterone receptor positive tumours will respond to therapy.

      For this patient population, chemotherapy is a valid option, especially after failure or
      intolerance to hormone therapy. Both combination and sequential single-agent chemotherapy are
      reasonable options. Based on the available data, sequential monotherapy is recommended as the
      preferred choice for MBC. Preferred first-line chemotherapy single agents are anthracyclines,
      taxanes, capecitabine, gemcitabine and vinorelbine.

      The development of oral chemotherapy formulations offer numerous benefits to patients,
      oncologists, oncology nurses, pharmacists and healthcare providers Metronomic therapy (MT)
      refers to repetitive, low doses of chemotherapy drugs. MT exerts an effect not only on tumor
      cells, but also on their microenvironment. In particular, the low-dose schedule compromises
      the repairing process of endothelial cells, leading to an anti-angiogenic effect. A
      systematic review of the results of phase I, II and III studies suggests that MT is a
      treatment option for breast cancer patients, has a low toxicity profile, efficacy in most
      patients and has potentially significant cost-effective advantages for public health.
