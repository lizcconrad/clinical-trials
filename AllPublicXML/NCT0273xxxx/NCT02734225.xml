  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis produces degeneration and joint wear that greatly affects the patient's
      proprioceptive system increasing instability. After total knee arthroplasty intervention, it
      is recommended that the patient performs a rehabilitation procedure to minimize deficits
      caused by surgery. In this job it is essential to insist on the importance of recovering
      balance after total knee arthroplasty intervention, and assess a specifically designed
      protocol to restore its function. An intervention which includes a dynamometric platform as a
      training method was proposed. The randomized clinical trial compared a control group that
      performed balance exercises on parallel bars, unstable plates, ramps and stairs against an
      experimental group that included dynamometric platforms training as a differentiator.
