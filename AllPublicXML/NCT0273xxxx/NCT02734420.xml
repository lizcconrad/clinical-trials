  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to assess the clinical effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT)
      on dentin with carious lesions in primary teeth. Patients with primary molars exhibiting deep
      carious lesions on the occlusal surface indicated for restorative treatment will be randomly
      allocated to three groups: Group 1 - traditional caries removal with a low-speed drill; Group
      2 - PDT + PapaMblue (carious tissue removal agent) modified with methylene blue; and Group 3
      - PDT with methylene blue 0.05%. PDT will be performed with low-level laser for the treatment
      of the carious tissue. Dentin samples will be removed before and after PDT for
      microbiological analysis. The microbiological samples will be cultured in Brucella blood
      agar, Mitis Salibarius-bacitracin agar and Rogosa SL agar. The teeth will then be restored
      using high-viscosity glass ionomer cement, with clinical and radiographic follow up at six,
      12 and 24 months. The data will be submitted to descriptive statistics.

      The groups of study (Group 1)- Conventional caries removal with low-speed drill (Group 2)-
      PDT combined with PapaMblue (Group 3)- PDT combined with methylene blue

      The data in descriptive statistics will be used The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test
      will be used for the comparison of categorical variables (age and gender). The Student's
      t-test and analysis of variance will be used for the comparison of signs and symptoms of
      reversible pulpitis. Pearson's correlation coefficients will be calculated to determine the
      strength of correlations among the continuous variables.

    <measure>Microbiological analysis - collection of dentinal tissue and restoration with glass ionomer cement</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on a study by Guglielmi et al. (2011)(30) teeth with be selected (n = 48) and divided into three groups, as delineated in Chart 4. Fragments of dentinal tissue will be collected from all teeth before and after treatment for microbiological analysis. The teeth will be restored with glass ionomer cement in all cases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographs evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 mounth</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic subtraction and the evaluation of the density of the remaining dentin will be performed prior to and following treatment for the removal of carious tissue as well as at six, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Periapical radiographs will be performed initially to include or exclude teeth based on the eligibility criteria. Immediately following the clinical procedure, the first bitewing radiograph will be taken. Bitewing x-rays will also be taken during the three follow up sessions.The bitewing x-rays will be standardized using a positioner. A portion of self-curing acrylic resin will be placed on the surface of the tooth to be evaluated and its antagonist for the impression of the surface anatomy and adapted to the positioner. This will allow the same positioning of the film during the different evaluations as well as the standardization of the x-rays at the same vertical and horizontal angles and distance for all radiographs taken with the same patient.</description>
