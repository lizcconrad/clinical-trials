  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to gain preliminary information and knowledge on metabolic
      profile in ASD. The benefit of this study will be to expand our insight of the potential
      relationship in metabolic processes and neuropsychological functions in ASD. For example,
      based on the obtained data of the study we can determine whether there is a link between the
      tryptophan pathway and cognitive functions in autism. The project is based on a systematic
      and multidisciplinary approach using tracers for delineating the mechanism by which the
      metabolism of amino acids like TRP is involved in affective and cognitive functions in ASD.
      Using an innovative approach to the evaluation of amino acids has not been used in adults
      with ASD. In addition, the obtained data of the study holds promise to develop specific
      markers (metabolic and/or neuropsychological) for guiding the identification those
      individuals with increased risk of developing mood disturbances or cognitive impairment, and
      for predicting the therapeutic effect of a specific nutritional interventions in subjects
      with ASD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the metabolic profile of different amino acids and cognitive
      functions in adults and adolescents with ASD in comparison with age- and gender-matched
      healthy young adults. The study involves 1 screening visit of approximately 2 hours and 1
      study day of 5 hours

      The objective is to explore changes in amino acids (e.g. TRP pathway) in ASD and evaluate the
      function of TRP in neuropsychological functions by using the technique of stable isotope and
      our newly developed 'single pulse method' with multiple amino acid and keto-acid isotopes.

      The aim of this study is to determine the underlying mechanism by which the metabolism of
      amino acids such as TRP are involved in mood and cognitive functions in ADS.

    <description>Study Day: The subject will arrive fasted. A catheter will be inserted in the arm for stable isotope infusion and blood sampling. The hand of the arm used for blood sampling will be placed in a thermostatically controlled warmed box that heats the air. Immediately after a baseline blood sample is taken, an infusion with stable isotopes will be administered by the research nurse. Stable isotopes are given to measure amino acid metabolism.
