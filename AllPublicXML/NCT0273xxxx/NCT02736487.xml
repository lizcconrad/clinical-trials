  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research project is to examine whether short-term use of portable air
      pollution filtration can result in changes in indoor airborne pollutants and impact on
      cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes of the inhabitants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on evaluating the short-term benefits of a common portable air purifier
      technology in reducing air pollutant exposure and the anticipated concomitant health impacts.
      High ambient levels of various air pollutants in the Shanghai area serve as a useful model to
      test the portable air purifier intervention in a realistic setting. As most people using a
      portable air purifier would only be able to do so in their residences, the investigators have
      designed our study only to test residential air purifier use. Our hypothesis is that the
      reduction in pollutant concentrations in indoor air caused by the air purifier will result in
      measurable reductions in risk factors for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

    <description>This intervention involved three sequential steps: (1) 12 to 20 hours of true air filtration intervention; (2) at least two weeks of washout period; (3) 12 to 20 hours of sham air filtration intervention. In the indoor environment, the portable filtration device drew room air, sent it through filter and active carbon (for true filtration) or active carbon alone (sham filtration) and then delivered processed air back to room air. In the study the portable filtration device processes 2.8 cubic meter of room air per minute. The washout period lasted for at least two weeks where no filtration intervention was implemented.</description>
