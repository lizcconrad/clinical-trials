      The investigators propose to use Belinostat in combination with AZT as consolidation therapy
      for the treatment of ATLL.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATLL is an aggressive malignancy caused by HTLV-1. ATLL cannot be cured by conventional
      chemotherapy thus urging the development of new therapeutic strategies. HDAC inhibitors are
      broadly active anti-neoplastic agents that can be exploited for the treatment of ATLL as it
      has been demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of HDACs promotes acetylation of
      nucleosomes and chromatin unwinding at the HTLV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), which
      results in transcription of the viral genome.

      Belinostat, a potent pan HDAC inhibitor, causes H3 subunit acetylation and induces HTLV-1 Tax
      expression in cultured ATLL cells resulting in dose-dependent apoptosis. Further, Belinostat
      blocks constitutive expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B
      cells (NF-κB), and increases apoptosis in the presence of AZT.

        -  This is an open-label, single arm, phase II study of zidovudine (AZT) and Belinostat, as
           consolidation therapy with optional interferon-alfa-2b (IFN-alfa-2b) or pegylated
           interferon-alfa-2b (PEG-IFN-alfa-2b). For subjects receiving interferon therapy at
           baseline, the corresponding interferon, IFN-alfa-2b at 5 million IU daily or
           PEG-IFN-alfa-2b at 1.5 μg/kg once weekly, may be continued. Subjects will receive up to
           8 cycles of Belinostat combined with AZT (as consolidation) followed by AZT-based
           maintenance therapy (± IFN-alfa) for at least 6 more months.

        -  Subjects will be restaged at the end of Belinostat Cycle 3(-7 days), Belinostat Cycle
           8(-14 days), end of Month 9(≤14 days) and end of Month 12 (≤14 days) post-Belinostat
           during AZT-based maintenance treatment. Subjects who have progression of disease at any
           of these time points will be taken off study treatment. At the end of Cycle 3 (of
           Belinostat), subjects who achieve a molecular complete response or maintain a clinical
           stable response may continue on the study.

        -  At the end of Cycle 8 (i.e. completion of Belinostat), subjects who achieve or maintain
           a complete molecular response (CMR) with no evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD)
           will continue to receive AZT (±IFN-alfa). Subjects with MRD with no clinical evidence of
           disease progression nor clinical evidence of ATLL may also continue to receive AZT (±
           IFN-alfa) OR be removed from treatment at the discretion of the Investigator.

        -  At the end of Month 9, subjects who maintain/achieve CR with no evidence of MRD will
           continue to receive AZT (± IFN-alfa) for 3 more months, to Month 12. Those with MRD
           (without clinical evidence of disease progression or clinical evidence of ATLL) may also
           continue to receive AZT (± IFN-alfa) for 3 more months to Month 12 OR be removed from
           the study at the discretion of the Investigator.

        -  Up to 20 subjects are expected to be enrolled. Correlative evaluations will also be
           performed at specified visits.

    <measure>Molecular mechanisms of Belinostat on ATLL cells in vivo</measure>
    <time_frame>48 - 72 hours post-Treatment Initiation</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that Belinostat will exert its anti-neoplastic effects in ATLL cells through a variety of molecular mechanisms including the activation of silenced key cellular genes (i.e. cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors), and suppression of HBZ, which is the only HTLV-1 protein that is consistently expressed in all ATLL tumors; this protein is thought to play a major role in HTLV-1 latency and propagation of immortalized clones. To investigate the molecular effects of Belinostat, the investigators will isolate CD4+ T-cell from enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and shortly after Belinostat treatment initiation (48-72 hours). Investigators will determine histone acetylation, HTLV-1 basic zipper factor (HBZ) and Tax mRNA and protein levels, and expression of various cellular genes affected by viral proteins or epigenetic effects of Belinostat.</description>
