  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is one of the most pressing health care issues of the 21st century. Evidence
      suggests that exercise enhances cognitive function in healthy older adults. Most research has
      focused on aerobic training (AT). Therefore, investigators aim to assess the individual
      effects of AT and resistance training (RT), as well as the interaction effect of combining
      the two types of exercise training, on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive
      impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a 6-month assessor-blinded randomized-controlled trial of 200
      community-dwelling adults with mild cognitive impairment. Individuals will be randomized to
      one of four experimental groups, all which receive 6 months of exercise classes four times
      per week: 1) combined aerobic training and resistance training; 2) aerobic training; 3)
      resistance training; or 4) balance and toning exercise. There will be two measurement
      sessions: baseline and 6 months (end of intervention period).

    <description>The A&amp;RT program will be a four-times-per week program. Twice a week will be aerobic training consisting of outdoor walks with certified fitness instructors. The outdoor walking program will start participants out working at 45% of their heart rate reserve, and work up to 70% of the heart rate reserve. The other two days a week will be resistance training in which a pressurized air system and free weights will be used to provide the training stimulus. Other key strength exercises (with free weights) will include mini-squats, mini-lunges, and lunge walks. The intensity of the training stimulus will initially be at 50% to 60% of 1 repetition maximum (RM) as determined at week two, and progress to 75% to 85% of 1-RM at a work level of 6 to 8 repetitions (2 sets) by week four. The training stimulus will be increased using the 7 RM method, when 2 sets of 6-8 repetitions are completed with proper form.</description>
