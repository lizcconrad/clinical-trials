      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of administering N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) to
      assist in initial cessation and/or relapse prevention in adult cigarette smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on initial cessation
      and relapse prevention in adult cigarette smokers. Specifically, this study has the following
      aims: Aim 1) Examine the efficacy of NAC, compared to placebo, in helping smokers achieve
      three days of continuous abstinence; Aim 2) Among those who maintain initial 3-day
      abstinence, examine the time to relapse over the 8-week intervention between NAC and placebo
      groups; Aim 3) Assess 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the 8-week end-of-treatment study
      visit in order to obtain effect sizes and estimates of variability to power a randomized
      clinical trial.

    <description>Abstinence will be measured through biochemical verification via breath carbon monoxide. Abstinence is defined as a 75% reduction in carbon monoxide values (parts per million) from smoking baseline levels.</description>

    <description>Relapse to smoking will be measured through carbon monoxide-verified relapse at weekly study visits. Relapse (return to smoking) will be defined as carbon monoxide values (in parts per million) that do not meet abstinence criteria (i.e., 75% reduction from baseline smoking levels).</description>

    <description>Seven day point prevalence abstinence will be measured through biochemical verification via breath carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine analysis. Abstinence is defined as a 75% reduction in carbon monoxide values (parts per million) from smoking baseline levels and a negative urine cotinine measure (&lt;80 ng/mL).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-65

          2. Daily smoker for ≥6 months, smoking approximately ≥5 cigarettes per day on average in
             the past month or must meet the criteria for nicotine dependence

          3. Be interested in quitting smoking (defined as a 2 or above on a 10-point Likert scale
             assessing readiness and interest in quitting (1=not at all ready/interested,
             10=extremely ready/interested)

          4. Willing to engage in a 3-day quit attempt as part of study procedures

          5. Willing to abstain from cannabis use during study procedures (since inhaled cannabis
             will affect breath carbon monoxide readings).

          6. If female, agreement to use birth control (any form) to avoid pregnancy during study
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any serious or unstable medical/psychiatric disorder (including severe substance use
             disorders, other than tobacco use disorder) in the past month that may interfere with
             study performance based on PI judgment

          2. Current pregnancy or breastfeeding

          3. Current use of medications with smoking cessation efficacy

          4. Known hypersensitivity to NAC

          5. Use of carbamazepine or nitroglycerin (or any other medication deemed to be hazardous
             if taken with NAC) within 14 days of study participation
