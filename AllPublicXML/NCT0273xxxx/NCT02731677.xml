      Sleep disorders correspond to a non-motor symptom present in DP, being represented by daytime
      sleepiness and maintenance insomnia. This study aims to evaluate the effects of acupuncture
      on sleep disorders in patients with PD assisted by Pr√≥-Parkinson Program at University
      Hospital of Pernambuco, Brazil. Its a randomized clinical trial approved by the Ethics
      Committee for Research with Human. It was included patients with diagnosed with Idiopathic
      Parkinson's disease, Mini Mental State Examination (MMEE) according to education, stages 1, 2
      and 3 in the Hoehn-Yahr scale. It was used the sleep Scale for Parkinson's disease (PDSS), a
      self-administered scale designed to assess nighttime sleep problems, sleep disorders and
      excessive daytime sleep. Twenty-two subjects were allocated in two groups: experimental and
      control. Acupuncture was applied on the acupoints F3 - BP6- VB34- IG4 - TA5 - C7 - PC6 - IG11
      - VB20 - XIAOCHANXUE once a week, eight sessions in the experimental group. The control group
      no suffered intervention. The paired analyzes were performed using the Wilcoxon test and the
      independent analyzes using the Mann-Whitney test.
