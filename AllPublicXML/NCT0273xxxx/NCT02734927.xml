      In order to control a behaviour, investigators need to realise goal directed actions and to
      priories some actions. This control is required in unusual situation. Appropriate actions are
      selected and coordinated according to context and aim.

      Several studies try to draw a model of executive function. Recently, Koechlin has suggested a
      three levelled organisation to explain how the prefrontal cortex controls actions.

      Contextual control is useful to answer appropriately with the immediate context. Episodic
      control allows selecting the action according to specific information given before. Sensorial
      control is the automatic response when a stimulus is presented.

      Some diseases like schizophrenia are associated with neurological dysfunction in prefrontal
      cortex. Chambon and al (2008) have identified a dysfunction of contextual control in
      schizophrenia.

      As the prefrontal cortex is involved in motivational process, it seems interesting to study
      potential links between executive function and motivation. A study from Kouneiher shows
      contextual and episodic activation of motivation in healthy population.

      Investigators aim to study the way motivational process are recruited in schizophrenia.

      behavioral protocol. Letters (vowel and consonant; upper- or lower- case) are presented in
      several colours into successive blocks. Each block included a series of eight letters. Each
      colour required a specific task given by a fixed rule (contextual control) but for some
      colour, the rule changes sometimes (episodic control). Participants are informed that payoffs
      vary according to their own performance. A frame indicates essay with bonus reward. Moreover
      a dashed frame indicates a low-bonus reward and a solid frame means a high-bonus reward. Thus
      different blocks are designed: low-incentive block and high incentive block.

      This reward increased from standard to bonus motivation in high-incentive block (contextual
      motivation) and from low to high according to the type of blocks (episodic motivation)
      Reaction time may be higher in bonus reward Patients with schizophrenia are not sensitive to
      contextual motivation, and therefore patients should behave differently than control in
      contextual motivation.
