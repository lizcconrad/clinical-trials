    <description>Subjects will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg as an IV infusion. RT begins D1 prior to dose 1 of Pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion. Radiotherapy will be performed using external beam ionizing radiation as standard therapy in accordance with institutional standard practice. The dose of radiation will be a standard regimen/fractionation used in palliation: 3000 cGy, delivered in five 600 cGy fractions within 5-7 days.</description>

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent or has
             participated in another Merck pembrolizumab clinical trial.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
