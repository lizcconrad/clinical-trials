  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is common, costly and affecting up to 80% of the population with the lumbar
      discectomy being a frequent spinal procedure for disc herniations. Pain &amp; mobility
      impairments persist in patients following microdiscectomy with long term issues of back pain.
      The question remains as to why some patients recover quickly and without lasting difficulties
      while other patients persist with prolonged disability following the same surgery. The
      purpose of this study is to determine how to guide the patient towards full function and
      evaluate the timing to initiate strengthening, neurodynamics and a walking exercise program.

      The direction of treatment for low back pain both surgically and conservatively seeks to
      improve function in both daily and sporting activities for all patients. The patients
      continuing to suffer from a significant level of pain, disability and reduced function
      following single level microdiscectomy may benefit from a multi-factorial approach. A
      reduction in neurodynamic mobility related to dural adhesions is considered to be a
      contributing factor in this persistent peripheral neuropathic pain. The clinical efficacy of
      this study will address an exercise protocol post surgery in order to provide an optimal
      approach in the prevention of scar tissue that may be contributing to persistent pain post
      microdiscectomy. Mobility and motor control impairments are considered the consequence to the
      onset of pain. Education, neurodynamics and stabilization exercises are instrumental in the
      recovery post microdiscectomy with a reduction in pain and disability and the goal towards
      full functioning. The introduction of a neurodynamic protocol as an early exercise
      intervention may serve to reduce pain inhibition resulting with improved mobility and motor
      control. The recording of step count per day following a lumbar microdiscectomy will serve to
      document daily and physical activity levels following surgery. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether or not there is a significant difference in pain levels and lumbar
      mobility between an early exercise intervention group versus a late exercise intervention
      group post microdiscectomy.
