      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best way to give pembrolizumab with
      combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery and to see how well it works in
      treating adult patients with gastroesophageal junction or gastric cardia cancer that has
      spread from where it started to nearby tissue and can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting
      certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving pembrolizumab, combination chemotherapy, and radiation therapy before surgery may make
      the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy
      plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in locally advanced gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)/cardia
      adenocarcinoma. (Phase Ib) II. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when
      combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil (mFOLFOX6) (without
      radiation) in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma. (Phase Ib) (re-initiated) III. To
      evaluate the pathological complete response (pathCR) rate of pembrolizumab when combined with
      radiotherapy plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma.
      (Phase II) IV. To determine the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of pembrolizumab
      when combined with mFOLFOX6 (without radiation) in locally advanced GEJ/cardia
      adenocarcinoma. (Phase II) (only if Phase Ib is re-initiated)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS), determine time to relapse (TTR),
      disease-free survival (DFS), complete resection with no tumor within 1 mm of the resection
      margins (R0) rate, and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab when combined with radiotherapy
      plus carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS), pathCR rate, time to relapse (TTR),
      disease-free survival (DFS), R0 rate, and overall survival (OS) of pembrolizumab when
      combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil (FOLFOX) chemotherapy. (only if Phase
      Ib is re-initiated)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify tissue and/or circulating biomarkers that are associated with pathCR, DFS, and
      other clinical outcomes in patients with locally advanced GEJ/cardia adenocarcinoma treated
      with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy.

      II. To determine differences in pre-treatment vs post-treatment tissue expression of immune
      markers, including programmed death ligand (PDL)1 and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (cluster
      of differentiation [CD]8+, forkhead box P3 [FOXP3]+ regulatory t cells [Tregs], CD45RO,
      granzyme B), in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy.

      III. To identify immune markers in pretreatment tissues that correlate with pathCR and
      long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based therapy.

      IV. To explore whether an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor molecular profile is
      associated with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant
      pembrolizumab-based therapy.

      V. To explore whether a microsatellite-unstable (MSI) tumor molecular profile is associated
      with pathCR and long-term outcome in patients treated with neoadjuvant pembrolizumab-based
      therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -7, 15, and 36 and carboplatin IV and paclitaxel IV over 1-96 hours on days 1, 8, 15, 22
      and 29. Patients also undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5 days per week for 4 weeks
      and 3 days (23 fractions).

      Patients with progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV
      over 1-96 hours, and carboplatin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2-4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT (RE-INITIATED): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 22 and oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 15 minutes to 2
      hours, and fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with progressive disease receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 22,
      oxaliplatin IV over 2-6 hours, leucovorin calcium over 15 minutes to 2 hours, and
      fluorouracil IV over 46-48 hours on days 1, 15, and 29. Treatment repeats every 41 days (6
      weeks) for 1-3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      SURGERY: Within 5-8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy or 3-6 weeks after completion
      of chemotherapy for patients receiving chemotherapy alone, patients undergo curative-intent
      surgery.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 21 days.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.
