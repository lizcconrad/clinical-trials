  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neurons degeneration of the
      substantia nigra, in the midbrain, resulting in the presence of motor disorders, such as
      tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Researches have shown that mental
      rehearsal in learning motor skills through mental practice (MP), which associates the
      physical practice to somatosensory imagination to action, causes positive effects in several
      motor tasks, such as the speed of motion, muscle strength performance and accuracy. Thus,
      this study aims to report the effects of MP as a tooth brushing training strategy in people
      with Parkinson's disease. This project was approved by the Ethics Committee in Research with
      Human beings of UFPE and attempt to compare the presence of bacterial biofilm before and
      after 8 weeks of brushing through the mental practice training, based on O'Leary's index. The
      sample consisted of 35 people, divided into two groups: Intervention Group consists of 17
      people with Parkinson's, in stages I to III of the disease, who underwent brushing
      orientation associated with PM, and the control group people without the disease, who
      received only orientation brushing. Then, the data were evaluated by factorial ANOVA 2x2 and
      post hoc Tukey test considering p &lt;0.05. It was observed that after the intervention was a
      significant improvement of the control dental biofilm.

             brushing;

          -  Use of orthotic / prosthetic hand;

          -  Toothless in both dental arches.

        In the control group were excluded individuals with mioarticulares abnormalities of the
        upper limbs; in use of orthotic / prosthetic hand; presenting any movement disorder in the
