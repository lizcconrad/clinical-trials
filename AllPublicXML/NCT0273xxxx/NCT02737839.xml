  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic disease self-management is the ability of the individual, in conjunction with family,
      community and healthcare professionals to manage symptoms, treatments, lifestyle changes and
      psychosocial, cultural and spiritual consequences associated with a chronic condition.
      Self-management strategies have been successfully used in supportive care and survivorship in
      oncology. Stepping On, a multi-component program using a small-group learning environment,
      reduces falls by 31%. It empowers participants with knowledge about fall-risk, exercise,
      medications and environmental hazards to self-manage their risk of falls over 7 weeks of
      educational sessions, followed by a home visit. The research in this proposal will yield the
      adaptation of the effective group-education-based fall-prevention intervention Stepping On,
      tailored to cancer patients, feasible for testing in a multi-institutional trial, and
      ultimately scalable in the oncology setting.
