    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the retention rate of perampanel when given
      as secondary monotherapy in routine clinical care.

    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective study of participants who received perampanel as primary or
      secondary monotherapy at approximately 40 centers in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Primary
      monotherapy is defined as the administration of perampanel in the absence of any concomitant
      antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Secondary (conversion) monotherapy is defined as the conversion
      of perampanel from adjunctive therapy to monotherapy by withdrawing concomitant AEDs.
