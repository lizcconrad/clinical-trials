    <textblock>
      Patients with first recurrent resistance ovarian cancer and disease progression with
      peritoneal carcinomatosis will undergo PIPAC procedure. The primary end point is to determine
      the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of a pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy with a
      combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin.

      This study aims to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of PIPAC using cisplatin and
      doxorubicin in women with first recurrent resistance ovarian cancer and disease progression
      with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) according to RECIST/GCOG criteria after three cycles of PIPAC
      with PIPAC cisplatin and doxorubicin

    <description>Evaluation of target lesions will be done as follows:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase</description>

    <description>PIPAC stands for Pressurized IntraPeritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapies. Enrolled patients will undergo to explorative laparoscopy as usual and PC index will be determined according to Fagotti score (PIV). Pathological response will be determined by serial peritoneal biopsies. Then a pressurized aerosol containing cisplatin followed by doxorubicin will be applied via a nebulizer. The PIPAC procedure can be repeated after 4-6 weeks until progression or limiting toxicity</description>

    <description>After insufflation of a 12 mmHg of capnoperitoneum at 37 °C, two balloon trocars will be placed. Parietal biopsies will be taken and ascites (&lt; 500cc) will be removed. A nebulizer will be connected to a high-pressure injector and will be inserted into the abdomen through a trocar. A pressurized aerosol containing cisplatin at a dose of 7.5 mg/m2 body surface in 150 ml NaCl 0.9 % followed by doxorubicin at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 body surface in a 50 ml NaCl 0.9% solution will be applied via a nebulizer immediately. Then, the system will be kept in steady-state for 30 min (i.e.: application time).</description>
