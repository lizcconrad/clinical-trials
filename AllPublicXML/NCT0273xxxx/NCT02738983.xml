      Concurrent chemoradiotheray is the standard care for patients with locally advanced non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but often accompanying with high toxicity and poor tolerability.
      Radiosensitization of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors
      (TKI) has been proved in preclinical studies, and the safety of TKI combined with thoracic
      radiotherapy has also been evaluated in several phase II trials. The aim of study is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of thoracic radiotherapy combined with TKI in wild-type
      EGFR patients who refused or unsuitable for concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

          1. Had systemic anit-NSCLC treatments;

          2. Had be treated by HER-targeting agents;

          3. Had local radiotherapy for NSCLC;
