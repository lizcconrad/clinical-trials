  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) globally, accounting
      for 25-35% of the population-attributable fraction. Sodium (salt) intake is a key determinant
      of blood pressure, and reducing sodium intake has emerged as an important target for
      population-based interventions to prevent CVD. However, there is considerable uncertainty
      about the optimal level of sodium intake that is associated with lowest CV risk, and whether
      optimal levels differ for different populations and individuals. International and national
      guidelines recommend low sodium intake (&lt;2.3g/day, or lower) in all persons, and advocate a
      population-wide approach to reducing sodium. Most of the world's population (~95%) consume
      between 3 and 6g/day of sodium (mean intake 4.0g/day), which means that most people will
      require a major change to their diet, to achieve the guideline target (&lt;2g/day). While there
      is convincing evidence that high sodium intake (&gt;5g/day) is associated with an increased risk
      of CVD, compared to low or moderate intake, the evidence that low sodium intake (&lt;2.0g/day)
      is associated with a lower risk of CVD than moderate intake (2.0-5g/day) is inconsistent and
      inconclusive. The investigators plan to conduct a Phase IIb clinical trial to evaluate the
      role of low sodium intake (versus moderate) on cardiovascular biomarkers.
