      As stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) has been widely used in clinical practice at present, the
      aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy compared with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) concurrently with EP
      regimen(cisplatin plus etoposide) in treating patients with limited-stage small cell lung
      cancer
