    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pioglitazone hydrochloride and tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI) therapy works in treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that has come
      back after a period of improvement (relapsed) after a first TKI discontinuation. TKI may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking certain enzymes need for cell growth. Although TKI
      therapies are effective against CML, there are residual cancer cells called leukemia stem
      cells that are able to hide from TKIs. Pioglitazone is a drug approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration to treat diabetes and has been shown in laboratory studies to increase CML
      stem cell death when given together with TKI therapy. Giving pioglitazone with TKI therapy
      may be effective in treating patients with CML.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety of the combination of pioglitazone (PIO) and TKI in CML subjects who
      experience a loss of major molecular response (MMR) following a first TKI discontinuation.

      II. To assess survival without loss of MMR following a second TKI discontinuation in subjects
      who achieve or maintain &lt; molecular response (MR)^4.5 with the combination PIO and TKI
      administered for at least 6 months.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pioglitazone orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Patients also start
      or continue the same TKI therapy at the pre-discontinuation doses. Courses repeat every 28
      days for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month for 3 months, every
      3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.

    <measure>Proportion of subjects who lose MMR following discontinuation of pioglitazone and TKI using blood qRT-PCR for BCR-ABL1</measure>

    <description>The proportion of subjects that has reappearance of BCR-ABL1 will be described. Descriptive statistics that will summarize the changes in BCR-ABL1 testing over time will be presented. Loss of MMR is defined as a BCR-ABL1 &gt; 0.1% by qRT-PCR confirmed within a week and associated with a rise in the titer on a confirmatory test obtained 4 weeks later (European Leukemia Net definition). Subgroup analyses will be performed by baseline potential prognostic factors. Subgroups will include: age, gender, race, underlying diagnosis, and other disease-related prognostic factors (disease status).</description>
