  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent years, women with infertility have become more and more and thus assisted reproductive
      technology has been applied in a broad range. And the quantities of twin pregnancies are
      larger and larger. However, complicated twin pregnancy subsequently increased including
      selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR), twin growth discordance, twin transfusion
      syndrome (TTTS) and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). The occurrence of complicated twin
      pregnancy has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in twin and mother.
      Meanwhile, twin pregnancy, especially monochorionic type has suffered from higher rate of
      chromosomal anomalies and structural anomalies. Therefore, it is important that more
      attention should be paid to the prediction, clinical evaluation and the occurrence of
      chromosomal anomalies and structural anomalies in complicated twin pregnancy.

      So far, prenatal ultrasound has been acknowledged as the best method for prenatal diagnosis
      and evaluation in twin pregnancy. By means of the application of prenatal ultrasound, the
      detection of fetal chromosome, and secondary correlation analysis, the investigators try to
      build prenatal ultrasound monitoring system of twin pregnancy and provide evidences for the
      choice of intervention and delivery time, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of
      twin and improve perinatal short and long outcomes.

      The goals of this study are as below: (1) primary goal: the prediction of complicated twin
      pregnancy by using prenatal ultrasound; (2) primary goal: the clinical evaluation of
      perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancy by using prenatal ultrasound; (3) secondary goal: the
      analysis of the correlation between prenatal ultrasound and fetal anomalies.

      The study is designed as an observational prospective cohort study. The primary outcome is
      complicated twin pregnancy (sIUGR, TTTS, IUFD, twin growth discordance). The main exposed
      factors are discordance of crown-rump length more than 20%, discordance of nuchal
      translucency more than 20%, either of twin with abnormal amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios or
      oligoamnios), either of twin with abnormal umbilical artery flow (elevated resistance index,
      absent or reverse diastolic flow), either of twin with abnormal middle cerebral artery flow
      (more than 1.5Mom), either of twin with abnormal ductus venous flow (absent or reverse
      a-wave). Meanwhile, some demographic data are to be collected and confounding factors are to
      be analyzed.

      Women with twin pregnancy who are examined in the department are enrolled in this study.
      Ultrasound will be done in 11-13+6 weeks, 16-18 weeks, 22-24 weeks, 30-32 weeks and 37-39
      weeks, and perinatal outcomes are to be collected, including the diagnosis of complicated
      twin pregnancy, when it happens, ultrasound indices, delivery mode, delivery time, birth
      weight, neonatal outcomes.

      When there are indications for the detection of fetal chromosome, women are probably advised
      to have this examination, such as non-invasive DNA, amniocentesis, umbilical cord screening,
      as appropriate, and written informed consent will be achieved from every patient.
