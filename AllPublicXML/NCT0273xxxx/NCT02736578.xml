      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of cetuximab-IRDye 800CW when
      used with intraoperative imaging and to see how well they work in finding pancreatic cancer
      in patients undergoing surgery. Cetuximab-IRDye 800CW may help doctors better identify cancer
      in the operating room by making the cancer visible when viewed through a special imaging
      device.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of cetuximab IRDye800 (cetuximab-IRDye 800CW) in
      intraoperatively identifying pancreatic cancer compared to surrounding normal pancreatic and
      extrapancreatic tissue, as measured by tumor-to-background ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of the cetuximab IRDye800 as an imaging agent in patients
      undergoing resection of pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cetuximab-IRDye 800CW intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes to 1 hour on day 0.
      Within 2-5 days, patients undergo surgery with intraoperative imaging.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at days 10 and 30.
