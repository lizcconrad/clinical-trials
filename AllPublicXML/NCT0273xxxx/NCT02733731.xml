      Design: A randomized double-blind controlled trial.

      Setting: The hospital ward.

      Participants: 200 postmenopausal woman with senile vaginitis (mean age 56).

      intravaginal administrated in treatment group and control group for 3 weeks，follow-up 1
      month.

      Measurement: symptom improving(pain and itch) and onset time, edema-size of vaginal wall,
      vaginal discharge, and PH changes.

      80 postmenopausal women living in the communities near the hospital with AV (atrophic
      vaginitis) symptoms were recruited for this clinical trial. Patients with AV receiving
      external treatment and requiring hospitalization were randomized in a double-blind,
      single-centre trial. Subjects received CHCO (Chinese Herbal Compound Ointment) topical
      vaginal application in experimental group, while estriol in control group. The dosage of
      medicine for single treatment once a day in two group is 0.5g.The total time for therapy is 3
      weeks in two groups. Assessment indicators：vagine PH, sIgA and IL-1βchanges, the degree of
      symptoms improving, onset time, edema-size of vaginal wall, vaginal discharge, and relapses
      and retreatment effect.
