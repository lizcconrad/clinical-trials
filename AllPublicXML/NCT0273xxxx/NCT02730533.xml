  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, randomised, endoscopist-blind, parallel-group study in patients
      who are scheduled endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric mucosal lesion. The
      primary objective is to observe whether a regimen of 7-day oral esomeprazole premedication
      can alleviate intraoperative bleeding in patients scheduled for ESD due to gastric mucosal
      lesions.
