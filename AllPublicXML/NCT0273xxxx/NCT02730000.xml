  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the clinical damage caused by errors commonly made during the dosage and handling of
      glass ionomer cement (GIC) of high viscosity powder-liquid type, the use of encapsulated
      ionomer has been recommended for final restorations. However, the initial cost of the
      encapsulated MIC is higher when compared to the material handled manually. The objective of
      this randomized study is to (1) reveal cost-effective in the long run, the encapsulated CIV
      Riva Self Cure and Equia used as a restorative material in atraumatic restorations
      (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment), (2) assess whether the type of cavity (occlusal and
      occlusal-proximal) influences the longevity of atraumatic restorations using encapsulated IC,
      (3) assess whether the child's caries experience influences the longevity of atraumatic
      restorations with GIC encapsulated. Children, ages 3 and 7, will be selected in the Tietê-SP
      municipality. Randomization will be performed in a stratified manner by the conditions: type
      of cavity and caries experience. 122 ART restorations are performed using encapsulated CIV -
      Riva Self Cure - SDI and Equia -CG Corp. The restorations will be evaluated after 6, 12 and
      18 months by two trained examiners blind to the groups (intra- and inter-rater agreement
      above 0.7). To verify the survival of the restorations will be used Kaplan-Meier survival
      analysis and log-rank test. To evaluate the association between longevity and variable Cox
      regression test will be applied. For the cost analysis will be used analysis of variance.

    <description>The treatments will be classified as successful when they present a clinical satisfactory aspect. Otherwise, &quot;minor failure&quot; will be analyzed. &quot;Minor failures&quot; are those in which there is a defect in the restoration/crown, but it does not interfere with the tooth health.</description>

    <measure>Cost-efficacy assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment costs will be calculated considering professional costs and procedure costs. In order to calculate the professional cost the time spent in each session will be converted in hours and multiplied by the medium income of the dentist per hour as related by the Brazilian Ministry of Labour and Employment ($36,23). On the other hand, to estimate the procedure cost, it will be considered both variable cost, which includes electricity and equipment depreciation, and materials cost. To calculate the equipment depreciation (peripherals, dental chair and instrumental), the investigators will consider their price, the lifespan of five years and a monthly use of 160 hours, using an estimate value per hour of $1,81. All materials used in each procedure will have their specifications and quantity registered. Prices will be inferences from the market value converted in US Dollars and obtained by the medium of the values from different places that commercialized the referred products.</description>

    <description>Occlusal-proximal ART restorations in primary molars using Equia (Easy/Quick/Unique/ Intelligent/Aesthetic) will be performed. No local anesthesia will be used. Infected carious tissue will be removed with hand instruments, and the cavities restored with GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement). The cavity will be filled with GIC. After the press-finger technique, the excess of material will be removed and occlusion will be checked.</description>
