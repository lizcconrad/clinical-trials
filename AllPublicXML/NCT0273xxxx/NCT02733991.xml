  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A premarket, international multicenter, prospective, open label, adaptive, randomized
      controlled study.

      The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of sensor augmented pump therapy with MiniMed™640G and
      SmartGuard™in preventing hypoglycemic events in comparison with continuous subcutaneous
      insulin infusion therapy in type 1 diabetes adults with an increased risk of hypoglycemia.
      The primary objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the mean number of hypoglycemic events
      when using the MiniMed™640G system with SmartGuard™ and the secondary objectives will aim at
      evaluating the difference in glycemic parameters and HbA1c.
