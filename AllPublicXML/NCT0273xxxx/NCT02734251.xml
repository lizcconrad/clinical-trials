  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial aims to evaluate the
      effects of Relora supplementation on responses to induced stress produced by a combination of
      cognitive and physiologic stressors in healthy men and women. The effects of the supplement,
      compared with a placebo, will be evaluated using measures to assess anxiety [State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory-Part 1 (STAI-Part 1), mood [Bond-Lader Visual Analog Scale (VAS)],
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (salivary cortisol) and cognitive function
      (cognitive flexibility, reaction time, processing speed, attention, sustained attention,
      working memory, and executive function). Testing will be completed at the beginning and end
      of 7-d supplementation periods with the active and placebo products to assess both the acute
      effects and the &quot;acute-on-chronic&quot; effects following one week of daily use.
