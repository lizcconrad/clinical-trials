    <textblock>
      Lateral humeral condyle fractures are the second most common elbow fractures in children.
      Displaced and rotated fractures require stabilization and reduction. Kirschner wires
      (K-wires) are most commonly used for fracture fixation. Here, the investigators introduce a
      new fixation method involving absorbable screws. The investigators aimed to determine if it
      is feasible to treat lateral humeral condyle fractures with absorbable screws by comparing
      the functional outcomes obtained using screw fixation vs. K-wire fixation.

      Methods: Between May 2007 and September 2010, 86 participants (age, 1.6-13 years; average
      age, 6.7 years) were randomly divided into two groups. All participants had been diagnosed
      with lateral condyle fractures classified as Jacobs type II (unstable) or III. Closed
      reduction failed in all participants. Therefore, open reduction was performed under general
      anesthesia. One absorbable screw was used for fixation in the experimental group, while two
      1.8-mm K-wires were used in the control group. At 4-6 weeks postoperatively, the
      participants' plaster casts were removed, and functional training was started.
