      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the rate of return to work, rate of
      return to activities, functional outcome measures and pain scores in operatively repaired
      rotational Bimalleolar and Trimalleolar (AO/OTA Classification of 44A and 44B) ankle
      fractures not requiring fixation of the syndesmosis and allowed early weight bearing on or
      before the first post-operative visit.
