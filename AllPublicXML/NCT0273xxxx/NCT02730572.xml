      The primary purpose of this study is to identify whether, after adjustment for confounders
      via stratification on a propensity score and adjustment for calendar year, the combined
      endpoint consisting of #1 to #4 (1. switching back to Concerta, 2. changing the use of
      immediate release [IR] methylphenidate, 3. beginning a new attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder [ADHD] medication, or 4. stopping both Concerta and the long acting [LA]
      methylphenidate {authorized generic [AG] methylphenidate or equivalent generic [EG]
      methylphenidate} that was begun on the index date), differs between participants who switch
      from branded Concerta to the EG formulations versus participants who switch from branded
      Concerta to the AG formulation.

      This is a retrospective cohort study based on a health claims database, the Truven Commercial
      Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database. Participants will enter the cohort when, after using
      Concerta continuously for at least 60 days after October 3, 2012, they receive a dispensing
      of the AG or EG formulation within 15 days of the end of the days of Concerta supplied. The
      date of that dispensing of the AG or EG formulation is the participants index date. This
      study will track various events, example, back-switches, and methylphenidate dose changes
      over time (the 60 days before the switch from Concerta to an AG or EG generic compared to the
      60 days after that switch).

        Participants in the Truven Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database who enroll in
        the study will have a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and continuously used Concerta brand of
        methylphenidate for at least 60 days and receive a dispensing of the AG or EG formulation
        within 15 days of the end of the days of Concerta supplied.
