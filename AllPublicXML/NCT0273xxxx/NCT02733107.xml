  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of anti-angiogenesis drugs has led to renewed enthusiasm in lung cancer
      treatments. Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which selectively inhibits the vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Etoposide is an oral preparation for lung
      cancer which is recommended by NCCN guideline. The investigators wondered whether these two
      drugs have synergistic effects when treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who
      failed to previous at least 2nd line treatments. Thus, the aim of this trial is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib combined with etoposide in heavily pretreated
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
