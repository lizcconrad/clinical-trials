  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to assess the feasibility and safety of carbon-ion
      radiotherapy (CIRT) for the treatment of in Chinese localized prostate cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of CIRT in the
      treatment of localized prostate cancer and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the
      MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate the
      maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and
      within 6 months after the completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for localized prostate cancer is
      determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.

    <description>Four dose levels [59.2 GyE(Gray equivalent)/16Fx, 60.8 GyE/16Fx, 62.4 GyE/16Fx, 64.0 GyE/16Fx] are planned within the Phase I part. After the recommended dose (RD), i.e., MTD, is determined or if the treatments to 64 GyE/16Fx are safely delivered, the recommended dose (or 64 GyE/16Fx) will be the prescribed dose in the Phase II part of the study.</description>
