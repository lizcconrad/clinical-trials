    <textblock>
      Sleeve gastrectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed today for patients
      that undergo bariatric surgery. One of the primary reasons for morbid obesity is unhealthy
      eating habits and the belief that changes in those habits can ensure the success. Objectives:
      The investigators aimed to explore the effect of different eating habits prior to the
      bariatric surgery on the surgery success and on different aspect of quality of life. Design:
      The investigators conducted this study on patients that underwent sleeve gastrectomy as the
      first bariatric operation.

      The investigators conducted this study on patients that underwent sleeve gastrectomy as the
      first bariatric operation. The investigators divided the patients into groups according to
      their pre-operation eating habits: binge, sweet, snack and high volume and compared different
      aspects of the surgery such as weight loss, BMI and distance from ideal weight. The
      investigators also examined the effect of the surgery on the quality of life, sexual life,
      physical activity, eating habits and satisfaction from the surgery by a telephonic survey
      that was conducted up to one year after the surgery.
