  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a masked, two center, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of nasal and oral inhalation of 75 mg aztreonam in subjects
      with CF and lung infection due to PA. The study will involve two sites: Virginia Commonwealth
      University Medical Center (VCU) and Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS). Potential
      subjects will be identified in each site's CF clinic.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the efficacy and safety of nasal aztreonam administered
      using the Pari Sinus Nebulizer combined with oral Cayston aerosol therapy compared to placebo
      on clinical and laboratory endpoints such as risk of antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (PA), time to pulmonary infection exacerbation, nasal quality of life, pulmonary
      function, nasal and lower airway cultures, and properties of mucus.

      P. aeruginosa (PA) is a primary cause of lung infections in persons with cystic fibrosis (CF)
      (1). Over the past decade, studies have shown that aerosolized antibiotics can reduce lower
      respiratory bacterial load, decrease exacerbations of pulmonary disease, and in many patients
      improve pulmonary function. Cayston (aztreonam) oral aerosol using the PARI Altera Nebulizer
      System was approved by the FDA in February 2010 for CF patients 7 years of age or older with
      PA (2). In 2011, 35.8% or patients in the National CF Patient Registry used Cayston for
      treatment (3). Bacterial cultures suggest that the upper airways and lower airways of CF
      patients are cross-infected by PA and that the paranasal sinuses can act as a bacterial
      reservoir (4). There is improved post-transplanation patient survival for recipients that
      undergo sinus surgery and daily nasal washes to reduce bacterial load (2).

      Routine CF care does not generally include upper airway assessment. There are no published
      studies evaluating the effect of aerosol antibiotics to treat nasal and sinus infections in
      CF in combination with oral inhaled aerosol therapy to treat the lower airway disease.
      However Mainz and colleagues published a case report that suggested that sinonasal
      administration of tobramycin using the Pari Sinus nebulizer (Pari Corp, Starnberg, Germany)
      delayed PA lower respiratory infection in a 12 year-old with CF who had chronic mucopurulent
      rhinosinusitis (5) and studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggest that treating
      upper airways can also improve coexistent lower airway disease.

    <time_frame>140 days</time_frame>
    <description>Protocol-Defined Pulmonary Exacerbation includes events that are characterized by change or worsening pulmonary symptoms (increased cough, increased sputum production and chest congestion, decreased appetite and exercise tolerance), loss of weight, and lung function decline that prompt initation of antibiotic therapy. Protocol-defined exacerbations in subjects that warrant treatment with IV antibiotics will be determined from the medical record during the course of this study.</description>

    <description>Protocol-Defined Pulmonary Exacerbation includes events that are characterized by change or worsening pulmonary symptoms (increased cough, increased sputum production and chest congestion, decreased appetite and exercise tolerance), loss of weight, and lung function decline that prompt initation of antibiotic therapy. Protocol-defined exacerbations in subjects that warrant treatment with IV antibiotics will be determined from the medical record during the course of this study. The time of beginning the study to first protocol-defined pulmonary exacerbation will also be determined from the medical record during the course of this study.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sinus and Nasal QoL questionnaire (SNOT-20) on day 140 and day 168</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 140 and Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 20 (SNOT-20) is a validated health-related QOL questionnarie designed to determine the impact of sinonasal dysfunction. Patients will assess nasal symptoms, emotion, and activity on a scale of worsening symptoms scored 1 through 7 to provide a quantifiable score capable of disease severity. It has been shown as a responsive measure of health-related quality of life and suitable for use in outcomes studies and routine clinical care. Survey responses from Day 140 and Day 168 will be compared to the SNOT20 survey responses from previous visits (V1, V2, and V4)</description>

    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis QoL score (CFQ-R) on day 140</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 140</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R is a validated patient-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for children and adults with CF. The CFQ-R contains both general and CF-specific scales. The CFQ-R was administered at Visits 1, 6, and 7. The endpoint was change in CFQR on day 140 compared to V1 and V5.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pulmonary function (FVC and FEV1 percent predicted) on day 140</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 140</time_frame>
    <description>Routine spirometry will be performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. A minimum of three maneuvers will be performed. The largest FVC and FEV1 will be reported after examining data from all acceptable curves even if they did not originate from the same maneuver. Data will be expressed both in absolute values and as percent (%) predicted based upon NHANES predicted values.</description>

    <measure>Change in acoustic Rhinometry for nasal obstruction (volume) (will be measured at VCU site ).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Acoustic rhinometry is used to measure cross-sectional volume of the nasal cavity allowing the calculation of nasal volume. Reflected sound waves are painlessly introduced through nasal adaptors into the nasal passages allowing the production of area-distance graphs.</description>

    <measure>Number of Safety and adverse events including nasal stuffiness, epistaxis, and headache.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency, severity and duration of all nasal and pulmonary adverse events, regardless of cause, will be recorded in REDCap as an electronic case report form. Serious adverse events will be captured in OnCore. The frequency and severity of adverse events will be calculated for each patient, with each patient counted once using the most severe grade experienced. The duration of adverse events will be calculated by the number of days each event persisted. Tables will be generated for all adverse events including serious adverse events and withdraws from the study.</description>
