    <textblock>
      Treatment of osteochondral lesion of Talus with a devitalized viro-inativated sterile
      osteochondral graft. To avoid having to harvest autograft material from the knee, a processed
      allogeneic osteochondral can be used instead autograft. The surgical technique is to implant
      in the osteochondral defect one to three products in the defect.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients between the ages of 18 and 50

             dissecans

          -  Osteochondral lesion &gt; Anderson Grade I (MRI)

          -  1 to 3 cm2 lesion

          -  Presence of disabling and clinically meaningful symptoms (subjective OMAS &lt; 50)

          -  Patient who has been treated previously for this lesion, except if this treatment

             control method.

          -  Previous mosaicplasty treatment of this lesion

          -  Fracture or bone defect or subchondral lesion without cartilage involvement, untreated

          -  Presence of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, excessive hindfoot deformity or any
             other condition of the talocural joint that, in the surgeon's opinion, is likely to
             compromise the allograft's outcome

          -  Excessive laxity or recurrent instability that could affect the score evaluation

          -  Presence of an ulcerative disease, heavy smoking, tuberculosis, chronic psychiatric
             disorder or disease requiring long-term treatment with a medication that would affect
             bone or joint metabolism
