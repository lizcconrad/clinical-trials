  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who receive hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT) are at high nutritional risk due to
      comorbidities and complications that are likely to develop before, during and after
      transplant. Prior to transplant, many children undergo multiple rounds of chemotherapy which
      affect appetite and cause gastrointestinal toxicities that limit food intake. During
      transplant, painful mucositis makes it difficult to consume adequate nutrients and often
      children will require nutrition support such as parenteral or enteral nutrition. Energy
      imbalance and physical deconditioning following transplant can result in loss of lean body
      mass and functional impairment; these nutritional side effects are exacerbated if the child
      develops graft-versus-host disease. After transplant, a substantial number of childhood
      cancer survivors become overweight and develop metabolic syndrome. However, little is known
      about the prevalence and distribution of pediatric malnutrition (under-nutrition as well as
      obesity), the psychosocial factors that affect dietary intake and how the quality of the
      child's food intake and physical activity level throughout the transplant process might
      affect body composition and clinical outcomes. In this exploratory study, we will monitor
      nutritional status in pediatric patients undergoing HCT. This study will test the feasibility
      of collecting patient-reported dietary intake data along with anthropometric, body
      composition, functional status and psychosocial measurements that may influence dietary
      intake in pediatric patients undergoing HCT. The data collected in this preliminary analysis
      will inform future interventional studies.

    <description>This is an observational study. Validated measures of nutritional status, dietary intake, body composition, functional status and psychosocial factors will be used to measure outcomes in study patients at 4 time-points: (1) pre-HCT (Baseline), (2) 30-days post-HCT, (3) 100-days post-HCT and (4) one year post-HCT.</description>
