    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I trial to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced Melanoma. The primary
      objective is to assess safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 and identify recommended phase II
      doses of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced Melanoma.

      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in subjects with advanced Melanoma who have
      failed current standard antitumor therapies.

      The safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical
      laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical
      examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will
      also be conducted (immune-related adverse events (AEs), or labs of autoimmune sera,
      inflammatory events, and immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory)
      are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.

      Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: screening (up to 14
      days before the first dose), treatment, and follow-up (up to 3 months after the last dose of
      study treatment).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 18-70 years of age.

          2. Subjects diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed Melanoma documented
             as advanced or metastatic disease. Subjects must be considered relapsed or refractory

             standard therapy.

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          4. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          5. Subjects enrolled in the Part 2 expansion cohorts must have measurable lesion(s)
             according to response evaluation criteria in solid (RECIST) v1.1.

          6. Adequate laboratory parameters during the screening period as evidenced by the
             following:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L (1500/mm3)

               2. Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L (100,000/mm3)

               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL (90 g/L)

               4. Albumin (ALB) levels ≥ 2.8 g/dL

               5. Total bilirubin (TBIL) ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

               6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × ULN;
                  for subjects with liver metastases, ALT and AST ≤ 5 × ULN

             Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN

          7. Female subjects agree not to be pregnant or lactating from beginning of the study
             screening through at least 3 months after receiving the last dose of study treatment.
             Both men and women of reproductive potential must be willing and able to employ a
             highly effective method of birth control/contraception to prevent pregnancy. A highly
             effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure
             rate, that is, less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly

          8. Able to understand and sign an informed consent form (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:
