  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant maltodextrin (RMD) is an indigestible water soluble fiber that increases fecal bulk
      by enhancing growth of specific microbial populations; however the effect of RMD on
      bifidobacteria and total fecal weight is not clear. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine whether incorporating about ¼ cup of a fiber supplement into the diet will induce
      beneficial changes in gastrointestinal function, the fecal microbiota profile (increased
      number of healthy bacteria in stool) and immune processes resulting in improved quality of
      life.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After obtaining informed
      consent, participants will be randomized to either consume 0, 15 or 25 grams of resistant
      maltodextrin (RMD) during the first arm of the study. During the first intervention period,
      participants will consume the RMD everyday for 3 weeks. After a 2-week post intervention
      period, participants will be crossed to one of the other treatments for 3 weeks, followed by
      a 2-week post intervention and then receive the final intervention for 3 weeks.

      Participants will complete daily questionnaires and weekly gastrointestinal symptom
      questionnaires during the intervention and post-intervention periods. Stool samples will be
      collected at the baseline and final time points of each intervention. Dietary intake will
      also be assessed weekly during each intervention period.

    <description>Six dietary recalls occurred per study intervention, and each recall was scored for quality. The quality scores were averaged per arm and then compared between study arms for each subject/group using the Healthy Eating Index-2010.The Healthy Eating Index assesses diet quality based on 12 components, when summed has maximum points of 100 (HEI scale 0-100).
High component scores indicate intakes close to the recommended ranges or amounts; low component scores indicate less compliance with the recommended ranges or amounts.</description>
