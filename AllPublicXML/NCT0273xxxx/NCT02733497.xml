  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential palmar hyperhidrosis (EPH) is a pathological condition of excessive sweating of the
      hands due to an unexplained over-activity of the T2 and T3 sympathetic fibers. Endoscopy
      Thoracoscopic Sympathectomy (ETS) is the treatment of choice in patients with EPH refractory
      to medical treatment .

      The cardiac sympathetic activity is mainly controlled by cervical sympathetic fibers but
      anatomic studies have showed that &quot;accessory&quot; fibers from the T2 and T3 sympathetic ganglia
      come to the heart and influence its function.

      Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a simple and non-invasive method based on electrocardiogram
      to evaluate the sympathovagal balance at the sino-atrial level. Several studies have found
      that ETS caused a decrease of heart rate (HR), an increase of HR variability (HRV) and a
      shift of sympathovagal balance toward parasympathetic tone but remains unclear if these
      changes are associated with the extend of ETS.

      Thus, in the present study the investigator performed a prospective analysis of HRV function
      in patients with EPH undergoing different sympathetic denervations as sympathectomy and
      sympathicotomy with the hypothesis that cardiac autonomic changes could be associated with
      the extend of sympathetic resection.

      It was an unicenter prospective study performed at Thoracic Surgery Unit of Second University
      of Naples. Patients with severe EPH were randomly assigned to Sympathectomy or Sympathicotomy
      Group in 1:1 ratio .

      Bilateral ETSs were performed in a one-stage procedure by the same surgeon. General
      anaesthesia using single-lung ventilation technique was performed and patient was placed in
      standard lateral thoracotomy position. Immediately after the induction of anaesthesia, a
      local infiltration with 2% lidocaine and epinephrine was injected at each port 5 minutes
      before the incision to reduce postoperative pain. The first port was placed in the 3th
      intercostal space below and anterior to inferior angle of scapula and through that a 10 mm 30
      degree camera was inserted. A second 5 mm working port was placed at the same intercostal
      space in the anterior axillary line. After identification of sympathetic chain, in
      Sympathectomy Group the T3 ganglion was excised at the top of the third rib while in
      Sympathicotomy Group the sympathetic chain was resected between T2-T3 ganglia at the same
      level but the T3 ganglion was left intact. At the end of the procedure, a 16 F drainage was
      inserted through the port and the lung was re-inflated to allow the air drainage from pleural
      cavity and to prevent pneumothorax. The drain was subsequently removed.

      All measurements on cardiac autonomic function were performed one week before ETS and
      different post-operative time-points (7 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after ETS). The results were
      prospectively registered and then retrospectively analyzed.
