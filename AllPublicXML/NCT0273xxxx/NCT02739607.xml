      Objectives

        1. To test the effectiveness and acceptability of an augmented internet-supported
           transdiagnostic intervention in Romania.

        2. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the Internet version of the transdiagnostic program
           as compared to a standard treatment/usual care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of a transdiagnostic intervention will be compared with a wait list control
      group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design in a culture where this has not been
      tested before. The treatment approach is mainly emotion-focus, teaching participants how to
      confront and experience uncomfortable emotions, and how more adaptive coping mechanisms could
      be used. Because internet-delivered interventions represent an effective way to disseminate
      evidence-based programs, investigators decided to present our intervention online.

    <measure>Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Absolute values (average score) of ASI at 11 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI was designed to measure participant's level of anxiety sensitivity. The scale is unidimensional and the total score rages from 0 to 64. Low scores are associated with low levels of anxiety sensitivity, while high scores are associated with high levels of anxiety sensitivity.</description>

    <description>The APS-R was designed to measure participant's level of perfectionism. The scale is multidimensional and measures three dimensions of perfectionism: high standards, order and discrepancy. Low scores are associated with low levels of perfectionism, while high scores are associated with high levels of perfectionism.</description>

    <description>This transdiagnostic program is based on the general Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles and targets core higher order factors such as negative affectivity and emotion dysregulation, using common intervention techniques applicable across disorders. The program was designed to directly address the aversive emotional experiences often reported by clients, hoping to reverse participants' maladaptive thinking style and dysfunctional behaviors.</description>
