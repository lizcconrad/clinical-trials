      The first aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a gait training using treadmill
      with visual and auditory cues in patients in stages IV Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H&amp;Y). The second aim was
      to compare the obtained data of these patients in advanced stages with those in mild to
      moderate stages.

    <textblock>
      Gait is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. It has been shown that treadmill
      training with visual and auditory cues is useful in improving the gait's parameters in
      patients in early-moderate stages of disease. No data are available about the effectiveness
      of this training in those subjects in advanced stages of PD. The first aim of this study was
      to evaluate the effect of a gait training using treadmill with visual and auditory cues in
      patients in stages IV Hoehn &amp; Yahr (H&amp;Y). The second aim was to compare the obtained data of
      these patients in advanced stages with those in mild to moderate stages.

      150 patients with PD in early-moderate and advanced stages of disease (50 in H&amp;Y stage 2,
      group 1, 50 in H&amp;Y stage 3, group 2 and 50 in H&amp;Y stage 4, group 3) were enrolled. All
      patients underwent an intensive treatment: 20-minutes treadmill training per day, 6 times a
      week, for 4 weeks. Treadmill speed was previously set at 2.0 km/h and progressively increased
      until a maximum of 3.5 km/h, taking always into account the patients' physical abilities. All
      patients were evaluated at the enrolment and at the end of the 4-weeks treatment. The first
      evaluation consisted in one-minute walking on treadmill without the use of cues at 1.5 km/h
      speed, for all patients. The outcome measurements were: the average length of the right step,
      the average length of the left step, the coefficient of variance of both steps, and the gait
      cycle.
