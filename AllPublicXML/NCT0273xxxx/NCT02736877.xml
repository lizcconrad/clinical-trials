  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate 30 patients with surgical indication for corneal
      transplantation. Participants will be divided according to the following diseases diseases:
      keratoconus, bullous keratopathy, corneal dystrophies. Participants will be informed about
      the risks and benefits of the study and sign an informed consent form. In the preoperative
      evaluation will be submitted to a complete ophthalmologic examination with complementary
      tests, such as optical coherence tomography.

      One group of participants will undergo corneal surgery using the OCT Lumera microscope RESCAN
      - ZEISS and another group with a conventional microscope. Everyone will have their filmed and
      documented surgery. The team of surgeons will answer the questionnaire on the surgical
      difficulty about the ease of assessing corneal transplantation. After surgery, participants
      will be assessed on days 1, 7,15, 30, 60, 90 and 180 after surgery.

      Surgeries and study procedures will be performed by the same team of surgeons and performed
      by IPEPO - Paulista Institute of Studies and Research in Ophthalmology / Vision Institute.

      Participants will be allocated in one of the following groups:

        1. Control Group The control group will undergo corneal transplant with conventional
           microscope without coupled OCT. The team of surgeons will answer the questionnaire on
           the surgical difficulty regarding corneal transplantation (ANNEX 1).

        2. Group OCT RESCAN In the group microscope coupled to OCT, patients will undergo retinal
           surgery using the Lumera Microscope WITH RESCAN OCT - ZEISS. The team of surgeons will
           answer the questionnaire on the surgical difficulty regarding corneal transplantation
           (ANNEX 1).

      The investigators will evaluate intraoperative conditions, complications, operative time and
      postoperative results in both groups.

      All patients will be monitored and evaluated with full ophthalmological examination in all
      postoperative visits (day 1, 7,15,30, 60, 90, 180) and will be subjected to the following
      tests:

        -  Measurement of visual acuity with best correction

        -  Previous Biomicroscopy

        -  Corneal Topography

        -  tonometry

        -  Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  Microscopy speculate
