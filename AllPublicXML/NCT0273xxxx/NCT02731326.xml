  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF), a condition where the top chambers of the heart beat irregularly,
      is a major health problem. The long-term goal of this project is to use a personal, mobile
      heart monitor to help patients better recognize recurrent AF and improve patients' ability to
      better manage their condition. A total of 300 patients with a history of AF will be included
      in the study, with 150 patients receiving an iPhone with the mobile monitoring device and
      educational text messaging and the remaining 150 patients continuing with their regular
      medical care. Each patient will be included in the intervention period for 6 months. The rate
      of recurrent AF and treatments meant to manage AF and other heart conditions will be
      determined for both groups. Patients in both groups will complete a series of questionnaires
      at the start and end of the 6 month study period to look at differences in quality of life
      and knowledge of AF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized control trial with 1:1 randomization of 300 patients
      to either use the AliveCor device and receive behavioral altering motivational text messaging
      OR continue with usual care. The sample size and power was based on the test of the
      difference in AF detection rates between the intervention group and the control group in a
      similarly design pilot study. In the preliminary data there were 4 episodes of AF during the
      follow-up of 12 patients or a detection rate of 0.33 vs. a detection rate of 8% among
      controls. The detection window in this study as the time period from randomization to the
      6-month follow-up will be defined. All patients' clinical records will be reviewed every
      month (via charts and/or internal and external electronic medical record systems) up until
      month 6 for initiations/changes in treatments targeting AF. A recurrence of AF in the chart
      and any related therapies that are initiated as a result of electrocardiogram (ECG) findings
      through usual cardiac care or from the AliveCor™ Heart Monitor will be specifically looked
      at. Changes in cardiovascular measures (blood pressure, glucose control, etc.) will be
      compared between groups. The effect of participating in the intervention, which includes
      targeted text messaging on AF knowledge and cardiovascular behavior change will be determined
      by comparing the change in AF knowledge scales from baseline to 6 months. This study will
      also measure and compare the incidence of documented AF in both groups, changes in prescribed
      treatment by healthcare providers over the 6-month period, and the relationship of the
      intervention to changes in cardiac measures and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) measured
      at baseline and 6 months. A biannual time period was chosen to capture AF redetection,
      changes in AF treatment, and self-reported quality of life based on other studies that have
      shown biannual time-points as most appropriate for collecting the proposed study endpoints.

    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Examine the rate of recurrent atrial arrhythmias between the intervention and control group during the study period. The investigators will define and calculate recurrent AF detection rate as the ratio of the number of recurrent AF episodes to the number of person-months of follow-ups.</description>

    <description>Examine the type of treatment and time-to-treatment for recurrent atrial arrhythmias between the intervention and control group. For those who are treated for recurrent AF, the time-to-treatment is the time from beginning of study to the time of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Mean Quality-Adjusted Life-Years between Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Months</time_frame>
    <description>Calculate the mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in those in the iHEART intervention as compared to the control group during the six month study period. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) is calculated as follows: for each month of life lived at an EQ-5D index of x, the QALYs will be x/12=0.0833x years. The investigators will calculate QALYs during the 6-month study period for all patients by summarizing QALYs from baseline through six months.</description>

    <measure>Change in Atrial Fibrillation Knowledge Scale (AFKS) Scores between Baseline and Six Months Chronic Cardiovascular Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between educational text messaging and participation in intervention on AF knowledge will be determined by comparing the change in mean scores between groups from the Atrial Fibrillation Knowledge Scale (AFKS) from baseline to 6 months. The AFKS is an 11-item scale including questions about AF in general, symptom recognition, and treatment and is validated (Cronbach α 0.58) to differentiate between knowledge changes in patients with AF.</description>

    <description>The AliveCor Heart Monitor, an FDA-approved smartphone technology, snaps on to the patient's study smartphone similar to a protective case and works through a free application, &quot;AliveECG&quot;. It captures a highly sensitive (98%), specific (97%), and accurate (97%) single-lead ECG recording through two electrodes on the back of the patient's smartphone. When the application is opened, recording begins automatically when both electrodes make contact with skin. Transmissions are automatically uploaded to the study patient portal within the AliveCor &quot;cloud&quot;.</description>

The content of the text messages will not include PHI. The final text message bank will be housed internally and maintained by the Data Manager and text messages will be pushed automatically from this database.
