  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this alcohol-interaction pilot study is to provide information on the effect
      of AZD0530 (Saracatinib) on the pharmacokinetics of alcohol and on alcohol responses,
      including stimulation, sedation, intoxication, body sway and physiological responses. The
      investigators propose to test the effects of a single dose of AZD0530 (125 mg) on alcohol
      related responses. This is a within subjects open label study in which the investigators plan
      to run 8 subjects to obtain 5 completers.

      The purpose of this alcohol-interaction pilot study is to provide information on the effect
      of AZD0530 (Saracatinib) on the pharmacokinetics of alcohol and on alcohol responses,
      including stimulation, sedation, intoxication, body sway and physiological responses. The
      investigators propose to test the effects of a single dose of AZD0530 (125 mg) on alcohol
      related responses. This is a within subjects open label study in which the investigators plan
      to run 8 subjects to obtain 5 completers.

      Subjects will participate in two lab sessions, one prior to taking medication and one
      following 8-11 days of AZD0530. During each session, participants will receive successive
      doses of alcohol over a 90 min period designed to raise their blood alcohol levels to 80
      mg/dl; this dose was chosen because this is close to the legal limit of intoxication and to
      the peak BAC we have observed in prior research studies.Subjects will be monitored throughout
      the lab session and will receive a phone call two days following the 2nd lab session and a
      follow-up appointment one week after the 2nd lab session to assess any remaining side effects
      from the medication.

      Once it is determined that there is no change in the pharmacokinetics of alcohol or AZD0530,
      as well as no difference in behavioral or cognitive responses to alcohol in the presence of
      AZD0530, the investigators will begin the pilot study examining the effects of two doses of
      AZD0530 on behavioral measures related to alcohol self-administration following a fixed dose
      of alcohol in alcohol abusive or dependent heavy drinkers, and compare responses to those
      obtained from historical controls who were treated with placebo in Study 1. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of two doses of AZD0530 (50 mg/day or 125 mg/day) as a between subjects
      factor.
