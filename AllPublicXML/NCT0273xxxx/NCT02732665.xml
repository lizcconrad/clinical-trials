  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) profiling in subjects first diagnosed with metastatic
      ccRCC is hypothesized to be useful in monitoring drug response and predict the outcome of a
      CT scan. To this end, regularly measured plasmatic and urinary GAGs in prospectively enrolled
      subjects will be correlated to drug response as evaluated by the designated clinician based
      on CT scans. A positive correlation indicates that this test can successfully detect patients
      that are not responding to treatment before the scheduled follow-up in which CT scans are
      performed. Data on the extent of metastasis (number of metastatic sites) will be collected to
      assess whether the biomarker level correlates accordingly.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>ROC curves are generated to determine the extent to which the biomarker scores sampled 2 months before to the scheduled CT scan is specific and sensitive to the prediction of the response to first line therapy as evaluated according to both RECIST criteria and clinical evaluation by the designated clinician. The area under each ROC curve (AUC) is then calculated as primary outcome measure.</description>
