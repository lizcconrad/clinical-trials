      This study aims to evaluate the effect of probiotics on the improvement of glucose and lipid
      metabolism, as well as the gut microbiota.Baseline, 1 month and 3 months data will be
      collected and put into analysis to provide some suggestions on the probiotics use in the
      clinical practice for obesity patients.
