  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 25% of patients with type 1 diabetes have lost the capacity to timely detect
      hypoglycaemia, a condition referred to as impaired hypoglycaemic awareness (IHA) that causes
      a six-fold higher risk of severe, potentially hazardous, hypoglycaemia. IHA is usually the
      end-result of a process of habituation to recurrent hypoglycemia that is potentially
      reversible. Treatment with glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 Receptor Agonists (1RAs) in addition
      to insulin therapy may decrease the incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1
      diabetes. This study will test the hypothesis that treatment with the GLP-1RA, exenatide,
      added to basal-bolus insulin therapy will improve awareness of hypoglycaemia in patients with
      type 1 diabetes and IHA. In a randomized doubleblind placebo-controlled cross-over trial,
      patients will be treated for 6 weeks with exenatide (or placebo), after which hypoglycemic
      symptoms and counterregulatory hormone responses will be examined during a hyperinsulinemic
      hypoglycemic glucose clamp study.
