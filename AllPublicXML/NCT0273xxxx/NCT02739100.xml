    <textblock>
      The main purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Triferic iron administered via
      hemodialysate and via two different intravenous routes in adult patients with chronic kidney
      disease on chronic hemodialysis (CKD-5HD). It is an open-label, randomized single dose study.

    <description>Triferic will be mixed with the liquid bicarbonate concentrate used in the preparation of the hemodialysate solution. This will result in a final Triferic iron concentration in the dialysate of 2 µM (110 µg/L). The patients will receive Triferic via the hemodialysate over the course of the dialysis treatment.

          8. The patient must have at least a minimally adequate measured dialysis dose defined as
             single-pool Kt/V (dialyzer clearance of urea multiplied by dialysis time, divided by
             patient's total body water) ≥1.2, or KIDt/V (online dialyzer clearance measured using
             ionic dialysance multiplied by dialysis time, divided by patient's total body water)
             ≥1.2 measured within the 28 days prior to Baseline.

          9. Patient is receiving, or can receive anticoagulation for dialysis by a single dose of
             unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin pre-dialysis; or by
             intermittent IV heparin bolus.

         10. The patient's vascular access for dialysis that will be used during the study must
             have stable function in the judgment of the Investigator.

         11. The patient must agree to discontinue all iron preparations (oral and IV) for 14 days

             history of hepatic encephalopathy).

         15. The patient has ALT and/or AST levels consistently greater than twice the upper limit
             of normal at any time during the two months prior to Baseline.
