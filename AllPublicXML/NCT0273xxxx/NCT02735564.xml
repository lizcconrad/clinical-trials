  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is considered an effective long-term intervention for the treatment of
      obesity and associated complications. While bariatric surgery has been shown to result in a
      large sustained weight loss, the degree of weight loss and maintenance thereafter varies
      greatly. The Heads Up Surgical Demonstration Project (Heads Up) is a 5 year project examining
      weight loss after an intensive medical intervention (IMI) and the 2 most widely used
      bariatric surgeries (roux-en-y gastric bypass or RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy or SG). Baseline
      data are collected prior to surgery and follow-up data are collected at 6 months and annually
      thereafter. A recent meta-analysis revealed that RYGB resulted in greater weight loss and is
      more effective in resolving obesity related comorbidities than SG, although SG has been shown
      to result in a reduction of perioperative complications and reoperations1. Full elucidation
      of the mechanisms leading to variation in success for weight loss interventions is crucial to
      understanding the most effective and reliable treatments for obesity and associated
      comorbidities.
