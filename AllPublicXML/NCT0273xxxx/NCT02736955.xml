      This Phase 3b, rollover study will provide subjects who completed a Phase 3 valbenazine
      (NBI-98854) study open-label access to valbenazine (fixed doses administered once daily) for
      the treatment of TD until valbenazine is anticipated to be available commercially or they
      complete 72 weeks of treatment. This study will allow enrollment of up to 75 medically stable
      male and female subjects with TD who previously participated in and completed the
      NBI-98854-1304 (Kinect 3) or NBI-98854-1402 (Kinect 4) Phase 3 study.
