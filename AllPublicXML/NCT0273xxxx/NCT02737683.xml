      was caused by organic, while the rest of patients are showed abnormal inspection, and these
      are so called functional dyspepsia. Functional dyspepsia is a chronic and repeated occurrence
      of digestive disorders, patients often visit hospitals frequently and unable to get fully
      cured. Current Symptom diagnoses are based on Rome III criteria as diagnostic criteria.
      Although functional dyspepsia condition should combine with physical and mental treatments,
      due to the reasons behind the complex, there is still no effective classification could be
      acted in health education and drug intervention.

      knowledge used in medical care and public health fields that have raised more attentions,
      many European countries set health knowledge as one of the main indicators for health care
      policy in the future. To promote behavior of self-care health for people, enhance the
      effective use of medical service , also reduce health care cost and unequally medical
      information.

      Anxiety and depression are two common reactions when it comes to negative emotional states,
      which related to a body and caused a vicious cycle of disease. Some patients suffer from
      functional dyspepsia symptoms were diagnosed with anxiety or depression symptoms often ignore
      body care due to lack of health literacy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      distribution of functional dyspepsia patients with health literacy and emotional status, in
      order to provide more effective health education mode, thereby reducing the waste of medical
      resources, and promote patient health.
