  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No consensus exists among biomedical journals on the subject of blinding during the peer
      review process. Some journals attempt to remove all identifiers of authorship from potential
      manuscripts before delivering to referees for peer review while others prefer to leave the
      authorship transparent. Although peer review remains the gold standard for manuscript
      evaluation, the lack of a standardized blinding process between editorial offices may be a
      source of publication bias and make comparisons of manuscripts published in different
      journals more difficult to interpret.

      Proponents of a blinded peer review system believe that knowledge of authorship may leave
      referees vulnerable to biases about those authors' previous research, perceived expertise,
      institution, nationality, or gender. This shifts judgment away from the merits of the
      scientific work and introduces pre-conceived notions about the identity and background of the
      author into the review process. Conversely, supporters of transparent authorship argue that
      knowledge of author identity makes it easier for the referee to provide more appropriate
      critiques. Open author identification allows referees to compare the current manuscript to
      previously published work by the author, and to recognize or identify potentially important
      conflicts of interest.

      The investigators therefore propose an experimental study to address the question of whether
      blinding affects the likelihood a reviewer will recommend acceptance of a study being peer
      reviewed. The investigators plan to work in partnership with a journal to have a fabricated
      manuscript peer reviewed by a large number of reviewers; the authors will send this &quot;test&quot;
      manuscript out either in blinded form (authors' names/institutions not shown to reviewers) or
      in open form, with the names of several well-known, well-regarded authors and their
      institutions visible to peer reviewers. The manuscripts will otherwise be identical.

      The partnering journal, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research allows both open and
      blinded peer review, regularly employing both approaches (authors can choose what kind of
      review they prefer when they submit to CORR), and so the reviewers are unlikely to be
      troubled by seeing a manuscript in either format.

      The primary goal of this study is to determine whether the identification of a manuscript
      with a prominent group of authors (open authorship) will affect the likelihood that reviewers
      will recommend the manuscript for publication.

      Additionally, the investigators plan to purposely place several errors in the manuscript, and
      tally how often reviewers detect these mistakes, to determine whether reviewers read the work
      of prominent authors less critically.

      The investigators will also compare the reviewers' grading of the (identical) methods
      section, to determine whether the identification of a manuscript with prominent authors
      results in higher reviewer grades for methodological rigor.

      This study tests the following specific hypotheses:

        1. The visibility of prominent author names and institutions on test manuscripts will be
           associated with increased likelihood that the manuscript will be recommended for
           publication by peer reviewers. (Primary Study Endpoint)

        2. The visibility of prominent author names and institutions will be associated with a
           decreased likelihood that purposefully placed &quot;errors&quot; in the experimental manuscript
           will be detected by the reviewers.

        3. The visibility of prominent author names and institutions will be associated with
           increased scores given by reviewers for the methods section, despite the fact that the
           methods sections of the experimental manuscript will be identical.

      NOTE:

      All elements of the research protocol were approved by the University of Washington Human
      Subjects Review Committee, including the study's opt-out design for reviewer recruitment,
      since it was considered important that reviewers not know that the paper they evaluated was
      part of a study. To minimize the potential for harm, the authors chose as the topic of the
      fabricated test manuscript an intervention that could not be immediately put into practice at
      reviewers' own centers (a particular team-training process in the operating room). In
      addition, participating reviewers were informed which paper was the test manuscript at the
      completion of data collection, so that they did not pursue this sort of team training based
      on the results of the fabricated study.

      To reduce the risk of an observer (Hawthorne) effect, it was important to minimize the
      likelihood that participant reviewers would learn of the study while it was in progress. To
      this end, the investigators elected not to pre-register the study in a trial registry.
