  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of different levels of carbonation
      isocaloric beverages on glycemic response (using protocol based on standardized glycemic
      index testing methodology), gastric emptying and satiety. It is hypothesized that carbon
      dioxide will delay gastric emptying, and in turn, attenuate glycemic response and enhance
      satiety. The use of a non-nutrient (gas) in improving glycemic response and satiety would
      have important health implications for the beverage industry.

      15-20 healthy subjects will be recruited for the study by means of advertisements, flyers and
      personal communications.

      A randomized, cross-over design experiment with three treatments will be carried out. Three
      different beverages will be prepared:- No carbonation (NC): Potable water + sugar- Low
      carbonation (LC): Potable water + sugar + little CO2- High carbonation (HC): Potable water +
      sugar+ high CO2.

      The outcome measures assessed will be glycemic response, gastric emptying and satiety.
      Glycemic response will be measured by taking capillary blood samples (&lt;5ul) by fingerpricking
      with one-time use sterilized lancets. Gastric emptying will be assessed by ultrasonography
      methodology developed by Okabe et al, 2015. Satiety will be measured using electronic visual
      analogue scales assessing hunger, fullness, desire to eat, prospective consumption and
      thirst. In addition, participants will be asked to rate the level of effervescence of
      beverage, sweetness of beverage, amount of beverage consumed, as well as how pleasant the
      beverage was immediately after drinking of test beverage. Feelings of bloatedness will be
      assessed using electronic visual analogue scales administered at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90,120
      min from drinking of test beverage. At the end of the test session, ad libitum lunch will be
      served, and the amount of food and drinks consumed will be measured (by weight difference
      before and after serving).
