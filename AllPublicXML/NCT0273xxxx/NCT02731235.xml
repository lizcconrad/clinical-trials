    <textblock>
      In a randomized-controlled study the effect of high-intensity training, 5 days a week at home
      for 12 weeks is tested in patients with lacunar stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about effect of exercise for patients with lacunar stroke, no studies have
      investigated the feasibility or effect of aerobic exercise in this subgroup of stroke. The
      patients have few and temporary symptoms and are therefore early discharged from the
      hospital. After an cerebral infarct the patients have increased risk of recurrent stroke and
      they are at risk of developing cognitive deficits or vascular dementia over time. Researchers
      want to investigate if high-intensity training at home in the acute phase has an effect on
      aerobic fitness, endothelial response and health profile in this potential fragile group of
      patients. We hope to increase the patientsÂ´ physical and mental function, and thereby prevent
      a recurrent stroke and slow the progression of vascular diseases.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  lacunar stroke verified by clinical examination and CT- or MRI-scans

          -  able to speak and read Danish

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous large artery stroke,

          -  symptoms or co-morbidities in the musculoskeletal system, which hinder bicycling,

          -  dyspnoea caused by heart or pulmonary disease,

          -  aphasia or dementia which hinder completion of the Talk Test.

        Amendment 1 (version 4.0, June 2016) has been modified to allow an extended inclusion
        period from 0-21 days (previously 0-7 days).

        Also, to allow inclusion of patients with recurrent lacunar stroke, with clinical symptoms
        and a corresponding ischemic lesion on MRI.

        Amendment 2 (version 5.0, June 2017) has allowed inclusion from two other stroke units in
        the Capital Region of Copenhagen due to low recruitment rate. The article describes
        protocol version 5.0 from June 6th. 2017
