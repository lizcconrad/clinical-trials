    <textblock>
      This open-label extension study of Ace-ER will assess the long-term safety and efficacy of
      Ace-ER treatment over a period of 24 months. Approximately 165 subjects from the UX001-CL202,
      UX001-CL301 and UX001-CL203 studies will be eligible to enroll in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GNEM (or HIBM), is a severe, progressive myopathy caused by a defect in the biosynthetic
      pathway for sialic acid (SA). Substrate replacement is a potential therapeutic strategy based
      on the success of replacing missing SA and reducing muscle disease in a relevant mouse model
      of the human disease. Successful use of SA replacement therapy in humans is believed to
      depend upon providing steady, long-term exposure to the compound in an extended-release form
      (such as Ace-ER), given SA's short half-life. This Phase 3b extension study will assess the
      long-term safety of Ace-ER in patients who participated in and completed the UX001-CL202,
      UX001-CL301, or UX001-CL203 studies; in addition, efficacy of 6 g/day Ace-ER will be further
      evaluated in GNEM patients, including those able to walk ≥200 m in the 6-minute walk test
      (6MWT) (roll over subjects from UX001-CL301 and naïve subjects from UX001-CL202) and GNEM
      patients with severe ambulatory impairment (roll over subjects from UX001-CL203).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed UX001-CL202, UX001-CL301 or UX001-CL203 study

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained, and before any research-related procedures are conducted

          -  Willing to comply with all study procedures

          -  Female participants of child‐bearing potential or male participants with female
             partners of child-bearing potential who have not undergone a bilateral
             salpingo‐oophorectomy and are sexually active must consent to use a highly effective
             method of contraception as determined by the site investigator (i.e., oral hormonal
             contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives, vaginal ring, intrauterine device,
             physical double-barrier methods, surgical hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation or
             true abstinence [when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject], which means not having sex because the subject chooses not to), from the
             period following the signing of the informed consent through 30 days after last dose
             of study drug

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not
             of childbearing potential include those who have been in menopause for at least two
             years, have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Screening, or who have had a
             total hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo oophorectomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to
        participate in the study:

          -  Ingestion of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) or related metabolites; intravenous
             immunoglobulin (IVIG); or anything that can be metabolized to produce SA in the body
             within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit

          -  Has had any hypersensitivity to SA or its excipients that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study

          -  Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days
             prior to Screening, or anticipated requirement for any investigational agent prior to
             completion of all scheduled study assessments

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the investigator, that
             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe
             participation in the study

          -  Has a concurrent disease, active suicidal ideation, or other condition that, in the
             view of the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance
             or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or would
             affect safety
