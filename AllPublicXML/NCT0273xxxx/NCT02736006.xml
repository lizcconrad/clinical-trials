  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diving disorders and particularly Decompression sickness (DCS) represent a major concern in
      recreational and occupational pressure-related activities. As a result of decompression from
      higher to lower ambient pressure bubbles which are formed in vascular flow and in tissues
      take part in embolism then resulting in DCS. Individual factors such as vascular or
      respiratory defects are now considered to increase the risk of this dysbarism disease.

      2 groups of occupational divers will be separated after a fitness medical examination by
      regarding DLCO decrease or not.

      The divers will be evaluated before and 30, 60, 180 minutes after a 20 meters air dive.
      Venous bubbles will be detected by precordial Doppler 30 minutes after the dive.

      In association with this Doppler, Flow Mediated Dilation, blood samples analysing
      inflammatory and thrombotic factors and other biomarkers will be explored before and after
      the dive in order to know how vascular and respiratory tracts in this environment react.

    <description>A dive in the depth of 20 m during 40 minutes. The divers will be evaluated before and 30, 60, 180 minutes after a 20 meters air dive. Venous bubbles will be detected by precordial Doppler 30 minutes after the dive.
In association with this Doppler, Flow Mediated Dilation, blood samples analysing inflammatory and thrombotic factors and other biomarkers will be explored before and after the dive in order to know how vascular and respiratory tracts in this environment react.</description>
