    <description>Study subjects who are randomized to the control arm will be treated with Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) and additional standard care treatments. No cellular or acellular biological tissue scaffold will be allowed for subjects in this study arm for the first 6 weeks of the study. Subjects who are randomized to this arm and who do not experience at least a 50% surface area reduction of the study wound by the 6 week study visit will have the option to cross over into the NPWT + MIRODERM treatment arm.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be at least 18 years old

          -  Have a complex study wound which will require an autograft or delayed primary closure
             procedure and which may or may not include tunneling and/or undermining

          -  Have a study wound with a total post-debridement surface area ≥50cm2 and ≤250cm2 with
             no dimension &gt;25cm, and a minimum depth of ≥0.5cm

          -  Have a study wound which is expected to take at least 4 weeks to reach autograft or
             delayed primary closure using standard care and NPWT

          -  Have a study wound that will be treated with NPWT regardless of study participation

          -  Be in an inpatient setting

          -  Be able and willing to sign the consent form and comply with all study visits and
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be pregnant or be planning to become pregnant during the study

             osteomyelitis, non-enteric and unexplored fistulas, malignancy in the wound, exposed
             vasculature, exposed nerves, exposed anastomotic site, exposed organs)

          -  Be immunocompromised or at risk of immunosuppression (e.g. be HIV positive, be
             experiencing organ rejection, be a recent, current, or anticipated chemotherapy
             recipient) as determined by the Investigator

          -  Have a study wound which is a third degree burn wound

          -  Have a study wound that is infected

          -  Have a study wound that is a pressure ulcer/wound

          -  Have a study wound with sinus tract(s) leading to other open area(s)

          -  Have a wound that is being treated or expected to be treated with either HBOT or
             topical wound oxygen therapy

          -  Have a study wound which has been treated with a cellular and/or tissue-based product
             within last 30 days
