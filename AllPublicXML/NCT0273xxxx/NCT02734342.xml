  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a condition that causes cartilage loss, bony remodeling, joint
      stiffness and generalized muscle weakness. 90% of OA presentation has been reported within
      the leg; with 44% affecting the knee joint. Knee OA is expected to increase by 50% over the
      next twenty years due to an ageing population, obesity, and societal trends such as lack of
      activity. Only 13% of knee OA sufferers reach the recommended levels of exercise therefore an
      understanding of how psychological and functional relationships effect exercise engagement,
      which in turn would provide a more comprehensive rehabilitation programme for patients with
      knee OA. The aim of this study is to investigate exercise in knee OA and it it's correlation
      with fear of movement, using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative methodology will
      investigate lower limb exercises for pain and function and fear of movement. The desired
      outcome of the study will show that a reduction in pain with patient specific exercise will
      also reduce the fear of movement and allow patients to self-manage their symptoms without
      fear. Other quantitative factors such as intensity of exercise and postural stabilization
      using the Y balance test will also be utilized to review the functional relationship of
      muscle strength and balance to kinesiophobia. A semi-structured interview will be completed
      at the end of the course of treatment to highlight what patients think about exercise as an
      intervention. Participants aged forty-five and above with specific clinical symptoms will be
      invited into the study and will be asked to attend eight exercise sessions within a class
      environment, which will last for 1 hour within the Physiotherapy Department.

      Exercise is recommended for the treatment for knee osteoarthritis (OA) with muscle strength
      and aerobic exercise improving physical function. There is evidence supporting quadriceps
      strength for patients with painful knee OA; positive effects on pain; and general fitness.

      Research reviews by suggest exercise as an important aspect of rehabilitation in knee OA.
      However, there is very limited evidence to what type of exercises actually decrease pain and
      improve activity.

      Despite positive evidence regarding exercise, highlighted major issues within the United
      Kingdom with only 5% of people with knee OA achieving the recommended level of activity and
      57% of the population not completing regular exercise. 1% to 4% of total healthcare costs
      account for physical inactivity which cost 8.3 billion in 2009.

      An essential factor of physical inactivity is exercise behaviour. Fear of movement is an
      important aspect of knee OA. Disability is present due to the individual's fear of physical
      movements that would cause pain. Evidence links fear of movement with knee OA and the role of
      exercise in the management of knee OA. Patients with OA experience pain during activity,
      which leads to an expectation that further activity, will cause greater pain therefore
      increasing muscle weakness. It has been indicated that individuals could have negative
      attitudes and beliefs about their knee problems, which could cause a barrier to treatment,
      with socioeconomic, personality and environmental factors being as important as the physical
      characteristics. Other factors such as balance issues and laxity of the knee have been
      associated with activity limitations. However, in a systematic review found weak evidence to
      support pain, distress, and avoidance of activity in participants with knee OA. Understanding
      individual exercise behaviours and habits is essential to improve exercise adherence.
      Non-compliance is common within physiotherapy with patients unwilling to accommodate
      exercises within everyday life. Reasons for this may include type of exercises, dosage, and
      underlying beliefs from the clinicians towards exercise as well as external factors.
      Incorrect prescription of exercises can lead to increased pain, decreased function and
      decreased exercise adherence. This could cause fear of movement whilst completing exercise.
      It has been concluded that in OA there is limited evidence that interventions can improve
      exercise adherence. Therefore, an understanding of non-adherence and the effects of
      kinesiophobia is essential to further develop exercise programmes for patients with OA.

    <measure>Change in the level of psychological and functional relationships using the Y balance test during an exercises programme and 6 weeks after the programme.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the beginning, through study completion, an average 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Y balance test is a quick, efficient, objective, portable, and consistent tool and will be used to evaluate dynamic and asymmetrical balance whilst utilising muscle strength and flexibility at the hip, knee and ankle joints. It consists of a stance platform to which three pieces of plastic pipe are attached in the three reach directions; anterior (ANT), posteromedial (PM), and posterolateral (PL). The PM and PL pipes are positioned 135 degrees from the ANT pipe with 45 degrees between the posterior pipes. The pipes are marked at 5 mm intervals for measurement. To perform the test the subject pushes the reach indicator along each of the pipes and a score is calculated. Each leg will be tested.</description>
