  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal surgery is highly associated with septic complications, therefore, multiple
      approaches have been used to reduce this complications, one of the most used is mechanical
      bowel preparation. Lately multiple studies have suggested that mechanical bowel preparation
      might not be necessary.

      Objective: Compare elective colorectal anastomosis with or without mechanical bowel
      preparation on outcomes, particularly anastomotic leak, surgical site infection, and ileum.

      Materials and methods: A clinical trial was conducted including patients with colorectal
      pathology who underwent elective colorectal anastomosis. Patients were randomized into two
      groups; with mechanical bowel preparation (Group 1), and without mechanical bowel preparation
      (Group 2). Surgical, and non-surgical outcomes were evaluated, including anastomotic leak,
      surgical site infection, ileum, acute kidney injury, pneumonia, and mortality.

      The statistical analysis was performed according to the nature of variables, for continuous
      data using measures of central tendency and dispersion and for the qualitative data with
      frequencies and percentages. Inferential analysis with student's t-test, and/or
      Mann-Whitney's U test; chi-square distribution, and/or Fisher's exact test respectively.
