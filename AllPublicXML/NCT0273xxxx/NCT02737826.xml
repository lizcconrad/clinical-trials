  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic opioid therapy for pain can be associated with significant risks, and a significant
      number of patients maintained on chronic opioids have continued pain and/or poor functioning.
      When patients need to or want to come off their opioid pain medications, there is little to
      guide physicians as to how to best help them do so, and it is not known how patients do after
      coming off opioid medications. The goals of this study are (1) to evaluate two medications in
      assisting patients in coming off their opioid pain medications and (2) determining outcomes
      after discontinuing opioids.

    <description>For Phase I, the primary outcome measure is the percentage of patients who tolerate buprenorphine initiation within an 8-hour initiation period, as evidenced by a total score of 3 points when summing the following measures (1) moderate-good level of pain control (same or improved rating on a 0-10 visual analogue scale for pain) = 1 point, (2) mild to no withdrawal symptoms (≤10 on the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale) = 1 point, and (3) willingness to continue to the stabilization and tapering phase of the study; &quot;yes&quot; = 1 point.</description>

    <measure>Opioid cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For Phase II, the primary outcome measure will be opioid cessation at 8 weeks, evidenced as a score of 3 points when summing the following measures: self-report of no opioid use = 1 point; prescription drug monitoring data showing no opioid prescriptions filled in past 30 days = 1 point; and confirmatory negative urine toxicology for a full panel of opioids = 1 point.</description>
