  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the effects looking in certain direction or moving the eyes in a certain way have
      on the ability of a subject to maintain equilibrium in different circumstances (eyes
      open/closed, and standing on hard or compliant surface, with the head straight or rotated
      right or left, flexed or extended).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) testing using the extended
      modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (ext_mCTSIB) protocol: the
      subjects will be required to stand on a hard or the compliant surface in a comfortable
      posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, arms to the side and free to move,
      gazing forward, and breathing normally, with head straight, turned right or left, flexed or
      extended. This testing will be used to determine the health status of the subjects.

      Then a sequence of tests will be performed (they could be done in different days to avoid
      fatiguing the subject): each sequence will comprise of a baseline test in one of the
      ext_mCTSIB testing conditions and a subsequent test in the same conditions but with an
      oculomotor additional task, such as gazing in a specific direction other than straight,
      performing saccades in different directions, at different speed and using different paradigms
      (prosaccades, antisaccades, to a remembered target, gap saccades, â€¦), following a target
      moving on the screen at different speed and in different directions, receiving an optokinetic
      stimulation in different directions and at different speeds. Video recordings of the eyes
      movement may be done to make sure that the subject is actually moving the eyes, to verify
      that the observers are well trained to detect and count the saccadic movements, as well as to
      obtain quantitative information regarding the eye movements per se.

    <description>The Stability Score (calculated as percentage ratio of the actual sway and the theoretical limit of stability) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used to assess if there is a difference between the two tests</description>

    <description>The average velocity moment (calculated as as the product of sway velocity path length) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task.

    <description>The sway path length (the distance traveled during the test) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between the test without and with oculomotor task.
