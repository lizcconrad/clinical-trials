  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the degree of correlation between the clinical
      severity of chronic venous disease and the prevalence of onychodystrophy. The completion of
      the study will require a previous synthetic explanation of the aforementioned two diseases,
      emphasizing the factors which have an impact on the proposed analysis.

      The ultimate goal of this work is to determine if patients with a higher clinical severity of
      chronic venous disease also present a higher prevalence of onychodystrophy. Chronic venous
      disease (CVD) is a vascular disease that manifests itself in the lower limbs and is related
      to a number of different clinical syndromes, all of which have venous hypertension (HTV) in
      common.

      Onychodystrophy in the lower limbs is a progressive non-infectious condition associated with
      various factors the prevalence of which increases with age.It is mainly an acquired
      condition, but it can also be congenital. It is associated to a number of factors, it can
      sometimes be asymptomatic and it is progressive, non transmittable and evolves at a slow
      pace. It is characterised by an abnormal pigmentation, changes in the shape or texture and/or
      the deformation of nails.

      The work performed was observational, cross-sectional, analytical, inferential and
      unicentric. In order to prove its feasibility, the researcher conducted a preliminary
      investigation work (pilot study) with a total of 40 patients (aged 40 to 85) who were treated
      at the Service of Angiology and Vascular Surgery of the Hospital de Sant Pau (Barcelona,
      Spain). These patients were selected to verify their data and then the researcher performed a
      statistical study from a descriptive and inferential point of view to find out whether there
      is a relation betwen the prevalence of onychodystrophy and the degree of severity of chronic
      venous disease. In order to minimise methodological mistakes in the outcomes and sampling,
      the study has been carefully defined and framed.

    <description>The results were obtained from 83 patients, 23 men and 60 women, 40-85 years old. 120 lower limbs were analysed. All studied subjects presented CVD in the studied limb. Some presented onychodystrophy in the studied limb. Each subject was assigned a CEAP classification class (C0 to C6) depending on the severity of their CVD.
Participants were also grouped according to age and gender to establish the relation between certain variables and the degree to which their veins are affected.
We used descriptive and inferential statistics to estimate the population parameters, ensuring a significance level of α=0.05 to α=0.1, i. e. a degree of confidence of 90-95%. Given the statistical results and the degree of confidence, we think the main hypothesis (&quot;The prevalence of onychodystrophy is higher amongst patients who present a higher degree of chronic venous disease&quot;) is proven and we can confirm the association between onychodystrophy in the lower limbs and CVD.</description>

        After the collection of the data, the researcher will establish the variables, including
        all clinical data, the Doppler echography data, the CVD symptoms, and the class to which
        the subject belongs according to the CEAP Classification ( ranging from 0 to 6). All these
        data will be analyzed in relation to the presence of onychodystrophy in each patient. Other
        variables that can be related to onychodystrophy will also be registered: type of footwear,
        feet deformation, personal history and local factors considered potentially responsible for
        the presence of onychodystrophy. Finally, the researcher will perform the statistical
        analysis relating all the variables to finally determine whether there exists or not a
        correlation betwen (CVD) and onychodystrophy.
