  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ewing's sarcoma characterized by the t(11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation at several but
      prioritized breakpoint sites, resulting in the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene is the second most
      frequently diagnosed primary malignant bone tumor in the US with an annual incidence, from
      birth to age 20, of 2.9 cases per million population. The survival rate for patients with
      high-risk recurrent disease (relapse &lt; 2 years) is &lt; 10% at 5 years. Moreover, of patients
      who progress after second line treatment, eighty percent do not achieve a second complete
      response and of these patients &lt; 10% survive one year. Refractory patients to both frontline
      and second line therapy have even worse prognosis.

      The EWS/FLI1 gene is well known as the driver gene of Ewing's sarcoma. We designed a novel
      pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX which has demonstrated sufficient specificity, safety and
      efficacy in animal testing to justify Phase I testing. Clinical safety (no ≥ grade 3 product
      related toxic effect) and target specific activity has been observed with other bi-shRNA
      products involving 147 cancer patients (698 separate dose administrations) (BB-IND 14205;
      BB-IND 14938). Moreover, safety has been observed with IV delivery of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1
      Type 1 LPX in murine and swine testing via multidose IV administration.

      Study testing of pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1 LPX will involve patients (≥age 8) with advanced
      Ewing's sarcoma. The first 3 subjects enrolled onto the study as well as the first subject
      enrolled into each dose cohort must be 16 years of age or older. pbi-shRNA™ EWS/FLI1 Type 1
      LPX will be given via intravenous infusion twice a week for 4 weeks (e.g. Mon and Thurs,
      preferred) for a total of 8 infusions of the product per cycle followed by a 2 week washout
      period. Patients will be accrued in 3-patient dose escalation cohorts using the following
      escalation schema (50% to 33% to 25% to 25% to 25%) at a starting IV dose of 0.04 mg/kg.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects will be eligible for registration if they meet all of the following inclusion
        criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT).

          2. Age ≥8 years.

          3. Evidence of EWS translocation fusion by FISH or RT-PCR or NGS.

          4. Evidence of Type 1 fusion by molecular diagnostics.

          5. Refractory or intolerant to standard of care.

          6. ECOG performance status (PS) = 0-2, or Karnofsky PS ≥60% or Lansky PS ≥60%.

          7. Normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

             Absolute granulocyte count ≥1,000/mm3 Absolute lymphocyte count ≥400/mm3 Platelets
