      1. The overall objective of the study: By evaluating the curative effect of CSAP in localized
      prostate cancer, locally advanced prostate cancer and metastasis advanced prostate cancer,
      and the change of state in cellular immunity and humoral immunity before and after CSAP.
      Validate the clinical therapeutic effect of all kinds of prostate cancer, as well as the
      change of immune status before and after CSAP.

      2. The main content of the study:

        1. Included in the samples are patients in hospitals for CSAP. The sample capacity are
           planned to be 80. The main purpose of the study is to observe the overall survival rate
           , disease free survival rate, the progress time of the PSA biochemical recurrence as
           well as the disease progress time.

        2. Measure the change of concentration in peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets (CD3 + T,
           CD4 + T, CD8 + T, CD4 + / CD8 + T, NK cells) and regulatory T cells before and after
           cryoablation within 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.

        3. Measure the change of concentration in peripheral blood IFN-1, IL-4, IFN-1/IL-4 ratio
           (Thl/Th2 ratio), and detect the secretion of CD4 + Th tumor-specific IFN-l and the
           activity of tumor-specific killer CD8 + CTL before and after cryoablation within 2 weeks
           and 1 month.

        4. Before cryoablation, detect the expression and distribution of Follistatin-Like1
           (FSTL-1), Besides, verify the connection between the number and activation ratio of
           tumor local dendritic cells (DC) and the FSTL-1, evaluating the cryoablation effect on
           the immune response.
