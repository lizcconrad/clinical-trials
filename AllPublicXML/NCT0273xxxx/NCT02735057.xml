  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of elderly patient with cancer is a therapeutic challenge and a public health
      problem. The mean age of esophageal cancer is 64.5 years and 72.1 years in men and women
      respectively. Surgery is a standard treatment reserved to about 30 % of patients. The other
      70 % are considered unfit for surgery for various reasons, including ageing.

      Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is standard treatment for patients with esophageal cancer unfit for
      surgery. The validated treatment scheme is external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 50 Gy over 5
      weeks combined with cisplatin and 5FU infusion. However it induces high rates of severe and
      life threatening toxicities: grade 3 haematologic and esophageal mucositis of 20 and 25 %
      respectively, in patients with a median age of 64 years. CRT has not been properly evaluated
      in patients more than 75 years, and other combined chemotherapy are challenging.

      Choice of the combined chemotherapy Carboplatin and taxanes delivered concurrently to
      radiotherapy is attractive. A Dutch randomized study (Cross trial) compared preoperative CRT
      to surgery in 368 patients with T1-T3 and N0N1. In the preoperative CRT group, patients
      received 41.4 Gy by EBRT over 5 weeks combined with carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50
      mg/m2). A 30 % tumor sterilization rate and a reduction of metastasis considered a distant
      effect of chemotherapy were observed. The 5-year survival was statistically better with CRT
      group. The preoperative CRT was well tolerated and few acute toxicities were observed.
      Intriguingly, in a French randomized study, conducted in less locally advanced disease, the
      combination of 45 Gy and 5 FU infusion and Cisplatin did not induce more tumor sterilization
      rate, suggesting carboplatine/paclitaxel is more effective than 5FU/cisplatin in CRT.

      Study design Since the optimal doses of each component radiotherapy- carboplatin - paclitaxel
      are unknown, we plan to conduct a phase I/II study

        -  Phase I: the objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended
           doses for phase II (RP2D) of each component considering the treatment scheme of Dutch
           study as reference:

             -  for chemotherapy 3 levels: 50%, 75% and 100% of the standard Dutch dose
                (carboplatin AUC 2 and paclitaxel 50 mg/m2)

             -  for radiotherapy 3 levels: 41.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/f; 45 Gy/1.8 Gy/f; 50.4 Gy/1.8 Gy/f basel
                level being : 41.4 Gy and 50% of standard CT doses The phase I is conducted with
                increasing doses of each component with 9 levels.

        -  Phase II: after the determination of RP2D of each component, the study is continued as a
           phase II in order to assess tumor response Secondary objectives: Quality of life,
           progression free and overall survivals
