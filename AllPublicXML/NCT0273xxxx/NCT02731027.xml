  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to profile biochemical responses and measure functional recovery
      in parallel, throughout the 1st year after spinal cord injury (SCI), within the same
      participants. These responses and recovery will be evaluated in samples from people who have
      had a spinal cord injury due to trauma (e.g. car accident or a fall) within the first year
      after SCI. Specifically, the investigators will test the hypothesis that a subset of
      inflammatory biomarkers correlate inversely with functional recovery. The investigators will
      use these data to build a predictive model of functional recovery after SCI that incorporates
      biomarkers that can be easily quantified in the clinic.

      Total anticipated enrollment will be 100 participants with SCI across three different sites
      (Northwell Health System (NY), The Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation (NJ), University of
      Louisville (KY) and may enroll up to 30 participants without SCI.

      At all study visits, a member of the study team (investigator) will collect basic demographic
      and health information from the participant or the participant's medical record.

      Study participants will have blood drawn at each study visit (approximately 2 tablespoons).
      The participant will be asked to partake in 4 study visits over the course of 1 year. The
      first visit will be within the first 0-14 days of SCI. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th visits will be
      3, 6, and 12 months after their spinal cord injury.

      At study visits 2, 3 and 4, a study investigator will also perform some clinical evaluations
      for research purposes to test how the participant is recovering the ability to perform
      activities of daily living and move after spinal cord injury.

    <description>Sample 1 will take place at the earliest possible time within 0-3 days post SCI. All blood products will be collected with strict adherence to universal precautions, and whenever possible, will occur concurrently with clinical blood draws. Blood samples collected from patients with documented concurrent infections such as UTI, as indicated by fever, hematuria or increased spasticity with the presence of pyuria (&gt;25 wbc/high power field), which will raise inflammatory biomarker levels independent of SCI, will be analyzed as a subgroup.</description>
