    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether iron therapy in patients with intravenous
      iron deficiency anemia causes an increase in appetite. And whether this increase is mediated
      by the hormone ghrelin.

      Prior to Iron treatment Investigator will sample subject blood for: counting blood, iron
      sector indices, renal function, electrolytes, and measure the level of ghrelin fasting
      plasma. In addition, the patient will fill a structured questionnaire that examines appetite
      levels. participants will be asked to answer a structured questionnaire which will include
      information on demographics, clinical data (fever, allergies, weight, height) and
      comorbidities. Additional data on laboratory tests, comorbidities, medication and regular
      blood and urine cultures results will be taken from the medical file. Iron treatment will be
      given according to local standard procedure . At the end of the treatment ghrelin levels and
      questionaire will be retaken .

      iron deficiency anemia is defined: hemoglobin &lt;12 gr / dl in women and Hb &lt;13 gr / dl in men
      with ferritin &lt;15 ng / ml.

20 mL of blood will be draw for complete blood count, renal function, electrolytes and ghrelin.
