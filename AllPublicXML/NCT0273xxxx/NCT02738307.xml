      Prospective interventional trial in lowlanders evaluating the effect of acute exposure,
      acclimatization and re-exposure to high altitude on global cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline measurements will be performed in Santiago de Chile, 520 m, over the course of 3
      days. Participants will then travel by commercial airline (2 h flight) and by bus (2 h ride)
      to the ALMA base camp located at 2900 m near San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile.
      Participants will stay there for the next 7 nights and they will be spend the days (6 total;
      6-8 h daily) at the telescope station at 5050 m while undergoing testing as described above
      at the first and the last day at 5050m. Daily transports from 2900 to 5050 m will be by car
      (1 h ride, one way). After the first 7 day altitude sojourn participants will return to the
      Santiago area (520 m) for a 7 day recovery period. A second altitude sojourn with an
      identical schedule as the one described above and a final low altitude stay of 3 days will
      follow.
