  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to test the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of the combination
      biotherapy regimen consisting of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in patients
      with advanced but operable melanoma. Evaluation of the presence of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T
      cells as well as that of PDL1 expression and IDO expression will be associated with clinical
      response (pathologic and/or radiologic). The study will test the radiologic/clinical
      preoperative response rate, recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). It will
      evaluate the safety of neoadjuvant nivolumab and neoadjuvant nivolumab-ipilimumab. Up to 66
      patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject will be excluded from participating in the trial if they meet any of the
             following criteria:

          -  Patients are excluded if they have a history of central nervous system
             (CNS)metastases.

          -  Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI

             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab
             combinations, drugs with a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution
             in patients treated with nivolumab-containing regimen.

             cardiology consult.

          -  Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2 or other non-study immunotherapy
             regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other investigation
             therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids; unless discontinued ≥ 4 weeks.
             A history of occasional use of steroid inhalers is allowed.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined above in Section 3.3, who are
