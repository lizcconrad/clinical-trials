      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Sound To
      Sleep System™ in improving the sleep quality of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
      The Sound To Sleep System™ is a mattress foundation designed to improve sleep quality in
      individuals with ASD and sleep disturbance by providing mattress vibrations that accompany
      and sync with auditory stimulation. For the present study, the primary objectives are as
      follows:

      * Study Aim 1 - To determine whether the use of the Sound To Sleep System™ in ASD-affected
      children with sleep disturbances is well tolerated as defined by group drop-out proportion
      due to issues with the mattress technology.

      The study will also explore the following objectives:

        -  Study Aim 2 - To determine the efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System™ in improving sleep
           quality as measured by parent reported sleep quality in ASD-affected children with sleep
           disturbances. (Please note Study Aim 2 was changed from clinician-rated to parent-rated
           because we were not able to collect clinician-rated sleep quality information).

        -  Study Aim 3 - To determine the tolerability of the Sound To Sleep System™ as defined by
           study drop-out due to any reason and caregiver ratings of ease of mattress technology
           use.

        -  Study Aim 4 - To determine whether use of the mattress technology improves functioning
           as defined by secondary outcome measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of a new mattress technology
      in improving the sleep quality of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Clinical and
      population studies indicate that children with ASD exhibit elevated rates of sleep
      disturbance compared to their typically-developing peers and that 50% to 80% of children with
      ASD have sleep problems. Sleep disturbance can include bedtime resistance, sleep onset
      latency, nighttime awakenings, decreased total sleep time, early morning awakenings, and
      other measures of sleep quality. Sleep problems in children with ASD are associated with
      greater externalizing and internalizing behavior problems during the waking day, poorer
      adaptive functioning, and can cause significant parental stress. Previous studies have
      examined the effectiveness of behavioral treatments, environmental modifications, melatonin,
      and psychopharmacologic treatments in decreasing the rates of sleep disturbance. However,
      none of these approaches have identified treatments that are effective for all ASD-affected
      children with sleep difficulties. Given the high prevalence of sleep disturbance in this
      population, there is a great need to identify additional treatments that may improve sleep in
      children with ASD.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the Sound To
      Sleep System™ using a single blind (actigraphy scoring blinded), cross-over design. The Sound
      To Sleep System™ is a mattress foundation designed to improve sleep quality in individuals
      with ASD and sleep disturbance by providing mattress vibrations that accompany and sync with
      auditory stimulation. For the present study, the primary objectives are as follows:

      Study Aim 1- To determine whether the use of the Sound To Sleep System™ in ASD-affected
      children with sleep disturbances is well tolerated as defined by group drop-out proportion
      due to issues with the mattress technology.

      The study will also explore the following objectives:

      Study Aim 2- To determine the efficacy of the Sound To Sleep System™ in improving
      parent-reported sleep quality in ASD-affected children with sleep disturbances.

      Study Aim 3- To determine the tolerability of the Sound To Sleep System™ as defined by study
      drop-out due to any reason and caregiver ratings of ease of mattress technology use.

      Study Aim 4- To determine whether use of the mattress technology improves functioning as
      defined by secondary outcome measures.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Within subjects comparison of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire CSHQ average total raw scores across baseline and on and off conditions.
The CSHQ is a parent-completed questionnaire that measures a variety of sleep-related problems using a 3-point Likert-scale (1=rarely/0 to 1 times per week, 2= sometimes/2-4 times per week, 3=usually/5-7 times per week). Ordinarily, parents rate these behaviors for the pas week but for the present study they were instructed to rate for the past two weeks to correspond to the mattress on and off conditions. The total raw scores were use to evaluate overall sleep difficulties (Range = 45-135, in which a higher score is indicative of more sleep problems).</description>

    <measure>Caregiver-Rated of Quality of Life as Measured by the CFQL-2 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Within subjects comparison of the Child and Family Quality of Life 2 (CFQL-2), quality of life average total raw scores across baseline and on and off conditions.
The CFQL-2 is a parent questionnaire that evaluation seven different aspects of child and family quality of life (child, family, caregiver, financial, partner relationship, external support, and coping quality of life). An adapted version was used that decreased the number of total items from 32 to 26 and added an additional item to each scale to specifically evaluate changes of the past two weeks in quality of life. Items use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1=strongly disagree/decreased substantially to 3=neutral/same to 5=strongly agree/improved substantially). The total raw score was used to evaluate overall quality of life for child and family (Range=26-130). A lower, overall score indicates a lower quality of life for the child and their family.</description>

        <description>Within subjects comparison of the parent completed Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) total raw score in the baseline, and on and off conditions.
The ABC measures the level of challenging behavior of individuals in and across 5 subdomains (Irritability, lethargy, stereotypy, hyperactivity, inappropriate speech) using a Likert-type scale of 0-3 in which 0 is &quot;not at all a problem&quot; and 3 is &quot;the problem is severe in degree&quot;. The sum raw scores of these subdomains make up the total ABC raw score (range = 0-174) in which a higher score indicates more severe challenging behaviors.</description>

        <description>Within subjects comparison of the average Children's Communication Checklist (CCC-2) General Communication Composite standard scores across baseline, and on and off conditions.
CCC-2 is a parent questionnaire that assesses children's communication skills across 10 domains using a 4-point Likert type scale (0=less than once a week/never to 3=several times a day/always). The general communication composite standard score based on age norms was used to asses overall communication competency (M=100, SD=15). Lower general communication composite scores indicate a higher likelihood of significant communication problems.</description>

        <title>Caregiver-Rated Problems With Sleep Habits as Measured by the FISH</title>
        <description>Within subjects comparison of the Family Inventory of Sleep Hygiene (FISH) average total raw scores across baseline, and on and off conditions.
The FISH is a parent-completed questionnaire that assesses sleep hygiene-related behaviors in children using a 5-point Likert scale (1=Never, 2=occasionally, 3=Sometimes, 4=Usually, 5=Always). Typically parents rate these behaviors with reference to the past month, but for the present study they were asked to rate for only the previous two weeks to correspond to each mattress condition. The total raw score was used to asses sleep hygiene (Range = 12-60, in which higher scores are indicative of better sleep hygiene-related behaviors).</description>

        <description>Within subjects comparison of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire CSHQ average total raw scores across baseline and on and off conditions.
The CSHQ is a parent-completed questionnaire that measures a variety of sleep-related problems using a 3-point Likert-scale (1=rarely/0 to 1 times per week, 2= sometimes/2-4 times per week, 3=usually/5-7 times per week). Ordinarily, parents rate these behaviors for the pas week but for the present study they were instructed to rate for the past two weeks to correspond to the mattress on and off conditions. The total raw scores were use to evaluate overall sleep difficulties (Range = 45-135, in which a higher score is indicative of more sleep problems).</description>

        <description>Within subjects comparison of the Child and Family Quality of Life 2 (CFQL-2), quality of life average total raw scores across baseline and on and off conditions.
The CFQL-2 is a parent questionnaire that evaluation seven different aspects of child and family quality of life (child, family, caregiver, financial, partner relationship, external support, and coping quality of life). An adapted version was used that decreased the number of total items from 32 to 26 and added an additional item to each scale to specifically evaluate changes of the past two weeks in quality of life. Items use a 5-point Likert scale ranging from (1=strongly disagree/decreased substantially to 3=neutral/same to 5=strongly agree/improved substantially). The total raw score was used to evaluate overall quality of life for child and family (Range=26-130). A lower, overall score indicates a lower quality of life for the child and their family.</description>
