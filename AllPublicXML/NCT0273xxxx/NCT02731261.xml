  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to investigate if a six months period of physical exercise
      could improve motor memory consolidation in elderly people.

    <textblock>
      38 subjects of both genders, with a mean age of 71 years old participated in the study.
      Subjects were divided in two groups: a control group and an experimental group. Before the
      intervention of a physical exercise program, subjects performed a Finger Tapping Sequence to
      measure baseline performance. After the intervention, the assessment of the impact of
      exercise on motor memory consolidation was held in three stages: Training; 1 hour after
      training and 24 hours after training.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participants were required to learn a Finger Tapping Sequence (4_1_3_2_4) by using a computer keyboard. The finger sequence corresponded to computer keys as follows: digit 1 - Index finger; digit 2 - Middle finger; digit 3 - Ring finger; digit 4 - Little. The participants were requested to repeat the sequence as quickly and as accurately as possible for 30 seconds.</description>
