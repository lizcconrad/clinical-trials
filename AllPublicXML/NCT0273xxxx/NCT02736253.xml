      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the independent risk factors for osteomyelitis,
      amputation and major amputation of the diabetic foot infection in the forward direction
      without using standard scoring procedures. Patients who were applied to Diabetic Foot Council
      of our setting with diabetic foot infections between 2012 and 2014 were included in the
      study. Patients were followed prospectively and ethical approval was obtained from research
      ethics committee of our setting. An informed consent form was provided by each patient.
      Diabetic foot infection was decided as local infection involving only the skin and the
      subcutaneous tissue or infection involving symptoms and signs more than this criterion.
      Properties and variables of the cases were recorded during the admission process with total
      57 different situations. The related characteristics were followed until the end of the
      treatment. Osteomyelitis, amputation and factors affecting to have major amputation on the
      cases were investigated. In the first step, data normality tests were performed with a simple
      data analysis and univariate analysis was applied in the second stage to which meaningful. At
      the last stage, major amputation, amputation and osteomyelitis were analyzed with stepwise
      multiple logistic analysis (SLA) model. Logistic regression was subject as significant data
      were saved as the independent risk factor. The Odds ratio and 95% CI were calculated from the
      beta coefficients of the variables with significant p value. P &lt; 0.05 was used for
      significance at all tests.

    <description>Number of cases with osteomyelitis as assessed with using at least two of criteria below:
X-ray graphic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, bone tissue microbiological culture bone pathological biopsy

    <description>Transfemoral, transtibial, knee disarticulation, and hipdisarticulation amputations were decided as MAJOR AMPUTATION.

    <measure>To Decide Independent Risk factors for osteomyelitis in patients with Diabetic Foot Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>within the first 5±2 days after admission</time_frame>
    <description>Data of the cases were recorded during the admission process with total 58 different situations including the demographic data such as age, gender, type of diabetes and the wound characteristics such as length and width of the wound, the laboratory results such as the number of leukocyte, neutrophil percentage and CRP, monitoring results such as osteomyelitis and arterial occlusion, congestive heart failure, comorbid diseases such as cataracts, tissue culture results, results of microbiological examination, Charcot joints or deformity such as claw-foot.
For determining of data recieved from area of the wound, HD(at least 1900x1080 pixel) images were recorded.
MDR, XDR, PDR enteric gram-negative microorganisms. MRSA, MRCNS, VRE, ESBL-producer determination factor of any microorganism was adopted as the reproduction of &quot;resistant microorganisms&quot;(1)(2). Fungal growth was recorded also in tissue culture.</description>

    <description>Descriptions were similar with ''Independent Risk factors for osteomyelitis'' But: Osteomyelitis was added to the list(s) for both MAJOR AMPUTATION and AMPUTATION For MAJOR AMPUTATION: AMPUTATION was removed from the list. For AMPUTATION : MAJOR AMPUTATION was removed from the list.</description>
