  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction(CIPO) is a serious motility disorder with
      life-threatening condition, and it is often related with bacterial overgrowth. Fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) results in restoration of the normal intestinal microbial
      community structure. The investigators planned to observe the eﬃcacy of FMT in the treatment
      of a series CIPO patients. Patients received FMT on 6 consecutive days through nasojejunal
      tubes and followed up for 8 weeks after treatment. Rate of clinical improvement and
      remission, feeding tolerance of enteral nutrition, CT score of intestinal obstruction, and
      gastrointestinal quality-of-life index(GIQLI) were evaluated.

    <description>The occurrence and severity of each of these symptoms: pain, nausea, vomiting and bloating (each scored as 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = medium, 3 = severe, or 4 = could not be worse) were recorded by nurses blinded to the intervention on a daily basis.</description>
