    <textblock>
      The aims of the current study is to explore if different exercise training protocols affect
      fatigue post-exercise, and if sarcoidosis-related fatigue and maximal and sub-maximal
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) variables change after a 4-weeks exercise training
      period.

      This project aims to provide data on post-exercise fatigue after single exercise sessions
      with endurance training and muscle strength training, each with two different intensities.
      For endurance training; post-exercise fatigue will be assessed after one session of high
      intensity interval training, and one session with longer duration of moderate intensity. For
      muscle strength training, fatigue will be measured after one session with high loads/few
      repetitions and one session with low loads/many repetitions. In addition, changes in
      sub-maximal and maximal metabolic and ventilatory responses to a maximal cardiopulmonary
      exercise test on a treadmill (CPET) and association to sarcoidosis-related fatigue before and
      after a 4-weeks exercise training period will be studied.

    <description>Four exercise training sessions. Two endurance training sessions, one with high intensity interval training and one session of moderate intensity of longer duration. Two strength training session; one with high load and few repetitions and one with low load and many repetitions.
Fatigue and lactate will be measured before, after and 24 hours post-exercise. Trainings sessions will be randomized.</description>

    <description>Two different muscle strength training protocols will be compared; one exercise session with high load/low repetitions (4 sets x 5RM) versus one exercise session with low load/high repetitions (2 sets x 25RM). Both session will be conducted at four different exercises; seated leg press, chest press, cable lat pull down and seated rowing.</description>
