  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to compare lung function data generated by applying High
      Fidelity Functional Lung Imaging (HFFLI) software to 4D CT, cone beam CT, and fluoroscopic
      images of the lungs breathing to determine whether different modalities of imaging provide
      similar data on lung movement and function. HFFLI may detect changes in lung function in
      patients undergoing External Beam Radiotherapy for cancer.

      This study is designed to test a novel technology to examine early changes in the lung in
      hopes of identifying patients who may be at risk for radiation pneumonitis. Eligible subjects
      will undergo standard of care treatment with the use of the Varian TrueBeam system for
      radiation therapy of a cancer lesion in the chest. The imaging data acquired as part of usual
      standard of care for these patients is a pre-treatment 4D planning CT scan, and a daily cone
      beam CT at each radiation treatment visit. We will also obtain a series of images consisting
      of five six-second cinefluorographs (real time fluoroscopic movies, for a total each time of
      30 seconds of fluoroscopy) of the lungs while the subject is breathing, each at precisely
      measured angles to the subject, on 4 different occasions. This study will compare lung
      function data generated by applying High Fidelity Functional Lung Imaging (HFFLI) software to
      4D CT, cone beam CT, and fluoroscopic images of the lungs breathing to determine the degree
      of correlation between data generated from different imaging modalities. The study is open to
      adults over the age of 18, at any stage of cancer.

    <description>High fidelity functional lung imaging (HFFLI) is an improved method of measuring pulmonary function by analyzing 3-Dimensional (3D) motion. Using this technique, we are able to detect and localize pathological changes in the lung with sub-segmental resolution. The approach uses a unique cross-correlation analysis and non-linear optimization to reconstruct lung tissue motion from a small number of standard projections. All participants will undergo standard 4D Computed Tomography (CT), standard Cone Beam CT, research Low-dose Cinefluorography, and additional research Pulmonary Function Tests.</description>

    <description>Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT) gives global functional data for the lungs as a whole, but is relatively insensitive to early pathological changes. It involves taking very deep breaths and exhaling as forcefully as possible.
Research PFTs will be conducted at 4 and 12-months post radiation therapy</description>
