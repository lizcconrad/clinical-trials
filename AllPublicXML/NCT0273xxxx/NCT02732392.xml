  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of a ganglionic infringement(achievement) at a patient reached (affected) by a
      prostate cancer is a factor(mailman) of bad forecast. The locoregional ganglionic staging is
      a very important element in the coverage (care). He allows to determine the local extension
      of the disease and the type(chap) of therapeutics to implement(operate) after the surgery.
      The standard cleaning out at present recommended by the European company (society) of urology
      at the patients at intermediate or high risk of second offense (recurrence) after local
      treatment(processing), has to concern the obturating pit, the internal and external iliac
      territories. However this type(chap) of cleaning out does not seem to solve all the problems
      of locoregional stratification. Indeed, several studies concerning the radio-controlled
      cleaning out highlighted that 10 in 30% of ganglions.
