  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover study with two
      2-week treatment periods separated by a 2-week wash-out period. Subjects will participate in
      up to eight study visits and have a follow up phone call approximately a week after the last
      clinic visit. Visits 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are evening visits that will be conducted between 5PM
      and 11PM. Visit 4 and Visit 7 are also evening visits that will begin between 5PM and 11PM
      and continue over a period of approximately 24 hours. Subjects will be required to attend
      three clinic visits during this 24-hour period. An exercise challenge (using a treadmill)
      will be conducted at Visit 2, Visit 3 and Visit 6 (after 23 hours of the first treatment dose
      in each Treatment Period); and at 12 and 23 hours post evening dose at Visits 4 and 7.
      Spirometry will be conducted at specified visits and prior to and after each exercise
      challenge.

      Subjects with symptomatic allergic rhinitis at Visit 1 (screening) may be treated for up to
      four weeks with intranasal corticosteroids followed by a repeat screening visit to determine
      eligibility prior to entry into the study.

      Eligible subjects at visit 1 will complete a 4-week single blind run-in on FP 250 microgram
      (mcg) twice daily (BID), followed by 2-week double-blind Treatment Period 1 on randomized
      treatment, a 2-week single blind washout period on FP 250 mcg BID, 2-week double-blind
      Treatment Period 2 receiving the alternative treatment, and follow-up contact approximately
      7-days after completing Treatment Period 2. The total duration of study participation is
      approximately 11 weeks; and up to 15 weeks for subjects with Symptomatic Allergic Rhinitis.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the protective effect of fluticasone
      furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) 100/25 mcg once-daily compared with fluticasone propionate (FP)
      250 mcg twice-daily against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in adolescent and adult
      subjects aged 12 to 50 with persistent asthma.

    <time_frame>At Week 2 of treatment period 1 and 2</time_frame>
    <description>The exercise challenge test is a stepped challenge on a treadmill. It was performed at 12 hrs post evening dose at the end of the 2-week treatment period, wherein the participants exercised sufficiently to reach a heart rate between 80 to 95 percent of their predicted maximum within 4 minutes (min) and maintained the heart rate with exercise for an additional 6 min followed immediately by serial assessments of FEV1 at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min post-exercise. Maximal percent decrease was calculated as pre-exercise FEV1 minus minimum post exercise FEV1 (smallest FEV1 value collected within one hr following exercise challenge) divided by pre-exercise FEV1 multiplied by 100. Pre-exercise FEV1 was defined as the FEV1 collected prior to the exercise challenge test at 12 hr post dose. ITT Population comprised of all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication.</description>

             excluded.

          -  12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG): A subject is not eligible if he/she has an abnormal,

             guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location which seems

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover comparison study of fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) versus fluticasone propionate (FP) in adolescent and adult participants with asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). The study was conducted in two countries–United States and Canada.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of 4-week single-blind run-in, 2-week double-blind treatment period 1, 2-week single-blind wash out, 2-week double-blind treatment period 2 and 1-week Follow-up. A total of 163 participants were screened, 75 were randomized and 74 were included in Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population who received at least 1 dose of trial medication.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Maximal Percent Decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Following Exercise Challenge at 12 Hours (Hrs) Post Evening Dose From Pre-exercise FEV1.</title>
        <description>The exercise challenge test is a stepped challenge on a treadmill. It was performed at 12 hrs post evening dose at the end of the 2-week treatment period, wherein the participants exercised sufficiently to reach a heart rate between 80 to 95 percent of their predicted maximum within 4 minutes (min) and maintained the heart rate with exercise for an additional 6 min followed immediately by serial assessments of FEV1 at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min post-exercise. Maximal percent decrease was calculated as pre-exercise FEV1 minus minimum post exercise FEV1 (smallest FEV1 value collected within one hr following exercise challenge) divided by pre-exercise FEV1 multiplied by 100. Pre-exercise FEV1 was defined as the FEV1 collected prior to the exercise challenge test at 12 hr post dose. ITT Population comprised of all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication.</description>

          <title>Maximal Percent Decrease in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) Following Exercise Challenge at 12 Hours (Hrs) Post Evening Dose From Pre-exercise FEV1.</title>
          <description>The exercise challenge test is a stepped challenge on a treadmill. It was performed at 12 hrs post evening dose at the end of the 2-week treatment period, wherein the participants exercised sufficiently to reach a heart rate between 80 to 95 percent of their predicted maximum within 4 minutes (min) and maintained the heart rate with exercise for an additional 6 min followed immediately by serial assessments of FEV1 at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min post-exercise. Maximal percent decrease was calculated as pre-exercise FEV1 minus minimum post exercise FEV1 (smallest FEV1 value collected within one hr following exercise challenge) divided by pre-exercise FEV1 multiplied by 100. Pre-exercise FEV1 was defined as the FEV1 collected prior to the exercise challenge test at 12 hr post dose. ITT Population comprised of all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean 0-60 Min for Percentage Decrease From Pre-exercise FEV1 Following Exercise Challenge at 12 Hrs and 23 Hrs Post Evening Dose.</title>
        <description>The exercise challenge testing at the end of 2 week treatment period was performed on a treadmill at 12 hrs and 23 hrs after administration of the evening dose of double-blind treatment. Following exercise challenge testing, post-exercise FEV1 values were assessed serially at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. Pre-exercise FEV1 was defined as the FEV1 value collected prior to the exercise challenge test at 23 hrs post-dose. Number of participants listed is the number in the ITT population. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>
