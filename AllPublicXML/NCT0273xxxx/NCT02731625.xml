  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance benefits of supplementing Army
      standard Physical Readiness Training (PRT) with a defined kettlebell (KB) deadlift and swing
      training program as compared to standalone PRT. Power and performance will be measured on
      horizontal (broad) and vertical jumps, 40 yard sprint, 60 yard shuttle, and the Army Physical
      Fitness Test (APFT). It is hypothesized that the unique force distributions of kettlebell
      training will promote improved power, particularly across the horizontal plane, when compared
      to standalone Army PRT. Findings will potentially provide insight as to how Army units can
      effectively utilize kettlebells to further diversify their training programs.

      A sample of 140 subjects will be recruited from the remedial physical training population of
      the Corps of Cadets. This will be achieved through regular communication with company level
      Tactical Officers (TAC) and Physical Development Officers (PDO). Upon consent, unit integrity
      will be maintained as the teams of Cadets will be randomized to either the Army standard PRT
      group or the KB group. Once groups are assigned, PDO's will be provided with their training
      calendars for the upcoming eight week period and a kettlebell safety/familiarization session
      will be arranged for all units in the KB group.

      Prior to the start of training, all subjects will undergo a pre-assessment on the following
      performance measures: broad jump, vertical jump, 40 yard sprint and 60 yard shuttle. Current
      APFT scores will be collected from the West Point Academy Management System (AMS). After the
      assessment, those assigned to the PRT group will conduct training in accordance with Army
      Field Manual 7-22 (sustainment phase activity). The KB group will conduct the same training
      with the exception of kettlebell exercise in place of strength training circuits (this occurs
      on alternating days). KB exercise will initially be instructed by the principal investigator
      (certified kettlebell instructor through CrossfitÂ®), but once independence with exercise is
      noted, the principal investigator's role will become supervisory and continued KB exercise
      will be executed under the leadership of unit PDO's. Upon conclusion of the eight week
      training program, all subjects will undergo a post-assessment consisting of the same measures
      noted previously. Follow on APFT scores will be collected either from West Point AMS for
      graded tests or from the TACs/PDOs for diagnostic tests.

      Once data collection is complete, analysis will be performed using SPSS version 19. A 2x2
      mixed-model analysis of variance will be performed with application of Sidak's multiple
      comparison test to determine if statistical significance has been reached.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Horizontal (Broad) Jump at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 week re-assess</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to assess leg strength and power. Subjects will be advised to assume a standing position with toes directly behind a taped start line. On their own command, subjects will jump as far as they can along a tape measure secured to the floor. Subjects will be encouraged to bend at the knees and hips and swing their arms to assist the jump. Subjects must jump from both feet and land with both feet without falling backward. The distance jumped will be recorded to the nearest centimeter, from the start line to the point of closest heel contact. Subjects will be given three attempts at this test</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 40 Yard Sprint at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 week re-assess</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to assess anaerobic power and speed. Subjects will be advised to assume a three-point position behind a start line. On their own command, subjects will run as fast as they can through the finish line. Time will stop when they cross the timing gate. Subjects will be given a single attempt at this test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vertical Jump at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 week re-assess</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to assess leg strength and power. Subjects will first be advised to assume a standing position with their feet together and legs straight, positioned directly beneath the measuring device. Without jumping, subjects will reach one arm upward, touching the highest vane they can. This will be recorded as standing reach. Subjects will then be advised to assume a standing position with feet shoulder width apart, again positioned directly beneath the measuring device. Subjects will then, on their own command, jump straight up as high as they can, striking the highest vane they can reach with one hand. Subjects will be encouraged to bend at the knees and hips and swing their arms to assist the jump. Subjects must jump from both feet and land with both feet below the measuring device. Subjects will be given three attempts at this test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 60 Yard Shuttle at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 week re-assess</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to assess speed and agility. This test is designed as a basic out-and-back shuttle run and one hand must touch each mark as a subject changes directions. Subjects will be advised to assume a three-point position behind the start line. On their own command, subjects will run out to the 5 yard line then return back to the start. Without pause, this pattern will be repeated for the 10 and the 15 yard lines. Time will begin upon subjects initial movement out of the start and will end upon crossing the finish line. Subjects will be given a single attempt at this test.</description>

    <measure>Change in Army Physical Fitness Test at 12 weeks</measure>
