    <textblock>
      This study will assess the potential of Testagen® TDS-Testosterone to enable transfer of
      Testosterone to females coming in contact with skin to which Testagen® TDS-Testosterone has
      been applied and the potential of product to raise serum androgen levels in those women.

      48 Couples will be added to the protocol and a single dose applied by the male member of the
      couple. The female member of the couple will have undergone a baseline pharmacokinetic
      monitoring of her endogenous levels of Testosterone. At precise intervals by cohort on the
      day of the trial, the male will expose the skin onto which the trial materials were applied
      to the skin of his partner and she will then undergo another 24-hour multiple sample
      monitoring of her levels of testosterone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy Volunteers

          2. Subject Couples, between 18 and 80 years of age, inclusive.

             Sheets and provide written informed consent.

          4. The subject has a body mass index (BMI) within 18-30 kg/m2.

          5. The subject is in otherwise good health as determined by medical history and physical
             examination.

          6. Female subjects must be practicing an acceptable method of birth control. Acceptable
             methods of birth control include hormonal contraceptives. If practicing an acceptable

          8. The female subject must agree to comply with the placement of an indwelling catheter
             on two separate occasions and the drawing of blood samples for the pharmacokinetic
             assessments.

          9. The subject couple is willing and able to comply with all testing and requirements
             defined in the protocol.

         10. The subject couple is willing and able to return to the study site for all visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has any relevant deviations from normal in physical examination,
             electrocardiogram (ECG), or clinical laboratory tests, as evaluated by the

          2. The subject has had a clinically significant illness within 30 days preceding entry
             into this study.

          3. The subject has a history of significant neurological, hepatic, renal, endocrine,
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, or metabolic disease.

          4. The subject has a known allergy or history of hypersensitivity to Testosterone or
             similar compounds.

          5. The subject has used any prescription medication within 14 days or over-the-counter
             (OTC) medication or alcohol within 48 hours of dosing or intends to use any
             prescription or OTC medication during the study that may interfere with the evaluation
             of study medication (excluding oral contraceptives).

          6. The subject has donated or lost a significant volume of blood (&gt;450mL) within four (4)
             weeks of the study, and their haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit have not
             returned to within 5% of normal.

          7. The subject has a history of substance abuse or a current positive urine drug screen.

          8. Alcohol consumption greater than community norms (i.e. more than 21 standard drinks
             per week for males, and 14 for females).

          9. Subjects who have received an investigational drug or have used an investigational
             device in the 30 days prior to study entry.
