  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The REKREATE project will be an international, multi-centre, non-randomised, prospective
      single-arm pivotal study. All study patients will receive the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold
      following the provision of informed consent. A study period of 1 year and extended follow up
      period of up to 3 years is planned , to enable a thorough and complete assessment of the
      performance of the device when implanted to replace removed or damaged meniscal tissue in
      humans. The test article for this multi-centre study is the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold,
      which has been developed for repair of defects of the meniscus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject (or guardian, if appropriate) has signed and dated a specific informed
             consent form;

          -  The subject is over the age of 18 and ≤55 years of age;

          -  The subject is able to comply with the protocol-defined pre-operative procedures, the
             post-operative clinical and radiographic evaluations and the recommended
             rehabilitation regimen as determined by the Investigator;

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of an MRI or arthroscopically confirmed irreparable medial
             meniscus defect;

          -  The meniscal defect should represent 25% or more of the meniscus and be amenable to
             implantation;

          -  The peripheral meniscal rim must be present;

          -  The subject has a functionally intact ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament);

          -  Haemoglobin &gt;9g/dL and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm3 prior to Day 1;

          -  No contraindication to general anaesthetic;

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential: a negative urine pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is &gt;55 years of age;

          -  The subject has a functionally deficient ACL;

          -  The subject has concomitant posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency of the involved
             knee or a concomitant injury that interferes with the subject's ability to comply with
             the recommended rehabilitation programme;

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of Grade IV Outerbridge Scale degenerative cartilage
             disease in the involved knee joint;

          -  Patients demonstrating an active local or systemic infection;

          -  Any condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of the FibroFix™ Meniscus scaffold and clinical outcome;

          -  The subject has a history of confirmed anaphylactoid reaction;

          -  The subject has received local administration of any type of corticosteroid or
             systemic administration of antineoplastic, immunostimulating, or immunosuppressive
             agents within 180 days prior to the scheduled surgery;

          -  The subject has evidence of osteonecrosis of the involved knee;

          -  The subject has a medical history that includes a confirmed diagnosis of rheumatoid or
             inflammatory arthritis, or relapsing polychondritis;

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential: evidence of a positive pregnancy test or a
             stated intention to become pregnant in the next 6-12 months;

          -  Current or recent (&lt;3 months) participation in another device or drug study.
