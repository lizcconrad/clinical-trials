  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For intrauterine device (IUD) insertion, currently there are no standardized clinical
      guidelines for pain management. The investigators aim to explore whether adequate pain relief
      is possible through self-administered, non-invasive means alone. Reducing pain associated
      with IUD insertion may benefit patients and providers. When patients are comfortable during
      their procedure, it is likely the provider can more quickly and with fewer complications
      perform the insertion. The investigators propose to explore the effect of a locally applied
      vaginal lidocaine gel in place of the standard of care pain management, no intervention,
      prior to IUD insertions. This is a superiority, blinded, randomized controlled trial.
