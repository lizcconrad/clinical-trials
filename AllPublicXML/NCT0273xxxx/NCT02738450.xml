      The purpose of this study is to test in adults with Down Syndrome the safety, tolerability
      and immunogenicity of a vaccine, ACI-24.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center, placebo controlled, double-blind and randomized dose
      escalation study of 2 doses of ACI-24 versus Placebo over 24 months with a total of 21
      visits.

      All subjects will receive the study medication (ACI-24 or Placebo) 7 times via s.c. injection
      (12 months) and will be followed up for 12 months after the last dose with a final safety and
      efficacy assessment.
