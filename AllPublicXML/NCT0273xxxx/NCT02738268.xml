  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 90% of the radiotherapy patients will develop a certain degree of skin reaction at the
      treated area, also known as radiodermatitis (RD).

      Currently, there is a wide variety of strategies to manage RD, including creams, gels,
      ointments, wound dressings. However, up to now, there is still no comprehensive,
      evidence-based consensus for the treatment of RD. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a
      promising, non-invasive technique for treating RD. In a recent study conducted in our
      research group, LLLT prevented the aggravation of RD and provided symptomatic relief in
      patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer after breast-sparing surgery. This was the
      first prospective study investigating the potential of LLLT for RD. In the current study, we
      want to investigate the efficacy of LLLT as a tool for the prevention of radiodermatitis in
      head and neck cancer patients.
