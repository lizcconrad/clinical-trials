  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by an increase in the pressures in the blood supply
      to the lungs greater than a mean pressure of 25mmHg and a concomitant increase in overall
      pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). In patients who have remodeling of their pulmonary
      vasculature, PVR will increase with exercise instead of decreasing as it would in normal
      patients. Based on published evidence, the investigators intend to investigate the effects of
      inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) on patients undergoing standard exercise techniques who have
      separately and previously had an implanted pulmonary artery monitoring device (CardioMems by
      St Jude Medical, Inc.) placed.
