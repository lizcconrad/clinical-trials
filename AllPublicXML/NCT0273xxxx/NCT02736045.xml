  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has demonstrated that during residency years, in particular training to obtain
      a medical specialty, work burnout is a very prevalent problem. Work burnout is defined as a
      syndrome of dysfunction in three domains, emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a
      reduced sense of personal accomplishment. (Maslach et. al., 1981). Often, burnout has been
      associated with poor sleep quality and negative affectivity, such as depression and anxiety.
      In fact, our preliminary data demonstrate that burnout in medical residents affects sleep
      quality, and increases negative emotions. Strikingly, burnout in medical residents negatively
      impacts working performance as well as patient-physician interactions, and hence may affect
      the quality of health care. However, lacking are studies aimed at understating how work
      burnout affects cognitive performance and decision making in medical residents. The proposed
      study will provide essential groundwork in demonstrating the link between burnout and
      impaired cognitive performance. In addition, the proposed study will demonstrate feasibility
      for a future trial to test whether an intervention, emWave, integrating a computer based
      stress management (resilience training), can have a positive impact on residents with high
      burnout symptoms. The amelioration of psychological risk factors in medical residents may
      lead to improved physician-patient relationships in the service of improved quality of care.

      Background: Burnout during residency years, in particular training to obtain a medical
      specialty, has been well recognized. Often, burnout has been associated with poor sleep
      quality and negative affectivity, such as depression. However, aspects of positive emotion
      that have been linked to improved physical and mental health, such as trait forgiveness (TF),
      have been poorly explored.

      For instance, according to statistics, depression in residents is as high as twenty-five
      percent, while residents' suffering from depression with resident burnout (defined as an
      occupational related syndrome of emotional exhaustion and low sense of professional
      accomplishment) is as high as seventy-six percent. In fact, first-year residents, with a
      sense of high well-being, experience great level of burnout and depression by the end of
      their first year. ( www.aafp.org, Yi M.S. et al. , 2007 ; Shanafelt T.D. et al. ,2002 ;
      Richman J.A. et. al. , 1992)

      There are two specific aims my collaborators and I are focusing on in in this two-phase
      study:

      Specific Aim 1: To explore the impact of work burnout on cognitive performance and
      psychological functioning in medical residents. Mounting evidence points towards the
      conclusion that work burnout can have a negative effect on psychological functioning in
      medical residents. We will test the working hypothesis that work burnout will be associated
      with poor cognitive performance, poor sleep quality, and high negative affectivity. Our
      approach is to use self-reported cognitive impairment and cognitive performance tasks
      designed to measure three basic processes underlying executive control: (i) updating, (ii)
      inhibition, and (iii) switching. Negative affective symptoms will be measured using validated
      psychometric scales for depression (Beck Depressive Inventory; BDI), anxiety (State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory; STAI), and anger (State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2; STAEI-2).
      Sleep quality will be assessed via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

      Specific Aim 2 - To examine the impact of an 8-week computer based resilience training
      intervention on work burnout, cognitive performance, and affectivity in medical residents.
      Our approach will be to test the impact of this intervention through a SmartPhone (e.g
      Android Phone or Iphone) application, emWave software, which will be provided to all our
      subjects. emWave is a tool that reduces stress by allowing individuals to be less reactive,
      think clearly, and make good decisions, especially under pressure. Fifty medical residents
      with high burnout symptoms will be randomized to receive an 8-week intervention (INT; n=25)
      or sham control (CON; n=25).

    <description>Work Burnout will be measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI:Maslach et. al., 1981). The MBI consists of 22 items that are broken up into three dimensions of burnout: a) nine items relating to emotional exhaustion, b) five to depersonalization, and c) eight to personal accomplishment.</description>
