  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a combination product
      for the prevention of veisalgia. Common symptoms of veisalgia following the moderate
      consumption of alcohol includes headache, fatigue, and thirst. It is the investigators
      hypothesis that a combination of two drugs can alleviate or significantly reduce these
      symptoms when taken before the start of moderate alcohol consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some people who consume alcohol in moderation experience veisalgia. These symptoms include a
      long list of adverse effects that include headache, fatigue and thirst. The mechanism by
      which these effects occur has not been fully elucidated. Although, it has been documented
      that alcohol causes the release of a large number of substances into the blood stream that
      cause a number of physiologic changes.

      A 4-arm study will help to determine the effect each agent contributes to decreasing the
      alcohol induces physiologic changes and the effect when the two agents are delivered
      concurrently.
