  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignancies worldwide and the second
      leading cause of cancer-related death. Surgical resection is still the main radical approach
      for HCC, but the recurrence rate after hepatectomy is very high, which hampers the further
      improvement of prognosis of HCC patients. The conventional risk factors of recurrence
      including: huge tumor, multiple lesions, vessels invasion and tumor rupture. Recently, the
      microvessels invasion (MVI) has been recognized a novel risk factor of recurrence after
      hepatectomy. The investigators' previous study showed that the recurrence rate is more than
      50% for the patients with &gt;5cm solitary tumor and MVI. The MVI was confirmed as the only
      independent risk factor for the overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients in multiple
      variables analysis. It is important to reduce the recurrence and prolong the survival of
      patients after hepatectomy with effective adjuvant therapy. Reported at 2014 American Society
      of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting, A phase III randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of adjuvant sorafenib after resection or ablation to prevent
      recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (STORM trial) failed to meet the primary
      endpoint-recurrence free survival (RFS). Given the inspiring result of a recent trial, which
      compared with single agent of doxorubicin, the oxaliplatin-containing regimens (FOLFOX)
      showed significant improvement in OS, objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate
      (DCR) in Asian (especially China) HCC patients. Based on these rationales, the investigators
      design the current prospective randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effect of adjuvant
      chemotherapy with FOLFOX to prolong the overall survival and reduce the recurrence in HCC
      patients at high risk (&gt;5cm solitary tumor and MVI) after resection, compared to vigilant
      follow-up.

      The patients with solitary tumor more than 5cm and microvessels invasion after radical
      hepatectomy were randomized to receive adjuvant FOLFOX chemotherapy ï¼ˆ8~12 cycles) or
      follow-up. The main endpoint: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival(DFS) and safety
      were compared between this two groups.
