  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to assess whether it was necessary to conduct magnifying
      endoscopy with narrow band imaging (ME-NBI) targeted biopsy compared with endoscopic forceps
      biopsy (EFB) from white light endoscopy in diagnosing early gastric cancer (EGC). Meanwhile,
      the investigators proposed the most cost-effective way to diagnose EGC.

    <textblock>
      ME-NBI has been widely used for the diagnosis of stomach diseases, especially in the early
      diagnosis of gastric cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate diagnostic efficacy
      of ME-NBI targeted biopsy and ME-NBI combined with targeted biopsy compared with EFB from
      white light endoscopy and ME-NBI combined with EFB.

      A prospective study was conducted encompassing suspected EGC. All patients were performed
      white light endoscopic examination with EFB and then ME-NBI with ME-NBI targeted biopsy.
      Outcome measures were assessed and compared, including diagnostic efficacy of EFB from white
      light endoscopy,ME-NBI combined with EFB, ME-NBI targeted biopsy and ME-NBI combined with
      targeted biopsy.

    <description>EFB and ME-NBI targeted biopsy and final resected specimens were assessed according to the Vienna classification. Suspected lesions were assessed in ME-NBI view according to the diagnostic classification proposed by Yao and Ezoe et al. However, little different from their classification, lesions were classified into positive HGN phenomenon, indefinite and suspected HGN, negative HGN phenomenon. After that, ME-NBI targeted biopsy was performed where abnormal or suspected phenomenon was observed. Compared with final pathology of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or surgery specimens, sensitivity of EFB, ME-NBI, ME-NBI targeted biopsy, ME-NBI combined EFB and ME-NBI combined targeted biopsy was calculated. Accuracy of EFB and ME-NBI targeted biopsy was compared using McNemar test. The same method was used to compare ME-NBI combined EFB and ME-NBI combined targeted biopsy.</description>
