  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the equivalence of closed triple therapy
      Fluticasone Furoate (FF)/Umeclidinium (UMEC)/Vilanterol (VI) to open triple therapy (FF/VI +
      UMEC), with a comparison of both triple therapies to dual therapy (FF/VI) on lung function.

      This is a phase III, 4-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter study
      comparing FF/UMEC/VI (100 micrograms [mcg]/62.5 mcg/25 mcg) delivered via a single ELLIPTA®
      inhaler ('closed' triple) + matching placebo ELLIPTA inhaler, FF/VI + UMEC delivered via two
      ELLIPTA inhalers ('open' triple) and FF/VI via a single ELLIPTA inhaler + matching placebo
      ELLIPTA inhaler, all once daily. The total duration of subject participation will be
      approximately 7 weeks, consisting of a 2-week run-in period, 4-week treatment period and a
      1-week follow-up period.

      ELLIPTA is a registered trade mark of the GSK group of companies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the
             study.

          -  Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of asthma
             are eligible if they have a current diagnosis of COPD, which is the primary cause of

          -  Subjects with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying cause of COPD.

          -  Subjects with active tuberculosis are excluded. Subjects with other respiratory
             disorders (e.g. clinically significant: bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis,

             are the primary cause of their respiratory symptoms.

          -  Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery (including procedures such as
             endobronchial valves) within the 12 months prior to Screening (V1).

          -  Immune suppression (e.g. advanced Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) with high viral
             load and low CD4 count, Lupus on immunosuppressants that would increase risk of
             pneumonia) or other risk factors for pneumonia (e.g. neurological disorders affecting
             control of the upper airway, such as Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis).subjects
             at potentially high risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low BMI, severely malnourished, or
             very low FEV1) will only be included at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least
             14 days prior to Screening (V1) and at least 30 days following the last dose of
             oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable).

          -  Other respiratory tract infections that have not resolved at least 7 days prior to
             Screening (V1).

          -  Chest x-ray reveals evidence of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not
             believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or another condition that would hinder the
             ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray (e.g. significant cardiomegaly, pleural
             effusion or scarring). All subjects will have a chest x-ray at Screening (V1) [or
             historical radiograph or CT scan obtained within 12 months prior to Screening.
             Subjects who have experienced pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation
             within 12 months of Screening (V1) must provide a post pneumonia/exacerbation chest
             x-ray or have a chest x-ray conducted at Screening (V1)].

             • For sites in Germany: If a chest x-ray (or CT scan) within 12 months prior to
             Screening (V1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x-ray will
             need to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS).

          -  Subjects with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular,
             neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, gastrointestinal,
             urogenital, nervous system, musculoskeletal, skin, sensory, endocrine (including
             uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or haematological abnormalities that are
             uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or
             which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study.

             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35 percent).

          -  Current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or
             asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per investigator
             assessment).

             abnormal and clinically significant finding that would preclude a subject from
             entering the trial is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not
             limited to, any of the following:

               -  Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate &gt;120 beats per minute;

             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 3 years.
             Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma and
