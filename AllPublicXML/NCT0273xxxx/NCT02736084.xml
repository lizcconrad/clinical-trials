      The investigators developed a novel, telephone-based, 12-week positive psychology
      intervention and will assess its feasibility and short-term impact in adults with type 2
      diabetes (T2D) and suboptimal health behavior adherence. Participants will receive a positive
      psychology (PP) manual, complete exercises (e.g., writing a gratitude letter, performing acts
      of kindness), and review these activities by phone with a study trainer over the 12-week
      study period.

      Specific Aim #1 (Feasibility and acceptability (immediate impact); primary aim): To assess
      whether PP exercises administered over the phone are feasible and linked with immediate
      benefit in patients with T2D, as measured by ratings provided pre- and post- each exercise.

      Hypothesis: The PP exercises will be feasible (i.e., 4 of the 7 PP exercises will be
      completed by a majority of participants, and participants will have a mean score of at least
      7 out of 10 on ratings of ease of completion for the exercises. The PP exercises will also
      have adequate immediate impact (i.e., mean ratings of 7/10 of exercise utility post-exercise
      and ratings of optimism post-exercise that are significantly higher than pre-exercise).

      Specific Aim #2 (Changes in clinical outcome measures): To determine whether the PP
      intervention is linked to improvements in psychological well-being, during and after the
      intervention period (6 &amp; 12 weeks), via measures of optimism, gratitude, depression, and
      anxiety. To examine whether the brief PP intervention is associated with improvements in
      self-reported outcomes related to health (diabetes self-care, diabetes distress, health
      related quality of life), during and after the intervention.

      Hypothesis: Participants will have higher mean scores on all psychological outcome measures
      at 6 and 12 weeks compared to baseline. Participants will also have higher mean scores on all
      health-related outcome measures at 6 and 12 weeks compared to baseline.

      This is a pilot and feasibility study in adult inpatients and outpatients at MGH.
      Participants will have Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and are required to report suboptimal adherence
      to health behaviors, measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale (MOS
      SAS). All participants will receive a 12-week PP intervention and pre- and post-intervention
      assessments of mood and physical symptoms.

      Participants will be enrolled from the outpatient Diabetes Center and inpatient medical units
      of MGH; research staff will introduce the study, assess for inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      and obtain written informed consent. Post-enrollment, and prior to initiation of the
      intervention, participants will complete baseline self-report measures of clinical outcomes.

      During the initial enrollment visit, participants will receive a treatment manual. In person
      or by telephone, the study interventionist will review the introductory portion of the manual
      and discuss the first exercise (Gratitude for Positive Events) with the participant. In
      subsequent weeks, exercises will be completed independently by participants, recorded in
      their treatment manual, and then discussed over the phone with their trainer. In the final
      week, after the final exercise is reviewed, the interventionist and participant will discuss
      future implementation and ways to incorporate the principles into daily life.

      The 12-week intervention will consist of 7 distinct PP exercises, to be completed weekly for
      the first 4 weeks and then biweekly over the next 8 weeks.

      For feasibility, interventionists will record rates of exercise completion at each
      participant phone session. For acceptability, participants will rate their optimism and
      positive affect on a 0-10 scale prior to completing the exercise and then immediately
      following the exercise. Additionally, participants will also rate the ease and overall
      utility of the exercise on a 0-10 scale after each exercise.

      At baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, non-interventionist study staff obtained the following
      validated measures of study outcomes:

        -  Optimism = Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R)

        -  Gratitude = Gratitude Questionnaire-6 (GQ-6)

        -  Anxiety and depression = Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)

        -  Diabetes-related distress = Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS)

        -  Health-related quality of life and function = Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
           Information System physical function scale (PROMIS-PF-10)

        -  Diabetes self-care behaviors = Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Measure (SDSCA)

        -  Health behavior adherence = Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale (MOS SAS)

Feasibility will be defined as: 4 of the 7 PP exercises will be completed by a majority of patients and subjects will have a mean score of at least 3.5 out of 5 on ratings of ease of completion for the exercises.</description>
