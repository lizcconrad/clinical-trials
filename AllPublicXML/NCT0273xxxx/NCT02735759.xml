  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further evaluate and adjust the photoacoustic flow cytometry
      device and its use in detecting circulating emboli.

      Study Design: Cohort 1: Normal healthy volunteers will be enrolled to further adjust the
      device settings. Cohort 2: Use the Phatoacoustic flow cytometry (PAFC) to detect circulating
      emboli in vivo in patients with venous thromboembolism at diagnosis, during and after
      anticoagulation therapy.

      Laser beam from the investigational device Phatoacoustic flow cytometry PAFC will be applied
      to skin and underlying blood vessels. The optical and ultrasound signal will be collected for
      analysis. On each tested vessel, we will estimate the vessels diameter (using optical or/and
      ultrasound imaging). The subject's skin pigmentation will be classified as light, medium, or
      dark. A photoacoustic (PA) contrast will be considered usable for detection of circulating
      emboli if the photoacoustic signal from the vessels is more than 1.3-fold higher than the
      photoacoustic signal from surrounding tissue. The device for subjects enrolled on cohort 2
      will be completed on day 0 (immediately after venous thromboembolism diagnosis and prior to
      anticoagulation therapy), day 7 ± 3 days after initiation of anticoagulation therapy, one
      week ± 3 days after completion of planned anticoagulation therapy and one month ± 3 days
      after completion of planned anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulation therapy is part of the
      patient's normal standard of care and is not part of this study however data from what
      therapy was received may be captured. D-dimer test will be performed on each time point as
      part of their normal standard of care however if the D-dimer test is not ordered as part of
      the standard of care it will be required for the study.. Patients will then be followed in
      hematology clinic to monitor the venous thromboembolism recurrence every 3 months for one
      year.
