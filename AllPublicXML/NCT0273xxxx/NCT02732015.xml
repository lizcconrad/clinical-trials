      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare rolapitant with fosaprepitant in
      controlling or preventing nausea and/or vomiting that may be caused by chemotherapy in
      patients with sarcoma.

      Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:

      There are 2 parts in this study. If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study,
      you will be assigned to either Part 1 or Part 2 based on when you joined the study.

      Each study cycle is 21 days.

      If you are enrolled on Part 1 of the study, you will receive rolapitant by mouth on Day 1 of
      each cycle.

      If you are enrolled on Part 2 of the study, you will then be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups to learn which study drug you will receive. This is
      done because no one knows if one group is better, the same, or worse than the other.

        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive rolapitant by mouth on Day 1 of each cycle.

        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive fosaprepitant by vein for about 30 minutes on
           Day 1 of each cycle. Depending on how you respond to the drug, you may also receive
           fosaprepitant on Days 1 and 4 of Cycles 2 and beyond.

      You and the study staff will know to which group you are assigned.

      Both groups will also receive additional supportive drugs (such as dexamethasone and
      ondansetron) before chemotherapy, every day for 5 days, to help prevent nausea and vomiting.
      You may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      You will also receive the chemotherapy prescribed by your doctor. You will sign a separate
      consent form for chemotherapy that will describe these treatments in detail, along with their
      risks.

      Before each chemotherapy cycle, you will be given a study diary. Each day, you will record
      any side effects you may have. You should bring your study diary to every study visit.

      Study Visits:

        -  Within 1 week before each cycle, you will have a physical exam.

        -  You will fill out the same questionnaire you did at screening on days 1, 5 and 10 in all
           cycles while on study.

        -  Within 1 week before each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine
           tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy/study drug. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after you have completed the end-of-study visit.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      About 3 weeks after your last dose of rolapitant/fosaprepitant:

      Â°You will have a physical exam.

      This is an investigational study. Both fosaprepitant and rolapitant are FDA approved and
      commercially available for the prevention of nausea and vomiting that may be caused by
      chemotherapy. It is considered investigational to compare these 2 standard treatments to one
      another to learn if one is more effective than the other. The study doctor can explain how
      the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 91 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
