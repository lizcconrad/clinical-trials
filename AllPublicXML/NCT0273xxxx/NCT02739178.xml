  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will measure the impact of sanitation access on women and girl's social and
      emotional health, behaviors, and quality of life in rural India before and after a sanitation
      intervention compared to a comparison group that will receive the same intervention at a
      later date.

    <textblock>
      This mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study will evaluate the extent to which the Global
      Sanitation Fund (GSF) sanitation program in Bihar, India improves health and well-being among
      women and girls. Our study consists of a controlled before-and-after (CBA) study with an
      embedded ethnography.

      Specific objectives are:

        -  Measure the effect of the GSF intervention on sanitation-related psychosocial stress
           (SRPS), generalized psychosocial stress (PSS), perceived quality of life, hair cortisol,
           and urogenital health among women between the ages of 14 and 65.

        -  Measure changes in sanitation adoption (e.g.: sanitation access and exclusive use) among
           individuals / households receiving the GSF intervention.

        -  Document individual and community experiences with sanitation, intervention
           participation, and latrine coverage through ethnographic methods.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sanitation-Related Psychosocial Stress Scale (SRPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SRPS consist of 25 yes/no questions on experiences related to sanitation within the past thirty days of the date the SRPS is completed.This SRPS Scale specifically includes questions related to defecation, menstrual hygiene management, and post-defecation cleaning - the three behaviors that have the greatest contribution to sanitation-related psychosocial stress among women in India.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS10)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>A measure for non-specific perceived stress. The PSS10 is the short form of the PSS and consist of 10 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 to 4). Scores are calculated by reverse scoring items with positive wording and summing across all items for a final score of 0 to 40. The PSS10 is not a diagnostic scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The K10 provides a measure of non-specific psychological distress and consists of 10 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 to 5). Scores are calculated by summing response across each item.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The WHO5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO5 consist of 5 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0 to 5) related to subjective well-being, vitality, and mood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported urogenital infections</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Urogenital infections, a health outcome linked to both menstrual hygiene management practices and sanitation access (Das et al., 2015) will be identified through self-report of any one of the following four symptoms: abnormal vaginal discharge (unusual texture / color and/or more abundant discharge than normal), burning or itching of the genitalia, burning or itching when urinating, or having genital sores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hair cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Hair cortisol will be assessed in a sub-sample of women in both intervention and comparison communities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep duration</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep duration will be assessed through a variety of self-report methods. The investigators will adapt questions from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index that assess sleep duration over the past month: 1. During this past month, how many hours of actual sleep did the participant usually get at night? (Herring et al., 2013). The investigators will also ask the following questions: 1. To the best of the participant's knowledge, what time did the participant go to bed last night? 2. To the best of the participant's knowledge, what time did the participant wake up this morning?</description>
