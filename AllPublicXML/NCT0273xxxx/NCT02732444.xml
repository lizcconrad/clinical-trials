    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients in Long-Term Home Oxygen Therapy (LTOT)
      have a reduction in airflow that is not totally reversible. This obstruction may be
      associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs as a result of inhalation of
      toxic particles, particularly to cigarette smoke. Furthermore, COPD patients also present
      limited symptoms to physical exercise, significant extrapulmonary effects, including weight
      loss, nutritional abnormalities and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Hyperinflation has been
      identified as a major cause of dyspnea and is currently believed to be already present in the
      early stages of the disease, causing limitations in physical capacity. The progressive
      exertional dyspnea is most associated with impairment to activities of daily living,
      decreased quality of life and worse prognosis. Traditionally, the severity of COPD is defined
      by the degree of obstruction, as measured by forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
      after bronchodilator use (post-BD) and can be classified as mild, moderate, moderately severe
      and very severe disease. In the group of patients with Advanced Pulmonary Disease (APD),
      those with partial pressure values of oxygen (PaO2) lower or equal to 55mmHg, or arterial
      oxygen saturation (SaO2) lower or equal to 88% in ambient air; or those with PaO2 values
      between 55-60 or SaO2 lower than 90%, with evidence of pulmonary hypertension or polycythemia
      require LTOT, over 15 hours / day, with evidence of increased survival. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the erythrocyte membranes stability in COPD and APD patients in LTOT compared
      to healthy subjects. It is a cross-sectional, observational study with evaluation of
      erythrocyte membranes stability among the groups as well as lung function, physical testing,
      laboratory analysis, oxidative stress and quality of life questionnaires. As red blood cells
      are the cells responsible for the gas exchange in the lungs and peripheral tissues, and since
      the patients with COPD and APD have gas exchange impairment compared to the healthy group, it
      is expected to find a difference in erythrocyte membranes stability and levels of oxidative
      stress among the groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COPD is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, representing a significant economic and
      social cost. In the household, it causes concern, limited social life and leisure; commits
      the budget and shortens life. In the professional field, reduces productivity, anticipates
      the retirement and results in pension payments and benefits. In the area of health system,
      motivates repeated calls in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics and is a frequent cause of
      hospitalizations, which causes high costs for government and society. Most cases can be
      attributed to smoke.

      COPD is often developed in middle-aged smokers with long time exposure which have a variety
      of other diseases related to smoking or aging. COPD itself has also significant
      extra-pulmonary effects (systemic) that lead to comorbid conditions. Nutritional
      abnormalities, weight loss and skeletal muscle dysfunction are well-recognized extrapulmonary
      effects of COPD and patients are at high risk for myocardial infarction, osteoporosis,
      respiratory infection, bone fractures, depression, sleep disorders, anemia and glaucoma.

      Thus, this study aims to investigate the erythrocyte membranes stability in patients with
      COPD compared to healthy individuals, since the loss or damage of the red blood cells may be
      related to worsening gas exchange of patients and caused, for example, by increased oxidative
      stress observed in the disease mechanism of COPD patients, especially those with advanced
      lung disease.

      Cross-sectional, observational study, which will be compared COPD patients with Advanced Lung
      disease using Long-Term Home Oxygen Therapy to healthy subjects to evaluate the presence of
      difference in membrane stability in the red blood cells as well as differences in pulmonary
      function tests, physical tests, laboratory analysis and presence of oxidative stress, as well
      as their quality of life.

      The results obtained after analysis of erythrocyte membranes stability, as well as oxidative
      stress and functional and laboratory tests will be correlated, both in patients with COPD
      Long-Term Home Oxygen Therapy as the control group in order to establish relationships
      between variables and also compare between groups to determine the differences among them.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The stability of erythrocytes is an inverse function of their osmotic fragility and can be measured by erythrocyte osmotic fragility test (FSO). The test of the FSO provides four parameters for the cell stability of measurement: dX, H50, Amax and Amin. Dx parameter expresses variation in salt concentration necessary to take intact erythrocytes (Amin) to a complete lysis state (Amax), with a 100% hemolysis. Increased dX values expresses greater stability of erythrocytes. The H50 parameter is related to the salt concentration required to produce 50% hemolysis. H50 larger values expresses lower stability of erythrocytes.</description>

It is self-administered and consists of three domains: symptoms, activity and impact of disease. Each domain has a maximum possible score and the total is expressed as a percentage of that maximum, where values above 10% reflects changes on quality of life. A minimum change in score of 4 units was established as clinically relevant after patient and clinician testing.</description>

    <description>AQ20 is a specific questionnaire for obstructive respiratory diseases, consisting of only 20 questions, derived from a longer questionnaire: Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ). On its validation, it was compared to two other more complexes questionnaires (SGRQ and AQLQ) and showed good correlation with these instruments and clinical presentation of the patient. It is self-administered and its great advantage is the short time required to answer it, only 4 minutes, and simplified answers (yes, no or not applicable).</description>

    <description>The system used is the Cardio 2 (MGC, Minnesota, USA), which consists of a flow module, a gas analyzer and a computer with the software &quot;Breeze Suite 7.2&quot;. This controls the ergometer and provides the graphical presentation and examination reports. The gas analyzer determines, breath by breath, the mixed expired fraction of respiratory gases. The analysis of the oxygen (O2) concentration is made using zirconium cell and analysis of the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is done in optical analyzer by absorption of infrared light. This module is calibrated before each test, using a reference sample gas (21% of O2 in nitrogen balance) and calibration mixture (12% of O2 and 5% of CO2 in nitrogen balance of the mixture).</description>

    <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is performed in accordance to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. The equipment required for the test are: timer, pulse oximeter, heart rate monitor, sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. The tests will be conducted on a 30 meters enclosed corridor, free of obstacles, with chairs positioned at each of its ends, always by the same examiners who will be previously trained. Participants will be instructed to walk as fasten as possible during six minutes, being encouraged with standardized phrases every minute. If necessary, participants can rest, but the timer will remain on and they will be instructed to continue the test as soon as possible until the end of the sixth minute.</description>
