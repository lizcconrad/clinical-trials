    <textblock>
      Research to date suggests that individuals with headache use avoidance as a way to manage
      their pain. Despite the wide use of avoidance as a coping mechanism of headache triggers,
      very little empirical evidence exist to support its effectiveness in headache management. New
      treatment approaches, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), emphasize acceptance
      of headache and valued-living as alternatives to avoidance, have demonstrated preliminary
      support in helping individuals reduce headache-related disability and improve quality of
      life. Though, ACT has received empirical support for various chronic pain conditions, very
      little evidence exists as to its effectiveness for head pain problems. The current study will
      examine the effects of an ACT-based intervention when added to medical treatment as usual
      (MTAU) vs. a wait list control group comprised only of MTAU, on improving quality of life and
      decreasing disability among headache sufferers.

      Research to date suggests that individuals with headache may use experiential avoidance as a
      coping mechanism to manage pain or other private events (e.g. thoughts) related to their
      headache difficulties. Despite the wide use of avoidance in headache management, very little
      empirical evidence exists to support its effectiveness. Indeed, attempts at avoiding headache
      triggers or other internal private experiences associated with headache, may increase trigger
      potency, restrict lifestyle, decrease internal locus of control, and exacerbate and maintain
      pain perception. New treatment approaches, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,
      emphasize acceptance and valued-living as alternatives to avoidance, have demonstrated to
      reduce headache-related disability and improve quality of life. Though APA has recently
      included ACT as an empirically supported treatment for chronic pain, very little evidence
      exists as to its effectiveness for head pain. The purpose of the present study is twofold.
      First, it examines, in a Randomized control study (RCT), how an ACT-based intervention for
      headache sufferers (added to medical treatment as usual-MTAU) improves quality of life and
      decreases disability. Second, it investigates whether the proposed process of change
      mechanism (i.e., acceptance and values-based actions) mediates headache interference and
      treatment outcomes (i.e. quality of life). It is expected that the ACT-based group in
      comparison to only MTAU group, will result in lower headache-related interference, higher
      emotional and physical functioning and increase in quality of life. Results of this study
      will offer new evidence regarding the utility of ACT in the management of primary headaches.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Henry Ford Hospital Headache Disability Inventory (b-HDI; Jacobson, Ramadan, Aggarwal &amp; Newman, 1994)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Headache Disability at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>is a 25-item headache disability inventory assesses the effect of headaches on daily activities (e.g. 'Because of my headaches I am less likely to socialize') and emotional functioning (e.g. 'I feel desperate because of my headaches'). Items are divided into two sub-grouped scales: functional, representing the sensory component of headaches (e.g. intensity etc) (13-items); and emotional (12-items), representing the reactive or affective realm (Andrasik, Lipchik, McCrory, &amp; Wittrock, 2005). The instrument is answered with &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot; and the higher the score the greater the disability caused by the headache. The b-HDI has shown high reliability (a=.84) and validity with other similar scales.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ; McCracken, 1999)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain Acceptance at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>CPAQ assesses pain acceptance and consists of 20 items (long version) of which 8-items comprise the short version. It is rated on a 7-point Likert scale1 (0 = &quot;never true&quot; to 6 = &quot;always true&quot;) and yields a total sum with a range from 0-120. Higher scores denote greater activity engagement and pain willingness.</description>

    <measure>Psychological inflexibility in pain scale (PIPS-II; Wicksell, Lekander, Sorjonen &amp; Olsson, 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Psychological Flexibility Levels at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>PIPS is a 12-item instrument of psychological inflexibility. PIPS-II contains two subscales: avoidance of pain (8 items) and cognitive defusion (4 items) related to pain. The avoidance subscale measures behaviors that lead to avoidance of pain, while the cognitive fusion subscale assesses how a patient's thoughts about an event can lead to avoidance of pain ( &quot;I need to understand what is wrong in order to move on&quot;). Responders rate answers on a 7-point Likert-type scale from &quot;never true&quot; (1) to &quot;always true&quot; (7). The scale has good psychometric properties, showing high reliability (a= .87) and sufficient construct validity as shown by relations with other constructs. Validation of the instrument in the Greek language shows similar with the original results (Vasiliou, Karekla, Michaelides, &amp; Kasinopoulos, in preparation). The Greek version appears with high internal consistency (Cronbach's a= .80) and significant correlations with associated constructs.</description>

    <measure>Committed Action Questionnaire (CAQ; McCracken, Chilcot, &amp; Norton, 2014),</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Committed Actions Levels at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>CAQ is an 8-item Likert-type scale assesses goals- directed behaviors (McCracken, 2014). It includes 13 positively worded items (e.g. &quot;When a goal is difficult to reach, I am able to take small steps to reach it&quot;) and 11 negatively worded items (e.g. &quot;I find it difficult to carry on with an activity unless I experience that it is successful&quot;) tapped into two related factors: positive and negative aspects of committed actions. Questions are ranged from 0 (never true) to 6 (always true) with higher scores denote higher committed actions. CAQ present with high internal consistency reliability (a= .87) and sufficient validity with other related instruments, including pain acceptance, depression, and functioning (McCracken et al., 2014).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond, &amp; Snaith, 1983)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Anxiety and Depression Levels at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is a 14 item questionnaire assessing levels of anxiety and depression symptomatology. Each subscale consists of 7 items rated on a 4-point scale (0-3). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety and depression. The Greek version presents with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=.88) and validity (Michopoulos et al., 2008).</description>

    <measure>Greek Brief pain inventory: the pain severity subscale (G-BPI; Mystakidou, Mendoza,</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Pain Intensity levels at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>G-BPI is a 4-item scale rated in a Likert-type scale from 0= no pain to 10 = the most severe pain ever experienced. Ratings are taken for the present time and 24 hours prior to the interview. The G-BFI shows good internal consistency (a coefficient= .80) and sufficient validity. The Greek validity has also demonstrated a high reliability (a= .88 for severity) and sufficient validity with other similar instruments.</description>

    <measure>The Migraine- Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ v 2.1; Martin et al., 2000; under permission given by GlaxoSmithKline; GSK USMA health outcome group),</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Quality of Life Levels at an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The MSQ is a 14-items migraine-specific Likert-type scale assesses the impact of migraines on patients' quality of life over the past four weeks. The scale is divided into three dimensions: Role Restrictive (RR; 7 items), Role Preventive (RP; 4 items), and Emotional Function (EF; 3 items). Role- function restrictive describes the degree to which performance of daily activities are limited by migraines. Role Preventive (RP) assesses the amount of normal activities interrupted by migraines. The Emotional Function (EF) evaluates the degree of emotional effects of migraine (e.g., frustration, afraid and burden). Items ranged from 1 (none of the time) to 6 (all of the time). The revised MSQ (version 2.1) appears with sufficient psychometric validity and reliability (a coefficient= .86- .96), across different migraine groups (Cole, Lin &amp; Rupnow, 2007; Rendas- Baum, Bloudek, Maglinte &amp; Varon, 2013).</description>

    <description>The Acceptance and Commitment therapy + MTAU (active treatment) consists of an unpublished manual developed for the purposes of the Algea project (Vasiliou &amp; Karekla, 2015). Sessions focus in fostering the six ACT processes targeting at increasing psychologically flexible responses to headache episodes and enhancing behavioral changes. The protocol specifies the following goals: (a) increase individuals' willingness to face uncomfortable internal experiences; b) promoting meaningful activities even in the present of head pain; (c) emphasizing acceptance as an alternative to avoidance in coping with headache; (d) clarifying individuals' values in important life domains; e) enhancing present moment-to-moment awareness.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups: ACT-based intervention, plus their usual health care or Medical Treatment as Usual only (MTAU). The MTAU group will follow their usual medical treatment (prescribed headache medication). Treatment sessions will be conducted weekly by two co-therapists in groups of approximately 8-10 participants for 1 ½ hours. The control group will receive the ACT intervention following the completion of the Tx group. Participants will fill out questionnaires before and after the intervention and at a 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up. The ACT protocol and the patients' workbook were developed for the needs of the Algea project (Vasiliou &amp; Karekla, 2015). Techniques will focus on key ACT processes aiming to promote psychological flexibility.</description>
