  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      1467335 in healthy male and female subjects following oral administration of multiple rising
      doses over 28 days.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and target engagement
      biomarkers of BI 1467335 after multiple dosing.

             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication
