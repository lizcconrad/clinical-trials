  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major heart attacks are caused by a number of factors, the two major of which are furring up
      of a coronary artery with atheroma and then sudden clot formation on this area leading to a
      blockage and interruption of blood flow. The clots that lead to heart attacks are largely
      made of clotting blood cells (platelets) that in health repair blood vessels and inhibit
      spontaneous bleeding. One of the main treatment strategies for heart attacks is to make these
      cells less &quot;sticky&quot;. Aspirin is a main stay of anti-platelet treatment in the United Kingdom
      (UK) and in addition one of three other oral antiplatelet agents acting on the same platelet
      activation pathway (P2Y12 receptor) is licensed for use. When a patient is admitted with a
      major heart attack, they are treated with emergency primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PPCI) a technique where a wire and balloon are used to reopen the coronary
      artery and then usually a stent (a slotted metal tube) is placed to keep the artery open.
      Aspirin and one of the P2Y12 inhibitor agents are given to prevent further clots and all have
      been shown to reduce negative events following heart attacks and angioplasty with stent
      insertion. There are increasing data, including from our own institution, showing that in the
      setting of heart attacks, the oral P2Y12 inhibitors are poorly absorbed and have little
      effect at the time of most need, i.e. soon after dosing while the primary PCI is being
      performed.

      All three current P2Y12 inhibitor agents are taken in tablet form immediately before the
      emergency PPCI procedure. It appears that in healthy stable patients these agents take at
      least 30 min to 2 hours to have an adequate effect. In heart attack patients the angioplasty
      procedure is usually performed well within this timescale. Furthermore, patients who are
      having a heart attack do not have normal drug absorption with blood being diverted away from
      the stomach and gut activity being suppressed by other drugs such as morphine.

      In this current study, patients with major heart attacks will be given our standard oral
      agent, Ticagrelor, or the newer intravenous agent Cangrelor prior to PPCI.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with STEMI eligible for PPCI

          -  Able to give verbal assent pre procedure and written consent following the procedure.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  No contraindication to Cangrelor or Ticagrelor

          -  Thienopyridine naïve

        If a patient gives verbal assent but is unable to provide a written consent at a later
        stage due to incapacitation, presumed consent will be continued. The reasons why a patient
        becomes incapacitated and becomes unable to provide a written consent will be recorded
        during data collection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant active bleeding

          -  History of intracranial hemorrhage

          -  Patients who are being treated with formal anticoagulation (Vitamin K antagonist,
