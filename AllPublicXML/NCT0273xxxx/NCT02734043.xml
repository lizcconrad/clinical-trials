  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to provide a road map that can help organizational leaders
      understand how to sequence their financial and human capital investments related to bundled
      payment arrangements. Although specific strategies will vary between organizations, providing
      evidence from a health system with extension experience bundling care for orthopedic joint
      replacements can be instructive for other providers entering new building arrangements.
      Insights from the experience of the health system can help other organizations prioritize
      effort and focus energy around strategies that increase the likelihood of succeeding under
      Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) and other bundled payment contracts.

      This study will analyze data from a health system with the longest standing experience with
      bundled payments for orthopedic procedures. The goal of this work is to provide insights from
      this health system's six years of experience and offer a road map that other organizations
      around the country can use as they plan and implement their own bundled payment programs. The
      investigators will conduct a retrospective analysis on quality and cost data from a health
      system with extensive experience with bundled payments for orthopedic joint replacements. The
      study design will consist of three parts: first, the team will report trends in quality and
      cost outcomes over time using descriptive statistics; second, the team will perform
      multi-variable regression analyses on the data to identify significant predictors of
      different quality and cost outcomes and provide statistical tests on the trends; third, the
      team will evaluate changes in physician and hospital level variation along the outcomes.
