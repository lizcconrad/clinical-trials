  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to create a model; in order to examine the effects of neural
      trauma in patients that are healthy individuals, induced by controlled nasal fractures during
      rhinoplasty, and the regeneration process in the weeks/months that follow. This study
      includes monitoring of subjective nasal symptoms with a visual analogue scale (VAS) score,
      peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) measurements, collection of nasal secretions and nasal
      provocation (response to capsaicin and cold dry air (CDA) exposure).

      The investigators will set up a prospective mono-center study. The investigators will utilize
      objective and subjective parameters in order to assess trigeminal nerve function at the level
      of the nasal mucosa before and after septorhinoplasty (as a model of controlled nasal
      fractures). The subjective parameters involve a visual analogue scale (VAS) score for each
      individual nasal symptom (nasal obstruction, facial pain/pressure, headache, rhinorrhea,
      sneezing, pruritus, post nasal drip, and loss of smell). An objective assessment includes
      measurement of PNIF (Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow), the presence of neuropeptides in nasal
      secretions, (by introducing merocels and removing them 5 minutes later), short cold dry air
      (CDA) provocation and capsaicin provocation with subsequent measurements of PNIF and VAS
      scores and neuropeptides.

    <time_frame>Before and after each test (cold dry air provocation) during the pre-operative visit (one week before the intervention) and the three postoperative visits (two weeks, three months and six months after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of nasal fluid: nasal fluid will be collected, by placing a small Merocel (4 cm) between the middle and inferior turbinate, for 5 minutes. This technique is a traumatic and painless for the patient, and allows a rapid collection of nasal fluid without the need for local anesthesia. The fluid will be stored at -20Â°C until analysis, i.e. measurement of mediators such as histamine, Substance P (SP), Neurokinin A and B (NKA, NKB), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), eotaxin, NPY, CGRP by ELISA. All these measurements will be aggregated to arrive at one reported value an increase of neuro mediators in the immediate postoperative period and gradual decrease to the baseline levels over a period of time.</description>
