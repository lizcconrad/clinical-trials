    <textblock>
      This is a 2 centres, randomised, double blind, three-treatment, three-period cross-over trial
      in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      Each subject will be administered individualised single subcutaneous doses of BioChaperone
      Human Insulin (HinsBet®), insulin lispro (Humalog®) and regular human insulin (Huminsulin®
      Normal) immediately before ingesting a standardised mixed meal.

      Following trial drug administration, PK and PD assessments will be carried until 6 hours
      after start of the standardized test meal.

      The total trial duration for an individual subject will be up to 11 weeks.

          -  Presence of clinically significant acute gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea,
             vomiting, heartburn or diarrhoea), as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Known slowing of gastric emptying and or gastrointestinal surgery that in the opinion
             of the Investigator might change gastrointestinal motility and food absorption.

          -  Unusual meal habits and special diet requirements or unwillingness to eat the food
             provided in the trial.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become
