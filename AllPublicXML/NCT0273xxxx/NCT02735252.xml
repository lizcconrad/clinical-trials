    <textblock>
      This is a tissue and blood collection protocol requiring image-guided biopsies of metastatic
      prostate cancer. Whenever possible, a new bone lesion or new/progressing soft tissue lesion
      will be chosen for biopsy as opposed to radiographically stable lesion. Patients will be
      enrolled in parallel into one of five patient cohorts based modality of planned or recently
      initiated systemic therapy, as well as disease setting: (A) Androgen signaling inhibitor, (B)
      Immunotherapy, (C) Chemotherapy, (D) Targeted therapy, or (E) Castration-sensitive disease.
      Patients in cohort E will be enrolled in one of two groups: Group 1 (treatment-naïve), and
      Group 2 (pre-treated) (see previous section for definition). Patients enrolled in Cohorts
      A-D, as well as Cohort E group 1, will undergo baseline tumor biopsy prior to initiation of
      next line of systemic therapy. For patients enrolled in Cohort E, group 2, patients will
      undergo the first tumor biopsy between 6-8 months after first dose of LHRH analogue delivered
      as treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.

      After performing tumor biopsies and processing the biopsies, the researchers will perform
      comprehensive molecular analysis using established methods for RNA and DNA sequencing. The
      researchers will also collect blood samples (for circulating tumor DNA, plasma, and serum)
      and circulating tumor cells from participating patients. Residual paraffin-embedded blocks,
      frozen tissue, and blood products (serum, plasma, and circulating cells) will be stored in a
      repository for future testing of candidate predictive markers identified during microarray
      analysis. Whenever possible, the researchers will utilize a CLIA-certified laboratory to
      identify genetic mutations within mCRPC tumors to provide genetic information that can be
      returned to patient to potentially inform treatment decisions.

      Following biopsy, patients will be treated per investigator discretion, with treatment
      corresponding to assigned patient cohort. Patients will be evaluated every 3 months for
      response to therapy, with serum PSA and staging scans as clinically indicated. Outcomes on
      treatment post-biopsy will be recorded, including maximal PSA decline, date of radiographic
      progression.

      For cohorts A-D (mCRPC), at the time of disease progression by PCWG2 criteria, patients may
      undergo optional repeat tumor biopsy, along with blood collection for analysis of circulating
      tumor DNA and CTCs.

      For cohort E, group 1, patients will undergo optional repeat tumor biopsy 6-8 months after
      the start of androgen deprivation therapy, along with mandatory blood collection for ctDNA
      and CTC analysis.

      For cohort E, group 2, patients will undergo optional repeat tumor biopsy at the time of
      development of castration resistance as defined by PCWG2 criteria, along with mandatory blood
      collection for ctDNA and CTC analysis.

      All patients will be followed for long term survival with every 3 month telephone calls
      and/or chart review.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically confirmed prostate cancer. Patients without histologically
             confirmed prostate cancer are eligible if both the treating physician and the study PI
             agree that the patient's history is unambiguously indicative of advanced prostate
             cancer (e.g. high PSA responsive to Androgen Deprivation Therapy.)

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease amenable to image-guided biopsy of a
             metastatic site. Soft-tissue as well as bony metastatic lesions will be considered
             acceptable. Patients with locally advanced disease only (where the biopsy would be of
             a prostatic mass) are not eligible. Biopsy of newly emerging or progressive metastases
             is desired and preferable to the biopsy of previously existing stable lesions whenever
             possible.

          -  Platelets &gt;75,000/μl

          -  PT or INR and a PTT &lt; 1.5 times the institutional ULN within 14 days prior to biopsy.

          -  Patients on warfarin, aspirin, or other anti-coagulants are eligible provided they are
             deemed able to tolerate discontinuation of anti-coagulation prior to the biopsy as per
             usual standard of care. Conversion to low molecular weight heparin prior to biopsy is
             permitted per local standard operating procedures, provided there is agreement
             regarding the procedure between the treating physician, the interventional radiologist
             and the PI.

          -  Patients with significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorders (eg type 3 von
             Wildebrand's disease, acquired bleeding factor inhibitors) are not eligible.

          -  Age &gt; 18 yrs

          -  ECOG Performance status 0-2 (see appendix A)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  Additional Inclusion Criteria for Cohorts A-D:

          -  Metastatic, castration resistant disease by PCWG2 criteria, with progression on most
             recently applied systemic therapy prior to study registration, as defined by:

          -  PSA Progression: PSA level of at least 2 ng/ml which has risen on at least 2
             successive occasions, at least one week apart.

        and/or

          -  Soft tissue progression: by RECIST v1.1 and/or

          -  Bone scan progression: the appearance of ≥ 2 new lesions and/or

          -  Symptomatic progression in an area of radiologically evident disease

          -  Documented serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients without prior bilateral orchiectomy
             are required to remain on LHRH analogue for duration of study.

          -  Patient is planning therapy with androgen signaling inhibitor (cohort A),
             immunotherapy (cohort B), chemotherapy (cohort C), or targeted therapy (cohort D).
             Therapeutic combinations are allowed and as treatment may fall into more than one
             category cohort assignment will be per PI discretion. Treatment must be planned to
             start within 28 days of baseline tumor biopsy.

          -  Additional Inclusion Criteria for Cohort E: Metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer
             who are planning to start (Group 1) or currently receiving (Group 2) androgen
             deprivation therapy. The use of chemotherapy or other investigational agents is
             allowed but not required in both Group 1 and Group 2.

        Group 1 (ADT-Naïve): Patients who have not received LHRH analogue, LHRH antagonist or any
        anti-androgen for metastatic disease. Prior use of androgen deprivation therapy in the
        (neo)adjuvant, salvage, or biochemically recurrent setting is allowed provided the last day
        of effective androgen deprivation was more than 12 months prior to study entry. Androgen
        deprivation therapy must be planned to start within 28 days of baseline tumor biopsy.

          -  Group 2 (ADT Pre-Treated): Patients who have initiated androgen deprivation therapy
             (including LHRH agonists, antagonists and/or anti-androgens) for metastatic prostate
             cancer within no more than 6 months prior to study entry.
