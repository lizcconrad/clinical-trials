  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related injuries of the shoulder complex represent a challenge for clinicians due to the
      large variety of clinical entities involved and the broad anatomic structures that are
      potentially affected. Furthermore, commonly performed orthopedic tests have demonstrated
      limited accuracy for the actual diagnosis of the injury. Although considerable research has
      been performed to standardize a model for shoulder injury management, a comprehensive
      approach integrating both a clinical and functional based status of the pathology and adapted
      rehabilitation prescription remains lacking.

      The present study protocol aims to complement previously published shoulder injury management
      algorithms. Potentially, the multi-component, individualized and progressive multi-etiologic
      shoulder injury management model for rehabilitation could become a new effective strategy for
      reducing the time required to regain functional capacity and symptom recovery among patients
      with work-related shoulder injuries.

    <textblock>
      The patient will be attended by an occupational physician who specializes in work-related
      injuries. Following medical diagnosis and supplementary evaluations where requested (i.e.,
      radiological examination), the patient will be referred to the rehabilitation service. Before
      initiating the physiotherapeutic rehabilitation program, the patient will undergo a
      comprehensive functional screening at the biomechanics laboratory. Using a decision-making
      scheme, the identified functional deficits will be used to customize the individual
      rehabilitation plan.Registry procedures will be monitorized in a customized Microsoft excel
      spreadsheet which would record the code of patient episode (i.e. 20170001) as well as the
      number of the first medical and laboratory examination and the code of the therapist
      responsible of the rehabilitation. Twice a week an investigator (I.S) will check the report
      in order to assure proper patient rehabilitation course as well as claiming that pre and post
      laboratory and medical examinations are made. Completed episodes will be moved to another
      archive as &quot;successfully completed&quot; whereas in completed ones will be moved to another
      archive as &quot;unsuccessfully completed&quot;. From that register efficacy data with regards to
      complete rehabilitation management model implementation rate will be calculated and reported
      apart from the outcome variables. The obtained results in terms of number of rehabilitation
      sessions performed and number of working day loss will be compared along with historical
      cohorts of the same medical institution

    <measure>Active Range of Motion (AROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The shoulder range of motion (ROM) will be measured through the use of 3 iso-inertial unit STT-IBS (STT Systems, Spain) - based technology.
The STT-IBS is a 9 degrees-of-freedom inertial measurement unit that integrates an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer in each of its axes. The system measures the relative orientation, acceleration and position (in each of the X, Y, Z axes) of the STT-IBS sensors and sends this information to a computer with a Bluetooth-enabled host. The raw signals are processed online by iSens software (STT-Systems©, Spain), which provides the angular velocity, the acceleration and the angular position of each STT-IBS. Furthermore, after selecting the preferred model form the software (i.e., flexion/extension, FLX/EXT shoulder model) and placing the sensor units accordingly, the software provides the angular measurement of the selected movement in each plane.</description>

    <measure>Isometric Peak force evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>During the entire screening examination, each of the orthopedic tests performed will be performed with the implementation of a Hand-Held dynamometer (MicroFeet 1 Hoogan Industries, USA) to register the peak force (N) exerted during each task in addition to the standard clinical interpretation of the pain elicited during the maneuver. Routinely, 3 repetitions will be performed for each limb at each testing position. The first repetition will serve as familiarization, whereas the subsequent two repetitions will be registered for further analysis. The Orthopaedics test will include three different test for each of the examining clinical entity, such as shoulder impingement, instability, and weakness</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of self reported shoulder function. Simple Shoulder Test Questionnaire (SST)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported shoulder function was registered by means of the utilization of the Simple Shoulder Test Questionnaire (SST). The questionnaire consists of 12 items, and dichotomous responses are registered (yes/no). Two questions are related to pain, 7 are related to function and strength and 3 are related to range of motion perceptions. The minimum clinically importance difference between pre- and post-rehabilitation evaluations was set between 2 to 2.33 points (Angst et al.2011)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost Effectiveness ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The economical burden of the rehabilitative process (by associating both medical and work missing economical costs) will be provided and compared to historical cohorts of the same medical institution (50 patients recruited the year before the OCBRA model is implemented) following the previously reported models (Goessens et al 2001J Clin Epidemiol)) . The number of overall rehabilitation and medical visitations made will by multiplied by its economical costs. The number of sessions administered as well as working day loss will be provided by hosting the Mutual Insurance society for work-related injury management. The economical burden of both medical and working day loss will be provided by the same institution following the recommendations of the National Social Health agency of the Spanish Heath Service Ministry. The cost effectiveness ratio will be calculated as the number of visitations made + working day loss divided by the sum of its economical burden</description>

Afterwards, all the gathered information will be assembled to generate the patient-specific functional and clinical status-based rehabilitation program. This program will be generated in conjunction with the physical therapy staff.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Every Spanish speaking patient over 18 years of age and above the age of 64 seeking
             treatment by a physician at our institution due to work-related shoulder complaints
             from a mechanical origin (related to movement repetitions) lasting more than 4 weeks
             will be eligible to enter our rehabilitation model.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Shoulder pain episodes during less than 4 weeks. This preliminary time-based criterion
             for exclusion from the program is designed to prevent the inclusion of transient
             shoulder ailments that could adequately resolve with rest and AINES medication. This
             decision will prevent service saturation due to limited technical and human resources.

          -  Shoulder pain episodes corresponding to other shoulder pain sources other than work-
             related shoulder complaints from a mechanical origin
