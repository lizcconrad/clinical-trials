  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to measure changes in the thickness of the vaginal lining
      (epithelium + underlying stroma) between 0 and 8 weeks after injection.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to measure changes in the following between 0 and
      8 weeks after injection:

      A. vaginal flora and Nugent score.

      B. vaginal pH.

      C. functional evolution via the VHI index by Gloria Bachman (state of the vaginal mucosa),
      pain / dyspareunia (visual analog scale) and the satisfaction concerning care viay the PGI-I
      questionnaire (Patient Global Impression and Improvement).

      D. Procollagen I and III gene expression (by PCR) and mitotic activity of the mucosa (Ki67
      proliferation marker) based on biopsies.

    <description>Multi-point Intra-mucosal Injections of Cross-linked Hyaluronic Acid (DESIRIAL®) in the Vaginal Vestibule
The intervention is Intended for intra-mucosal injection in women for biostimulation / rehydration of the surface layers of the lining of the genital areas, vaginal hypotrophies and / or treatment of female sexual dysfunction related to subsidence G &quot;spot or area of Gräfenberg &quot;.
Following disinfection and topical anesthesia (lidocaine gel), the vesitbule is injected using a multi-point technique. The optimal volume of DESIRIAL® to be used for injection into the vestibule is approximately 0.3 ml in total.</description>
