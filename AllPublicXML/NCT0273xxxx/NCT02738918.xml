      BACKGROUND: Antibody-mediated humoral rejection is currently a critical question in renal
      transplant recipient with immunological risk factors such as pre transplant donor-specific
      anti HLA antibodies (DSA). The immunosuppressive management of the patients is still not well
      defined and improving both short and long-term graft outcome remains a challenging question.
      Recent experimental data suggest that Belatacept could induce B cell anergy , induce
      regulatory B cell and decrease Ig production. These findings are strengthened by the results
      of both phase II and III clinical studies, showing a significant lower incidence of DSA in
      patients treated with Belatacept compared to recipients receiving a conventional
      immunosuppressive regimen with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI).

      Primary objective will be the incidence of clinical and subclinical humoral rejection
      (According to BANFF 2011 Criteria). Secondary objectives will include one-year graft and
      patient survival, renal function at M12 (MDRD), incidence of cellular rejection (M 12), level
      of proteinuria (M3 and M12) and DSA outcome (outcome of DSA MFI at JO, M3 and M12). Inclusion
      period will be of two years. DSA identification and quantitative analysis before and after
      transplantation will be centralized in only one HLA laboratory Unit (Hospital Saint Louis)
      for providing results homogeneity.

      According to previous clinical studies, the incidence of Acute Antibody Mediated Humoral
      Rejection is close to 20% in patients with mild immunological risk defined by the presence of
      DSA at the time of transplant with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) between 1000 and 3000
      (Luminex). In order to demonstrate a significant reduction (40%) of AAMR and sAAMR incidence,
      91 patients will be included in this study. Results will be compared to a cohort matched for
      age, sex, immunological risk factor (DSA), time of transplant, transplant center and grafted
      with a similar immunosuppressive regimen including CNI instead of Belatacept

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Written Informed Consent

             a) Before any study procedures are performed, subjects will have the details of the
             study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to
             read. Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that
