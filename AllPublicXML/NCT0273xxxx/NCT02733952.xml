      this study aims at comparing between different methods to decrease blood loss in
      trans-abdominal myomectomy. this study compares between medical (intravenous tranexamic acid
      administration) and non medical (pericervical tourniquet) methods in decreasing blood loss
      intra operative

    <description>The tourniquet method will be used where the urinary bladder will be dissected downwards from the lower uterine segment, and then a perforation will be made in the posterior leaflet of the broad ligament bilaterally at the level of uterine isthmus. A tourniquet (using 16- inch Foley catheter) will be passed through the perforation encircling the uterine arteries bilaterally. The Fallopian tubes and the ovaries will be carefully excluded from the line of the tourniquet to avoid direct compression and necrosis. The tourniquet will be released intermittently (at about 30 minutes interval) during the surgery and ﬁnally removed after the repair of the uterus</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Women in the reproductive age (20 - 40 years) diagnosed as having uterine fibroids
             who are consenting to have trans-abdominal myomectomy in the postmenstrual period
             diagnosed by:

        Clinical symptoms and signs:

          -  Abnormal uterine bleeding (menorrhagia or (and) metrorrhagia).

          -  Associated pelvic pathology.

        Ultrasound criteria of uterine fibroids of included patients:

          -  Maximum diameter of the largest fibroid is greater than 4cm.

          -  Maximum number of uterine myomas is not to be more than 5 myomas.

          -  Uterine fibroid may be subserous or intramural.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Obesity (body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2).

          -  Cardiac, endocrine, pulmonary or hematological disease (including anemia; hemoglobin
             level below 10gm/dl).

          -  Patients known to be allergic to tranexamic acid.

          -  Patients who received pre-operative hormonal therapy (such as a GnRH analogue).

          -  Patients presented by or with suspected malignant gynecological disease.

          -  Patients diagnosed as having submucous uterine fibroids, cervical or supracervical
             fibroids, broad ligamentary fibroids and pedunculated fibroids.

          -  Patients with contraindication to general anaesthesia.

          -  Patients with positive pregnancy test.
