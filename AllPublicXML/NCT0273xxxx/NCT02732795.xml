    <textblock>
      Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is one of the most common pediatric surgeries performed, and is
      estimated to comprise 530,000 procedures in children under 15 years of age. Historically, the
      leading cause for these procedures was recurrent infections; however, more recently surgical
      indications include sleep disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
      Pre-operative polysomnography (PSG) is recommended for all children with suspected OSA prior
      to undergoing AT, although it is unclear whether sleep disordered breathing characteristics
      predict post-operative outcomes or complications.

      Obesity has become an epidemic in our pediatric population. More recently, an increased
      population of obese children are presenting for AT with upper airway obstruction with or
      without tonsillar hypertrophy, which is similar to the adult etiology of OSA. Obesity is a
      multisystem disease, causing fatty liver and cardiac disease, defects in glucose metabolism,
      insulin resistance, leptin resistance, and creates a state of chronic inflammation. Markers
      for inflammation, including TNF-Î±, CRP, leptin, IL-6 and IL-10, are abnormal in obese
      patients and have also been linked to more severe OSA disease in children even after
      controlling for BMI.

      In pediatrics, medication dosing is based on an actual body-weight calculation, however,
      recent reports suggest that this dosing method is over-dosing patients with obesity.
      Therefore, increased respiratory complications after surgery may be related to inappropriate
      intra-operative opioid dosing.

      Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To compare analgesic-guided opioid dosing using actual body weight
      (ABW) based dosing versus ideal body weight (IBW) dosing for adenotonsillectomy in children
      with OSA (BMI &gt;/=75%).

      The investigators hypothesize that 1) weight-based opioid dosing compared to dosing based on
      ideal body weight leads to increased respiratory complications defined by (a) upper airway
      obstruction, (b) hypoventilation, and (c) oxygen desaturation without affecting pain scores
      immediately after adenotonsillectomy. In addition, the investigators believe 2) that there
      will be little statistically significant difference in pain scores between ABW and IBW for
      these patients.

      Specific Aim 2 (SA2): To determine whether biomarkers related to obesity, chronic
      inflammation, and OSA predict post-operative respiratory compromise after AT. The
      investigators hypothesize that inflammatory and obesity-related biomarkers are elevated in
      overweight children with OSA, more so in obese children with OSA, compared to lean children
      with OSA.
