    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized placebo-controlled trial of a computerized
      intervention targeting working memory in 30 children with comorbid
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Tourette Syndrome (TS).

    <textblock>
      Because impairments in executive functions (EFs), such as working memory, are associated with
      functional impairments in youth with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders,
      strategies that target EFs are critical. Neuroplasticity-based cognitive training has been
      found to improve cognition in youth with ADHD and in adults with schizophrenia. In this
      trial, the investigators seek to extend the relevance of computerized cognitive training to
      youth with comorbid ADHD and Tourette Syndrome. Given the literature, the investigators
      hypothesize that computerized working memory training will produce gains in untrained
      cognitive tasks and behavioral ratings of executive functions in youth with ADHD+TS. The
      investigators will assess aspects of attention and executive functions in 30 affected youth
      and randomize them 1:1 to either neuroplasticity-based cognitive training or enjoyable
      age-appropriate computer games not intended to improve cognition. Cognition will be assessed
      again after 30 training sessions over 6 weeks and then again at a one-month follow-up.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The investigators will limit inclusion to youth between the ages of 7-13 who carry
             current diagnoses of ADHD+TS and who have a treating physician at a Partners
             affiliated hospital or clinic.

          2. The investigators will include youth who have undergone neuropsychological testing in
             the prior 3 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The investigators will exclude patients with intellectual disability in order to more
             directly extend the prior literature to the ADHD+TS population.

          2. The investigators will exclude patients with severe tics as evidenced by a score of &gt;
             30 on the clinician administered Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).

          3. The investigators will exclude patients with moderate to severe Obsessive Compulsive
             Disorder (OCD) symptoms, as evidenced by a score of &gt;30 on the clinician administered
             Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS).

          4. The investigators will exclude patients treated with neuroleptics, given that these
             medications can be cognitively dulling and sedating and potentially lead to secondary
             working memory impairments.

          5. The investigators will exclude families who do not have a computer with an internet
             connection in their homes, and in which neither a parent nor the child has an email
             address to receive study related communications.

          6. The investigators will exclude families who anticipate or are likely to have a change
             in therapeutic treatments (i.e., psychotherapy or psychopharmacology) during the time
             frame of the trial.

        NOTE: Patients treated with ADHD medications will not be excluded, but medications will be
        recorded for covariate analysis.
