  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effects of esketamine on QT/QTc intervals and
      electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology at therapeutic exposures of esketamine and noresketamine
      (intranasal administration) and supratherapeutic exposures of esketamine (intravenous
      administration) in healthy adults.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), placebo- and
      positive-controlled, double-blind (Periods 1 to 3), and open-label (Period 4), single-dose,
      crossover study in up to 60 healthy adults. The study has a Screening Phase and a Treatment
      Phase. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequence groups and will
      receive the 4 treatments (1 treatment per period); Treatment A (intravenous placebo,
      Intranasal placebo and Oral placebo tablet matched to the moxifloxacin tablet), Treatment B
      (intravenous placebo, 84 milligram (mg) of intranasal esketamine as 4 devices, each with 28
      mg esketamine and Oral placebo tablet matched to the moxifloxacin tablet), Treatment C
      (intravenous placebo, Intranasal placebo and 400 mg oral moxifloxacin tablet) and Treatment D
      (0.8 milligram per kilogram of intravenous esketamine, Intranasal placebo and Oral placebo
      tablet matched to the moxifloxacin tablet ). The first 3 periods will be double-blinded and
      the fourth period will be open-label. Periods 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be separated by 5 to 7
      days. Primarily the effects of esketamine on QT/QTc intervals and electrocardiogram (ECG)
      morphology will be evaluated. Safety of the participants will be monitored throughout the
      study.
