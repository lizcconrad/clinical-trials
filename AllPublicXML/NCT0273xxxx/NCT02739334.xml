  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether a combination of two research-proven programs,
      a responsive caregiving parenting program and a childhood obesity prevention program, will
      have an effect on toddlers' healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors. Investigators
      hypothesize that the children participating in the intervention will have significantly lower
      BMI z-scores, lower intake of sugar sweetened beverages, and increased number of servings of
      fruits and vegetables, and minutes of physical activity.
