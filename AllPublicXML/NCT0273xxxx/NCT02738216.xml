    <textblock>
      This NICHD-funded RCT will enroll up to 178 depressed pregnant women, randomly assigning them
      to one of 2 intervention conditions: (1) a gentle prenatal yoga program (PYP), or (2) a
      series of educational workshops focused on perinatal health, the Mom and Baby Wellness
      Workshop (MBWW), each condition lasting 9 weeks. The investigators will clinically monitor
      all participants in the study for safety and clinical deterioration, and measure a variety of
      symptom outcomes over the course of the intervention period during pregnancy, as well as at a
      postpartum follow-up.

      In this randomized controlled trial, eligible women will be randomly assigned to either a
      9-week Prenatal Yoga Program (PYP) vs. a 9-week health education control group, the
      Mother-Baby Wellness Workshop (MBWW). Follow up assessments will take place at multiple
      points during the study. The primary study outcome will be severity of prenatal depression
      assessed by a blind interviewer. The investigators will examine relevant secondary outcomes
      (self-reported depression, anxiety, functioning, &amp; pain; pre-term birth) and potential
      mediators (inflammation, mindfulness/non-judgment).
