    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the MRI characteristics of Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease subjects both at baseline and yearly for a period of 5 years, and to
      correlate these biomarkers with pulmonary function tests, CT scan, 6 Minute-walk tests, and
      respiratory questionnaires.

      The central hypothesis is that quantitative assessment of the lung through magnetic resonance
      imaging of hyperpolarized 3He can detect early alterations in structure and function which
      are precursors to clinically apparent COPD and that these precursors can be used to predict
      progression of disease earlier and better than established clinical methods.

      Novel assessments using 3He MRI will lead to new information about COPD and will be critical
      for characterizing disease response to therapy. A secondary hypothesis is that a variety of
      technical improvements in the techniques of hyperpolarized gas MRI will accelerate the
      translation of this relatively new modality to clinical use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent was obtained and documented (after the investigator has given
             oral and written information about the study to the subject).

          -  The subject was conscious, co-operative, and agreed to return for the scheduled visits
             and tests and any visits required to obtain additional safety information.

          -  The subject's medical history, physical examination (including vital signs, pulse
             oximetry, PFT's, and 12-lead electrocardiogram [ECG]), and clinical laboratory tests
             (hematology, serum chemistry) obtained at the screening visit were within acceptable
             limits for entry into the study, as judged by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is &lt;40 or &gt;70 years old

          -  Subject known to be pregnant

          -  Subject with a baseline oxygen requirement &gt; 2 l/min via nasal cannula

          -  Any known contraindication to MRI examination

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  A language, communication, cognitive or behavioral impairment that might interfere
             with fully informed consent

          -  Active drug or alcohol dependence

          -  Homelessness or other unstable living situation

          -  Active drug or alcohol dependence

          -  Significant co-morbidities such as heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease,
             hematologic or neurological disease that require continuing treatment.
