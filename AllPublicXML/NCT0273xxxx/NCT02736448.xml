      This is a randomized phase II, parallel group study. Patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) well differentiated G1 - G2 (ki67≤ 20%) and G3 (ki67≤ 50%),
      somatostatin receptor (SSR) positive and 18-FDG positive will be enrolled in the study and
      will be randomly assigned to 2 different arms:

        -  Arm Lu-PRRT-Cap: oral low dose of capecitabine in association with Lu-PRRT (at 3.7 Gbq
           per cycle x 7 cycles) followed by long acting octreotide or lanreotide (SS-LAR); OR

        -  Arm Lu-PRRT: Lu-PRRT (at 3.7 gigabecquerel (Gbq) per cycle x 7 cycles) followed by

      This is a randomized phase II, parallel group study. Patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) well differentiated G1 - G2 (ki67≤ 20%) and G3 (ki67≤ 50%),
      SSR positive and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positive will be enrolled in the study and will
      be randomly assigned to 2 different arms:

        -  Arm Lu-PRRT-Cap: oral low dose of capecitabine in association with Lu-PRRT (at 3.7 Gbq
           per cycle x 7 cycles) followed by long acting octreotide or lanreotide (SS-LAR); OR

        -  Arm Lu-PRRT: Lu-PRRT (at 3.7Gbq per cycle x 7 cycles) followed by SS-LAR. The primary
           objective is to evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) in the two arms.

      The secondary objectives are: i) the efficacy (disease control rate, DCR), ii) acute and late
      toxicity, and iii) overall survival (OS).

      The investigators plan to enroll 176 patients during a period of 36 months and a period of 36
      months of follow up
