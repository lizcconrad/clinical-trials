  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of a prognosis-guided vs standard medical therapy in the: 1) duration
      of hospital stay; 2) cost-effectiveness; 3) satisfaction and quality of life; 4) in-hospital
      and 30-day all-cause mortality; and 5) 30-day readmissions in normotensive patients with
      acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE).

      Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, single blind trial. Normotensive patients with
      acute symptomatic PE will be randomly assigned to follow a prognosis-guided treatment, or to
      receive usual care.

      Setting: Respiratory, Medicine and Emergency Departments in 15 Spanish hospitals.

      Analyses: Data for the primary and secondary end points will be analyzed according to the
      intention-to -treat principle. The intention-to-treat analysis will include all randomly
      assigned patients. For the efficacy end points, investigators will use the Mann-Whitney U
      test. We will also use competing risk regression models according to Fine and Gray. For the
      safety end points, comparisons will be made with the use of the chi-square test. Separate
      analyses will be done in key prespecified subgroups of patients, according to age and
      hospital size.
