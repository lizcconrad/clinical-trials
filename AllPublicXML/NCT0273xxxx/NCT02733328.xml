  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to recruit 156 (54 Acute Kidney Injury (AKI);102 non-AKI) patients undergoing
      Cardio pulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, including those with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and
      multiple co-morbidities. Urine and blood samples collected pre-operatively and then 0, 3, 6
      and 18 hours post-CPB will be stored at -80oC until batch analysed for NGAL using the Abbott
      and BioPorto assays. AKI - defined as a ≥50% rise in serum creatinine (SCr) over baseline, or
      the requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT). SCr will be measured pre-operatively
      (baseline), then 12 hourly for the first 48 hrs post-CPB and thereafter 24 hourly for 5 days.
      Clinical data collected will include patient demographics, co-morbidities, drug history,
      pre-operative renal function, surgery details (type, length, CPB time etc.), length of
      Intensive treatment unit and hospital stay and post-operative complications. Data will then
      be analysed comparing the two NGAL tests to find out which is superior, whether it is better
      to use blood or urine and to define optimal NGAL cut-offs and sample timing for predicting
      AKI. Both the Abbott and BioPorto assays will subject to a laboratory method evaluation prior
      to the analysis of any patient specimens in order to verify that their performance is
      acceptable and meets the manufacturer's claims. This will involve measuring the standard
      parameters used to assess laboratory assay performance e.g. imprecision (reproducibility),
      linearity, recovery and method comparison etc.
