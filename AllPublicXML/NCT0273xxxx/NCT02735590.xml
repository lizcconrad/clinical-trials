    <textblock>
      Effective tuberculosis (TB) control requires that people who progress from latent
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection (LTBI) to TB disease are identified and treated
      before they infect others. A prognostic correlate of risk (COR), based on messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression signatures, which prospectively discriminates between TB
      cases and healthy controls, has been constructed and validated. Based on published microarray
      case-control datasets, the COR has 87% diagnostic sensitivity and 97% specificity for
      prevalent TB disease; and in two nested case-control studies, 70% prognostic sensitivity and
      84% specificity for incident TB disease occurring within one year of sampling (HIV uninfected
      persons). Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the COR has not yet been tested in a
      prospective cohort.

      COR+ status is not directly associated with LTBI; and may, or may not, be amenable to
      preventive therapy. Although effective in the short-term, preventive therapy is not
      recommended for treatment of LTBI in HIV uninfected adults living in high TB burden
      countries, due to rapid loss of protection; and treatment burden. A 3-month, 12-dose,
      once-weekly preventive therapy regimen of high dose Isoniazid (INH) and Rifapentine (3HP) has
      been recommended as equivalent to 6 months of daily INH for treatment of LTBI in low TB
      burden countries by the World Health Organization (WHO).

      A 'screen &amp; treat' strategy, based on serial mass campaigns to provide targeted, short-course
      preventive therapy only to COR+ persons at highest risk of TB disease, may offer the solution
      for durable, community-wide protection in high TB burden countries. The efficacy of 3HP for
      prevention of incident TB disease in COR+ persons has not yet been tested in a clinical
      trial.

      Primary Aims

        1. Test whether preventive therapy (3HP) reduces the rate of incident TB disease, compared
           to standard of care (active surveillance), in COR+ persons.

        2. Test whether COR status differentiates persons with cumulative prevalent or incident TB
           disease from persons without TB disease.

      Secondary Aims

        1. Estimate whether COR status differentiates persons at high risk for incident TB disease
           from persons at low risk for incident TB disease

        2. Compare prognostic performance of the COR for incident TB disease with Interferon-gamma
           release assay (IGRA).
