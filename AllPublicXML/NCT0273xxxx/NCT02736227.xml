  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients who get a liver transplant must take immunosuppressants for the rest of their
      lives. However, this has occurred at the expense of chronic CNI toxicity, e.g. chronic kidney
      disease (CKD), metabolic complications, infections and malignancy. Everolimus (EVL) is a drug
      that may stabilize or improve kidney function for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      that has been caused by immunosuppressants. EVL is used for standard of care treatment to
      prevent transplant liver rejection in combination with other immunosuppressants, such as
      tacrolimus. The overall aim of this study is to examine a combination of two different
      immunosuppressants and EVL to determine if patients may have stabilized and/or improved
      kidney function without liver rejection. This study will look at how safe it is to slowly
      withdraw one anti-rejection medication while continuing to take the other medicine, and
      whether this can be done without liver rejection occurrence.

    <description>During the first month post-transplant, the subject receives everolimus (about 5-8 ng/mL) and tacrolimus with or without mycophenolic acid as part of standard of care procedures. At one month post-transplant, mycophenolic acid will be stopped and tacrolimus dosage will be reduced while continuing the dosage of everolimus. At three months post-transplant, tacrolimus dosage will be reduced by 50% of the daily dose each week. At four months post-transplant, tacrolimus will be discontinued.</description>
