    <textblock>
      This study is to build a Xinjiang people registry and surveillance system for acute
      myocardial infarction(AMI) in2012-2015years to obtain real-world information about patient's
      basic information, patient characteristics, diagnostic test mode, the program of treatment
      and hospitalization outcomes including mortality, treatment complications, the cost of
      hospitalization and follow-up terminal events (death, major adverse cardiac events, minor
      adverse cardiovascular events)of xinjiang AMI patients; And to propose scientific precaution
      strategies aimed to prevent effectively from the incidence of AMI; And to optimize the
      management and outcomes of AMI patients through implementation of guideline recommendations
      in clinical practice, and analysis and development of effective treatment strategies; And to
      create cost-effective assessment system.

      The aim of the study is to establish the platform for surveillance, clinical research and
      translational medicine in Xinjiang , designed to provide a foundation for future quality
      improvement and research as well as facilitate efforts to improve the quality of AMI patient
      care , translate research into improved care for patients and thus decrease morbidity and
      mortality associated with AMI.
