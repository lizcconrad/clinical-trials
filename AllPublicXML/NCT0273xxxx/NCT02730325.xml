      The effects of serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) will be evaluated
      and compared to matching placebo in two distinct patient populations:

      I. Hospitalized ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who tested positive for Clostridium
      difficile (C. difficile) at time of admission and are receiving vancomycin.

      II. Hospitalized UC patients who tested negative for C. difficile at time of admission.

      The effects of serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) will be evaluated
      and compared to matching placebo in two distinct patient populations:

      I. Hospitalized ulcerative colitis (UC) patients who tested positive for Clostridium
      difficile (C. difficile) at time of admission and are receiving vancomycin.

      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the effect of SBI on time (# of days) to resolution of diarrhea, defined as a
      consecutive 24 hour period with only formed bowel movements (Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) ≤ 4)
      in this patient population

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the ability of SBI to decrease the incidence of recurrent C. difficile
           infection (CDI) following successful treatment with vancomycin.

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on UC status

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on nutritional status

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SBI

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on subjects' quality of life (QOL)

        -  To investigate the effect of SBI in fecal microbiome

        -  To evaluate the length of hospitalization (time of hospitalization to time of discharge)

      II. Hospitalized UC patients who tested negative for C. difficile at time of admission.

      Primary Objective:

      • To evaluate the effect of SBI on time (# of days) to resolution of diarrhea, defined as a
      consecutive 24 hour period with only formed bowel movements (Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) ≤ 4)
      in this patient population

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI in decreasing the incidence of CDI

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on UC status

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on nutritional status

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SBI

        -  To evaluate the effect of SBI on subjects' QOL

        -  To investigate the effect of SBI in fecal microbiome

        -  To evaluate the length of hospitalization (time of hospitalization to time of discharge)

             Investigator.

          -  Eligible subjects will be assigned to one of two different and independent patient
             groups based on C. difficile status as determined by clinical symptoms with diarrhea
             and laboratory tests: either a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or glutamate
             dehydrogenase (GDH) screening test used in two- or three-step algorithm with
             subsequent toxin A and B EIA testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with history of constipation within a week of the screening visit; or any
             serious hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, neurological or hematological disorder in the
             opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Subjects with history of drug or alcohol abuse, history of psychiatric disorders,
             known allergy or hypersensitivity to beef or any component of SBI.

          -  Subjects with a history of antibiotic treatment within the 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Subjects using anti-diarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide and bismuth
             subsalicylate).

               -  Note: anti-diarrheal medications will be prohibited throughout the study.

          -  Subjects who have been admitted to the hospital more than 48 hours prior to
