    <textblock>
      The study assesses patients with cured pulmonary tuberculosis by compulsory notification data
      of Uberlândia (Minas Gerais state - Brazil) from 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. These patients
      will be invited by telephonic contact. After eligibility and exclusion criteria evaluation,
      those included will be assessed in order to know structural and functional repercussions of
      pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae.

      This study evaluates structural and functional repercussions of pulmonary tuberculosis
      sequelae by chest imaging (computed tomography and radiograph), functional respiratory tests
      (spirometry and six minute walking test) in patients with cured pulmonary tuberculosis.

    <description>High resolution computed tomography of the lungs will be evaluated by radiologists and the extent of pulmonary abnormalities will be score subjectively.
Spirometry will permit assessment of lung volumes: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).</description>
