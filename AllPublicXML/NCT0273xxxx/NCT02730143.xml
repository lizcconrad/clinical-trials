      Prospective interventional trial in lowlanders evaluating the effect of acute exposure,
      acclimatization and re-exposure of high altitude on nocturnal breathing pattern.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory polygraphies will be performed in Santiago de Chile, 520 m, over the course of 3
      days. Participants will then travel by commercial airline (5 h flight) and by bus (3 h ride)
      to the ALMA base camp located at 2900 m near San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile.
      Participants will stay there for the next 7 nights and respiratory polygraphies will be
      performed on night 1 and 6. They will be spend the days (6-8 h daily) at the telescope
      station at 5050 m while undergoing physiological testing. Daily transports from 2900 to 5050
      m will be by car (1 h ride, one way). After the first 8 day altitude sojourn participants
      will return to the Santiago area (520 m) for a 6 day recovery period.

      A second altitude sojourn with an identical schedule as the one described above and a final
      low altitude stay of 3 days will follow.
