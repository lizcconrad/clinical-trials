  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to allow the investigation of local field potential
      (LFP) signals in patients treated with DBS of the STN. This study will identify common LFP
      biomarkers observed as a function of disease symptoms, medication effect, fluctuations in
      disease, and changes resulting from adjustments from current standard practices of DBS
      programming. The data collected and LFP markers identified will serve as guidelines for
      future stimulation predicted programming.

      The goals of this study are to evaluate local field potentials (LFP) and associated beta,
      gamma and other band oscillations and their correlation with disease pathophysiology and
      clinical status of the patients, and to potentially determine a more objective biomarker of
      response to deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment. This study aims to find evidence that
      changes in the power and coherence of the beta and gamma bands can be consistently linked to
      DBS adjustment and associated clinical effects. This approach can be of significant potential
      benefit to provide a foundation for closed loop DBS therapy in patients with continuous DBS
      adjustments.

      This study will use a novel bi-directional neural interface system that can chronically and
      simultaneously record, sense, process and telemeter LFP signals from DBS electrode (Rouse et
      al. 2011) to study the stability and subsequent change to LFP linked to the clinical state
      relevant to the present disorder, and DBS stimulation at rest and during motor and cognitive
      tasks. This investigation will be conducted at the Ohio State University.

    <description>The study aims at testing a slightly modified device (battery) that is similar to the approved system that has the potential of offering future patients a closed loop system with automatic adjustments of stimulation. The purpose of this clinical study is to allow the investigation of local field potential (LFP) signals in patients treated with DBS of the STN. This study will identify common LFP biomarkers observed as a function of disease symptoms, medication effect, fluctuations in disease, and changes resulting from adjustments from current standard practices of DBS programming.</description>

    <intervention_name>Activa PC+S</intervention_name>
    <description>The Activa PC+S is a newly developed Medtronic DBS implantable system and is available for use in clinical research. This system has a mechanism for both sensing of LFP and the ability to provide deep brain stimulation therapy. The sensing capabilities are controllable with data management using a clinician sensing tablet programmer that has a USB extension allowing for telemetry to an encrypted, locked computer.</description>
