      The primary purpose of this investigation is to report the short-term clinical outcomes of
      patellofemoral arthroplasty implanted using the MAKOplasty knee resurfacing system.

      The secondary purpose is to compare the short-term outcomes, complication rates, and survival
      rates of this operation to those of our historical controls of patients who underwent either
      osteochondral autograft transfer or autologous chondrocyte implantation for full-thickness
      patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions. The investigators believe these data will provide
      strong evidence to improve the selection criteria for patellofemoral arthroplasty.

      All patients will complete validated questionnaires from the Cincinnati Knee Rating System,
      including the Sports Activity and Function Form, the Occupational Rating Form, and the
      Symptom Rating Form. Patients will also complete the SF-12 general health questionnaire. In
      addition to the above mentioned rating systems, patients will also complete questionnaires on
      post-surgical expectations and general fitness level.

          -  Arthroscopically demonstrated full-thickness articular cartilage lesions (Grade 2B or
             3A-B) in the other compartments of the knee.

          -  Uncorrected varus or valgus malalignment

          -  Uncorrected knee joint instability
