  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to explore the sequential therapeutic effect of
      CD19-targeted and CD20-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T(CAR-T) cells in the treatment of
      Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anti-CD20 antibody has been broadly used in the treatment of B cell malignancies and
      exhibited good clinical outcomes. The CD19-targeted CAR-T has shown excellent therapeutic
      efficiency in B cell malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. However, patients
      treated with CD19-targeted CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 mutation. Therefore we attempt to
      treat Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL) patients by sequential therapy of the 2 targets
      and hope to combine their advantages.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. CD19-expressing and CD20-expressing Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma(DLBCL) must be
             assured and must be relapsed or refractory disease after at least one standard
             chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. According to current traditional therapies,
             there must be no available alternative curative therapies and subjects must be either
             ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT, or have
             disease activity that prohibits SCT at this time.

          2. Patients enrolled must have an evaluated score above 60 with KPS.

          3. Expected survival time of patients enrolled is over 3 months.

          4. Gender is not limited, age from 14 years to 75 years.

          5. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease at the time of enrollment, which
             may include any evidence of disease including minimal residual disease detected by
             flow cytometry, cytogenetics, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.

          6. Patients are expected to survive for more than 3 months by their physicians at the
             time of enrollment.

          7. Adequate absolute CD3 count estimated need to be assured for obtaining target cell
             dose based on dosage cohorts.

          8. Subjects with the following CNS status are eligible only in the absence of neurologic
             symptoms suggestive of CNS leukemia, such as cranial nerve palsy: CNS 1, defined as
             absence of blasts in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) on cytospin preparation, regardless
             of the number of WBCs; CNS 2, defined as presence of &lt; 5/uL WBCs in CSF and cytospin
             positive for blasts, or &gt; 5/uL WBCs but negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm CNS3
             with marrow disease who has failed salvage systemic and intensive IT chemotherapy (and
             therefore not eligible for radiation)

          9. Patients with isolated CNS relapse will be eligible if they have previously been
             treated with cranial radiation (at least 1800 cGy).

         10. Ability to give informed consent.

         11. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects on the fetus.

         12. Cardiac function: Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40% by
             MUGA or cardiac MRI, or fractional shortening greater than or equal to 28% by ECHO or
