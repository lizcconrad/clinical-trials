  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Andago V2.0 is a recently developed overground gait and balance training device. Many
      patients in neurorehabilitation suffer from gait disorders, most typically after stroke.
      Since pharmacological therapies are basically not available, neurorehabilitation plays an
      important role in the treatment of such patients. The Andago V2.0 may represent a useful
      device in the rehabilitation of stroke and other neurological patients featuring a severe
      gait disorder. Therefore a study has been designed to investigate the usability of the Andago
      V2.0 in the setting of a neurorehabilitation clinic. The primary outcomes of this study are
      the usability and acceptance of the investigational medical device (IMD). Usability is mainly
      measured by the time spent for the set-up and release of the participant, achieved training
      times and distances, the number of stumbles, collisions and emergency stops and the error
      messages during the session. Besides patient and therapist satisfaction with the Andago V2.0
      is recorded.

    <description>The Andago V2.0 is tested in 2 sessions, the first being a training session to define the probably optimal settings for the subsequent therapy session. In the therapy session the participant performs a specific parcours. Usually this parcours can be done within 10 minutes. However, the session is stopped as soon as the patient feels too exhausted or becomes too weary.</description>

             craniotomies, osteopenia, osteoporosis or symptoms or indices in the patient history
             that infer a higher risk of bone density reduction)

          -  Unstable arthroplasty

          -  Uncontrolled knee or ankle instability that would still pose a danger despite the Body
             Weight Support (BWS) (especially lateral instability)
