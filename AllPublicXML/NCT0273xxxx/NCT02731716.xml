    <textblock>
      To design an innovative payment system that improves upon fee-for-service (FFS), incorporates
      behavioral economic principles, and improves work satisfaction among primary care physicians
      (PCPs) while improving quality and reducing health spending at the state level. Second, to
      test the incremental effectiveness of two additional interventions: (1) shared financial
      incentives between physicians and poorly controlled diabetes and (2) social comparisons
      ranking physicians on quality metric performance and total cost of care.

      The goal of this project is to transform the Hawaii Medical Services Association (HMSA)
      primary care provider payment model to better incentive population health while bending the
      increasing trend of health spending in the state. Primary care and overall spending patterns
      will be studied to lay the foundation for a more rationally designed model. This model
      deliberately shifts away from FFS and includes three components: 1) a risk-adjusted
      per-member, per-month (PMPM) base payment, 2) an enhanced quality incentive program with
      larger bonus amounts and 3) a total cost of care incentive at the PO level. The aim is to
      build on the success of the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC) program implemented by BCBS of
      Massachusetts. While the AQC is used as a starting point, the study introduces and tests a
      number of innovations using concepts from behavioral economics. First, the move away from the
      FFS chassis to a PMPM-based capitated payment. Second, 20% of the PMPM payment is at-risk
      based on metrics designed to increase engagement between HMSA and physicians and engagement
      with performance feedback. Third, the number of metrics in the quality incentive program is
      drastically reduced from over 60 metrics to 10-12 per specialty. Fourth, the scoring of
      quality incentives incorporates rewards for improvement, rather than exclusively attainment
      of thresholds, to activate physicians along the entire performance distribution. In addition
      to implementing the new payment model, the initial experiment will include a test of two
      additional behavioral concepts: social comparisons for physicians and a shared incentive for
      physicians and poorly controlled diabetics tied to improve glycemic control.

Providers will also receive weekly emails that will show comparisons of their own performance against their peers within the same provider organization on specific quality measures and total cost of care. There is also a shared incentive between the member and the provider. The member incentive will be a payment made to diabetic patients with an A1C of greater than or equal to 9% who experience a reduction of at least 0.5%. Each participating member and PCP can receive up to $75 per quarter for A1C reduction.</description>
