  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of patients undergoing structural heart disease procedures that utilize
      TEE and fluoroscopic guidance at the New York University (NYU) Langone Medical Center.
      Patients in this study will undergo their procedure utilizing the TEE/Angio fusion software
      prototype. This protocol is primarily intended to ascertain the potential utility of the
      software prototype in the study population and to provide data and feedback to improve the
      workflow and algorithms of the prototype. As such, a primary outcome variable and statistical
      analysis plan have not been identified. However, procedural time, measures of radiation
      exposure (dose area product, total radiation dose, fluoroscopy time), degree of residual
      valvular regurgitation or paravalvular regurgitation as applicable, and complications will be
      recorded.

      This study is for patients planned to undergo a transcatheter-based structural heart disease
      procedure that utilizes TEE and fluoroscopic guidance at the NYU Langone Medical Center. It
      will evaluate the utility and workflow of the transesophageal echocardiography/angiography
      (TEE/Angio) fusion software prototype to provide visualization of anatomic landmarks and
      guidance during structural heart disease procedures.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate software (TEE/Angio fusion) that merges images from
      two standard procedures (ultrasound and x-ray) used to look at the heart during a procedure
      for structural heart disease. Typically, these 2-dimensional images are viewed separately,
      requiring the operator to mentally merge the two images together while deciding if he/she is
      in the correct location for the treatment strategy. TEE/Angio fusion is designed to make a
      single 3-dimensional image of the heart in real-time.

    <description>The TEE probe will be inserted into the patient's esophagus, after anesthetic induction or conscious sedation is administered, and removed after the completion of the procedure. Once the TEE probe is placed, the interventional cardiologist will acquire 2 fluoroscopic images with the TEE probe. These images will be used to co-register the ultrasound and fluoroscopy systems. As part of routine care, TEE and fluoroscopy images will be acquired throughout the procedure for clinical purposes. As new fluoroscopy images are acquired, the prototype software will automatically track the location of the TEE probe. When the echocardiographer has an image of a cardiac structure of interest, he may use the prototype software to place landmarks.
The echocardiographer may then press a button to have the landmarks displayed on the fluoroscopy image that is only visible on an assist monitor and will not interfere with the standard fluoroscopy imaging monitor.</description>
