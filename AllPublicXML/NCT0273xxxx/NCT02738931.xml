  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) are indicated in combination with other
      antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      infection. Fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets of existing approved drugs are preferred by
      many patients and offer the potential for increased patient adherence and consequently a
      reduced likelihood of virological failure and viral resistance.

      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of two
      experimental FDC tablets of DTG and 3TC relative to co-administration of the single entity
      products in healthy adult subjects.

      This study will be conducted as a randomized, open label three-way, crossover design with 6
      treatment sequences in approximately 30 subjects. Each subject will have a screening visit
      within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, three treatment periods each with a
      single dose of study drug and a follow-up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose of study
      drug. There will be at least 7 days washout between dosing periods. The total duration of
      participation of a subject in this study will be approximately 9 weeks.

          -  Between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac evaluation (history, electrocardiogram [ECG]).

          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the investigator in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor if required agree and document that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kilogram (kg) (110 pounds [lbs.)] for men and &gt;= 45 kg (99 lbs) for
             women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/meter square (m^2)
             (inclusive)

          -  Male or Female

        Female subject of non-reproductive potential: is eligible to participate if she is not
        pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [hCG]
        test), not lactating, and at least one of the following conditions applies:

          -  Non-reproductive potential defined as: Pre-menopausal females with one of the
             following: Documented tubal ligation, Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion
             procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, Hysterectomy,
             Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy

             levels). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is
             in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt;60 mL/minute (min)
