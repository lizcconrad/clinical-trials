  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded superiority treatment
      study to compare placebo to once daily doses of 6mg auranofin for adults with amebiasis or
      giardiasis. A sample size of 68 subjects enrolled with amebiasis (34 per arm) and 68 with
      giardiasis (34 per arm); Power based on 60 subjects with amebiasis and 60 with giardiasis
      completing the study. Primary objectives are 1) to compare the proportion of subjects with
      stools positive by rapid EIA and positive antigen detection EIA for E. histolytica at
      enrollment with resolution of diarrhea (less than 3 loose stools/24 hrs) by Day 7 for E.
      histolytica infections and 2) to compare the proportion of subjects with stools positive by
      rapid EIA and positive antigen detection EIA for Giardia at enrollment with resolution of
      diarrhea (less than 3 loose stools/24 hrs) by Day 5 for Giardia infections. The length of
      this study is set for 3.5 years; subject participation is 7 days treatment (amebiasis) and 5
      days (giardiasis) with follow-up until day 28

      stools positive by rapid EIA and positive antigen detection EIA for E. histolytica and
      trophozoites on smear at enrollment with parasitological response (no detection of
      trophozoites of E. histolytica on microscopic exam by Day 7) 2) to compare the proportion of
      subjects with stools positive rapid EIA and positive antigen detection EIA for E. histolytica
      and trophozoites on smear at enrollment with parasitological response (no detection of
      trophozoites on microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) by Days 3 and 5, 3) to
      compare the rate of decrease of trophozoites/cyst load by qPCR in stools by Days 3, 5, and 7,
      4) to compare the proportion of subjects with negative stool antigen tests by days 3, 5, 7,
      and 14, 5) to compare the proportion of subjects with sustained cure (no detection of cysts
      or trophozoites by microscopic exam or negative antigen detection) at 14 and 28 days, and 6)
      to compare the proportion of subjects with relapse (same strain) or re-infection (new strain)
      with positive stools at 14 and 28 days by genotyping the initial vs. subsequent strain.
      Secondary objectives for Giardia infections are 1) to compare the proportion of subjects with
      parasitological response (no detection of trophozoites on microscopic exam ) on Day 3, and 5
      2) to compare the rate of decrease of trophozoites/cyst load by qPCR in stools by Days 3 and

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures. 2. Able to
        understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all study visits.
        3. Male or non-pregnant non-lactating females 18-65 years of age, inclusive. Females of
        reproductive potential currently using effective contraceptive methods are eligible. 4.
        Amebiasis or giardiasis identified by rapid EIA and positive antigen detection EIA of
        stool* . *Note: if a subject is infected with both E. histolytica and Giardia, they will be
        enrolled in the E. histolytica study arm. Once the Entamoeba study arm is fully enrolled,
        any subsequent dual infected subjects will be enrolled in the Giardia arm. If a subject is
        infected with both Giardia and Cryptosporidium, they will not be enrolled. 5. Has diarrhea
        (defined as three or more loose stools) in the past 24 hrs, but is assessed to be
        clinically stable and in otherwise good health *Note: as determined by medical history and
        targeted physical examination, if indicated based on medical history, to evaluate acute or
        currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions that would affect the assessment
        of eligibility and safety of subjects. Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except
        those in the Subject Exclusion Criteria) must be deemed as stable chronic medical
        conditions. A stable chronic medical condition is defined as no change in prescription
        medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3 months (90 days) and health
        outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last
        6 months (180 days). Any change due to change of health care provider, insurance company,
        or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not
        be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription
        medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal
        investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this
        inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the
        opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no
        additional risk to subject safety. Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications, vitamins, and
        contraceptives are permitted. 6. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure)
        are all within normal protocol-defined ranges. 7. Laboratory tests (blood urea nitrogen,
        creatinine, AST, ALT, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin) are all within
        protocol-defined ranges. Subjects will be eligible for enrollment with the following
        laboratory values: blood urea nitrogen less than or equal to 30 mg/dL, creatinine less than
        or equal to 133 umol/L, AST or ALT less than or equal to 60.0 U/L, white cell count between
        3.5 and 13.0 inclusive (10^9/L), platelets between 131 and 550 (10^9/L), hemoglobin between
        11.0 and 18.0 gm/dL inclusive 8. Urinalysis with no greater than trace protein. If a high
        protein is confirmed to be due to menstruation, it should be repeated. 9. Women of
        reproductive potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of
        starting study medications. *Note: Female subjects who are surgically sterile via tubal
        sterilization, bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy who have been postmenopausal for
        greater than 1 year are not considered to be of reproductive potential. 10. Female subjects
        participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy must be using and continue to
        use highly effective contraception for a total of 4 months after enrollment. *Note: Highly
        effective methods of contraception are defined as having low failure rates (i.e. less than
        1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and may include, but are not limited to,
        abstinence from intercourse, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, male
        condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed
        hormonal methods. Females on effective forms of birth control will continue while on the
        study and for the follow-up period of 4 months total. The method and compliance of birth
        control used will be confirmed and documented at all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Known intolerance of auranofin or gold compounds. 2. Pregnant or breastfeeding women or
        women of reproductive potential not using effective contraception or who plan to become
        pregnant or breastfeed at any given time during the study or within 3 months of study
        completion. 3. Current use of systemic antibiotics or metronidazole. 4. Has any condition
        that would, in the opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable
        risk of injury or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol. 5.
        Concurrent participation in other investigational protocols or receipt of an
        investigational product within the previous 30 days. 6. History of alcohol or drug abuse
        within the last five years.
