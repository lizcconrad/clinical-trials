  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 260 subjects presenting with skin laxity on the face and neck will be randomized to one
      of two treatment groups. Subjects meeting all entrance criteria will receive study treatment,
      then complete two post treatment phone contacts and follow-up study visits at 90, 180 and 365
      days post treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment,
      and at each follow-up visit for qualitative and quantitative assessments of efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double blinded, multi-center, parallel arm,
      non-inferiority, pivotal clinical trial to demonstrate that the safety and efficacy of a new
      transducer which delivers two simultaneous lines of treatment at the same treatment depth is
      not inferior to a standard transducer to improve jawline definition and submental skin
      laxity.

      Changes from baseline in quantitative measures of neck and submental lift will be assessed at
      study follow-up visits. Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores, Merz Jawline Grading Scale
      scores, 3D volumetric changes from baseline to post treatment, patient satisfaction and
      patient-reported improvement will be obtained.
