  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of three novel motivational
      approaches to weight loss with 18-25 year olds. Participants will be 18-25 year olds with a
      BMI of 25-45 kg/m2, randomized to: 1) Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL), 2) BWL + Autonomous
      Motivation (BWL+Aut) or 3) BWL + Extrinsic Motivation (BWL+Ext). All arms will receive a
      6-month behavioral weight loss intervention, followed by a 6-month no-treatment follow up
      period.

    <textblock>
      A 3-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted, the goal of which is to determine
      which group represents the most viable approach to behavioral weight loss treatment with
      18-25 year olds. A total of 381 participants,18-25 years of age, with a BMI between 25 and 45
      kg/m2 will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL), 2) BWL +
      Autonomous Motivation (BWL+Aut) or 3) BWL + Extrinsic Motivation (BWL+Ext). All arms will
      receive a 24-week behavioral weight loss intervention, including personalized dietary,
      physical activity, and weight loss prescriptions. In addition, all arms will be followed for
      a 6 month no treatment follow-up period. Assessments of weight and secondary outcomes will
      occur in 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. The investigators will compare treatment effects, across all
      3 arms at 6 months, and compare arms on weight loss maintenance at12 months. The
      investigators will also examine mediators of treatment outcomes consistent with the
      investigators theoretical framework.

             (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension). The investigators will refer individuals who have
             blood pressure levels &gt;140 / 90 mmHg as part of baseline screening to their physician
             and exclude them from this study unless their treating physician determines s/he is a
             suitable candidate based on the specifics of the protocol and provides written medical
             consent for participation. Participants who report a history of or current treatment
             for medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) will be asked to obtain MD
             consent to participate.

          -  Other health problems or medications which may influence the ability to walk for
             physical activity or be associated with unintentional weight change, including cancer
             treatment within the past 5 years or tuberculosis.

          -  Report a heart condition, chest pain during periods of activity or rest, or loss of
             consciousness on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q), which will be

             or lost &gt; 5% of body weight during the past 3 months.

          -  Failure to complete the screening appointments.
