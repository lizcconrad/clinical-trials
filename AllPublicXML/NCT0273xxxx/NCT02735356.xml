  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 0 trial studies how well itraconazole gel works in treating patients with basal
      cell cancer. Itraconazole gel may help to treat basal cell tumors in patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if 12 weeks of topical itraconazole gel reduces basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
      biomarkers (Gli1, the target gene of the Hedgehog pathway).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if topical itraconazole gel will decrease BCC size.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply itraconazole topically twice daily (BID) and placebo topically BID for 12
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 14 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must sign and date all informed consent statements; children will sign the
             assent form and their guardian will sign the consent form

          -  The subject must be willing to apply the medications twice daily for 1 month

          -  The subjects must have at least four BCCs in non-cosmetically sensitive sites

          -  For women of child-bearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test

          -  Women of child-bearing potential are expected to use an effective method of birth
             control to prevent exposing a fetus to potentially dangerous agent with unknown risk

          -  For male patients with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use
             adequate contraception while you are participating in the study and 1 month after
             applying your last dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  History of congestive heart failure or other findings of ventricular dysfunction

          -  History of current evidence of malabsorption or liver disease

          -  Current immunosuppression or taking immunosuppressive drugs

          -  Taking oral itraconazole

          -  Taking any medication known to affect hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway

          -  The subject has used topical or systemic therapies that might interfere with the
             evaluation of the study medication during the study; specifically these include the
             topical use to the study tumors of: glucocorticoids (ii) retinoids (e.g., etretinate,
             isotretinoin, tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene) systemically or topically (iii)
             alpha-hydroxy acids (e.g., glycolic acid, lactic acid) to more than 5% of the skin
             during the six months prior to study entry (iv) 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod; also -
             treatment with systemic chemotherapy or agents known to be inhibitors of HH signaling
             within 60 days to starting study medication
