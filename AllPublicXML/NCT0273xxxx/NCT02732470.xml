  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is chronic and systemic autoimmune disease that mainly
      affecting women and leading to organ damages especially skin, joints, kidneys, central
      nervous system and heart. In SLE, immune system dysfunction leads to autoantibodies,
      autoreactive T cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. These elements will initiate
      and maintain organ damages. Patients with SLE have disease flares followed by period of
      remission. Flares can occur because of stress, infections, surgery, pregnancy or ultraviolet
      exposition. Furthermore the chronic nature of SLE is an important factor of depression in
      these patients.

      Qi Gong is an ancient Chinese practice based on relaxation movements, posture and breathing
      in order to harmonize the body and mind. This practice improves the general state by reducing
      fatigue and improving sleep. The beneficial effect of Qi Gong in medicine has been studied in
      several diseases including cancer, diabetes, arterial hypertension and fibromyalgia. Qi Gong
      seems interesting in depressed patients but also to reduce stress in healthy subjects.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Qi Gong on quality if life in patients
      with SLE. Patients will have two lessons of 60 minutes per week for three months and a
      collective lesson of 90 minutes per week for three months. The teacher of Qi-Gong will
      evaluate adherence to the practice of Qi Gong every week. Clinical and biological data will
      be collected at baseline and at 2th, 4th, 6th, 9th and 12th month. Different evaluation
      scores and neurotrophin levels will be collected at baseline and at 6th month.
