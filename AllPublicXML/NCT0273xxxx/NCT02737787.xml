  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of an investigational WT1
      vaccine and another drug called nivolumab. This is the first time that the WT1 vaccine and
      nivolumab are being used in combination.

    <description>The first 3 patients will be observed for 30 days before enrolling the next 7 patients. Accrual will continue as patients become available after the first 3 patients are observed for 30 days. If &gt;2/10 DLTs are observed then the study combination will not be considered safe.</description>

    <description>Patients will initially receive 6 vaccinations over 12 weeks and 7 infusions of nivolumab over 14 weeks. Toxicity assessments will be performed with each dose of vaccine, and 3 weeks after the completion of therapy at week 15. Patients who do not have disease progression at the week 15 evaluation are permitted to receive 4 additional vaccines administered approximately every 8 weeks. This maintenance vaccine course would begin at week 19.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer confirmed
             by pathology review at MSK.

          -  Patients will have relapsed at least once and returned to complete clinical remission
             after additional chemotherapy. Interval surgery is permitted.

          -  Complete clinical remission is defined as CA-125 within normal limits, examination and
             CT or MRI without objective evidence of disease (non specific abnormalities are
             permitted on radiologic imaging).

          -  Patients may sign screening consent during recurrence or at time of remission if they
             can start vaccine therapy within 4 months of completing chemotherapy.

          -  Testing of patient's archived (paraffin embedded, unstained slides) or freshly
             biopsied tumor nodules must be positive for WT1 protein expression. WT1 expression:
             Immunohistochemical analysis will be performed using the technique described by Dupont
             et al [58]. WT1 expression will be graded according to an adaptation of the German
             Immunoreactive Score (IRS). Only tumors with moderate to strong IRS scores (4-12) will
             be considered WT1 positive.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%

          -  Hematologic parameters: Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mcL, Platelets &gt; 50 K/mcL.

          -  Biochemical parameters: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl, AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limits
             of normal, Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl.

          -  Patient of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             study entry and must be practicing and effective form of birth control

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Patients with active infection requiring systemic antibiotics, antiviral, or
             antifungal treatments

          -  Patients with a serious unstable medical illness or another active cancer.

          -  Patients with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids
             (&gt;10mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses &gt;10mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease.

          -  Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus acute or chronic
             infection.

          -  Patients with active known or suspected autoimmune disease (treated hypothyroidism is
             permitted to enroll)

          -  Patients with active interstitial pneumonitis.
