      The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effects of the use of manual therapy and
      diadynamic in muscle trigger points in the upper trapezius muscle in individuals diagnosed
      with shoulder impingement syndrome, unilateral shoulder as functional capacity, pain
      intensity and pain threshold the pressure.
