    <textblock>
      The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a relatively simple and
      short value-based emotion-focused educational programme in adults with type 2 diabetes
      (VEMOFIT) on diabetes-related distress, depressive symptoms, illness perception, medication
      adherence, quality of life, diabetes self-efficacy, self-care and clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients experience many psychosocial problems related to their
      diabetes, as well as social- and work-related relationships. These often lead to emotional
      disorders such as distress, stress, anxiety and depression. Without proper care, these
      patients use more often negative coping strategies and more frequently expect that their
      diabetes will negatively affect their future. A cluster randomised controlled trial will be
      conducted in 10 public health clinics (HC) in Malaysia. These clusters are eligible if they
      are providing standard diabetes care according to national clinical practice guidelines, not
      involved in similar trial and having nurses to be trained to deliver the VEMOFIT educational
      programmes. Pre-stratification by cluster size and geographic areas of the HCs will get
      randomised five HCs to the VEMOFIT group (VG) and attention-meetings group (AG),
      respectively.

    <description>The VEMOFIT intervention involves four biweekly two hours sessions over a period of about six weeks, and a booster at three months follow-up. It consists of a mixture of 1) exploring illness perceptions and personal meanings of diabetes, 2) cognition-focused education on diabetes and practical skills in self-management and 3) emotion-focused training on recognising emotions in the self and others. Each group will consist of 10 to 12 participants of equal representation by the patients and their significant others.</description>

    <description>Patients in the health clinics randomised to the AG, will receive the usual T2D care by the clinic doctors and education by the clinic paramedics based on the recommendations in the Malaysian clinical guidelines. At T1, T2 and T4, patients (not including their significant others) in AG will be gathered in groups of 10-12 people for the primary and secondary outcomes evaluation. This session will include general discussion on feeling about and coping with T2D, social support at home and satisfaction with treatment and care received at the respective clinics.</description>
