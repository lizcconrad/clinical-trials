  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is the leading reason for ICU admission in immunocompromised
      patients. Usual oxygen therapy involves administering low-to-medium oxygen flows through a
      nasal cannula or mask [with or without a bag and with or without the Venturi system] to
      achieve SpO2≥95%.

      Oxygen therapy may be combined with non-invasive ventilation [NIV] providing both
      end-expiratory positive pressure and pressure support. However, in a recent trial by our
      group, non-invasive ventialtion [NIV] was not superior over oxygen without NIV.

      High-flow nasal oxygen [HFNO] therapy is a focus of growing attention as an alternative to
      standard oxygen therapy. By providing warmed and humidified gas, HFNO allows the delivery of
      higher flow rates [of up to 60 L/min] via nasal cannula devices, with Fraction of inspired
      oxygen (FiO2) values of nearly 100%. Physiological benefits of HFNO consist of higher and
      constant FiO2 values, decreased work of breathing, nasopharyngeal washout leading to improved
      breathing-effort efficiency, and higher positive airway pressures associated with better lung
      recruitment.

      Clinical consequences of these physiological benefits include alleviation of dyspnoea and
      discomfort, decreases in tachypnoea and signs of respiratory distress, a diminished need for
      intubation in patients with severe hypoxemia, and decreased mortality in unselected patients
      with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure However, although preliminary data establish the
      feasibility and safety of this technique, HFNO has never been properly evaluated in
      immunocompromised patients.

      Thus, this project aims at demonstrating that HFNO is superior to low/medium-flow (standard)
      oxygen, minimising day-28 mortality

      After discussion at the investigator meeting and based on comments from the Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board on May 12, 2016, the DSMB has highlighted the need of the interim analysis
      (already planned) as benefits from high flow oxygen may be observed after 400 inclusions.

      Update on June 16, 2017:

      The number of patients enrolled is 488 and the inclusion rate is increasing steadily.

      The interim analysis has been performed as scheduled and the DSMB decided that nothing should
      be changed.
