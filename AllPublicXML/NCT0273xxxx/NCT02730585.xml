  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is difficult and despite important advances in medical
      sciences, detailed patient questioning and precise medical examination are the main keystones
      of the diagnosis of acute appendicitis and up to now, results still unsatisfactory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency and the most common source of
      community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. The lack of accuracy in the diagnosis of acute
      appendicitis yields often to two types of outcomes: a delay in diagnosis leads to perforation
      and peritonitis in up to 15% of the cases and unnecessary appendectomy is associated with
      post-operative complications such as wound infection and adhesions. CRP is an acute phase
      protein that is often used by many surgeons as a diagnostic marker of acute appendicitis.
      During the evaluation of patients with possible appendicitis in the emergency department
      (ED), repeated physical examination of the abdomen may provide further information about the
      decision making. However, the role of repeated laboratory examinations is not proven.

      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether repeated serum CRP measures could be
      useful to predict acute appendicitis, after 3 hours of observation, in comparison with the
      histopathological findings.

        All patients presenting to the Fattouma Bourguiba University hospital with an equivocal
        diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The clinical suspiscion of appendicitis was made based on
        anamnestic and physical examination findings.
