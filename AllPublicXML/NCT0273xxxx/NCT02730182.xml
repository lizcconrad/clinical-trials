      Prospective interventional trial in lowlanders evaluating the effect of acute exposure,
      acclimatization and re-exposure to high altitude on postural control

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline measurements including the assessment of the center of pressure during 30s, the
      cerebral oxygen saturation and a sharpened Romberg test will be performed in Santiago de
      Chile, 520 m, over the course of 3 days. Participants will then travel by commercial airline
      (5 h flight) and by bus (3 h ride) to the base camp of the Atacama Large
      Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope station located at 2900 m near San Pedro de
      Atacama, northern Chile. Participants will stay there for the next 8 nights and they will be
      spend the days (6-8 h daily) at the telescope station at 5050 m while undergoing testing as
      described above at the first and the last day at 5050m. Daily transports from 2900 to 5050 m
      will be by car (1 h ride, one way). After the first 8 day altitude sojourn participants will
      return to the Santiago area (520 m) for a 6 day recovery period.

      A second altitude sojourn with an identical schedule as the one described above and a final
      low altitude stay of 3 days will follow.
