  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and test the feasibility of a new therapy called Compassion
      Focused Therapy (CFT) for psychosis. This therapy helps people with psychosis manage
      distressing experiences by building internal feelings of safeness and affiliation, and by
      providing contexts, practices and insights that facilitate the development of compassion to
      self and others. The focus is on helping people feel safe in relation to their experiences
      and their social worlds. CFT is a promising new approach that has been successfully provided
      for people with a range of mental health difficulties. It is also firmly based in the most
      up-to-date knowledge and science about how the mind works (both normally and under stress).

      9 participants will be recruited from NHS psychological therapies services for people with
      psychosis in South London and Maudsley (SLAM) NHS Foundation Trust. Following a short
      baseline period they will receive up to 26 weekly sessions (about 6 months) of CFT with a
      clinical psychologist, and will provide interview and questionnaire research data at five
      different points during the study. At these assessment points, data will be gathered on
      participants' experiences, mood, perceptions of their position in the social world, and heart
      rate variability.

      The initial therapy protocol has been developed by psychologists with expertise in CFT,
      alongside people with lived experience of hearing voices and having distressing beliefs.
      However, it will continue to be developed and evolve as the study progresses, and as more is
      learnt (e.g. from the service-user participants) about applying the model in this population.
      At the end of this study, the aim is to have all the information needed to run a randomised
      controlled trial of this therapy.
