    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of a 12-week proprioceptive training
      program on the neurofunctional control and the incidence of ankle sprains in fencing
      athletes. The study will be developed in six stages: familiarization, pre intervention,
      intervention, post intervention follow-up of three and six months. In the pre intervention
      stage will evaluate muscle strength inverters, everter, dorsal plantar flexors and ankle
      flexors through the isokinetic dynamometer; the reaction time of these muscles during Lunge
      Test; neuromuscular control during the Star Excursion Balance Test and performance in Drop
      Vertical Jump Test. In the intervention athletes will perform proprioceptive training for 12
      weeks, three times a week, lasting 30 minutes. In the post intervention, the follow up of
      three to six months will be held the same pre intervention of the tests and recording the
      incidence of injuries occurred during the study. The expected result at the end of the study
      is to improve all variables, increasing the performance of athletes and decreasing the
      incidence of ankle sprains.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fencing is an agility sport, with higher incidence of injuries in the lower limbs, with the
      ankle sprain the most prevalent. Injury prevention is very important to improve performance
      and reduce time off of athletes. Proprioceptive training programs can be added to the
      training of athletes, since in addition to the easy application and low cost, proprioception
      serves to stabilize the joint, preventing injuries. Therefore the aim of this study is to
      investigate the influence of a 12-week proprioceptive training program on the neurofunctional
      control and the incidence of ankle sprains in fencing athletes. The study will be a
      randomized clinical trial, with fencing athletes from 14 to 25, a multi-sport club of Porto
      Alegre/RS, and developed in six stages: familiarization, pre intervention, intervention, post
      intervention follow-up of three and six months. The first step will be to familiarize
      themselves with the force of testing and registration of injuries in the previous year. In
      the pre intervention stage will evaluate muscle strength inverters, everter, dorsal plantar
      flexors and ankle flexors through the isokinetic dynamometer; the reaction time of these
      muscles during Lunge Test; neuromuscular control during the Star Excursion Balance Test and
      performance in Drop Vertical Jump Test. In the intervention athletes will perform
      proprioceptive training for 12 weeks, three times a week, lasting 30 minutes. In the post
      intervention, the follow up of three to six months will be held the same pre intervention of
      the tests and recording the incidence of injuries occurred during the study. For statistical
      analysis, the data will be presented as mean and standard deviation and submitted to the
      Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA will be held for repeated measures and post hoc Bonferroni to
      determine differences. The effect size is calculated using Cohen's d test.o significance
      level is 0.05. The expected result at the end of the study is to improve all variables,
      increasing the performance of athletes and decreasing the incidence of ankle sprains.

    <description>The intervention will be the implementation of a proprioceptive training program for the fencing athletes in the intervention group.
In this study the training program will be developed for 12 weeks and will be applied during the heating of the athletes, three times a week and the duration of each session is 30 minutes. Each week will be chosen three of the 14 exercises adapted for fencing athletes, and preferably one of each category. The categories have exercises with different levels of difficulty and can change the exercises occur by different proposed levels or the complexity of the exercise by changing category. The training program will be implemented by the same evaluator over the 12 weeks.</description>
