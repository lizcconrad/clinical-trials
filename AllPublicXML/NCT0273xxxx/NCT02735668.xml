    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine whether the invasive physical therapy and
      motor control exercises of shoulder joint together are more effective than motor control
      exercises of shoulder joint and/or shoulder conventional exercises.

      Introduction: Studies suggest that a potential complication that today lacks sufficient study
      and analysis are the motor patterns disturbances in chronic shoulder pain which occurred
      after breast cancer treatment. This alteration, maintained permanently, may cause long-term
      pathologies more committed both locally (impigement subacromial, retractable capsulitis ...)
      as a more global level by means of the central nervous system. So appears the need to
      reconsider these issues and propose effective physical therapy programs to solve these
      dysfunctions.

      Subjects and methods: A randomized clinical trial, the examiner being blinded unaware of the
      intervention group to which subjects were assigned. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      three groups:

      An experimental group, where the participants will be treated with Invasive Physical Therapy
      and Motor Control Exercises;

      Another experimental group where will be realized Motor Control Exercises;

      And a third group where will be done Shoulder Conventional Exercises.

      Pre- intervention, immediate post-intervention, 3, 6 and 12 months assessments will be made.
      The selection criteria will be: Adult women with chronic shoulder pain presenting motor
      patterns disturbances after breast cancer treatment verified through electromyography (EMG).
      All participants must understand and sign freely Informed Consent.

      Sample size: 30 women for each group.

      Data Analysis: A descriptive analysis of all variables was performed. It establish for all
      cases a confidence level of 95% (p &lt;0.05). The effectiveness was assessed by comparing the
      experienced change of the three goups in outcome variables between physicaltherapy
      examinations.

    <measure>Active myofascial trigger points of the muscles involved in shoulder. Travell and Simon's Criteria were used.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Travell and Simon's Criteria consists in (Wolfe et al 1992):
The major criteria include:
A patient's regional pain complaint;
Palpation of a trigger point elicits a stereotypic zone of referred pain specific to that muscle;
Identification of a palpable taut band;
As well as a palpable, and exquisitely tender spot along the length of that taut band;
Some degree of restricted range of motion of the involved muscle.
Three minor criteria have been suggested to further aid in the diagnosis of myofascial pain syndrome:
Palpation of a trigger point should reproduce the clinical pain complaint;
A local twitch response may be elicited by transverse snapping or needling of the trigger point;
The alleviation of pain by trigger point inactivation.
