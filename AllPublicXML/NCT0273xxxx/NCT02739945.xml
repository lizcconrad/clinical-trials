      The investigators want to compare changes in CSA of the ulnar nerve at the elbow
      hypothesizing that US examination is a useful tool to detect unsuccessful release and
      defining which technique shows the best outcome in the first year postoperatively.

      The measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) as a diagnostic tool to detect entrapments
      syndrome in upper limbs has already been described. US typically demonstrates an abrupt
      narrowing and displacement of the nerve within the tunnel, possibly in association with a
      thickened retinaculum or a space-occupying lesions. Previous studies prospectively compared
      sonographic outcomes after decompression of the median nerve at the wrist.

    <description>Quantitative measurement of grip strength were assessed with a Jamar dynamometer. The Jamar Dynamometer is an instrument for measuring the maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. The Jamar dynamometer was introduced in 1954 (Bechtol,1954). It consists of a sealed hydraulic system with adjustable hand spacings that measures handgrip force</description>

    <description>Two-point discrimination is the ability to discern that two nearby objects touching the skin are truly two distinct points.
Two-point discrimination has long been used as an assessment tool for tactile gnosis, and to assess recovery after a peripheral nerve surgery.</description>

    <description>The ulnar nerve is decompressed proximally at the intramuscular septum, decompressed more distally through the cubital tunnel and then exposed between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. Care is taken to ensure that any point that might compress the ulnar nerve either proximally or distally is evaluated.</description>
