  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect information about a new treatment for severe
      aortic stenosis, which affects the aortic valve in the heart. Aortic stenosis is a narrowing
      of the aortic valve opening, which decreases blood flow from the heart and causes symptoms
      such as chest pain, fainting and shortness of breath. The preferred treatment for severe
      aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement surgery.

      This study will examine the use of a TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement), which is
      a minimally invasive procedure designed to replace the aortic valve inside the heart. The
      TAVR procedure is performed by a heart surgeon and/or an interventional cardiologist. This
      less invasive surgical approach called TAVR is offered to those patients who are high risk
      for undergoing open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve. In this study, TAVR will be
      performed using the JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System, which is intended to help treat severe
      aortic stenosis. The JenaValve replacement valve is placed inside the aortic valve by using
      the JenaValve delivery system. The JenaValve replacement valve may be implanted in one of two
      ways: (1) transapical - where the valve is implanted through the chest wall, and (2)
      transfemoral - where the valve is implanted through an artery in the groin. The choice of
      which implant method will be used is decided by the doctor. The choice of which approach is
      used is at the clinical discretion of the study physicians. The TAVR procedure typically
      takes 1-2 hours to complete. The JenaValve TAVR device, once implanted, is designed to remain
      permanently in place.
