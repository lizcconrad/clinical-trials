      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-group, non-randomised, observational study of the
      safety and biochemical disease control of Infacort® in neonates, infants and children with AI
      who have completed study Infacort 003. All subjects who have satisfactorily completed study
      Infacort 003 will be offered the opportunity to take part in Infacort 004.

      This is a Phase 3, open-label, single-group, non-randomised, observational study of the
      safety and biochemical disease control of Infacort® in neonates, infants and children with AI
      who have completed study Infacort 003 (EudraCT number 2014-002265-30). All subjects who have
      satisfactorily completed study Infacort 003 will be offered the opportunity to participate in
      study Infacort 004 at or after their final visit of study Infacort 003. Subjects will receive
      the usual clinically-appropriate dose (since bioequivalence has been demonstrated with
      conventional hydrocortisone), as determined by the Investigator, which will be administered
      according to usual clinical practice - generally 3 or 4 times a day. Subjects can continue to
      be treated in this study until they meet the study withdrawal criteria, Infacort® is granted
      a marketing authorisation (and so is available commercially, which is expected within 2 years
      of initiation of this study), Infacort® is refused a marketing authorisation, or the Sponsor
      decides to discontinue the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects successfully completing study Infacort 003, whose inclusion criteria were:

          1. Male and female children less than 6 years of age.

          2. A diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) as confirmed by an inappropriately low
             cortisol usually with other supporting tests.

          3. Receiving appropriate adrenocortical replacement therapy (hydrocortisone with/without
             fludrocortisone).

          4. Adequately hydrated and nourished. In addition, the parents/carers must be able to
             understand and give written Informed Consent for this extension study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinically evident acute AI (adrenal crisis) (Note: the subject can be re-evaluated
             for eligibility once the episode is over)

          2. Inability of the child to take oral therapy

          3. Subjects with clinical signs of acute infection or fever on inclusion (Note: the
             subject can be re-evaluated for eligibility once the episode is over)

          4. Any surgical or medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may place
             the subject at higher risk from his/her participation in the study

          5. Parents/carers of subjects unwilling to consent to saving and propagation of
             pseudonymised medical data for study reasons

          6. Subjects who are in a dependent relationship with the Investigator or the Sponsor
