      This is a single center, prospective cross-sectional study of women who have completed
      therapy for primary breast cancer within 5 years of diagnosis and are at increased risk for
      relapse.

      Patients will undergo screening bone marrow aspirate to test for presence of disseminated
      tumor cells (DTCs) Patients who harbor DTCs will be offered the opportunity for enrollment
      into a clinical trial of therapy targeting DTCs to prevent recurrence (separate protocols).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically-confirmed primary invasive breast cancer within 5 years of study entry

          -  Pathologically-confirmed invasive breast cancer in axillary lymph nodes or tumor with
             triple negative subtype: negative estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)
             and Her2-overexpression by ASCO-CAP guidelines or tumor with a Breast Cancer
             Recurrence Score of ≥ 25 per the Genomic Health Oncotype DX breast cancer test, or
             residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Completed all primary therapy (surgery, (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant
             radiation) for the index malignancy with

          -  No evidence of local or distant recurrent disease by physical examination, blood tests
             (CBC, LFTs, Alk Phos), or symptom-directed imaging, per NCCN guidelines.

          -  Normal coagulation studies: PT and PTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal per institutional
             laboratory range and for patients on warfarin, INR &lt; 3.0. For patients on therapeutic
             anti-coagulants, medication must be clinically held peri-procedure per standard
             clinical management.

          -  Willing to undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood specimen collection per protocol
             specifications

          -  Age 18 or over and able to give informed consent

          -  Patient has no evidence of meeting exclusion criteria for companion clinical trials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent enrollment on another investigational therapy

          -  Patients receiving chronic, high dose systemic treatment with corticosteroids defined
             as: chronic use of cortisone &gt;50mg; hydrocortisone &gt;40mg, prednisone &gt;10mg,
             methylprednisone &gt;8mg or dexamethasone &gt;1.5mg; or another immunosuppressive agent.
             Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.

          -  Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other
             conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:

        Symptomatic congestive heart failure of New York heart Association Class III or IV Unstable
        angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within 6 months of start of study drug, serious
        uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia or any other clinically significant cardiac disease
        Severely impaired lung function with a previously documented spirometry and DLCO that is
        50% of the normal predicted value and/or 02 saturation that is 88% or less at rest on room
        air Uncontrolled diabetes Active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled severe infections Liver
        disease such as cirrhosis, chronic active hepatitis or chronic persistent hepatitis A known
        history of HIV seropositivity as reported by the patient Impairment of gastrointestinal
        function or gastrointestinal disease (e.g., ulcerative disease, uncontrolled nausea,
        vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel resection) Patients with an
        active, bleeding diathesis

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breast feeding. Women of childbearing potential
             must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test.

          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus,
             temsirolimus, everolimus).

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to Everolimus or other rapamycins (sirolimus,
             temsirolimus) or to its excipients

          -  A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done
             at screening for all patients. HBV DNA and HCV RNA PCR testing are required at
             screening for all patients with a positive medical history based on risk factors
             and/or confirmation of prior HBV/HCV infection.
