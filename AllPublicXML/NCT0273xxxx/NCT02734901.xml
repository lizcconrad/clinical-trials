  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence from epidemiological and human intervention studies indicates that the
      cardiovascular health benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are (in part) related
      to their (poly)phenol content. Raspberries are rich in phenolic and polyphenolic compounds,
      in particular procyanidins, ellagitannins and anthocyanins, but also phenolic acids. At
      present, a small number of randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of berry
      (poly)phenols on validated surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease risk have shown
      promising results. However, to date, very few human studies have specifically investigated
      the effects of raspberry (poly)phenols on cardiovascular function in healthy subjects.
      Moreover, ellagitannin-derived metabolites are believed to persist for a long period of time
      in the blood and urine. Therefore, the investigators will investigate the presence of plasma
      and urinary raspberry-derived metabolites 24h post-consumption. To the investigators
      knowledge, the effects of red raspberry consumption on vascular function in humans have not
      been investigated before. This information is necessary for the planning of long-term studies
      aiming to assess the potential beneficial effects of raspberries,. Therefore, this study aims
      to investigate the potential role of red raspberry (poly)phenols in the modulation of
      vascular function by monitoring changes in vascular function together with the major
      (poly)phenol derivatives/metabolites in plasma.
