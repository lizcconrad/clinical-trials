      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal dose of nab-paclitaxel to be safely
      administered in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced inoperable non-small
      cell lung cancer. The study is also aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the combination
      therapy.

      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, proof of concept study of nab-paclitaxel administered in
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Part 1 of the study will assess the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of nab-paclitaxel in
      combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg administered on day 1 of each 21 day
      cycle). Dose escalation for nab-paclitaxel will be conducted according to the &quot;3+3 design&quot;
      until the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined.

      Part 2 of the study will evaluate the administration of pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg
      every 3 weeks in combination with nab-paclitaxel at the RP2D. Determining the RP2D will
      classify the treatment combination as safe and allow for an expansion of the study
      population, which will ultimately lead to further assessments of safety and tolerability as
      well as an evaluation of the anti-tumoral effect of the proposed treatment combination.

      Using Simon's optimal 2-stage design for Phase II clinical trials, we determined that a
      sample size of 36 patients would be adequate to test the proposed hypothesis.

      The primary efficacy analysis of overall response rate (ORR) will be interpreted as follows:
      1) if less than 9 partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) are recorded, the
      combination of nab-paclitaxel and pembrolizumab provides less than additive effects and is
      not likely to be clinically superior compared to pembrolizumab alone based on an ORR
      assessment; 2) however, if 9 or more PR or CR are recorded, the treatment combination
      warrants further clinical study. This could take the form of an extended phase II (to reach
      the 97 patients calculated from the model) or a phase III study.

      Treatment will continue until disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1), unacceptable adverse
      event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
      investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, investigator's noncompliance with trial
      treatment or procedures requirements, the subject receives 24 months of uninterrupted
      treatment or 35 administrations of study medication (whichever is later), or administrative
      reasons.

    <description>Phase I will determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of nab-paclitaxel when given in combination with pembrolizumab. Escalation for nab-paclitaxel will be conducted following a &quot;3+3&quot; design. First cohort of 3 patients will receive nab-paclitaxel on Days 1 and 8 at a dose of 100 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) in combination with pembrolizumab at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks. If no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) occur, the dose of nab-paclitaxel will be escalated to 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks. The dose of pembrolizumab will remain the same. If no DLTs occur, dose level 2 will be defined as the RP2D. In the Phase II, pembrolizumab will be administered at 200 mg IV every 3 weeks and nab-paclitaxel will be administered at the RP2D.</description>
