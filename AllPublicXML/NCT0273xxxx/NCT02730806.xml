    <textblock>
      The purpose of this interventional study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the NLP PTSD
      protocol in the event of PPPTSD in comparison with the common practice protocol. The study's
      main hypothesis is that the implementation of both protocols will be equally effective and
      result in reduction of the overall PTSD level.

      Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is considered to be a major Public Health disorder in
      the Western world with 8% prevalence. When including partial/Sub-clinic PTSD, prevalence
      rises dramatically. Studies examining the common intervention methods indicate certain
      clinical effectiveness although none presents sweeping efficiency. Therefore, this syndrome
      is still a significant clinical problem in Public Health.

      This study focuses on women population who have experienced trauma in childbirth. Such women
      experience full post traumatic symptoms (Full PTSD) or Partial/Subclinical PTSD. This
      syndrome is defined in professional literature as PPPTSD (Post-Partum Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder). While childbirth is a healthy part of the cycle of life, birth itself is an event
      that may involve a risk to the mother and child life. PPPTSD prevalence ranges between 1%-6%
      and is expressed in at least two of the criteria listed in the DSM. 8.3%-28% of women suffer
      from partial PPPTSD.

      Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a &quot;one-on-one&quot; intervention method, connecting
      Neurological processes (N), Linguistic (L) and learned behaviors (P), in order to allow
      conceptual/perceptual, mental and behavioral changes. Even though NLP is used since the
      1970's and field testimonies report its effectiveness, there are only few studies regarding
      its effectiveness in the field of PTSD.

      &quot;Group intervention&quot;, which combines both CBT tools and dynamic group therapy, is part of the
      common treatment usually implemented at Maccabi Healthcare Services in the event of PTSD.

      This study's main objective is to examine the effectiveness of the NLP PTSD protocol in
      comparison to the common intervention protocol used at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel
      (Treatment as usual).

      The study population will include 60 women, up to one year after birth, with PPPTSD, out of
      which 30 will be treated in 12 sessions implementing Maccabi Healthcare Services common group
      protocol and 30 will be treated in 5 individual sessions implementing the NLP PTSD protocol.

    <measure>PTSD (PCL-C) - PTSD checklist - measures the change in the overall level of PTSD</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A Self-report questionnaire diagnoses the severity of PTSD (PCL-C), conducted separately in each arm before and after the intervention as well as a comparison between both arms, enables to examine the overall level of PTSD (PTSD volume). Developed by Weathers et al, 1993, based on criteria appearing in DSM- V, it includes 20 questions, with each item testing the presence and the severity of one of the symptoms of PTSD during the passing month. Answers are based on the Leickert scale with 5 degrees ranging from 0 (&quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;). Overall measurement ranges from 0 to 80 (PTS - Post Traumatic Symptoms). Cut mark for the estimation of PTSD &gt;= 44.</description>

    <description>A Self-report questionnaire diagnoses the severity of PTSD (PCL-C), conducted separately in each arm before and after the intervention as well as a comparison between both arms, enables to examine also the levels of PTSD symptoms: intrusion/re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal and negative alterations in cognitions and mood. Developed by Weathers et al, 1993, based on criteria appearing in DSM- V, it includes 20 questions, with each item testing the presence and the severity of one of the symptoms of PTSD during the passing month. Questions are presented in four groups, which express the four main symptom clusters in PTSD: intrusion/re-experiencing (items 1-5) (criteria B), avoidance (items 6-7) (criteria C), negative alterations in cognitions and mood (items 8-14) (criteria D), and hyper-arousal (items 15-20) (criteria E).</description>

    <measure>Functioning Questionnaire - measures the change in overall subjects' Functioning Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire, developed by Gelkopf et al 2011, will be conducted separately in each arm before and after the intervention as well as a comparison between both arms. The questionnaire evaluates 6 functioning aspects in the passing month: occupation, studies, parenting, relationship with the spouse, being part of the community, friendship and intimacy. The answers are based on the Leickert scale with 5 degrees ranging from 0 (&quot;very bad&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very good&quot;). The internal consistency is α = 0.86 (range 0-4, SD=0.79, M=3.20).</description>

    <measure>Post Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) - measures the change in the overall level of PTG</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire, developed by Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996, will be conducted separately in each arm before and after the intervention as well as a comparison between both arms. It includes 22 items divided to 5 sub-scales: connection with others, new opportunites, personal strength, spiritual change and life appreciation. The subjects are asked to rate their answer concerning the amount of change they experienced in their life due to the traumatic event. The answers are based on the Leickert scale with 5 degrees ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;). The internal consistency is α = 0.96.</description>
