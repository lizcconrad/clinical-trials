    <textblock>
      Apart from objective criteria for the evaluation of oral health (CAO, CPIâ€¦), there are no
      scales to evaluate the oral health of patients with schizophrenia. The only scales that do
      exist are for the population at large, children or the elderly. Given the severely
      deteriorated oral health in these schizophrenic populations, it is important to have a tool
      to evaluate their perception of the quality of their oral health so as to better orientate
      prevention programmes.

      The aim of this study is to validate a tool to measure the perception of oral health in
      patients with schizophrenia.

      To do this, patients will be invited to complete a series of self-questionnaires relative to
      the concept of oral health.
