  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled study will evaluate if Long Acting Reversible
      Contraceptive (LARC) forward counseling in combination with same-day LARC placement increases
      overall LARC uptake within a community college population compared to LARC forward counseling
      and referral to a secondary clinic for LARC placement. The study will be conducted at Mount
      Hood Community College (MHCC) in Oregon. Participants will be enrolled into three groups. All
      groups will receive the same standardized contraceptive counseling (&quot;LARC forward
      counseling&quot;) and participants will be able to choose between a LARC method and short-acting
      method of birth control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of an on-campus birth control counseling
      and services clinic. Currently there are no health services that provide access to birth
      control located on the Mount Hood Community College (MHCC) campus. We are offering a
      temporary 'Birth Control Resource Center' for eligible students. All forms of birth control
      in this study are FDA approved.

      During the study participants will undergo counseling to choose the method of birth control
      that is right for them. This will include watching an informational video and having a
      discussion with study staff. If participants choose pills, the patch the ring, or a diaphragm
      and do not have any contraindications to this method, they will receive a prescription for
      this method to be filled at the pharmacy of their choice. If participants choose Depo-Provera
      (the shot), they will receive their first shot on the day of their visit and a prescription
      for repeat shots every 3 months. If participants choose to have an IUD or Implant as their
      method of birth control, they will be randomized to one of two groups. There is a 50% chance
      of having the intrauterine device (IUD) or Implant placed immediately after the counseling
      session and a 50% chance of receiving a list of local clinics that can place the device at a
      later time.
