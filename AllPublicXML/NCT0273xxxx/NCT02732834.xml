  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand communication between patients with lung
      cancer and their clinicians. The investigators are also interested in patient's perceptions
      of the quality of communication with his/her clinician and how these perceptions may impact
      patient outcomes. The clinician participating in this study and has given us permission to
      approach his/her eligible patients for study participation.

    <description>Following informed consent, the patient will complete the patient questionnaire, either electronically, by phone, or on paper. Patients who prefer to complete the survey electronically will be emailed a link to access to a secure electronic (web-based) version of the study assessment which they will have access to from any computer. We will include an introductory email with the survey link. Will audio-record actual patient-physician clinical consultations with lung cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK). Completing the survey will take about 15 minutes. Answer a few open-ended questions about the consultation with the doctor. We will audio record your answers to these questions. This will take about 15 minutes.</description>

    <description>Following informed consent, clinicians will be scheduled to participate in a 2 hour training on empathic communication with lung cancer patients. Surveys will be collected from 6 patients (3 pre-training, 3 post-training). Clinicians will complete one standardized patient assessment before training (pre-SPA) and one assessment after training (post-SPA). These are 12-minute video-recorded clinic consultations with standardized patients (trained actors).</description>
