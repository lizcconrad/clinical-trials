    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent and
             metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The definitive diagnosis of recurrent and
             metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be made by integrating the histopathological
             data within the context of the clinical and radiographic data. Patients with islet
             cell neoplasms are excluded.

          2. Initial diagnosis of recurrent and metastatic disease must have occurred ≤6 weeks
             prior to randomization in the study.

          3. Patient has one or more lesions measurable by CT scan or MRI (if patient is allergic
             to CT contrast media).

          4. Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female, and ≥ 20 years of age.

          5. Patient must meet the following blood counts at Baseline (obtained ≤14 days prior to
             randomization):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 (100 × 10^9/L)

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9 g/dL.

          6. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline (obtained ≤14 days prior
             to randomization):

               -  AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal range (ULN), unless liver
                  metastases are clearly present, then ≤ 5 × ULN is allowed.

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ULN

          7. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 70. Two observers will be required
             to assess KPS. If discrepant, the one with the lowest assessment will be considered
             true.

          8. Patient has voluntarily agreed to participate in the study, and signed the Informed
             Consent Form (ICF) prior to participation in any study-related activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of malignancy in the last 5 years. Patients with prior history of in situ
             cancer or basal or squamous cell skin cancer are eligible. Patients with other
             malignancies are eligible if they were cured by surgery alone or surgery plus
             radiotherapy and have been continuously disease-free for at least 5 years.

          2. Patients have uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections

          3. Patient has known historical or active infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis
             C.

          4. Patients have a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of Paclitaxel,
             Gemcitabine, or Cremophor EL.

          5. Patients with high cardiovascular risk, including recent coronary stenting or
             myocardial infarction in the past 6 months.

          6. History of Peripheral Artery Disease (e.g,. claudication, Leo Buerger's disease).
