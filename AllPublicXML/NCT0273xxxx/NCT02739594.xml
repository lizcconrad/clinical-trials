  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label trial will randomize participants with multiple myeloma to a
      regimen of ibandronate or zoledronate in order to compare the incidence of nephrotoxicity,
      measured as creatinine clearance (CrCl) reduction greater than (&gt;) 30 percent (%) or an
      absolute value of 30 milliliters per minute (mL/min) or lower.

    <description>CrCl was calculated from blood samples using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Relevant deterioration in renal function was defined as CrCl reduction of 30 percent (%) from Baseline or an absolute value less than or equal to (≤) 30 milliliters per minute (mL/min) at Week 44. The last available value on/before Week 44 was used in the calculation. The percentage of participants with deterioration in renal function at Week 44 was reported.</description>

    <description>Elevation in SCr was defined as an increase greater than (&gt;) 0.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) for participants with Baseline SCr less than (&lt;) 1.4 mg/dL, or an increase &gt;1.0 mg/dL for participants with Baseline SCr greater than or equal to (≥) 1.4 mg/dL. For the Week 44 analysis, the last available value on/before Week 44 was used. For the Week 92 analysis, the last available value on/before Week 92 was used.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Deterioration in Renal Function According to Reduction in Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) From Baseline to Week 44</title>
        <description>CrCl was calculated from blood samples using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Relevant deterioration in renal function was defined as CrCl reduction of 30 percent (%) from Baseline or an absolute value less than or equal to (≤) 30 milliliters per minute (mL/min) at Week 44. The last available value on/before Week 44 was used in the calculation. The percentage of participants with deterioration in renal function at Week 44 was reported.</description>

        <description>CrCl was calculated from blood samples using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Relevant deterioration in renal function was defined as CrCl reduction of 30% from Baseline or an absolute value ≤30 mL/min at Week 92. The last available value on/before Week 92 was used in the calculation. The percentage of participants with deterioration in renal function at Week 92 was reported.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in CrCl</title>
        <description>CrCl was calculated from blood samples using the Cockcroft-Gault formula, and was also measured by urinalysis. The percent change in CrCl was calculated as [Week 44 or 92 CrCl minus Baseline CrCl] divided by Baseline CrCl, multiplied by 100. For the Week 44 analysis, the last available value on/before Week 44 was used in the calculation. For the Week 92 analysis, the last available value on/before Week 92 was used in the calculation.</description>
