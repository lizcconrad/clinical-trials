    <textblock>
      This study will determine the role of the NK cells before and after bariatric surgery. The
      investigators selected patients with NAFLD.

      A Fibroscan evaluation will be assessed as a new modality to evaluate liver fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All morbidly obese patients who are candidates for a bariatric procedure in the investigators
      institution who has a fatty liver in their routine preoperative US will undergo a fibroscan
      to assess the degree of liver fibrosis preoperatively in addition to a blood sample that will
      be withdrawn from those participants to isolate the NK cells and to assess their activities
      by the assessment of the active form of NK cells (CD107a) using the spectrometry (FACS)
      analysis.

      The investigators will also collect other clinical data including comorbidities
      (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia) in addition to the following routine
      blood test( complete blood count, creatinine, urea, International normalized ratio, liver
      function test, HBa1C, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, vitamin D, vitamin B12,
      potassium, sodium, albumin, bilirubin, C- reactive protein, iron, ferritin and transferrin).

      All of the above mentioned tests including the NK cells and the fibroscan will be examined
      for all participants in 3, 6, 12 months postoperatively.

    <description>NK cells are through to play role in modulating fibrogenesis. They exert an anti-fibrotic effects by Killing activated hepatic stellate Cells; the major cells responsible for fibrosis.
NK cells activations are crucial step in inhibiting liver fibrosis. Therefore, their functions are thought to be affected in Obese patients.
Our aim is to investigate changes in peripheral Blood NK cells by detecting their cytotoxicity potentials by CD107a (LAMP-1; Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1) as a marker for activation and analyze them by flow-cytometry.
Peripheral Blood NK cells will be obtained from obese patients prior to Bariatric surgery and following 3 months, 6 months and 12 months of the surgery.</description>
