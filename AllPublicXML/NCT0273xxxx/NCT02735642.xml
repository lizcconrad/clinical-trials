  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge of HIV status is a first step towards accessing HIV care, treatment, and prevention
      services.The GIRLS study will rigorously compare two 'seek' recruitment strategies, three
      'test' strategies, and two enhancements to an adaptive (SMART trial design) 'linkage' to care
      intervention, among young at-risk women, 15-24 years old, in Homa Bay County, western Kenya.
      Additionally, we will evaluate a scalable primary prevention messaging intervention to
      support identified HIV-negative young women in reducing HIV risk and adhering to recommended
      HIV re-testing recommendations. We will also conduct an economic evaluation, using cost
      effectiveness analyses to determine the relative utility of each seek, test, link, and
      prevention interventions.

      Lessons learned will inform Government of Kenya, and other key policymakers, implementing
      partners and agencies throughout sub-Saharan Africa that are exploring policies about
      appropriate scale up of these multiple seek, test, link, retain, and prevention strategies to
      realize the dream of an AIDS-free future for adolescent girls and young women.

    <textblock>
      The GIRLS study will inform best practices to increase adolescent girls and young women's
      uptake of HIV prevention, testing, and linkage for HIV to care services in a high-HIV burden
      African setting to optimize engagement in both the HIV prevention and care continua.

      Aim 1: To determine the preferred recruitment venue and testing modality that targets and
      finds the highest number of HIV infected and at risk female youth aged 15-24 years in Homa
      Bay County, Nyanza region, western Kenya.

        -  This will be determined by examining the uptake and yield of previously undiagnosed HIV
           infection of the two (2) 'seek' strategies (community or home-based) and the three (3)
           'test' strategies (self-testing, HIV testing services (HTS) in a home/mobile setting, or
           facility-based HTS) among female youth;

      Aim 2: (a) To pilot and evaluate an adaptive intervention to link newly diagnosed
      HIV-positive female youth to treatment and care services; and (b) To identify barriers and
      facilitators to seeking HIV care services after receiving a positive diagnosis; (c) To
      identify barriers and facilitators to seeking HIV prevention services for high risk female
      youth after receiving a negative HIV test result; (d) To provide an HIV prevention
      intervention to a randomly selected subset of high risk negatives, and to re-test them; and

      Aim 3: To conduct an economic evaluation, using cost effectiveness analyses to determine the
      relative utility of each seek, test, link, and prevention intervention.
