  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical OC-10X
      Ophthalmic Suspension in patients diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (level
      61, 65, 71, or 75). OcuCure Therapeutics, Inc. (Roanoke, VA) has developed a lead compound,
      known as OC-10X, which is a selective tubulin inhibitor under development for the treatment
      of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). When
      administered as a topical eye drop, OC-10X has both anti-angiogenic (inhibition) and
      angiolytic (regression) properties in animal models of choroidal neovascularization (CNV).
      Unlike other therapies, OC-10X provides the efficacy of a vascular targeting agent without
      the traditional toxicity and works downstream independently of growth factors. As
      demonstrated by OcuCure's preclinical data, tubulin inhibition, using OC-10X, may be a
      promising new approach to the treatment of PDR and AMD. Like AMD, PDR is a major cause of
      blindness in adults and is also caused by the growth of abnormal blood vessels. Importantly,
      the Phase I Study found that OC-10X can be safely applied topically in human eyes without
      adverse ocular or systemic effects.

      Currently, there are few options for the treatment of PDR. Clinical options, such as laser
      photocoagulation or vitrectomy, require surgery and can permanently impair patients' vision.
      With few treatment options available, administration of OC-10X as a topical therapy, along
      with its novel mechanism, has the potential to provide benefits to patients with ocular
      diseases associated with angiogenesis.

          1. Clinically significant systemic diseases/conditions that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could negatively affect the safety of the patient during the study on a
             as determined on a case by case basis (e.g., unstable medical status including
             uncontrolled blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled liver disease,
             glycemic control or significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal
             failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal
             or neurological diseases, cancer or BMI).

             infection.

          7. Positive for urinary screen testing of drugs of abuse (opiates, cannabinoids,
             amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine).

          8. History of drug dependence or excessive alcohol intake on a habitual basis of more

         10. Planned use of any ocular or systemic medications that the Investigator determines
             unacceptable during the study (i.e. anti-vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]
             therapy), with the exception of oral contraceptives and short-term use of
             over-the-counter analgesics during the study.

         16. Any intraocular surgery or trauma within 6 months before trial enrollment.

         17. History of chronic ocular disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will
             affect neovascular progression.

             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for congestive heart failure within 6 months

         19. Current use of contact lenses.

         20. Concurrent or anticipated use of ocular agents during the study period that are
             considered by the Investigator to interfere with the study objectives.
