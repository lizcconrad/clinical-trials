        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients, at least 18 years of age

          -  Patients with NSCLC diagnosis who have been referred for a clinical FDG PET/CT staging
             scan as part of their standard of care

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to tolerate additional imaging time in the opinion of the investigator or
             treating physician.

          -  Only individuals (aged 18 or over) who can understand and give informed consent will
             be eligible to participate in this study. Individuals who are considered to be
             mentally disabled will not be recruited for this study. All subjects must be able to
             give informed consent. We will not be using specific methods to assess decisional
             capacity. Economically disadvantaged persons will not be vulnerable to undue
             influence, as this study offers no compensation and there is no additional cost
             associated with the additional study imaging time. All individuals will be told that
             their choice regarding study participation will in no way change their access to
             clinical care or their ability to undergo the standard clinical FDG PET/CT scan. This
             should negate any undue influence or coercion. Children, fetuses, neonates, or
             prisoners are not included in this research study
