    <textblock>
      Background and study aims: Being a caregiver for someone with cancer can be very difficult
      emotionally. For many the patient is a family member or friend, and so this can cause the
      caregiver a great deal of psychological distress. There are currently very few studies
      looking into the effectiveness of psychological treatments for distressed caregivers of
      cancer patients. This study is looking at tailored group therapy program for carers of cancer
      givers. The aim of this study is to find out whether this program can help to lower levels of
      distress in cancer caregivers and help them to better cope with caring for someone with the
      illness.

    <description>Participants take part in the tailored group intervention which consists of five 90-minute group sessions over eight weeks. The sessions are in the form of structured group talk/discussions following specific themes:

Session 2 - Distress: introduction of the distress model, identification of resources, breathing practices
Session 3 - Handling of stressful situations: individual identification in tandems, discussion of common pitfalls in the group
Session 4 - Self-care: inspection of individual daily routines, group collects positive experiences with &quot;windows&quot; for self-care
Session 5 - Feedback and outlook: stabilisation, retrospective reflection on the group experience and its benefits and, if applicable, potential adverse events</description>
