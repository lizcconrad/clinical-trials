  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine SV2A density in MDD and PTSD as a correlate of synaptic
      density, and to determine whether ketamine administration will reverse the synaptic loss in
      vivo in human subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first human study to examine SV2A in
      vivo in MDD and PTSD and to use the first known drug (ketamine) that rapidly reverses
      synaptic loss to determine whether ketamine administration could restore some of the
      structural changes associated with depression and PTSD.

      After a screening process to determine eligibility, all subjects will participate in an MRI,
      and 2-3 PET scans with the administration of ketamine for one of the scans. Cognitive testing
      and a stress test may also be done on scan days.

      The goal of the study is to determine whether there are alterations in synaptic vesicle
      glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed ubiquitously in synaptic vesicles, in depression
      and anxiety and whether ketamine, an N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, normalizes SV2A
      density at time of its greatest anti-depressant response. This study will conduct an
      examination of SV2A and associated consequences using neuroreceptor imaging and behavioral
      techniques for the following aims.

      Aim 1: To compare SV2A availability in individuals with MDD, healthy control individuals, and
      individuals with PTSD using APP311 and PET.

      Hypothesis 1: This study hypothesizes lower SV2A density in MDD and PTSD in the prefrontal
      cortex.

      Aim 2: To determine whether ketamine administration alters SV2A density in HC, MDD, and PTSD
      individuals.

      Hypothesis 2: This study hypothesizes administration of ketamine will lead to a significant
      increase in SV2A density in all subject groups (HC, MDD, and PTSD), and this increase will
      correlate with antidepressant response in individuals with MDD.

    <description>Subjects will participate in 2-3 PET scans (up to 4 if cancelations occur) on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT), the highest resolution human brain scanner available, or the HR+ will be used to image subjects. Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) will be obtained before and after radiotracer administration. Venous catheter(s) will be used for IV administration of the radiotracer and for venous blood sampling. An arterial catheter will be inserted by an experienced physician before the PET scan. After a baseline scan, subjects will be administered a low dose of ketamine for the second scan.</description>
