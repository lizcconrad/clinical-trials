  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study was being done to study the effect of codeine and Naloxegol for 3 days
      compared to placebo on the movement of food through the colon of healthy individuals. Codeine
      is a commonly used pain-relieving drug that often causes constipation as an unwanted side
      effect. Naloxegol is a medication recently approved by the FDA for treatment of constipation
      induced by Codeine.

      The hypothesis for this study was that Naloxegol reduces the retardation of small bowel and
      colonic transit induced by codeine in healthy participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase
      I study of the effects of naloxegol, a novel mu-opioid antagonist, on gastrointestinal and
      colonic transit in the presence or absence of the mu-opiate, codeine. There is a need to
      develop effective medications for the treatment of opiate-induced constipation and other
      motility disorders. Currently available opiates are complicated by addictive potential and
      induction of troublesome constipation.

    <description>The scintigraphic method is used to measure colonic transit. An isotope is adsorbed on activated charcoal particles and delivered to the colon in a delayed release capsule. Anterior and posterior gamma images are taken hourly. The geometric center (GC) is the weighted average of counts in the different colonic regions. The scale ranges from 1 to 5; a high GC implies faster colonic transit, a GC of 1 implies all isotope is in the ascending colon, and a GC of 5 implies all isotope is in the stool.</description>
