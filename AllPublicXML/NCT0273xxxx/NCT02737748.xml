           infections and bleeding)

        2. To evaluate the efficacy for Phase I+II of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor
           site wounds (DSW) in terms of The healing time from DSW creation to 100%
           re-epithelialization

      Secondary objective:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds
           (DSW) in secondary efficacy endpoints

        2. To evaluate the safety of TWB-103 in split-thickness skin graft donor site wounds (DSW)

             but no more than 100 cm2, with a minimum width of 3 cm and with an approximate
             thickness of 0.38mm. The graft cannot be harvested from a site from which a skin graft
             was previously obtained.

          3. If the primary wound is a result of a thermal or chemical burn, the total body surface
             area of the said wound must be less than 15%.

          4. Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative serum pregnancy test

             or ALT &gt; 3 × ULN, gamma-GT &gt; 2.5 x ULN, Alk-P &gt; 2.5 x ULN, serum albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dL,
             creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN, any other ≥ Grade 2 laboratory abnormality (based on CTCAE) at
             baseline (other than those listed above)

         16. DSWs in area with active skin infection or with skin condition that is considered
             highly susceptible to infection judged by the investigator
