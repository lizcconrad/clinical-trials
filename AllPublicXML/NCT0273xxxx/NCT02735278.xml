  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In optometry, binocular coordination is measured subjectively. The result is subjective
      fixation disparity. In research different experiments have proven, that subjective and
      objective fixation disparity are different. A binocular eyetracker has to be calibrated.
      There are two well known calibration methods: associated and dissociated calibration.
      Objective fixation disparity is measured in arcMin. Therefore, the precision of the
      eyetracker plays a crucial role. Now, the investigators try to compare dissociated
      calibration with polarized filters and associated calibration under different test paradigms.
