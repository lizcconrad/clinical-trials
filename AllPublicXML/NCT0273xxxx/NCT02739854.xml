        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An inclusion criterion is the traumatic patients (e.g. head injury, blunt chest, blunt
             abdomen, and fracture of spine; with or without operative, pure or multitrauma) with
             intubation and mechanical ventilation who admit at this time period will recruit to
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  a patients who admit less than 1 day will be excluded such as sudden death or moving
             to other ward because of improving conditions, etc.
