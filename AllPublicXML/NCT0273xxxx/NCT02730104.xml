      The purpose of this trial is to assess time to disease progression of patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with Lanreotide
      Depot. This is an observational study therefore all data collected will be in accordance with
      the routine practice of physicians.

    <time_frame>From first date of lanreotide to up to 24 months (approximately) after the last patient is randomised</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disease progression will be defined as the time from the first date of lanreotide, which may have occurred prior to study entry, to the date of first documented disease progression or the date of tumor-related death. In a living patient with no documented disease progression, or if the patient is lost to follow-up, disease progression will be censored at the date of the last evaluable scan. Patients who start a new treatment before they progress will be censored as of the date of last scan. Disease progression is defined for this study as both clinical dimensions of progression in conjunction with a treatment change.</description>
