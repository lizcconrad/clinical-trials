    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to recruit a total of 320 dyads composed by persons
      with dementia living in community settings and their primary informal caregivers. In the
      intervention group, persons with dementia will have a home monitoring kit installed in the
      household while participants in the control group will receive their usual care. The kit
      includes home leaving sensors, smoke and water leak sensors, bed sensors as well as automatic
      lights that monitor the individual's behavior. Alerts (text message and/or phone call) will
      be sent to the caregiver if anything unusual occurs. All study participants will receive
      three home visits by project administrators that have received project specific training in
      order to harmonize data collection. These will take place at enrollment and 3 and 12 months
      following installation of the home kits. At every home visit, a standardized questionnaire
      will be administered to all study participants to assess their health, quality of life and
      resource utilization. The primary outcome of this trial is the amount of informal care
      support provided by primary informal caregivers to the Person with Dementia.

    <textblock>
      While the enormous technological progress made in recent years has put technologies, such as
      mobile devices and smart phones, in the reach of many, innovators in dementia care are just
      starting to explore the full potential of these developments to transform them into valuable
      products and services for users. There is indeed a lack of studies that evaluate the
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these new technologically-enriched interventions
      targeted at people with dementia. Previous large scale evaluations of the impact of
      telemedicine and telecare, such as the Whole Demonstrator System in the United Kingdom, did
      not include people with dementia despite Alzheimer's disease being one of the most burdensome
      diseases in Europe.

      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effects of new technologies on
      caregiver burden by reducing the time spent in supervision. The trial builds on previous
      promising results from the UP-TECH project in Italy
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01700556) . The technologies used in TECH@HOME will
      include similar, but improved, home monitoring kits potentially leading to a greater impact
      on caregivers' caring conditions. In addition, while the UP-TECH study did not allow the
      researchers to estimate the impact of the technology as a &quot;stand-alone&quot; intervention (the
      monitoring kits were only given in combination with case-management support), TECH@HOME will
      overcome this limitation thanks to the possibility to compare a group of technology users vs.
      non-users. Results from this intervention in dementia care in Sweden hold the potential to
      inform regional and national policy makers in Sweden and beyond.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI) will be used to measure the level of caregiver burden. This is the instrument most consistently used in dementia caregiving research, and it is often used to measure the change of caregiver burden over time, resulting from the progression of the disease severity of the care recipient or from interventions aimed at reducing burden. The revised version of the Zarit with 22 items will be used.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized in the intervention group will receive a technical home monitoring kit for 12 months. The kits will be composed of a control unit and a set of sensors that immediately notify caregivers, through their phones, of any potential risks for the person with dementia. The kit will have home leaving sensors, bed occupancy sensors, smoke and water leak sensors, automatic lights, and other interactive functions. These devices will be connected to a single-board microcontroller that will transmit alarm messages to the caregivers in case of need.</description>

    <description>Patients receiving usual care, as provided to people with dementia in Southern Sweden can vary. In the target area, people with dementia usually receive comparable pharmaceutical treatment depending on the dementia type, as prescribed by a general practitioner or a specialist at a memory clinic. The social worker from the Municipality (&quot;Biståndshandläggaren&quot;) where the person resides, together with the district nurse, have a meaningful role in tailoring the care plan by mediating access to other care services such as respite care homes, home help and (dementia) nurse home visits. Use of such services depends on the specific needs of the person with dementia, which can also be unrelated to dementia, but rather dependent upon concomitant health and social issues.</description>

    <intervention_name>Home monitoring kit</intervention_name>
    <description>The home monitoring kits notify the caregivers about potentially dangerous situations, such as when the person with dementia:
leaves the home without notice, since this might occur in a moment of disorientation;
leaves a water tap open;
forgets something on the stove;
gets out of bed during the night and doesn't come back within a certain time interval;
never goes to the bathroom in 24 hours;
never opens refrigerator door in 24 hours.
Depending on the personal choice of the study participants, the kit will also :
automatically turn on a light to help avoid a fall during the night;
alert the caregiver when the temperature in the house falls or rises excessively;
act as burglar alarm in some areas of the home.</description>
