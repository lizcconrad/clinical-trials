      Few studies have investigated breastfeeding in twins, and none have addressed the effect of
      antenatal counseling on breastfeeding twins.The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      effect of antenatal breastfeeding counseling on the breastfeeding rates in twin pregnancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In singleton pregnancies, three randomized studies have recently examined the influence of
      antenatal breastfeeding education on the breastfeeding rates (Su et al. 2007; Mattar et al.
      2007; Wong et al. 2014). Two of these studies did not find differences in the total
      breastfeeding rates between the groups that received and did not receive antenatal
      breastfeeding education at the infants' age of 6 months old (Su et al. 2007; Wong et al.
      2014). However, Su et al. found higher exclusive breastfeeding rates for 6-months-old infants
      in the group that received antenatal counseling. In contrast, Mattar et al. 2007 found
      significantly difference in breastfeeding rates with individual counseling compared to
      non-counseling or only breastfeeding educational material with no counseling.

      Few studies have investigated breastfeeding in twins specifically, and even fewer have
      focused on the duration of breastfeeding of twin infants. Furthermore, in our literature
      search, we did not find studies of breastfeeding of twins investigating the effect of
      antenatal education on breastfeeding twins. Our hypothesis is that mothers of twins receiving
      specific antenatal counseling on breastfeeding should have a higher rate of breastfeeding
      than mothers who do not receive antenatal breastfeeding counseling. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study was to investigate the effect of specific antenatal breastfeeding counseling on
      the breastfeeding rates in twin pregnancies.

    <description>Patients in the PCG will receive specific counseling on breastfeeding consisting of three different counseling sessions during prenatal visits given by one two midwives involved in the study. The information will include: breastfeeding importance; how to prepare the nipples and breast for breastfeeding; the main complications and difficulties during the breastfeeding process and how to identify and overcome them; breastfeeding techniques and alternative positions for the simultaneous breastfeeding of twins, for example, &quot;double cradle&quot;, &quot;cradle-football&quot; or &quot;double-football&quot;, using illustrations and hands-on demonstration with doll models. During the counseling sessions patients will have the opportunity to discuss questions on breastfeeding.</description>

    <description>No breastfeeding counseling during the antenatal period will be provided. The Control Group will receive non-specific counseling with standard orientation regarding breastfeeding after delivery and during their postpartum hospitalization period. This standard orientation will be provided by one of the midwives of the hospital during a single counseling session with brief guidance covering the following topics: starting breastfeeding, hygiene, infants' conditions, colostrum/breast milk, infants' positions, duration of breastfeeding, frequency of feeds, mammary milking, and stopping breastfeeding.</description>

             and followed at our twin clinic; absence of absolute contraindications for
             breastfeeding, such as positive serology for HIV, HTLV; absence of use of lactation
             inhibitors to treat prolactinoma, such as cabergoline and bromocriptine; and absence
             of major malformation of one or both twins that could preclude breastfeeding,
             including gastrointestinal defects, cleft lip and cleft palate, or malformations that
             would require neonatal surgery with prolonged hospital stay.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  fetal or postnatal death of one or both twins; delivery before 32 weeks; major
             malformation diagnosed postnatal; and lost to follow up or no breastfeeding
