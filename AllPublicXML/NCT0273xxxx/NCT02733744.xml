    <textblock>
      This research study is studying an intervention called fecal microbiota transplantation
      (FMT). Patients who are scheduled to undergo Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation are
      invited to take part in this clinical trial to undergo empiric FMT soon after hematopoietic
      engraftment. The primary endpoint will be to assess the feasibility of FMT in this population
      and to assess safety.

    <textblock>
      The microbiome (spectrum of bacteria in a patient's gut) is thought to play a role in helping
      to shape one's immune system given its direct contact with normal cells in our intestine.
      Recent studies have suggested that a microbiome with very few bacteria (low diversity) seems
      to be bad for health and a high-diversity microbiome (many different species) appears to be
      good. This appears to be true even for patients after HSCT where low diversity microbiome
      status has correlated with infections, GVHD and overall survival.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is routinely performed for an infection caused by
      Clostridium difficile but is not yet approved by the FDA as a treatment for any disease. FMT
      restores a high diversity microbiome. It is hoped that through FMT, overall outcomes after
      HSCT can potentially be improved.

      FMT will be performed in the first 3 weeks after recovery of white blood cells after HSCT.
      The source of FMT will be from healthy 3rd party donors. FMT will be performed through the
      ingestion of 30 capsules over 2 consecutive days.

    <description>Each participant will undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to institutional standards.
Participants will receive a single standard dose of oral Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), which is 15 capsules per day for two consecutive days, for a total of 30 capsules. Participants will be asked to fast for 4 hours prior to and 1 hour following capsule intake. Capsules will be individually handed to participants by a research nurse or physician. Each capsule will be taken with a sip of water.</description>

             cells are eligible. Eligible conditioning regimens are those defined as myeloablative
