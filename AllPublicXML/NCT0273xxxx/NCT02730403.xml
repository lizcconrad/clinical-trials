  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, &quot;ancillary study&quot; intended to describe opioid use among opioid use
      disorder patients following their discharge into the community from inpatient detoxification
      and/or short-term residential treatment programs affiliated with parent study CTN-0051, which
      assessed the comparative effectiveness of extended release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX,
      Vivitrol®), an opioid antagonist recently approved and indicated for the prevention of
      relapse to opioid dependence, versus buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX, Suboxone®), a high
      affinity partial agonist indicated for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence, as
      pharmacotherapeutic aids to recovery.

      Participant recruitment will begin after recruitment for CTN-0051 has been completed. Opioid
      use disorder patients will be recruited prior to leaving detoxification and/or short-term
      residential programs. Screening and baseline data (focused on demographics, diagnosis and
      service utilization) will be collected prior to discharge, and follow-up data (focused on
      opioid use) will be collected at weeks 1, 4 and 8 following discharge.

        participating in CTN-0051. Up to 60 participants will be recruited at each of approximately
        six sites.
