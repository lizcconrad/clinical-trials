      &lt;Part I - Phase I trial&gt; The phase I clinical trial is to identify the MTD (Maximum Tolerated
      Dose) and DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) of CG200745 PPA. Initial dose of CG200745 PPA is 150
      mg/m^2, and it will be extended to 225 mg/m^2, 300 mg/m^2 or it will be reduced to 75 mg/m^2
      based on the results of the cohort of 3 subjects per dose level.

      Based on the 3+3 dose escalation study design, CG200745 PPA is to be administered as in four
      different cohorts according to the dose level. Each cohort consists of 3 or 6 subjects.

      &lt;Part II - Phase II trial&gt; In the phase II clinical trial, the subjects will be administered
      with the dose which is to be identified as a recommended dose based on the results of Phase I
      study. The whole one cycle is consisted of 28 days, same as the phase I. The entire treatment
      period is 6 cycles and tumor assessment is evaluated every 2 cycles.
