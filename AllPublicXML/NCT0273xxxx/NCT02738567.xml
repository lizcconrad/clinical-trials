  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of vasopressor supplement materials to local anesthetics is commonly used in
      procedures in various fields of dentistry, ENT (ear, nose, and throat), Plastic Surgery, Hand
      surgery and gastroenterology. Epinephrine is used to constrict small blood vessels, thus
      reducing bleeding during a medical procedure, reducing the toxicity by reducing systemic
      absorption of local anesthetic, and prolonging the duration and intensity of neural blockage
      created by the local anesthetic.

      There are descriptions in the literature of cases in which the use of lidocain and adrenaline
      caused adverse cardiac events such as arrhythmias, edema and increase in blood pressure
      during ENT and dentistry procedures. As far as we know there has never been a systematic
      examination of the incidence and severity of arrhythmias during procedures with local
      anesthesia.

      The purpose of the study:

        1. To examine the prevalence and types of arrhythmias in patients undergoing a medical
           procedure performed under local anesthesia

        2. Examine whether adding adrenaline to the local anesthetics affects the incidence of
           arrhythmia Determining the prevalence and types of arrhythmia will help determine the
           need for monitoring and type of monitoring required during procedures under local
           anesthesia.

      The patients:

      500 patients undergoing surgery or a medical procedure in which a local anesthetic is used at
      Meir Hospital. Patients with a medical history of known cardiac arrhythmia will not be
      included.

      Methods:

      Patients will undergo the medical procedure prescribed for them, using local anesthesia with
      or without adrenaline, at the discretion of the surgeon, in accordance with the usual routine
      being applied nowadays. The amount and type of anesthesia used will be registered. In
      addition to the routine monitoring that is currently performed (blood pressure cuff and
      non-invasive blood oxygen saturation) a continuous ECG monitoring device will be connected
      prior to the beginning of the surgical procedure, until the patient is discharged from the
      recovery room. The ECG monitoring results will be analyzed to detect arrhythmia. Side effects
      being reported by patients (palpitations, dizziness, fainting, CPR {cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation} ) will be recorded. In cases that an arrhythmia is detected, the type of
      arrhythmia and the presence of clinical symptoms will be investigated.
