    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter study investigating the clinical efficacy of repetitive
      daylight-PDT with MAL (Methylaminolevulinate) compared to cryosurgery in regard to
      prophylaxis and treatment of AKs (actinic keratoses) in the face. Patients will be randomly
      allocated to treatment groups. 5 PDT (photodynamic therapy) treatment sessions (visits 1-5)
      will be performed within 18 months. In the control group, cryosurgery will be performed at
      visit 1, and in case of non-cleared or newly occurred AKs at visits 2-5.

      In the PDT group the patients will apply a chemical sunscreen (SPF 50+) to the whole face and
      other light-exposed, unprotected areas of the skin. After at least 15 minutes a lesion
      preparation of AKs (removal of crusts) will be performed and MAL will be applied in a thin
      layer to the whole face. Within 30 min after MAL application patients expose themselves to
      daylight for 2 hours. In the control group, cryosurgery will be performed using liquid
      nitrogen spray in each AK lesion; this will be done at visit 1 and, if necessary, also at
      visits 2-5. At visits 2-6, the efficacy of the treatment will be evaluated by the observer by
      documenting all existing and newly appearing AKs in the face.

      This study is a multicenter study investigating the clinical efficacy of repetitive
      daylight-PDT with MAL compared to cryosurgery in regard to prophylaxis and treatment of AKs
      in the face. Patients will be randomly allocated to treatment groups. 5 PDT treatment
      sessions (visits 1-5) will be performed within 18 months. In the control group, cryosurgery
      will be performed at visit 1, and in case of non-cleared or newly occurred AKs at visits 2-5.

      Before application of the photosensitizer, an organic sunscreen (Actinica® lotion, LSF 50+)
      without mineral filters will be applied In the entire face.

      After an absorption time of approximately 15 minutes and before applying MAL (Metvix®), the
      surface of the AK lesions will be prepared gently with a curette or a scalpel to remove
      scales and crusts and roughen the surface of the AK-lesions. This is to facilitate
      penetration of the cream and light to the AK lesions.

      After lesion preparation, MAL (Metvix®) will be uniformly applied on the whole face in a thin
      layer.

      Within 30 min after MAL application the patients go outside and expose themselves for 2 hours
      to daylight. Daylight-PDT can be performed from March until October, during non-rainy weather
      with an outdoor temperature of at least 10° Celsius. Daylight exposure must start at least 3
      hours before sunset.

      At the end of the exposure, residual photosensitizer is washed off and the patients spend the
      rest of the day indoors.

      Cryosurgery of AK lesions will be investigated as standard reference therapy. Single
      freeze-thaw cryosurgery is performed using an open spraying procedure with liquid nitrogen
      with nozzle size C. After formation of an ice-ball of the required size, freeze time starts.
      Freeze time should lie between 5 s and 10 s.
