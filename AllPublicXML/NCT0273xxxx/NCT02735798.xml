  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm pilot study of 64Cu-MM-302 and unlabeled MM-302 in combination with
      trastuzumab in 10 patients with advanced HER2+ cancer with new or progressive brain
      metastases. Patients will receive standard imaging at baseline, including FDG-PET/CT plus MR
      brain imaging. Patients will subsequently start protocol therapy with MM-302 and trastuzumab
      given on day 1 of an every 21-day dosing cycle, at the recommended phase 2 dose of 30 mg/m2.
      Patients will receive 64Cu-labeled MM-302 (3-5 mg/m2 doxorubicin) three hours after unlabeled
      dose of MM-302. Integrated MR/PET imaging of the brain and whole body will be performed at
      two time points following 64Cu-labeled MM-302 administration: (1) within 3 hours (+/- 1 hour)
      of labeled drug injection, and (2) 24 hours (+/- 6 hours) post-injection. Patients will
      continue to receive subsequent doses of unlabeled MM-302 plus trastuzumab every 3 weeks until
      clinical or radiographic disease progression (either in the brain or systemically) or
      unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs soonest. MR brain imaging and FDG-PET/CT scans will
      be performed every 9 weeks to monitor for treatment response and disease progression.
