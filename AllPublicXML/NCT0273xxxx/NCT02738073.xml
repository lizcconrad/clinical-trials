  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid (TA) inhibits fibrinolysis by binding to lysine binding-sites of plasminogen
      to fibrin. Fibrinolysis is stimulated by surgical trauma, and the administration of TA has
      been shown effective in decreasing blood loss both intra-operatively and in the immediate
      post-operative period in elective hip and knee arthroplasty patients. Both the timing and
      dosing of TA has been investigated in these patients. Subsequent blood transfusion rate has
      also been shown to decrease as result of TA administration. Despite the support for TA
      utilization that exists in the arthroplasty literature, the data is scarce regarding its
      administration during surgical treatment of hip fractures. This is patient population who is
      at high risk for transfusion due to symptomatic post-operative anemia. This study aims to
      investigate whether TA's advantageous effects in the arthroplasty patient population can be
      extrapolated to the more unstable, heterogeneous hip fracture patient population. If the
      study is able to show a difference in blood loss and transfusion requirement, the long term
      implications of this with regards to cost and mortality can be significant.

    <description>This study aims to investigate the effect of tranexamic acid (TA) on blood loss and transfusion requirement during the perioperative period in patients who are admitted to the hospital with fracture of the hip and undergo surgical treatment. Both the drop in hemoglobin level from time of surgery (T0 being defined as just prior to surgery, while the patient waits in surgical holding area) over the subsequent several days, as well as post-operative transfusion rate, will be measured. The researchers' hypothesis is that both the hemoglobin drop and the subsequent transfusion requirement in patients who receive TA will be less than those who received saline placebo.</description>
