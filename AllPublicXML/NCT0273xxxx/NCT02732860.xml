  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By obtaining clinical specimens from participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC),
      colorectal cancer (CRC), high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), and other select tumor
      types to establish and profile as freshly implanted tumors in mice, the aim of this study is
      to identify agents with predicted activity in the host patient while also potentially
      providing them with personalized cancer treatment options

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Personalized patient-derived xenografts (pPDX) are increasingly used as tools for drug
      development in pre-clinical settings, and have been shown to recapitulate the histology and
      behavior of the cancers from which they are derived. Although, they have been commonly used
      productively as pre-clinical disease models to study disease biology and drug response, they
      have not been used prospectively to inform clinical management. pPDX have been employed to
      inform clinical decision-making in small studies, which have shown high concordance between
      individual pPDX and patient responses to therapy. While encouraging, the role of this
      approach in breast, colorectal, ovarian, and other cancer populations and in the context of
      genomic drug matching strategies remains undefined. This has created an opportunity to
      evaluate the utility of pPDX as clinical predictors to direct the use of chemo- and targeted
      therapies in combination with comprehensive genomic and epigenetic analysis for patients with
      TNBC, CRC, HGSOC and other selected tumor types.
