      The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of Bepanthen® wound healing
      ointment compared to placebo in a superficial abrasive wound model. The primary objective was
      the re-epithelization at Day 5.

      The secondary objectives were re-epithelization at Days 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 15,
      assessment of cosmetic outcome/acceptance at Day 15 (investigator only) and at Day 36
      (investigator and subject), and documentation and analysis of safety parameters.
