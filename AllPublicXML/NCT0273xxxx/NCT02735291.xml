  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 trial will treat the patients who have recurrent or
      refractory acute non T lymphocyte leukemia with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that
      have been genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that will bind to
      tumour cells that express the EPCAM protein on the cell surface.The study will determine if
      these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells.The trial will
      also study the safety of treatment with CAR-T,how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body
      and the impact of this treatment on survival.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm,multicenter Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      CAR-T for recurrent or refractory acute non T lymphocyte leukemia.The study will be conducted
      using a phase I/II design.The study will have the following sequential phases:Part A
      (screening leukapheresis, cell product preparation, and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and Part
      B (treatment and follow-up). The follow-up period for each participant is approximately 35
      months after the final CAR-T infusion. The total duration of the study is expected to be
      approximately 3 years. A total of 24 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.
