             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan) disease despite castrate levels of testosterone
             (&lt;50 ng/dL) due to orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
             agonist. Castrate levels of testosterone must be maintained.

          -  Patients must be either:

               -  Currently on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and not progressing; OR

               -  Pre-abiraterone and pre-enzalutamide with demonstrated evidence of progressive
                  disease. Defined as at least one of the following:

          -  Measurable Disease Progression: &gt;20% increase in the sum of diameters of measurable
             lesions from the time of maximal regression or appearance of one or more new lesions.

          -  Bone Scan Progression: Appearance of one or more new lesions on bone scan attributable
             to prostate cancer.

          -  Prostate- specific antigen (PSA) Progression: An elevated PSA ≥2 ng/ml that has risen
             serially on at least two occasions, each at least one week apart (PSA1 &lt; PSA2 &lt; PSA3).
             If the 3rd PSA value is less than the 2nd PSA value, than an additional test for
             rising PSA is required to document progression. (For the purposes of the nomogram
             calculator, the last PSA value recorded prior to initiation of the intervention will
             be considered the baseline PSA)

          -  On Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) with a Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
             agonist/antagonist or prior bilateral orchiectomy. All patients will be required to be

             to three days per week for four weeks during cycle 0, two days per week for cycles 1-8
             (32 weeks) and once per week for cycles 9-11 (12 weeks). In addition, patients must be
             able to attend exercise testing visits as outlined in the Table 1.Required Initial
             Laboratory Values:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/uL

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limits of normal

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limits of normal

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 1.5 x upper limits of normal

               -  Serum testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL

          -  Medical clearance to undergo a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)
             and vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise training.

             o Appendix 8: Patients must answer 'No' to all questions. If patients answered 'Yes'
             to only Questions 8-11, they will be considered eligible upon physician clearance

          -  Successfully pass the screening CPET by achieving:

             o Volitional exhaustion (RPE ≥ 9 using the 0-10 RPE scale) after 8 (or more) minutes,
             in the absence of any cardiorespiratory abnormalities.

          -  If cardiorespiratory abnormalities are identified, please refer the patient to his
             managing physician for further assessment and diagnosis.

          -  Note: To assist practitioners with delivering valid CPET assessments, patients nearing
             exhaustion should achieve a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of ≥1.1.

          -  RER is not a criteria of the test. This objective measure should only be used to
             assist practitioners with patient management and decision-making.

          -  Exercise Coordination Centre (ECC) review and approval of subject's screening bone
             scan/ areas with bone metastases.

          -  Subject is willing and able to use the technological aspects of the trial.

          -  The subject is fluent in the language as designated by the institution at which he
             would be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous progression (radiographic or PSA progression) while on treatment with
             abiraterone, enzalutamide, or a combination.

          -  Previously identified small cell neuroendocrine tumours or pure small cell carcinoma

             are allowed to be treated with chemotherapy during the duration of the trial. Patients
             who have received chemotherapy as part of initial androgen deprivation therapy for
             metastatic castration sensitive disease are eligible.

          -  Currently receiving experimental treatment with non-approved drugs at the time of
             enrolment. Patients must undergo a 28-day washout between last dose and screening
             CPET.

          -  Poorly controlled hypertension. During screening ≥2/3 of readings must be &lt; 160/90,

          -  Medical condition such as uncontrolled infection or cardiac disease that, in the
             opinion of the physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the
             patient (see Section 4.4-4.10).

          -  Patients with a currently active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer. Patients are not considered to have a currently active malignancy if they have
             completed necessary therapy and are considered by their physician to be at &lt;30% risk
             of relapse at time of assessment.

          -  Psychiatric illness, which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent or
             adhering to the study protocol.

          -  Serious or non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.

          -  Known spinal cord compromise or instrumentation due to metastatic disease. Radiation
             therapy for metastatic disease is allowed.

             impairment

          -  Ongoing restriction of physical activity with physician documentation

          -  Has chest pain brought on by physical activity

          -  Has developed chest pain in the past month

          -  Moderate-to-severe bone pain (i.e., National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology
             Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2-3 bone pain).

          -  Men who do not complete the baseline lifestyle and quality-of-life questionnaires and
             3-days of diet diaries or Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) (TBD) will not be
             eligible
