  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to assess the effect of trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      on cognitive control, working memory, functional, clinical, and cognitive outcomes in
      schizophrenia patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive functions and EEG correlates will be thoroughly assessed in schizophrenia patients
      undergoing a tDCS treatment and compared with patients receiving a placebo stimulation. The
      treatment will involve 20 minutes of tDCS application to the left prefrontal and
      temporo-parietal cortex, twice a day for five days, a procedure shown to be effective in
      improving other symptoms of psychosis such as negative symptoms and hallucinations.
      Critically, in addition to standard neuropsychological testing, cognitive assessments will
      involve tasks that tap cognitive control and working memory, impairments in which comprise
      two of the core cognitive disturbances in schizophrenia and which have been linked to brain
      rhythm disturbances measurable by EEG recordings. Investigators will also assess changes in
      functional outcome by tDCS and investigate relationships between improvements in cognition,
      brain rhythms and functional outcome. All these assessments will occur just prior to tDCS
      application, just after completion of the tDCS series, and then again at 2 months follow-up.
      There will be two separate independent groups of patients who will be randomized to active
      versus sham treatments. The first group will have early course schizophrenia (less than 5
      years of antipsychotic treatment; n=40). The second group will be chronic schizophrenia
      (greater than 5 years of antipsychotic treatment; n=40).

      Relevance

      This proposal would be the first integrated study of the effects of tDCS on cognitive
      symptoms, brain function and functional outcome in schizophrenia. A positive outcome would
      represent a marked improvement in clinical therapeutics for cognition in psychosis and
      provide a powerful tool for improving functional outcome in this debilitating disorder.
      Understanding the impact on brain rhythm disturbances could support the study of similar
      stimulation-based therapeutic approaches to other neuropsychiatric disorders that shows
      similar disturbances in cognition and brain rhythms activity, such as bipolar disorder and
      autism.

    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess cognitive control using the Preparing to Overcome Prepotency (POP) task. The accuracy mean differences between the high and low control conditions will be used as dependent measures.
The study is powered at 0.8 to observe a post-pre treatment improvement in cognitive control with a substantial effect size (d=0.56) compared to sham stimulation with effects relatively stable measured 2 months after baseline. The hypothesized effect size will be d=0.60.</description>

    <description>The investigators will assess working memory using a working memory task. The accuracy mean differences between the high and low control conditions will be used as dependent measures.
The study is powered at 0.8 to observe a post-pre treatment improvement in cognitive control with a substantial effect size (d=0.56) compared to sham stimulation with effects relatively stable measured 2 months after baseline. The hypothesized effect size will be d=0.60.</description>

    <measure>Negative Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure is the severity of negative symptoms as quantified by Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). This study is powered at 0.8 to observe a post-pre treatment improvement in negative symptoms with a moderate effect size (d=0.56) compared to sham stimulation with effects relatively stable measured 2 months after baseline. The hypothesized effect size will be d=0.60.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Auditory Hallucinations</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure is the change over time in the severity of auditory hallucinations as assessed by the Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale (AHRS).
In a study conducted using a similar montage and current strength (Brunelin et. al 2012), a reduction in auditory hallucinations with a substantial effect size (d=1.58) was observed in 30 patients with schizophrenia. However, as their study recruited only those patients with severe hallucinations while the current study does not have such an inclusion criterion. The investigators expect a more modest effect size of d=0.60.</description>
