    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, investigator blinded, vehicle controlled trial using
      intra-individual comparison (right half-face versus left half-face).

      Subjects will have each half-face randomized to one of the two following treatments:

        -  Adapalene 0.3% - BPO 2.5% gel (TactuPump® Forte).

        -  Vehicle gel

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effect of Adapalene 0.3% - benzoyl
      peroxide (BPO) 2.5% gel versus vehicle gel on the risk of formation of atrophic acne scars in
      moderate to severe acne subjects.
