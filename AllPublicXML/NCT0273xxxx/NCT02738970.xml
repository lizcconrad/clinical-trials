  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a two-part design. Part 1 is designed to determine the optimal dose of
      subcutaneous (SC) Perjeta, injected alone or mixed with Herceptin, that results in comparable
      exposure to intravenous (IV) Perjeta. Exposure between SC Perjeta and IV Perjeta will be
      compared using a compilation of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time of maximum
      concentration (Tmax), and serum trough concentration (Ctrough). Part 2 is designed to confirm
      the dosing regimen in women with EBC on the basis of safety, tolerability, and PK
      assessments.
