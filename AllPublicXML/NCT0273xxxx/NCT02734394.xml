    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to help to manage the many cancer treatment side effects
      through cardiovascular and resistance exercise, and education with the goal of using program
      outcomes to contribute to current research.

      This study is a single group pre-test post-test design.There are 4 optional measures that
      will be presented to participants from which they can choose to participate or not. These are
      presented with check boxes in the consent form. After completion of the University of
      Waterloo (UW) WELL-FIT program, participants will be given an option to continue with an
      exercise program; they will be offered the Graduate Program. Following consent of Graduate
      Program, repeated measures would be taken annually. At the time of consent, they will have
      the option to have their data used in research. At any point in their involvement of the
      exercise based programs, they can indicate &quot;they no longer want to participate in the program
      or the data collection&quot;. Their medical care or participation in the UW WELL-FIT program will
      not be affected.
