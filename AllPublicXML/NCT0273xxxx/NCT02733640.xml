  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators sought to evaluate the influence of pantoprazole, indicated as less
      effective than other proton pump inhibitors, on the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, with
      stratification of the population according to the presence of cytochrome (CYP) 2C19
      polymorphism.

      Participants being treated with a maintenance dose of 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg aspirin
      daily after previous PCI with coronary stenting were included in the study. Participants were
      randomly assigned to either the pantoprazole 40 mg once-daily group or the ranitidine 150 mg
      twice-daily group using a computer-generated randomized table. An independent investigator
      generated the random allocation sequence. Blood samples were collected at 9:00 on day prior
      to treatment (day 0) and on day 9. Measuring impedance was performed by one independent
      investigator in a blinded manner.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients being treated with a maintenance dose of 75 mg clopidogrel and 100 mg aspirin
             daily after previous PCI with coronary stenting were included in the study. All
             patients received standardized therapy with a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel
             hydrogen sulfate and 400 mg aspirin.

        All participants had a normal platelet count (150,000-450,000/mL).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe liver disorders, current gastrointestinal disorders, a current
             infection, congestive heart failure, or a known bleeding disorder as well as patients
             on bivalirudin or glycoprotein IIb/III antagonists within the last 7 days were
             excluded from the study.
