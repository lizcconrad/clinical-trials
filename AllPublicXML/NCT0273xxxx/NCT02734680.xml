      The trial is funded by Cancer Foundation of China. The trial is prepared to be registered on
      the clinicaltrail.gov.

      Quality assurance plan: every participant is enrolled or excluded by two practiced
      investigators. And two investigators participated in all steps of the trail, including the
      record of the data, and the investigators will compare the data. If the data is consistent,
      the investigators would record the data; if not, the data would be checked and decided by the
      two investigators. All the steps and data are site monitored and audited by the workers of
      research and financial department of National Cancer Center/ Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy
      of Medical Sciences.

      Data check: the investigators compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules
      for range or consistency with other data fields in the registry.

      Source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of
      registry data by comparing the data to external data sources, including medical records and
      electronic case report forms.

      Data dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry,
      including the source of the variable, coding information, and normal ranges if relevant.

      Standard Operating Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as
      participants recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, reporting for
      adverse events, and change management. All registry operations would be done according to
      specific steps, and by two practiced investigators.

      Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary
      to demonstrate an effect. According to the formula to differ advantages and disadvantages,
      the investigators need at least 70 participants to take part in the trail. The investigators
      can recruit about 35 participants every year according to previous experiences, so the
      investigators should recruit at least for two years.

      Plan for missing data: the investigators would collect as much data as possible, and the
      investigators exclude the participants who cannot cooperate on recruitment. And the
      investigators manage situations according to statistical principles where variables are
      reported as missing, unavailable, &quot;non-reported,&quot; uninterpretable, or considered missing
      because of data inconsistency or out-of-range results.

      Statistical analysis plan: Kaplan-Meier method would be used to analyze the difference of
      survival time between the two groups, and the local control rate of the two groups would be
      compared by chi square test. Statistical analyses would be performed by using IBM SPSS
      Statistics(version 20; IBM, Chicago, USA). The level of significance is defined as P &lt; 0.05.
