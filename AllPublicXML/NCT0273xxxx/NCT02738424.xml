    <textblock>
      Lumbar spine bone marrow is well explored in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) but some bone
      marrow diseases are hard to analyze with this method. Furthermore, there is heterogeneity in
      normal bone marrow, called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Histological and technical
      factors appear to be the cause, but the possible influence of the employed post-processing
      software has never yet been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is
      variability in lumbar bone ADC related to the post-processing software.

      Lumbar spine bone marrow is well explored in MRI. Some bone marrow diseases are hard to
      analyze in conventional MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) could be an additional
      diagnostic feature. However, according to the literature, there is heterogeneity in normal
      bone marrow of the quantitative parameter that it provides, called apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC). Histological and technical factors appear to be the cause, but the
      possible influence of the employed post-processing software has never yet been evaluated. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if there is variability in lumbar bone ADC related to
      the post-processing software.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ADC Score according to the post-processing software used</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The ADC Score will be calculated for each patient, with three different post-processing softwares : Siemens, PACS (picture archiving and communication system) Carestream, Osirix. The scores will be compared, because the aim of this study is to demonstrate the variability of this score, according to the post-processing software used.
Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a measure of the magnitude of diffusion (of water molecules) within tissue, and is commonly clinically calculated using Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). An ADC of a tissue is expressed in units of mm2/s. There is no unanimity regarding the boundaries of the range of normal diffusion, but ADC values less than 1.0 to 1.1 x 10-3 mm2/s (or 1000-1100 x 10-6 mm2/s) are generally acknowledged in adults as indicating restriction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ADC Score according to the intensity of MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The ADC Score will also be compared to the intensity of the Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed for each patient. Half have received a MRI of 1,5 Tesla and the other hand a 3 Tesla MRI. The variability between these two groups will be compared in the secondary outcome.</description>
