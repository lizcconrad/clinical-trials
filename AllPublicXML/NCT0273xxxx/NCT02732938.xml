      The purpose of this Phase 1b/2 study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, characterize the
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and overall safety profile of escalated doses of PF-04136309
      and the associated schedule, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to assess the
      enhancement of efficacy of PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
      versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + placebo in terms of Progression Free Survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has 2 parts:

      Phase 1b (dose-finding cohorts) will be open label as patients will receive ascending doses
      of PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine. The observation period for
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be from Day 1 to Day 28. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of PF-04136309 will also be assessed. The criteria for dose
      escalation will be based on a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method. After
      evaluating the safety and other results (eg, PK) from patients enrolled in the dose
      escalation cohorts, a dose level will be selected to be further evaluated as the Recommended
      Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). A minimum of 6 patients, up to 12 patients, will be treated at this dose
      level to establish it as the RP2D. To further evaluate safety and pharmacodynamics, the
      number of patients enrolled during this part of the study (Phase 1b) may be N up to 20. The
      study will stop if all PF-04136309 doses explored appear to be overly toxic.

      Phase 2 randomized double blinded placebo control. Approximately 92 patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive the RP2D of PF-04136309 in combination with nab-paclitaxel +
      gemcitabine (ARM A; n=46) versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + placebo (ARM B; n=46). The
      primary objective will be the enhancement of efficacy in terms of PFS.

      Patients will be treated as long as they are clinically benefiting from investigational
      product without unacceptable toxicity, objective disease progression, or withdrawal of
      consent.
