    <textblock>
      A two armed randomized trial is evaluating the effect of the medical-student-delivered
      school-based intervention Education Against Tobacco on the smoking behavior of adolescents in
      7-11th grade of secondary schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The primary endpoint is the
      change in smoking prevalence between the two groups.
