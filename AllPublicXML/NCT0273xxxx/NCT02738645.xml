    <textblock>
      From 2003 when Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS) appearedï¼Œmany new types of
      respiratory viruses emerge in endlessly. Therefore, the epidemiology and the clinical
      character has changed quietly, especially severe pneumonia. This cohort study aim to obtain
      the contents of severe pneumonia patients in Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU). Through
      the clinical data analysis, the investigators could get the information of the pneumonia
      caused by different reasons, such as morbidity and mortality, risk factors, clinical symptoms
      and radiographic changes, the respiratory support parameter and so on. The investigators hope
      the result could guide them do the clinical work of severe pneumonia better in the future.
