  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multi-site, non-randomized, open-label study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of MK-7625A 1.5 g (ceftolozane 1 g/tazobactam 0.5 g) plus metronidazole 500 mg for
      the treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (cIAI) in Japanese participants.
      Efficacy will be primarily assessed by clinical response defined as complete resolution or
      significant improvement in signs and symptoms of the index infection.

             progression of the infection beyond the gallbladder wall; diverticular disease with
             perforation or abscess; appendiceal perforation or periappendiceal abscess; acute
             gastric or duodenal perforation, traumatic perforation of the intestine; peritonitis
             due to perforated viscus or following a prior operative procedure; or Intra-abdominal
