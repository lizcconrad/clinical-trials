  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neuro-degenerative disease,
      counted among atypical parkinsonism (AP). Medical treatment and rehabilitation are extremely
      limited in AP, therefore it would be very useful to find new ways to improve motor and non
      motor symptoms in PSP. The Brainway Deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a new
      technology of TMS using a particular coil, i.e. H-coil, able to stimulate deeper regions of
      the brain. Only few studies in literature have evaluated the efficacy of DTMS in Parkinson's
      Disease and parkinsonism; in particular in PSP patients, a case report showed an improvement
      in language.

      Materials and Methods: This study was a pilot, randomized, cross-over, double blind trial. It
      was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Deep TMS in terms of recovery of motor functions,
      freezing of gait, and cognitive decline in patients with PSP. Nineteen subject underwent 14
      session of high frequency DTMS over a 4 weeks period. The target were the left Broca and
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

    <description>Each DTMS session consisted in two consecutive stimulations: a first low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation in the motor cortex (110% of the motor threshold, for 15 minutes)and a second high-frequency (10Hz) one in the prefrontal cortex (100% motor threshold, 2 seconds each train, 20 seconds between trains, for 15 minutes).The coil contains two symmetric devices, perfectly designed to rouse both hemispheres at the same time.</description>

    <description>The Brainsway DTMS produces a time-varying magnetic field and, based on Faraday's Law, it can be assumed that a time-varying magnetic field generates an electrical current in a nearby conductive substance. The induced electric current in the cortex travels in an orthogonal path in the direction of the magnetic field with the maximum strength and current located beneath the coil in the helmet placed on the patient's head and transmits magnetic pulses to the patient's brain. The induced current is tangential to the scalp at the cortical surface, and decreases in magnitude with increasing depth.
Patients underwent 12 sessions, 3 times a week, of repetitive DTMS using the novel H2-coil (Brainsway LDT).</description>
