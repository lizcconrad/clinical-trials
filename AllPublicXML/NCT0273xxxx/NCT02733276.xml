    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common symptom in inflammatory bowel diseaseI and persists despite clinical
      remission. Fatigue in patients with chronic diseases can be objectified by the FACIT-F scale.
      Acupuncture has been shown useful in the treatment of fatigue in various chronic diseases.

      This study evaluates the effect of electroacupuncture in the treatment of fatigue in patients
      with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease.

      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe fatigue (FACIT-F score &lt;38) who agree to
      participate in the study will be randomized to three different treatments: electroacupuncture
      vs. sham electroacupuncture vs. control group.

      Fatigue is a common symptom in inflammatory bowel disease and persists despite clinical
      remission. Fatigue in patients with chronic diseases can be objectified by the FACIT-F scale.
      Acupuncture has been shown useful in the treatment of fatigue in various chronic diseases.

      This study evaluates the effect of electroacupuncture in the treatment of fatigue in patients
      with quiescent inflammatory bowel disease.

      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe fatigue (FACIT-F score &lt; 38) who agree to
      participate in the study will be randomized to three different treatments: electroacupuncture
      vs. sham electroacupuncture vs. group control.

      Treatment consists of a total of 9 sessions / patient (2 sessions / week the first week and
      then one session / week for two months).

      During and after treatment, patients fill in questionnaires to assess fatigue, anxiety,
      depression, quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease and sleepiness. Those patients who
      do not improve with the initial treatment or present a recurrence of fatigue (defined as a
      decrease of at least 4 points in the FACIT-F score) then receive crossover treatment for 8
      more weeks (total of 9 new sessions).

      The control group fill in questionnaires in the same periods as patients who receive active
      treatment. These patients (control group) receive electroacupuncture sessions(total of 9
      sessions) in a second period.
