    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study in two parts. In the first part, F901318 (dose 2 mg/kg IV
      over 4 hours, Day 1) will be followed by F901318 (2 mg/kg IV over 4 hours) given on Day 8,
      after dosing with fluconazole 800 mg daily for 1 day (Day 4) and 400 mg daily orally for 4
      days (Days 5 to 8). Up to twenty subjects will be included in two cohorts which will undergo
      the same dosing schedules of fluconazole and F901318 and undergo the same procedures. The
      first cohort will consist of 12 subjects studied in two groups of six subjects each. If there
      is clearly a difference in F901318 kinetics detectable before and after dosing with
      fluconazole in this first cohort, the second cohort will not be studied. If there is no clear
      difference, the second cohort will also be studied to give a final result. In this cohort,
      based on the pharmacokinetic findings in cohort 1, the dose of F901318 may be increased to up
      to 4 mg/kg to establish a dose suitable for phase 2 evaluation. PK sampling for plasma
      F901318 will continue from before the first dose up to and including 72 hours after dosing.
      PK sampling for fluconazole will continue from before the first dose and up to 72 hours after
      the fifth dose. A follow up visit will be conducted 7 +/- 2 days after discharge from the
      clinical unit following completion of blood sampling following the second dose of F901318 and
      the fifth dose of fluconazole.

      The second part of the study will take place if no appreciable change in the pharmacokinetics
      of either F901318 or fluconazole has been observed in either the first or the second cohorts
      in the first part of the study. This second part will enrol 12 subjects. These subjects will
      receive fluconazole 800 mg daily for one day (Day 1) and 400 mg daily orally for 4 days (Days
      2 to 5) in combination with F901318 which will be given in a dose of up to 4 mg/kg IV bid for
      one day (Day 1) followed by 7 doses of intravenous F901318 up to 2.5 mg/kg bid (Days 2 to 5).
      Pharmacokinetic profiles of F901318 and fluconazole will be obtained during dosing and over a
      72-hour period following the final dose of both compounds.

      site until completion of the 72-hour post fluconazole and F901318 dose study-related
      procedures on Day 11. Admission procedures (Day -1) include a review of inclusion/exclusion
      criteria, weight, vital signs, test for drugs of abuse, alcohol and smoking and pregnancy
      where appropriate (must be negative), and a review of concomitant medication and adverse
      events. Blood (haematology, clinical chemistry and coagulation function) and urine
      (urinalysis) will be obtained for safety evaluations. Breakfast will be taken 30-60 minutes
      prior to dosing)

      breakfast is taken.

      Vital signs (supine and standing pulse rate and blood pressure and oral temperature) will be

      and at the following time points:

      48 hours

      Days 8-11: Subjects will fast for 12 hours before dosing on Day 8. Water will be allowed ad
