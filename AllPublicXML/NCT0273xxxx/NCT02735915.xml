  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the persistence of immune response to the HZ vaccine
      as well as safety up to 10 years after the first dose of initial vaccination course. This
      study will also assess immune responses after re-vaccination with 2 additional doses of the
      HZ/su administered at ten years after first dose of initial vaccination course from study
      Zoster-003 (NCT00434577).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this LTFU study (ZOSTER-060), subjects who received 2 doses of HZ/su in the earlier
      Zoster-003 (NCT00434577) study will be followed up at Month 108/Year 9 and Month 120/Year 10
      post first dose of vaccine for safety and immunogenicity (humoral and cellular). In order to
      assess the effect of re-vaccination with 2 additional doses of HZ/su vaccine, all the
      subjects will receive 2 additional doses of the HZ/su vaccine, on a 0, 2-month schedule at
      ten years after the initial vaccination course in study Zoster-003 (NCT00434577), and will be
      followed for reactogenicity, safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity (including
      persistence).

      In alignment with the previous persistence timepoints, this study has no control group.

        E.g., inactivated and subunit vaccines, including inactivated and subunit influenza
        vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.

          -  Previous vaccination against HZ since initial vaccination in Zoster-003.
