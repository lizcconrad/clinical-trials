      The purpose of this research study is to test a new way to deliver oncology and palliative
      care for patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  The goal of this study is to test a model where oncology and palliative care work
           together to care for participants with metastatic breast cancer who were recently
           admitted to the hospital or have new or worsening cancer involving their brain or the
           fluid around the brain or spinal cord.

        -  The investigators are studying whether participants who receive care from both teams
           have better communication about their care and improved quality of life and mood
           compared to those receiving care from only their oncologists.

      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to conduct a randomized trial testing the
      impact of the collaborative palliative and oncology care model or standard oncology care
      models among patients with poor prognosis metastatic breast cancer. Participants assigned to
      the intervention arm will participate in a series of structured palliative care visits,
      following tailored clinical practice guidelines previously developed for patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

    <textblock>
      This research study tests whether or not the earlier introduction of a team of clinicians
      that specialize in the lessening (palliation) of symptoms and addressing quality of life
      concerns may improve the end-of-life care, quality of life, and mood of women with poor
      prognosis metastatic breast cancer.

      Palliative care is a specific type of medical care given to patients to improve their pain
      and other symptoms like fatigue, and to support patients and their families as they cope with
      their illness. Palliative care includes physicians and advanced practice nurses who have been
      specifically trained in how to help patients with serious illness.

      Increasingly, the role of palliative care has been shown to benefit patients when introduced
      early in the disease trajectory. For example, in patients with metastatic (or spread) lung
      cancer, early involvement of palliative care improves patients' quality of life and mood.
      Patients with some metastatic cancers, like breast cancer, have an unpredictable disease
      trajectory, which makes it difficult to determine the best time to introduce palliative care
      services.
