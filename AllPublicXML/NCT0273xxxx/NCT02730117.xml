  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to determine if early initiation of renal replacement therapy guided by

      patients with acute kidney injury

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age older than 18 years old and admission in an ICU

          -  Acute kidney injury (defined by serum creatinine increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or urine output
             ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour according to KDIGO criteria)

          -  Informed consent provided by the patient or person with decisional responsibility

          -  Indwelling bladder catheter

          -  Documented cause of acute kidney injury from acute tubular necrosis e.g. presence of
             granular or epithelial casts on urine sediment, FeNa more than 1%, Feurea more than
             50%, urine or plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) more than 150
             mg/dL

          -  Opinion of the treating clinical team that patient was well resuscitated and
             sufficiently clinically stable for the intervention or by noninvasive or invasive
             measurements i.e. fluid accumulation at least 5% plus at least one of the following
             e.g. chest radiography, central venous pressure ≥ 8 mmHg, pulse pressure variation &lt;
             13%, inferior vena cava collapsibility index &lt; 50% in spontaneously breathing patients
             or distensibility index &lt; 18% in mechanically ventilated patients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL (male) and ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (female) within 3 months

          -  Evidence of volume depletion at the time of furosemide administration or active
             bleeding

          -  Evidence of obstructive uropathy, renal vein thrombosis or renal artery stenosis,
             thrombotic microangiopathy, glomerulonephritis, tumor lysis syndrome

          -  History of renal allograft

          -  Known pregnancy

          -  Allergy or known sensitivity to loop diuretics

          -  Need for emergency renal replacement therapy at randomization or evaluation by the
             clinical team that the renal replacement therapy should be deferred

          -  Patient is moribund with expected death within 24 hr or whom survival to 28 days is
             unlikely due to an uncontrollable comorbidity (cardiac, pulmonary or hepatic end-stage
             disease; hepatorenal syndrome; poorly controlled cancer; severe post-anoxic
             encephalopathy; etc.)

          -  Patients with advance directives issued expressing the desire not to be resuscitated

          -  Prior treatment with RRT within 30 days
