  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study aimed to assess long-term safety and
      efficacy of SPN-812 ER when administered alone or in conjunction with an Food and Drug
      Administration-approved Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication in the
      treatment of ADHD in pediatric subjects who have participated in a previous blinded study of
      SPN-812 ER. All pediatric subjects who complete a blinded study of SPN 812 ER will have the
      option to participate in this study in which all subjects receive SPN-812 ER. After an
      initial dose, subjects will enter an dose optimization phase for three to nine weeks.
      Following optimization, subjects will return to the clinic every 3 months or until the
      subject discontinues or the study ends at 36 months.
