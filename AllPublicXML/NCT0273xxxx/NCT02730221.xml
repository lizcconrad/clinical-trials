      A prospective observational study in the Intensive Care Unit and the Medium Care Unit in a
      university hospital in Amsterdam. Recent studies show that administrative tasks occupy more
      than 30% of the workload. One-third of these administrative tasks is unrelated to care. The
      administrative workload of physicians and nurses will be observed and quantified using two
      different methods. The amount of time physicians and nurses are logged on into the patient
      data management system (PDMS) will be measured and the time spent on different work tasks
      will be monitored with a work sampling method. Two different patient data management systems
      will be compared.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, regulatory authorities request a growing number of protocols and checklists
      to improve healthcare. Though the intention is to prevent medical mistakes and to improve
      patient care, these demands might result in an increased administrative workload for
      physicians and nurses. Recent studies show that administrative tasks and documentation occupy
      more than thirty percent of the workload of physicians, of which one-third is unrelated to
      care. This time spent on administration could lower the amount of time spent with the patient
      and the patient's family. In the Intensive Care Unit and the Medium Care Unit, most of the
      administrative tasks are executed within the patient data management system. The way an
      electronic patient data management system is set up could impact the administrative workload
      for physicians and nurses. A prospective observational study at the department of Intensive
      and Medium Care of the University medical centre will be performed with the aim to quantify
      the time spent on direct patient care versus administrative work. Two different patient data
      management systems will be compared at different points in time. The Nursing Activity Score
      and other patient characteristics will be registered for all the admitted patients during the
      two study periods.

      The administrative workload of physicians and nurses will be measured before and after the
      implementation of a new patient data management system, using the following methods:

        -  Login time in the electronic patient data management system during fourteen consecutive
           days in the Intensive Care Unit and the Medium Care Unit

        -  Timing of activities of physicians and nurses with a work sampling method during five
           consecutive day shifts in the Intensive Care Unit
