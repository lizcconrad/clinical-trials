    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective study of patients who undergo platelet-rich therapy (PRT)
      for facial rejuvenation at NYU Langone Medical Center. PRT has been increasingly used for
      wound healing, fat grafting, hemostasis as well as facial enhancement. PRT involves injection
      of patient's own platelets and fibrin, and has evolved as a less invasive technique for
      facial rejuvenation compared to more traditional techniques. Through the use of pre and post
      treatment photos, in addition to the FACE-Q Questionnaire and a clinician assessment, it is
      our hope that we will confirm the rejuvenating capabilities of PRT.

    <textblock>
      To assess patient-reported satisfaction of using platelet rich therapy for facial
      rejuvenation using a validated questionnaire (the FACE-Q scale). This is a prospective study
      of patients who will undergo platelet-rich therapy for facial rejuvenation at NYU Langone
      Medical Center. Platelet rich therapy (PRT) has been increasingly used for wound healing, fat
      grafting, hemostasis as well as facial enhancement. PRT involves injection of patient's own
      platelets and fibrin, and has evolved as a less invasive technique for facial rejuvenation
      compared to more traditional techniques. However, while platelet rich therapy for facial
      enrichment continues to gain popularity; little evidence exists to support its use in the
      current literature. Therefore, this study sets out to determine patient satisfaction as well
      as quality of life following PRT for facial rejuvenation. PRT has been previously used
      successfully in facial plastic surgery and is being offered as an option as part of standard
      of care for facial rejuvenation (Sclafani).

      Subjects will be identified by the principal investigator as they present to the office for
      facial rejuvenation and are interested in an alternative to soft tissue fillers. All such
      patients will be given PRT as an alternative option for facial rejuvenation and any patient
      who agrees to this therapy will be enrolled in the study. Subject enrollment will continue
      until a total of 30 subjects are recruited.

    <description>Each subject will receive six injections of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) at designated points on each side of their face (twelve total). Injection points are spaced evenly across the inferior border of the cheek and mid-cheek, and are consistent on each patient. Patients will receive a post-injection phone call within 48 hours of the procedure. Photographs will be taken at two time points as part of the research to serve as a point of comparison before and after platelet rich plasma. Patients will receive the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale amd tje Face-Q Questionnaire 1 month post-op</description>

    <description>Platelet Rich Therapy (PRT) involves injection of patient's own platelets and fibrin.Topical anesthetic will be applied to the face for a period of fifteen minutes prior to the injection. For PRP preparation, 8 cc of blood will be collected from each patient just before each procedure. Approximately 0.3-0.4 cc of PRP will be injected into each standardized injection point in a superficial manner. The injections points are 6 points on each side of the face along the inferior border of cheek and mid-cheek (12 total). The PRP injection will be followed by 10-15 minutes of icing.</description>
