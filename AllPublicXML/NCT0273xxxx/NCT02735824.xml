  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with suspected primary immunodeficiency will be studied and the results compared
      with healthy controls. Primary immunodeficiency may manifest as recurrent, severe or unusual
      infections as well as signs and symptoms of immune dysregulation such as autoimmunity or
      lymphoproliferation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a suspected immunodeficiency will be identified and invited to participate.
      Upon agreement, an additional blood sample will be collected when they have their routine
      bloods taken. If the study participants undergoes anaesthesia for any other reason, a small
      skin biopsy will be taken as well. Additional samples including blood samples or mouth swabs
      will be taken from healthy family members. Blood from healthy controls will only be taken
      when there is a clinical need for blood sampling (or when the study participant is already
      anaesthetised for any other reason) and not for research purposes only.
