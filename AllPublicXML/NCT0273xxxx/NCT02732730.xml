      To assess the acceptance rate, adherence, acceptability, and continuation of oral
      pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among young southern African women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase IV randomized multi-site prospective study to assess PrEP acceptance and adherence
      among HIV-uninfected young women. All women who accept open-label daily oral PrEP will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive enhanced adherence counselling based on feedback from observed drug
      levels or standard adherence support. A subset of up to ~25 women per site (maximum 75), will
      participate in qualitative assessments of facilitators and barriers for PrEP acceptance,
      adherence and continuation.

             antibiotics); active clinically significant medical problems including

             failure), or previously diagnosed malignancy expected to require further treatment.

          -  Current use of ARV drugs for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or completion of a PEP
             regimen within 4 weeks prior to Screening

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity to the study drug or its components

          -  Receiving ongoing therapy with any of the following: investigational ARV agents,
             interferon or interleukin therapy, agents with substantial nephrotoxic potential,
             other agents that may inhibit or compete for elimination via active renal tubular
             secretion (e.g., probenecid), and/or other investigational agents

          -  Any other condition that, based on the opinion of the site Investigator of Record
             (IoR) or designee, would preclude provision of informed consent, make participation in
