  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to prospectively study the comparative effectiveness and comparative
      safety of approved therapies for RA in a Japanese cohort of patients treated by
      rheumatologists. Specifically the effectiveness and safety of newer classes and dosages of
      disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs); e.g. higher dose methotrexate (MTX),
      non-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics, and Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors) will be
      compared with anti-TNF biologics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational study for
      patients with RA who are newly prescribed MTX, a biologic DMARD, or a JAK inhibitor at the
      time of enrollment into the registry. The drug is prescribed per the physician's decision
      which precedes the decision to enroll the patient into the registry. Longitudinal follow-up
      data is obtained via Corrona Questionnaires completed by both patients and their treating
      rheumatologists during routine clinical practice. The Enrollment and Follow-Up Questionnaires
      capture data on patient demographics, targeted medical history including a history of all
      prior treatments for RA, smoking history, disease duration, disease severity, disease
      activity, laboratory results, comorbidities, hospitalizations and other targeted safety
      events.

      The study will also monitor a range of clinical effectiveness, patient reported outcomes
      (PROs), health economic, and safety outcomes, including infections, malignancies and
      cardiovascular events, among other safety outcomes. Standard components of the European
      League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (Disease Activity Score -28 joint count) and American
      College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, including tender and swollen 28 joint
      counts, physician and patient global assessment, morning stiffness and pain will be collected
      at all study visits to enable comparisons of composite disease activity scores (e.g.
      remission) and response criteria. disease activity score (DAS)-28 erythrocyte sedimentation
      rates (ESR) will be calculated where possible, as Japanese physicians routinely collect ESR
      on a more regular basis than U.S. physicians. Composite indices of disease activity, clinical
      disease activity index (CDAI), DAS, and ACR scores may be calculated from the elements in the
      Corrona Questionnaire for publication. In addition, PROs will be collected via instruments
      including the EuroQol (EQ)-5D, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ)-DI, and work
      productivity activity impairment instrument (WPAI) questionnaire.

      A primary objective of the registry is analysis of comparative safety. The registry may be
      linked to other registries for the purposes including comparative safety or outcome studies.
      The program-specific subject identifier number (ID) will be collected for subjects that
      participate or have participated in a post-market surveillance study. The ID will be used for
      to ensure the accuracy of safety reporting to regulators by reducing duplicate reports Note
      that this study has not been submitted to a United States institutional review board. It has
      been approved by Japanese Authorities.

        The Corrona Japan RA Registry has a target enrollment of approximately 2,000 subjects being
        prescribed for the first-time, a medication for RA from one of the following drug classes:
        Conventional DMARDs, JAK inihibitors, Anti-TNF biologic DMARDs, Non-TNF biologic DMARDs.

        If during follow-up a subject stops treatment with the eligible medication prescribed at
        enrollment, that subject should still be followed long-term in the registry.

        This study will recruit patients from approximately 40 clinical sites from a broad
        geographic distribution in Japan. Subject enrollment will be monitored to obtain 4
        subgroups of 500 patients each segmented by drug class with enrollment closing when a cap
        of 500 patients is reached. Investigators may recruit patients into any drug subgroup in
        any order until the study cap is reached. Additional subgroups may be added as new drugs
        are approved. Additional patients may be added to maintain subgroup numbers.
