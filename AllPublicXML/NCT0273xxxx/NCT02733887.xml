  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lymph nodes or masses,positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)
      standardized uptake values(SUV) results, whole body magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)
      intravoxel incoherent motion(IVIM) sequence D, D*, f values and MRI volumes of lymphoma
      patients were compared before and after the chemotherapy in this project prospectively to
      provide data for evaluating the dependency and differences of PET/CT and whole body MRI in
      lymphoma staging and therapeutic evaluation. Long-term therapeutic effect indexes obtained in
      follow-up visits of patients such as Overall Survival(OS), Progression Free Survival (PFS)
      etc. were used to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and differences of MRI and PET/CT. The
      research could provide a new method of nonionizing radiation iconography for physicians to
      give appropriate treatments and predict prognosis.
