    <textblock>
      The Endurance Trial is a Phase IV open label clinical study to assess the need for ongoing
      intravitreal aflibercept injections after the 3-year VISTA DME (VGFT-OD-1009) endpoint.
      Subjects will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injections pro re nata (PRN) based on
      the presence of CR-DME (Clinically Relevant-DME). In addition, subjects who meet re-treatment
      criteria will be eligible for focal laser treatment every 90 days

      The Endurance3 Trial is a Phase IV open label study to assess the need for ongoing
      intravitreal aflibercept injections after the 3 year VISTA DME (VGFT-OD-1009) endpoint.
      Subjects will be treated with intravitreal aflibercept injections pro re nata (PRN) upon the
      presence of CR-DME (Clinically Relevant DME) as noted by OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography)
      imaging and examination. In addition, subjects who meet the re-treatment criteria will be
      eligible for focal laser treatment every 90 days.

    <description>2mg Aflibercept, as needed, intravitreal administration.
All subjects will be treated with intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept injections as needed in the presence of clinically relevant diabetic macular edema (CR-DME). If CR-DME is not present the subject will not receive an IVT aflibercept injection and will be observed.
If a subject has recurrent CR-DME they will receive an IVT aflibercept 2.0 mg injection and interval between visits will be reduced to 4 weeks.
At week 12 through end of study, all subjects will be evaluated for focal laser treatment.</description>

    <description>All subjects receiving PRN IVT aflibercept injections will be evaluated for focal laser treatment beginning at week 12 through the end of the study as assigned intervention. If the subject meets any of the criteria for focal laser treatment (FLT), fluorescein angiography (FA) will be performed to guide the focal laser treatment. Focal laser treatment and focal laser re-treatment will be administered no more than once every 90 days.</description>
