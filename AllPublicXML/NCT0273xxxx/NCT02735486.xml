      A randomized, single-blind human intervention study involving 22 healthy male volunteers was
      designed to investigate the acute effects of ginger drink consumption on risk markers of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). The primary outcome measure is reduction in blood pressure
      while the secondary outcome measures are improvement in flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and
      changes in plasma biochemical profile parameters related to CVD. Participants were given 300
      ml of ginger extract or water (placebo) with breakfast, followed by a lunch at 2 hours on two
      visits separated by 2 weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected at regular intervals as
      well as blood pressure measurement done during the two visits. Vascular function was measured
      by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) at baseline, 2 and 4 hours
      after the the consumption of the study drink and placebo. The blood and urine samples were
      analysed for changes in lipid profile and other markers of CVD.
