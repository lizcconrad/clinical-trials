      This is an open-label multi center study to evaluate the safety of Aceneuramic Acid Extended
      Release (Ace-ER) Tablets for patients with GNE Myopathy.The primary objective of this Phase 2
      study is to evaluate the safety of open-label 6 g/day Ace-ER in GNEM subjects with severe
      ambulatory impairment. The study will also assess efficacy to ensure that the full spectrum
      of patients with GNEM are evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GNEM (or HIBM), is a rare, severely debilitating disease of adult onset myopathy and
      progressive muscle weakness caused by a defect in the biosynthetic pathway for sialic acid
      (SA). Substrate replacement is a potential therapeutic strategy based on the success of
      replacing reduced SA and the resulting reduction of muscle disease in a relevant mouse model
      of the human disease. The primary objective of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety
      of open-label 6 g/day Ace-ER in GNEM subjects with severe ambulatory impairment. The study
      will also assess efficacy to ensure that the full spectrum of patients with GNEM are
      evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, aged ≥ 18 years old

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained, and before any research-related procedures are conducted

          -  Have a documented diagnosis of GNEM, HIBM, distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles
             (DMRV), or Nonaka disease due to previously demonstrated mutations in the gene
             encoding the GNE/MNK enzyme (genotyping will not be conducted in this study).

          -  Should meet the criteria for severe ambulatory impairment defined below:

               -  Unable to rise from a seated position to standing without help from another
                  person, assistive device(s), stationary object, or other support AND

               -  Unable to walk without the assistance of another person OR if able to walk (use
                  of assistive device(s) permitted), requires at least 2 minutes to walk 40 meters
                  (one full lap of the 6MWT course) AND

               -  Use of wheelchair or scooter for activities outside of the home or unable to
                  leave the home independently

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study procedures

          -  Participants of child‐bearing potential or with partners of child-bearing potential
             who have not undergone a bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy and are sexually active must
             consent to use highly effective method of contraception as determined by the site
             investigator (i.e. oral hormonal contraceptives, patch hormonal contraceptives,
             vaginal ring, intrauterine device, physical double-barrier methods, surgical
             hysterectomy, vasectomy, tubal ligation or true abstinence (when this is in line with
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) which means not having sex because
             the subject chooses not to), from the period following the signing of the informed
             consent through 30 days after last dose of study drug

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not
             of childbearing potential include those who have been in menopause for at least two
             years, have had tubal ligation at least one year prior to Screening, or who have had a
             total hysterectomy or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ingestion of N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc), SA, or related metabolites; intravenous
             immunoglobulin (IVIG); or anything that can be metabolized to produce SA in the body
             within 60 days prior to the Screening Visit

             Sialic Acid immediate release (SA-IR) in the past year

          -  Has had any hypersensitivity to aceneuramic acid or its excipients that, in the
             judgment of the investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

          -  Has serum transaminase (i.e. aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or gamma-glutamyl
             transpeptidase [GGT]) levels greater than 3X the upper limit of normal (ULN) for
             age/gender, or serum creatinine of greater than 2X ULN at Screening

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study

          -  Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 30 days
             prior to Screening, or anticipated requirement for any investigational agent prior to
             completion of all scheduled study assessments

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the investigator, that
             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe

          -  Has a concurrent disease, active suicidal ideation, or other condition that, in the
             view of the investigator, places the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance
             or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or would
             affect safety
