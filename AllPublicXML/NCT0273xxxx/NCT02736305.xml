  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of kinases involved in
      angiogenesis (VEGFR 1,2,3 and TEK), oncogenesis (KIT, Ret Proto-Oncogene (RET), Raf-1
      Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine Kinase (RAF1) and BRAF) and tumour growth (PDGFR and FGFR).
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell lines frequently express high levels of vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating Regorafenib have
      shown promising activity in ovarian cancer. In the clinic, anti-angiogenesis therapy with
      bevacizumab (a monoclonal antibody to VEGF) has already emerged as an important cornerstone
      in the management of ovarian cancer both as part of frontline adjuvant treatment and as
      second-line therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrent disease. Whilst Regorafenib has been FDA
      approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have failed
      prior bevacizumab, it's role in the management of ovarian cancer remains to be defined.
