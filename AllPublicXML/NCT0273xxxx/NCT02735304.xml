  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study seeks to address four independent questions that are all part of the
      delivery of care associated with the provision of a single item of treatment; an indirect
      restoration (known as a 'crown') to restore and cover a damaged tooth. The provision of a
      crown requires a series of sequential clinical and laboratory stages stages:

        1. Stage 1 - Preliminary impression. Taking a pre-operative impression of the tooth to be
           crowned. This will be used to enable the fabrication of the temporary crown after the
           tooth has been prepared. This is standard care and follows established clinical
           protocols.

        2. Stage 2 - Preparation of the tooth. This involves cutting the tooth back to make space
           for the crown that will be fabricated to replace the missing structure.

        3. Stage 3 - Taking an impression of the prepared tooth. From this a duplicate model will
           be made to fabricate the crown. To take the impression, the dentist will need to gently
           push the gums away from the tooth by fractions of a millimeter so that the margins of
           the preparation are clearly discernible.

        4. Stage 4 - Provision of a temporary restoration that will provide satisfactory function
           for a limited period of time, until the definitive crown can be fitted. This temporary
           crown is designed to have a finite short-term durability and have an ease of manufacture
           and subsequent removal; hence the use of a specific cement that will enable this.

        5. Stage 5 - Fitting of the definitive restoration. This is designed to be a durable
           restoration, with a mean life expectancy measured in years, but which is ultimately
           determined by a number of clinical, biological and patient specific parameters.
           Definitive restorations are fitted with cement designed to retain the crown in permanent
           manner.
