      This prospective early feasibility clinical study will collect information regarding the
      safety and efficacy of the CookÂ® Antimicrobial Hernia Repair Device to reinforce soft tissue
      during ventral or incisional hernia repair in clean-contaminated and contaminated (i.e.,
      Class II and Class III) surgical fields.
