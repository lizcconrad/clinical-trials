    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies how well myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) clinical
      assay works in finding and monitoring cancer cells in blood and urine samples from patients
      with or without localized or metastatic bladder cancer. Studying samples of blood and urine
      from patients with or without bladder cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and
      learn more about biomarkers related to cancer and may help doctors improve ways to diagnose
      and treat patients.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate a novel clinical assay (MDSC clinical assay) to detect cancer associated
      immune cells in the peripheral blood of patients as a means to better detect and monitor
      malignant bladder cancer in patients.

      II. Estimate mean MDSC level, intra-patient variability, and inter-patient variability, for 3
      groups of subjects with variable bladder cancer disease status at baseline.

      III. In patients with known localized, muscle-invasive bladder cancer who undergo surgical
      treatment: to determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after treatment including
      surgery.

      IV. In patients with known metastatic bladder cancer who undergo systemic treatment: to
      determine the change in MDSC level from baseline to after 4 cycles of treatment compared to
      the change in tumor burden as evaluated by radiographic imaging.

      V. In patients with no history of cancer: to determine the changes in MDSC levels from
      baseline to after 4 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare MDSC level measurements to urine cytology analysis at baseline and after treatment
      to determine whether the two tests correlate in any of the 3 groups of patients defined in
      this study.

      OUTLINE:

      GROUP I: Patients without cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for analysis
      via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and 4 months.

      GROUP II: Patients with localized bladder cancer undergo collection of blood and urine
      samples for analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and within 4 weeks after
      cystectomy.

      GROUP III: Patients with metastatic cancer undergo collection of blood and urine samples for
      analysis via MDSC clinical assay at baseline, 1 week, and within 4 weeks after completion of
      4 courses of systemic chemotherapy.
