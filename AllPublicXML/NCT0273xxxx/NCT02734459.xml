    <textblock>
      Each patient will be randomized to receive one dose of the test article in one eye and one
      dose of the reference formulations in the contralateral eye. One eye will be selected as the
      initial eye for cataract surgery and aqueous humor collection and hence will be dosed and
      operated on first. Followed by the second eye which will be dosed no early than a week
      followed by aqueous humor collection as per specified time points and no later than 35 days
      following the first eye again prior to the cataract surgery.
