    <textblock>
      This is a study incorporating brentuximab vedotin and dose attenuated rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) into initial therapy for elderly
      patients with DLBCL. Vincristine will be omitted from the standard R-CHOP regimen given the
      overlapping toxicities with brentuximab vedotin.

      This is a multicenter, single-arm pilot study incorporating brentuximab vedotin and dose
      attenuated rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) into initial
      therapy for elderly patients with DLBCL. Vincristine will be omitted from the standard R-CHOP
      regimen given the overlapping toxicities with brentuximab vedotin. CD30 positivity will be
      determined at enrollment and patients will be enrolled into a CD30 positive and negative
      group in equal numbers. Additionally, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) will be
      performed on all patients, but this will not be used to guide treatment decisions.

    <description>Per the Lugano Criteria, progression is defined as an individual node/lesion that increases in size by 50% or in the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length must increase by 50% of the extent of its prior increase beyond baseline (eg, a 15-cm spleen must increase to 16 cm). If no prior splenomegaly, must increase by at least 2 cm from baseline or any new or recurrent splenomegaly or new or clear progression of preexisting non-measured lesions or regrowth of previously resolved lesions. or assessable disease of any size unequivocally attributable to lymphoma or new or recurrent involvement.</description>

    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall response rate is the proportion of subjects who achieve a complete response or partial response based on the Lugano Criteria. Per the Lugano Criteria, complete response is defined as a Deauville score of 1, 2 or 3 and partial response is defined as Deauville score of 4 or 5, but decreased from baseline. Using CT measurements a complete response is defined as decrease in lymph node size to 1.5 cm, while a partial response is a 50% or greater reduction in size in 6 target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with impairment in physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activities of daily living (ADL): ADLs are measures of self-care. ADL independence will be assessed using the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, commonly referred to as the Katz ADL. The Katz ADL is the most appropriate instrument to assess functional status as a measurement of the client's ability to perform activities of daily living independently. Clinicians typically use the tool to detect problems in performing activities of daily living and to plan care accordingly. The Index ranks adequacy of performance in the six functions of bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding. Clients are scored yes/no for independence in each of the six functions. A score of 6 indicates full function, 4 indicates moderate impairment, and 2 or less indicates impairment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-specific procedure
             not part of routine medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care. Subjects must be
             able to understand and be willing to sign the written informed consent form.

          -  Men and women aged greater than or equal to 75 years of age

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-3

          -  Histologically-confirmed DLBCL by World Health Organization classification by site
             hematopathologist

               -  Histologic transformation (HT) will be included on the study. This must be
                  confirmed with a biopsy. Patients with HT must not have received an
                  anthracycline-containing regimen in the past.

               -  Composite lymphoma containing both indolent and large cell features will be
                  included

          -  Has received no prior therapy for DLBCL or HT with the exception of a course of
             prednisone of less than or equal to 7 days given for lymphoma related symptoms; prior
             therapy for follicular lymphoma is accepted, but no prior anthracycline-containing
             therapy.

          -  Carriers of hepatitis B virus should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory
             signs of active hepatitis B virus infection and for signs of hepatitis throughout
             study participation.

          -  Total bilirubin must be less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless the
             elevation is known to be due to Gilbert syndrome.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) must be less than 3
             times the upper limit of the normal range. AST and ALT may be elevated up to 5 times

             liver.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a platelet count of â¤50,000/mm3 within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Patient has an absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 1,000/mm3 within 14 days before
             enrollment.

          -  Prior exposure to anthracycline

          -  Patient has concomitant active malignancy that the treating physician or PI feels may
             interfere with the ability to measure the primary or secondary outcomes

               -  Patients with a history of curative, surgically treated basal or squamous cell
                  carcinoma or stage 1 melanoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality in screening blood chemistry, hematology, or
             urinalysis results that, in the judgment of the investigator, would impede adequate
             evaluation of adverse events and/or response to treatment, or that requires aggressive
             intervention
