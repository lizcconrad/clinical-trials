    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the utility of sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG)
      block to manage ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) after thoracotomy. This will be an open label
      preliminary pilot study to determine if SPG block has potential utility to manage ISP in
      post-thoracotomy patients. The primary outcome variable will be reduction of shoulder pain.

      This is an open label preliminary pilot study which will evaluate the utility of
      sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) block to manage ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP). It will
      determine if SPG block has potential utility to manage ISP in post-thoracotomy patients One
      hundred (100) patients will initially be consented in this study. Patients have to develop
      ISP and have a pain VAS &gt;= 5. The study is seeking ten (10) eligible participants.

      Patients will be followed after the SPG block(s), and the duration of pain relief will be
      monitored by serial assessments of the VAS. This assessment will occur for the initial SPG
      block and for all follow-up blocks, if performed. The follow-up assessments will only involve
      having the patient rate the ISP using a verbal VAS; This will take less than a minute of
      patients time. In addition, all patients will have PRN access to standard systemic analgesics
      as routinely ordered by the surgical service Safety assessments will be performed on all
      subjects. Blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate will be obtained every 15 minutes
      after each SPG block for 90 minutes. Dr. Grant will monitor the subjects for 90 minutes after
      each SPG block.

    <description>Patients who are undergoing a thoracotomy will be informed that they may develop moderate to severe postoperative ISP and may have the option to receive an SPG block. The SPG block will be performed every three minutes for 20 minutes, 0.1mL of the 4% lidocaine will be administered through. After 20 minutes and various intervals thereafter the patient will be asked to rate their shoulder pain.</description>
