      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a pre-consultation decision
      support workshop for breast reconstruction after breast cancer, in facilitating the
      decision-making process, compared to routine pre-surgical education.

    <textblock>
      Postmastectomy breast reconstruction is becoming increasingly utilized in breast cancer
      patients to provide surgical restoration of the breast mounds. The breast reconstruction
      discussions can be highly complex, as there are many different techniques, timing, and
      complications that are unique to each procedure. However Â¼ of women report being dissatisfied
      with some component of their cancer or reconstructive care. Failure of the physician to
      provide adequate information about treatment options is the most frequent source of cancer
      patient dissatisfaction and breast reconstruction patients have expressed a need for further
      information regarding the complex decision to pursue breast reconstruction. In such scenarios
      of complex medical decision-making, decision support techniques may be an effective solution
      to information provision and shared decision-making. As a result, the investigators developed
      a pre-consultation educational group intervention delivered in a group setting for women
      considering breast reconstruction, with the aims to fill an existing information-gap, promote
      high-quality decision-making and enhance decision self-efficacy and other decision measures.
      This study will evaluate the educational group intervention.

    <description>Decision conflict scale measures personal perceptions of uncertainty in choosing options and has been demonstrated to be valid and responsive to change. The decisional conflict scale is a 16-item 5-response instrument that reports a score from 0 - 100 with higher scores indicating more conflict (items are summed, divided by 16 and multiplied by 25).</description>
