  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The representation of the breast on the somatosensory cortex has not been
      precisely located. Therefore, a pilot study with healthy subjects is needed to localize the
      sensibility of the breast on the somatosensory cortex with the use of a 7 Tesla fMRI.

      Objective: To determine the exact localization of the representation of the sensibility of
      the breast and nipple-areola complex on the somatosensory cortex. Secondly, to assess whether
      there are differences in representation between individuals of the same sex and between both
      sexes.

      Study design: A single center pilot study carried out in the Maastricht University Medical
      Center, the Netherlands.

      Study population: A total of 10 female and 10 male healthy individuals will be recruited.

      Intervention: Every subject will undergo a functional MRI scan with stimulators applied to
      the bare breast in a fixed pattern. These stimulate the skin and sensory nerves of the breast
      and nipple-areola complex in a random sequence.

      Main study parameters: The hemodynamic response after stimulation of the skin of the breast
      and nipple-areola complex, representing neuronal activity in that region, is measured. Within
      the somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2), the temporo-spatial brain activity patterns after the
      various stimulation conditions are assessed, and the representation of the breast on the
      somatosensory cortex is mapped.
