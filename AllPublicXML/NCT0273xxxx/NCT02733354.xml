  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on real cases, daily life scenarios of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients
      were shooted and edited into video films, including environment of home dialysis, dietary
      patterns, water intake, sports mode, daily work, short time of travel and other activities,
      covering a certain natural day of either peritoneal or hemodialysis and some important time
      points in the way of life, such as nursing and treatment for common complications of the
      corresponding dialysis mode. The videos will also show the advantages and disadvantages of
      the two modes of dialysis. According to their actual living conditions, patients will decide
      the right dialysis modality that suite them well, thus improving dialysis compliance and
      psychological adaptability.

      the right dialysis modality that suite them well, thus improving dialysis compliance and
      psychological adaptability.

      By &quot;informed decision score&quot; questionnaire, comparison of two groups of patients on dialysis
      awareness of the pattern and ratio of patients choosing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis
      were performed. Dialysis mode conversion rates of the two groups were finally calculated and
      the correlation between awareness of dialysis modality and conversion rates of dialysis
      methods was analyzed.
