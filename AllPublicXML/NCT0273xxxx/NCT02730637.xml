  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the clinical relevance of early biomarkers to detect and prevent acute
      kidney injury. High-risk patients for developing acute kidney injury will be screened at
      initial presentation (emergency department and intensive care unit) for TIMP2xIGFBP7. In case
      of elevated readings patients will be randomized in two arms: The control group will be
      treated with standard care, the intervention group will receive an early nephrologic
      consultation.

      This study examines the impact of an early biomarker-guided intervention on the development
      of acute kidney injury (AKI). New biomarkers indicate kidney damage in an early stage before
      developing acute kidney injury according to AKI Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
      (KDIGO) Definition is detectable. The investigators want to test if it's possible to prevent
      AKI based on elevated urinary biomarkers. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to two
      groups, a control and an intervention Group by an early nephrologic consultation. The
      interventional group will receive an early preventive nephrologist consultation additionally
      to standard care.
