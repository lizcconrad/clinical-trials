      The purpose of this study is to evaluate selective depletion of naïve CD45RA+ T cells from
      allogenic peripheral blood stem cell graft in children transplanted for combined immune
      deficiency. The aims of this procedure are to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) while
      preserving anti-infectious response from donor memory T lymphocytes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined immunodeficiencies (CIDs) are an heterogeneous group of primitive immunodeficiency
      (PID), which affect T cells development, function or both. These inherited conditions can
      only be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). These procedures
      have a high risk of morbidity and mortality such a graft versus host disease (GVHD),
      rejection of the graft and serious infections, especially in this population of children with
      PID. GVHD is more frequent and severe if the donor is not an identical sibling and/or
      presents an HLA-mismatch. GVHD requires high immunosuppression as prevention and treatment,
      and therefore impedes immunity against infections.

      In vitro and animal models suggest that GVHD is mediated by naïve T cells. The aim of this
      study is to decrease the rate and severity of GVHD after selective depletion of naïve CD45RA+
      T cells from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell grafts in patients with CIDs with high risk
      of severe GVHD, and to preserve immunity against pathogens in a population with high
      vulnerability to infections.

      The project aims is, first, to show improvement of rejection-free and GVH-free survival 12
      months post-transplant, and secondly, to show the decrease of viral infection, and assess
      immune reconstitution kinetic and quality and specific antiviral responses, after a
      engraftment with naïve cell depleted allograft.

    <description>Experimental treatment: negative fraction after CD34+ selection from PBSC graft is depleted of naïve CD45RA+ cells. this fraction is reinjected to the recipient and is the experimental product.
Conditioning regimen:
Up-front ATG from D-14 toD-11 Busulphan IV from D-8 to -5 Fludarabine from D-7 to D-4 Thiothepa D-3 to D-2
Graft: CD34+ cells positively selected cells from PBSC of the donor
Post transplant immunosuppression: ciclosporin started at D-1 to D+100</description>
