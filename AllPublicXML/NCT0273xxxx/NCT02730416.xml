      This study will evaluate the role of addition of an anti-angiogenic agent
      (Nintedanib/placebo) to conventional combination chemotherapy as concomitant and maintenance
      treatment in primary advanced or with first relapse of endometrial cancer.

    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised phase 2 study is
      evaluating combination chemotherapy with nintedanib in patients with primary advanced stage
      (3C2 &amp; 4), or with first relapse of endometrial cancer.

      Patients are stratified according to:

        1. Stage of disease (stage 3C2 vs. stage 4 vs. recurrent disease)

        2. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes/no)

        3. Disease status (Measurable disease vs. non-measurable /RECIST 1.1)

      Patients are randomized to one of the two treatment arms 1:1 randomization:

        -  Arm A: Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (6 courses) and Nintedanib (until PD). (Experimental
           arm)

        -  Arm B: Paclitaxel and Carboplatin (6 courses) and Placebo (until PD) (Control Arm)

      Primary endpoint is PFS. 148 patients to be enrolled.
