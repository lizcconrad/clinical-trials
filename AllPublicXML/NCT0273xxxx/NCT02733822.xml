  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naloxone is the standard treatment in response to cases of suspected opiate overdose.

      Buccal formulation of naloxone is a novel alternative to the licensed naloxone injection
      which, by removing the risk of accidental needle-stick, may be safer and easier to
      administer.

      Current UK policy allows the emergency administration of naloxone by any member of the
      general public (Strang, Kelleher, Best, Mayet, &amp; Manning, 2006), and the preventative
      provision of naloxone to drug users and their family members (&quot;take-home naloxone&quot;) is
      possible on a prescription basis. Thus, buccal naloxone may be particularly suitable for
      administration by family members who are providing interim overdose management care while
      awaiting the arrival of an ambulance.

      The aim of this study is to examine the bioavailability and dose proportionality of buccal
      naloxone compared with the licensed injection standards (intravenous, intramuscular).

      The investigators hypothesise that buccal naloxone is not inferior to the injection reference
      in absorption kinetics, i.e. time elapsed till peak concentration (Tmax; primary outcome),
      peak plasma concentration (Cmax), overall absorption (AUC), bioavailability (F%) and,
      duration of action (mean terminal half-life; T1/2).

      The investigators propose a pharmacokinetic pilot investigation with within-subjects
      (crossover) design, comparing two doses (0.8 mg; 1.6 mg) of buccal naloxone hydrochloride
      solution to the licensed intramuscular (IM; 0.8 mg) and intravenous (IV; 0.8 mg) routes of
      injection. The investigators will invite four healthy (i.e., non-opioid using) male
      volunteers (n=4, not powered), each of whom will attend four experimental sessions at
      counterbalanced sequence. Each volunteer will receive naloxone hydrochloride doses of 0.8 mg
      IM, 0.8 mg IV, 0.8 mg buccal, and 1.6 mg buccal, with only one dose administered per session.

      Blood concentrations will be measured at selected times during each session to establish
      speed of naloxone absorption, time to peak concentration, estimated half-life, and overall
      bioavailability. This dose-ranging pilot will inform future work by providing preliminary
      data on buccal naloxone absorption into the bloodstream and by establishing feasibility of
      the buccal route for naloxone delivery.
