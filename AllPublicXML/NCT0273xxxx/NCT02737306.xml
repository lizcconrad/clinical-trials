  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to
      evaluate the feasibility of the use of PRO 140 as an add-on therapy to standard GVHD
      prophylaxis treatment for prevention of acute GVHD in adult patients with AML or MDS
      undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 60 subjects will be randomized to receive either PRO 140 or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio (i.e. 30 subjects per arm). PRO 140 or placebo will be administered as a 350 mg
      subcutaneous injection on Day -3 or Day -2 prior to stem cell infusion, on the day of stem
      cell infusion (Day 0), and then weekly for 30 days (at Week 1, Week 2, Week 3 and Week 4)
      after which it will be administered every two weeks for up to 100±7 days (at Week 6, Week 8,
      Week 10, Week 12 and Week 14). Subjects will return to clinic for two Follow-up visits at 2
      weeks after the last treatment visit, and one year after the first treatment visit.

          5. The donor-recipient Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) match criteria required for
             participation in this protocol are not research subjects in this study and they must
             meet criteria as National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) donors. Procedures for selection
             of donors and stem cell dose will follow FDA Code of Federal Regulations requirements
             for Blood Products (21 CFR 640) and Human Cellular and Tissue Based Products (21 CFR
             1271). The standard institutional practices for stem cell transplants also will be
             followed. The donors are:

               -  HLA-Identical Sibling (6/6): Minimal typing necessary is serologic typing for
                  class I (AB) and molecular typing for class II (DRB1)

               -  Matched Unrelated Donor (8/8): Molecular identity at HLA A, B, C and DRB1 by
                  high-resolution typing

               -  Matched Related and Unrelated Donor (7/8): high-resolution molecular typing at
                  the following loci is required: HLA A, B, C and DRB1

          6. Both male and female patients and their partners of childbearing potential must agree
             to use appropriate birth control methods (birth control pills, barriers, or
             abstinence) throughout the study duration (excluding women who are not of childbearing
             potential and men who have been sterilized). Females of childbearing potential must
             have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening visit and negative urine pregnancy
             test prior to receiving the first dose of study drug.

          7. Patients must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients not expected to be available for follow-up for at least 114 days after

          2. Patients who have received prior allogeneic stem cell-transplantation

          3. Patients who receive post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide

          4. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignant cells

          5. Patients receiving other investigational drugs for GVHD. Co-enrollment in other
             clinical trials that do not include experimental GVHD therapies is allowed

          6. Prior use of any experimental or approved C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5)
             modulators including maraviroc and PRO 140

             of acute viral hepatitis (defined as any active infection with hepatitis A or a new
             diagnosis of hepatitis B or C within 24 weeks of transplant)

          8. Currently active second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancers

          9. Presence of fluid collection (ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion) that
             interferes with methotrexate clearance or makes methotrexate use contraindicated

         10. Patients who are HIV positive

         11. Females who are pregnant, lactating, or breastfeeding, or who plan to become pregnant
             during the study

         12. Subjects on chronic steroid therapy &gt; 5 mg/day within 2 weeks of screening except for
             inhaled, nasal, or topical steroids

         13. Any other clinical condition that, in the Investigator's judgement, would potentially
             compromise study compliance or the ability to evaluate safety/efficacy
