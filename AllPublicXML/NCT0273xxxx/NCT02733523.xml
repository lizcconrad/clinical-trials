  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motivations:

      Socio‐economic and education determinants have a big impact on health outcomes, in terms of
      worse health status in populations living in more disadvantaged conditions. Social capital,
      self‐management and health literacy are some of the intermediate determinants, with the
      potential to mitigate health inequalities through interventions driven by local health
      agents. These three determinants are intensely interlinked and have, separately, impacts on
      self‐perceived health. Social capital is defined in this project as an umbrella concept,
      which includes quantitative aspects of social resources (structural social capital: social
      networks and contacts, social and civic participation) as well as qualitative or subjective
      aspects (cognitive social capital: perceived social support, feeling of belonging and trust)
      and covers relations between subjects at a micro or individual level (family and friends) as
      well as at a macro or community level. Health literacy is understood as cognitive and social
      skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to,
      understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health. Both are key
      aspects for self‐management behaviours. The target of our research project are older people
      living in urban socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, since ageing is in itself an
      inequality axis and urban environments concentrate the highest health disparities.

      Objectives: With the aim to reduce health inequality, an intervention has been designed to
      promote self‐management, health literacy and social capital among older people who perceived
      their health as fair or poor and are living in urban socioeconomically disadvantaged areas
      with the aim of improving their self‐perceived health. Secondarily, the efficacy of the
      intervention will be analysed in terms of increasing self‐management, health literacy and
      social capital (social support and social participation), quality of life, mental health and
      healthy lifestyles.

      In third place, behavioural health patterns will be identified in relation to health
      literacy, social capital, gender, socioeconomic and educational level, and they will be
      linked to the intervention efficacy levels.

    <description>Group-based intervention delivered face-to face and held once a week during 3 months. It comprises:
Promoting the uptake of self-care healthy habits: providing information, setting personal goals and sharing experiences to facilitate behavioural change, specially on physical activity and healthy dietary habits.
Promoting social capital at individual level: facilitating mutual knowledge and mutual support among participants and fostering participation in sociocultural and community activities in the neighbourhood through visits to the community assets accompanied by volunteers.
Promoting health literacy: improving navigation through the health care system, communication with health professionals, as well as the understanding and decision making when buying food.</description>
