  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to investigate if a six months period of physical
      exercise, could improve motor memory consolidation in elderly people on pedal dexterity

    <textblock>
      34 subjects of both genders, with a mean age of 71 years old participated in the study.
      Subjects were divided in two groups: a control group and an experimental one. Before the
      intervention of physical exercise program, subjects performed a Tapping Pedal Test to measure
      baseline performance. After the intervention, the assessment of the impact of exercise on
      motor memory consolidation was held in three stages: Training; 1 hour after training and 24
      hours after training.
