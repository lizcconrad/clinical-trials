  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite an organized treatment approach outlined in expert-consensus guidelines for sepsis
      with fluid resuscitation to treat hypovolemia, antibiotics to target the infectious insult,
      and vasopressors for hypotension, mortality rates for sepsis remain high and the incidence
      continues to rise, making sepsis the most expensive inpatient disease.

        1. Recent research has described the therapeutic benefits associated with ascorbic acid
           treatment for sepsis.

        2. Researchers objectives are to perform a randomized-controlled clinical trial
           investigating the ability of ascorbic acid(vitamin C) administration to decrease organ
           dysfunction in severe sepsis. The widespread occurrence of microvascular dysfunction in
           sepsis leading to tissue hypoxia, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ATP depletion, gives
           rise to organ failure.

        3. Patients with organ failure and sepsis (severe sepsis) are at a higher risk of death
           than patients with organ failure alone. Critically ill patients may have an increased
           requirement for ascorbic acid in sepsis and these patients frequently have levels below
           normal. Ascorbic acid administration, has been shown to correlate inversely with organ
           failure (human literature) and directly with survival (animal studies).

      4,5 Intravenous ascorbic acid therapy decreases organ failure by providing a protective
      effect on several microvascular functions including improving capillary blood flow,
      decreasing microvascular permeability, and improving arteriolar responsiveness to
      vasoconstrictors. Defining the utility of novel agents to augment researchers care for severe
      sepsis is an important task as investigators continue the institutional focus on sepsis care.
