    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Medifoam® and Betafoam®, which is a new
      dressing that contains povidone-iodine, in patients with diabetes foot ulcer. 70 patients (35
      each arm) are targeted to be enrolled in this study. Treatment follow periods are 8weeks.
