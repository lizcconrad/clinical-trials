      Open-label, multi-center extension study of intravenous ARC-520 in combination with entecavir
      or tenofovir in patients with chronic HBV infection. Patients who successfully completed the
      Heparc-2002/Heparc-2003 studies and responded to therapy are eligible to participate.
      Patients who have signed a Human Research Ethics Committee approved informed consent and have
      met all of the protocol eligibility criteria will continue receiving daily oral entecavir or
      tenofovir and IV injections of ARC-520. Study visits will occur once every 4 weeks for a
      total of 9 visits for monitoring and ARC-520 administration .

      Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the study:
      medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate and temperature), weight, adverse events (AEs), 12-lead electrocardiogramss
      (ECGs), concomitant medications, blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation,
      chemistry, creatine kinase, troponin, hemoglobin A1c, exploratory pharmacodynamic (PD)
      measures, urinalysis, HBV serology, immunogenicity, and pregnancy testing for females of
      childbearing potential. Patients will be monitored for HBV virology, AEs, and exploratory PD
      measures for a total of 24 weeks after the last dose of ARC-520.

             specific procedures.

          -  Have no abnormalities in 12-lead ECG assessment that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may compromise patient safety

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study assessments and adhere to the protocol
             schedule.
