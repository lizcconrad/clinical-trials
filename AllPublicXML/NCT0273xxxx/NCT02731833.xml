    <textblock>
      This single centre, comparative design study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an
      experimental stannous fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity
      (DH) after short term use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, three day, randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm,
      parallel design, stratified (by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two selected
      test teeth), controlled study, in participants with at least two sensitive teeth that meet
      all the criteria at the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) visits. Dentinal
      hypersensitivity will be assessed at baseline (pre-treatment), post-treatment and after 3
      days twice daily brushing

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score was indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score Post First Treatment by Direct Application</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 60 seconds post first treatment</time_frame>

          <title>Tactile Sensitivity - Tactile Threshold at Baseline</title>
          <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold Post First Treatment by Direct Application</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>

        <population>Analysis for this outcome was performed on ITT population, defined as all participants who were randomized, received the study treatment at least once and provided at least one post-baseline (post treatment) assessment.</population>

            <description>Participants were instructed to dose a dry toothbrush with a full strip (1 inch) of experimental dentifrice containing 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride (1100 ppm fluoride). Participants then brushed each of the two selected sensitive test teeth first followed by the whole mouth thoroughly for at least 1 minute. Participants were permitted to rinse with tap water after brushing.</description>
