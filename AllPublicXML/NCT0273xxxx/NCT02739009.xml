      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase I study for
      the assessment of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of
      MOR106 in healthy male subjects and multiple ascending doses in subjects with moderate to
      severe atopic dermatitis.
