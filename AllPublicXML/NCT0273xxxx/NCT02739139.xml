  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The manufacturers of AlphaBRAIN(TM) claim that their product, when taken as directed, has
      beneficial effects on cognition. The active ingredient in AlphaBRAIN, Huperzine A, is a
      naturally occurring compound found in firmoss and also thought to be an acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor. Numerous clinical studies have been undertaken to investigate the effects of
      Huperzine A on cognition and have demonstrated benefit to cognition in both individuals
      diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases as well as performance on academic tasks by
      students. However, to our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the
      effects of AlphaBRAIN(TM) on cognition. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to assess
      the effects of daily oral administration of AlphaBRAIN(TM) on cognitive functioning, as
      compared to placebo, after 45 days of treatment.

        1. To evaluate a single daily dose of AlphaBRAIN(TM) vs placebo given orally on the change
           in a battery of standardized neuropsychological tests (see attached).

        2. A secondary objective is to evaluate a single daily dose of AlphaBRAIN(TM) vs placebo
           given orally on sleep.
