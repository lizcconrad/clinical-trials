  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a serious systemic disease defined as a combination of Systemic Inflammation
      Response Syndrome (SIRS) plus a confirmed or suspected infection. Untreated or inadequately
      treated cases can lead to severe sepsis or septic shock; being characterized by high
      mortality and morbidity.

      Symptoms and signs of sepsis are variable and this makes clinical recognition and assessment
      very difficult in particular on Emergency Department (ED) patients due to their infectious
      illness background and the frequent comorbidities. Also, the severity of the condition may
      not be apparent at initial contact with ED personnel: patients may arrive at ED with mild
      clinical manifestation and rapidly progress to critical illness, or rather at the opposite
      others have benign evolution despite a similar symptoms. In these conditions, the main
      challenge of ED clinicians is differentiating mild infections from life-threatening ones in
      the heavy workload of ED environment Objective of TRIAGE project is to identify and validate
      biomarkers able to predict the clinical worsening of patients freshly admitted at Emergency
      Department.

      Targeted population is adult patients freshly admitted at ED, whom blood samples will serve
      to validate candidate markers.

    <description>A biostatistics analysis will be led in two steps. The first analysis or &quot;train set&quot; will be conducted on the first 150 patients enrolled, estimated size to reach statistical performance. The objective is to identify markers associated with clinical worsening of patients and decide on a model by selecting the best combination of markers. In a second time, performance will be confirmed during the &quot;test set&quot;. The number of samples to be tested depends on the target performance calculated with the area under the Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). We decided to aim for an AUC of 0.75, based on the performance described in the literature for some triage score as MEDS (Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis) or those associated with Lactate concentration used as marker of sepsis deterioration in ED</description>
