  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how chronic inflammation influences skeletal muscle
      protein metabolism and metabolic function in humans. The investigators will evaluate acute
      responsiveness to a single bout of exercise in men and women who are either lean or
      overweight/obese. The investigators will explore the relationship between circulating
      inflammatory markers and anabolic, proteomic, and transcriptional responses to acute
      exercise. The investigators will measure skeletal muscle protein synthesis in the
      postabsorptive state and in response to a single bout of exercise.

        Men and women between the ages of 30-55 years will be recruited for this study. Fifteen
        individuals will be lean, defined as a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 24 kg/m2.
        Thirty individuals will be overweight/obese, defined as a BMI between 25 and 45 kg/m2.
