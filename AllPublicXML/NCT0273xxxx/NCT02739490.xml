      Introduction: The stability of the pelvis is of great importance in body balance as a whole,
      can be improved by training the pelvic muscles fillet (MLP), which is characterized by low
      intensity isometric synchronous and the deep muscles of the trunk. This study aims to
      determine the effect of a stability program target, with the training of the MLP region on
      pelvic stability.

      This study aims to determine the effect of a stability program target, with the training of
      the MLP region on pelvic stability. Materials and Methods: We recruited 20 volunteers of both
      sexes were randomly divided into control group (CG) and training group (TG). The evaluations
      were performed before and after training the MLP. The training was held four isometrics
      series with a time of 30 seconds with 30 seconds rest in between reps during 10 sessions
      distributed twice weekly.
