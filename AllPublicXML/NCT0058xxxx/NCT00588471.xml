  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if one dose of simvastatin will decrease the
      inflammatory response to coronary intervention. Also to determine if one dose of simvastatin
      affects endothelial function (activity of the artery) as measured by noninvasive peripheral
      artery tonography.

      The objective of this study is to determine if acute pretreatment with simvastatin, an
      HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor will reduce the post inflammatory response after percutaneous
      coronary interventions (PCI), and/or change endothelial function as assessed by peripheral
      arterial tomography (PAT). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known as
      coronary angioplasty or simply angioplasty, is a non-surgical procedure used to treat the
      stenotic (narrowed) coronary arteries of the heart found in coronary heart disease.

      Patients will be pretreated with simvastatin 80 mg prior to undergoing PCI. Endothelial
      function will be assessed before and after treatment via PAT. Our working hypothesis is
      patients pretreated with simvastatin, will have 1) attenuated inflammatory response, as noted
      by decreased levels of serum high sensitivity CRP and IL-6 and 2) improved endothelial
      function as compared to patients not pretreated with statin therapy.

    <measure>Change in Serum High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, within 24 hours post percutaneous coronary intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The hsCRP test evaluates vascular inflammation. People with higher hsCRP values have the highest risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with lower values have less of a risk. The American Heart Association and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have defined risk groups as follows:
Low risk: less than 1.0 mg/L Average risk: 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L High risk: above 3.0 mg/L</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Endothelial Peripheral Arterial Tomography (EndoPAT) Score After PCI</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, within 24 hours post percutaneous coronary intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The EndoPAT is a noninvasive test that involves putting probes on the index fingers of both hands and evaluating the blood flow to one hand before and after inflating a blood pressure cuff on one arm, temporarily reducing blood flow to the fingers. The finger sensor on the affected arm will now show no blood flow, while the sensor on the opposite index finger will continue to display your normal blood flow level. After several minutes, the blood pressure cuff is released, allowing blood to flow back into the affected lower arm. If the finger sensor on the affected arm shows a rush of blood, the blood vessels are functioning normally. If the blood flow return is sluggish, however, the blood vessels are unhealthy.
The results are reported as the &quot;Endoscore&quot; (range 0-3); a score of 1.67 and lower indicates the need for immediate medical attention; a score between 1.68 and 2 indicates a need to reduce risk factors; a score above 2.1 indicates a healthy heart.</description>

        <title>Change in Endothelial Peripheral Arterial Tomography (EndoPAT) Score After PCI</title>
        <description>The EndoPAT is a noninvasive test that involves putting probes on the index fingers of both hands and evaluating the blood flow to one hand before and after inflating a blood pressure cuff on one arm, temporarily reducing blood flow to the fingers. The finger sensor on the affected arm will now show no blood flow, while the sensor on the opposite index finger will continue to display your normal blood flow level. After several minutes, the blood pressure cuff is released, allowing blood to flow back into the affected lower arm. If the finger sensor on the affected arm shows a rush of blood, the blood vessels are functioning normally. If the blood flow return is sluggish, however, the blood vessels are unhealthy.
The results are reported as the &quot;Endoscore&quot; (range 0-3); a score of 1.67 and lower indicates the need for immediate medical attention; a score between 1.68 and 2 indicates a need to reduce risk factors; a score above 2.1 indicates a healthy heart.</description>
