  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is our objective to improve the performance of CTC in the prepared colon, and to validate
      CTC in the unprepared colon for the detection of colorectal neoplasia. The cost-effectiveness
      ratio of CTC in the unprepared colon will compare favorably with other colorectal screening
      test.

      To improve the diagnostic performance of CTC in the prepared colon using improved spatial
      resolution, advanced image displays, and computer-assisted diagnosis, and to optimize
      diagnostic performance of CTC in the unprepared colon for colorectal polyp detection using
      electronic stool subtraction and computer-aided diagnostic techniques. To estimate the
      sensitivity and specificity of CTC in the unprepared colon for clinically important
      colorectal neoplasms (large adenomas ≥ 1 cm) and to compare such estimates with colonoscopy.
      To survey patient acceptance of CTC in the unprepared colon, and to assess implications for
      health care costs and cost-effectiveness of CTC in the unprepared colon in comparison with
      other approaches.
