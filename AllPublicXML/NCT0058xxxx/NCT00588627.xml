      This study is being done to find out why some people with mucus dripping down the back of
      their throat have a nagging cough while others do not cough.

      The objective of the protocol is to determine the pathogenesis of cough in diseases of the
      aerodigestive tract. There were over 24 million ambulatory chronic cough visits nationally in
      1991 and over 8,000 visits in 2004 at MCR. Current guidelines for chronic cough are based on
      case series and on empirical expert opinions. Studies have implicated mucosal inflammation,
      heightened sensitivity of capsaicin cough receptors on peripheral nerves and elaboration of
      inflammatory mediators including tussigenic neuropeptides. There are gaps in our knowledge of
      what triggers cough in many disease states. For example, postnasal drip syndrome has been
      estimated to account for 70% of chronic cough, yet it is known that not all patients with
      postnasal drip have chronic cough. Our hypothesis is that there must be critical factor/s
      that cause cough in one patient with postnasal drip but not in another. This study will
      evaluate whether there exists differences in capsaicin cough sensitivity, neuropeptides
      levels and mucosal inflammation in patients with postnasal drip and chronic cough and
      compared to its natural control group, subjects with postnasal drip with and without chronic
      cough. After standard therapy to eliminate postnasal drip, repeat measurement of capsaicin
      sensitivity and nitric oxide levels will be obtained. There is a critical need to determine
      the mechanisms underlying cough for better management. The study results will provide insight
      and fill gaps in our knowledge and will serve to advance future work evaluating mechanisms of
      cough in other disease states including asthma, GERD, interstitial lung disease and smokers.

      Mucus will be quantified and protease inhibitors will be added after collection. The specimen
      will be coded to deidentify. It will be transported to laboratory for storage and analysis.
      The mucus collected from the posterior nasopharynx will be frozen and assayed simultaneously.
      Substance P and Neurokinin A will be measured by ELISA at the end of the study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Postnasal Drip with chronic cough:

          1. Postnasal drip by rhinoscopy

          2. Cough by visual analog scale.

          3. Patients have to be 18 years old or older.

          4. Cough-variant asthma must be excluded by a negative methacholine challenge test within
             one year, or documented failure of chronic cough to resolve after administration of
             inhaled corticosteroid (&gt; one-month duration). Asthma is defined by the ATS
             guidelines.

          5. Subjects must have a negative chest radiogram or Chest CT scan within 6 months.

          6. No active GERD symptoms (&lt; 7 RSI score) &amp; a stable dose of Proton Pump Inhibitor (4
             weeks).

             Eligibility Criteria of Postnasal Drip without cough:

          7. Postnasal drip by rhinoscopy

          8. No cough by visual analog scale.

          9. Patients have to be 18 years old or older.

               1. Presence of nasal polyposis and/or sinusitis or active GERD symptoms on

                  or inhaled corticosteroids. Patient must be off nasal or inhaled corticosteroid
                  by at least 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria: Same for Post Nasal Drip without cough except:
