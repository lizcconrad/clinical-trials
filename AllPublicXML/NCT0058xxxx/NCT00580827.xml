  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 18-week, randomized, double blind clinical trial provided treatment for 160
      cocaine-dependent opioid addicts, aged 18-65 years. Participants were stabilized on LAAM
      maintenance during the first 4 weeks and cocaine use was assessed; participants were then
      stratified by level of cocaine use and randomly assigned to receive one of the following:
      placebo disulfiram (0 mg/day), disulfiram at 62.5 mg/day, disulfiram at 125 mg/day, or
      disulfiram at 250 mg/day. During induction onto LAAM, participants were administered
      increasing doses of LAAM plus placebo disulfiram on a thrice-weekly basis until maintenance
      doses of LAAM are attained. At the beginning of week 5, participants received LAAM plus
      disulfiram or placebo disulfiram according to their randomized assignments, and were
      maintained on these agents through week 16. At the end of the study, participants underwent
      detoxification from LAAM and active/placebo medication over a 4- to 6-week period. All
      participants received weekly 1-hour psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Treatment) with
      experienced clinicians specifically trained to deliver the therapy and who received ongoing
      supervision. The primary outcomes were retention and reduction in opioid and cocaine use, as
      assessed by self-report and confirmed by thrice-weekly urinalyses. Secondary outcomes
      included reductions in other illicit drug and alcohol use, as well as improvements in
      psychosocial functioning.

             of naloxone (&lt;0.8 mg, i.m.), and an opioid-positive urine screen.

          -  Participants also must be current users of cocaine with self-reported use of &gt; 7 gm
             during the preceding 12 months, self-reported use of &gt; 1 time/week in at least one
             month preceding study entry, and cocaine-positive urine screen.
