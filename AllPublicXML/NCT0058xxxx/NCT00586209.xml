    <textblock>
      To primary purpose is to evaluate the effect of L-glutamine therapy on exercise endurance and
      breath by breath exercise response of sickle cell anemia patients

      The secondary purpose is to assess the effect of L-glutamine on pain; energy and appetite
      levels; narcotics usage; and hospital and emergency room visits for sickle cell pain

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group,study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral L-glutamine therapy for
      patients with sickle cell anemia or sickle IS°-thalassemia who are at least 18 years old with
      focus on the aspect of exercise endurance. In this study, the patients will orally take
      L-glutamine or placebo twice daily, and clinical and hematological parameters will be
      monitored. The adverse events,especially those attributable to L-glutamine therapy, will also
      be monitored. The data obtained will be essential in understanding the role of L-glutamine in
      therapy for sickle cell anemia and sickle B°-thalassemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible to participate in the study, a patient must meet all of the following
        inclusion criteria:

          -  Patient is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patient has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia or sickle ß0-thalassemia
             (documented by hemoglobin electrophoresis).

          -  Patient has had at least two episodes of painful crises within 12 months of the
             screening visit.

          -  If the patient has been treated with an anti-sickling agent within three months of the
             screening visit, the therapy must have been continuous for at least three months with
             the intent to continue for the next 14 months.

          -  Patient or the patient's legally authorized representative has given written informed
             consent.

          -  If the patient is a female of child-bearing potential, she agrees to practice a

          -  Patient is able to perform exercise tolerance test

        Exclusion Criteria:

             sickle painful crisis) within two months of the screening visit.

          -  Patient has diabetes mellitus with untreated fasting blood sugar &gt;115 mg/dL.

          -  Patient has prothrombin time International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt; 2.0.

          -  Patient has serum albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dl.

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patient has been treated with an experimental anti-sickling medication/treatment
             (except hydroxyurea) within 30 days of the screening visit.

          -  Patient has been treated with an experimental drug within 30 days of the screening
             visit.

          -  There are factors that would, in the judgment of the investigator, make it difficult
             for the patient to comply with the requirements of the study.
