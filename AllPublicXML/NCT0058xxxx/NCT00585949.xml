  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help to permit the development of preventative strategies as well as
      cell-cased therapy for existent disease. It is hypothesized that aging is associated with
      reduced vascular injury-induced endothelial progenitor cell activity, resulting in impaired
      vascular repair and increased vascular disease. Patients with stable coronary artery disease
      and a control group of patients undergoing coronary angiography without angioplasty will be
      recruited.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our society. It is
      initiated by the dysfunction of the lining of coronary arteries. There are several repair
      mechanisms that are now thought to involve circulating endothelial progenitor cells that are
      mobilized from the bone marrow and home to sites of endothelial injury. We hypothesize that
      aging is associated with reduced vascular injury induced endothelial progenitor cell
      activity, resulting in impaired vascular repair and increased coronary heart disease events.
      96 patients with stable coronary artery disease will be enrolled in this study. They will
      undergo either angiography alone or angiography and angioplasty. Their venous blood will be
      collected immediately prior to the procedure and 20-24 hours after their procedure. The
      number of endothelial progenitor cells will be assessed based on their ability to form
      colonies and also to migrate under the influence of certain growth factors. These values will
      be compared between both samples. All the patients will also be contacted at 6 months, 2 and
      5 years after their participation in the study and the clinical outcomes of their coronary
      artery disease will be correlated with the number of those aforementioned cells.
