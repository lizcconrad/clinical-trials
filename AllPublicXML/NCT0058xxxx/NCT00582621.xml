  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to better understand the genetic causes of Hodgkin's disease (a
      kind of lymphoma) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as multiple myeloma, leukemia, and
      related diseases. The doctors have identified the patient because 1) they have had a
      lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma, leukemia, or multiple myeloma, and have a
      family member with one of these disorders or 2) they are a member of a family with a
      lymphoproliferative disorder, including Hodgkin's disease and/or, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or a
      second cancer after Hodgkin's disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with a personal and/or family history of lymphoma or lymphoproliferative
             disease B-cell malignancies, or multiple myeloma referred for study participation, or
             MSK patients referred from to the MSKCC outpatient clinics of the Lymphoma, Multiple
             Myeloma, or Leukemia Services in the Department of Medicine in consultation for
             treatment who are found on routine history or through a Family History Questionnaire
             (FHQ) (Appendix A). Individuals who have relatives or members of successive
             generations of the family affected with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
             lymphoid leukemia, multiple myeloma other lymphoproliferative disease prostate or
             pancreatic cancers, or other conditions suggesting hereditary cancer at the discretion
             of the MSKCC Principal Investigator. Patients with lymphoma, associated with colon and
             renal cancer will be eligible for DNA storage through this protocol. Family members or
             probands with Hodgkin's disease who are women who received therapeutic irradiation for
             Hodgkin's disease&quot; or who developed secondary cancers after Hodgkin's disease are also
             eligible for participation.

          -  The criteria for eligibility are broad because the ascertainment by the computerized
             FHQ does not allow for resolution of different types of lymphoma or different types of
             leukemia. Patient recall of this information is also imprecise. More accurate family
             history information will be obtained upon contact of family members and diagnoses will
             be verified by obtaining pathologic documentation. The spectrum of familial
             lymphoproliferative syndromes (LPS) may include all types of lymphoma as well as
             chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is an additional reason to have a broad
             eligibility. Subset analysis will be performed on specific types of lymphoid
             neoplasms. DNA of patients with a family history of lymphoma who have consented to
             protocol 93-102 (&quot;Ascertainment of Peripheral Blood or Saliva Samples for Genetic
             Epidemiology Studies of Familial Cancers&quot;) will also be eligible for inclusion in this
             study.

          -  Family members of probands including patients, sisters, brothers, halfbrothers and
             sisters, sons, daughters, grandparents, as well as aunts and uncles are also eligible.
             An effort will be made to ascertain all living affected and unaffected living
             relatives in the affected lineage. An emphasis will be on affected sibling pairs and
             both parents, if alive.

          -  As this study involves research that presents no greater than minimal risk to children
             (see Sec. 46.404 of Federal Regulations part 46), minors are also eligible for
             participation. The assent of any minor should be obtained before the patient is
             enrolled into this study, as well as the consent of the legal guardian.
