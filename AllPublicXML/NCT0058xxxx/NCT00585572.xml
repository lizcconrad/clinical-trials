  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wisconsin Brain Donor Program (WBDP) stores brain and other tissues/samples (e.g. blood
      and CSF) from deceased individuals who have participated in longitudinal research studies, as
      well as other select participants. These individuals have donated their tissues in order to
      aid scientific research. Through the collection of central and peripheral nervous tissues as
      well as (in select cases) skeletal muscle tissue, the WBDP strives to advance the knowledge
      of diseases of memory disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Brain donations are needed from
      healthy individuals, as well as those affected by diseases of the nervous system.

      The WBDP strives to provide well-characterized tissues/samples to researchers. The WBDP is
      aligned with the longitudinal research study of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center
      (ADRC) in Madison, Wisconsin as well as other studies associated with the ADRC.
