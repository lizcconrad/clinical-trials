      Develop a standard technique and demonstrate adequate precision for measurement of
      intima-media thickness (IMT) for routine clinical use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMT is measured using software to analyze ECG-gated US image sequences acquired using a
      standard protocol. Two sonographers acquire images and measure IMT for 100 vessels. IMT
      technique standard deviation (SD) is determined by assuming normally distributed
      measurements, and dividing the SD of the 100 (paired) IMT differences by sqrt(2). This SD
      will be taken as measures of precision of the IMT technique.

          -  Must have an appointment at either the Cardiovascular Health Clinic or scheduled for a
             carotid ultrasound.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Carotid endarterectomy,carotid stenting, carotid repair, less than 45 degree range of
