      The purpose of this study is to determine whether we can consistently identify the first
      lymph node (the &quot;sentinel node&quot;) draining your melanoma.

    <textblock>
      The issue of elective lymph node dissection (LND) in the management of melanoma patients with
      clinically negative nodes remains controversial. The concept of elective LND is attractive
      because it provides the opportunity to detect and remove occult micrometastases before they
      become clinically apparent. Numerous retrospective analyses have consistently shown a 15-20%
      long term survival advantage in patients undergoing elective LND who are found to have
      positive nodes, compared to those undergoing therapeutic LND for clinically positive nodes.
      The majority of patients undergoing elective LND however, do not have lymph node involvement,
      and the impact of removal of these negative nodes on the survival of these patients is
      unknown. The substantial morbidity of these procedures has led to the conduct of a number of
      important prospective randomized trials designed to define the impact of elective LND on the
      survival of patients with clinically node negative melanoma. In 1982, the World Health
      Organization reported on the end results of 553

      The primary objective of this protocol is to establish the feasibility of lymph node mapping,
      using preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative blue dye injection to detect the
      sentinel node in patients at risk for regional lymph node metastasis from their primary
      melanoma.
