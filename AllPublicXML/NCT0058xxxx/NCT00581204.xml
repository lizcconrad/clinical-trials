  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose for this study is to measure the physiology of human undergoing a Lower Body
      Negative Pressure usea non-invasive low-power optical technique, near-infrared diffuse
      optical spectroscopy measurement and compare these measurement to standard monitoring
      procedures delineated in the Brooke Army Medical Center.

      The Brooke Army Medical Center can use near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy to provide
      functional physiologic tissue and organ information without ionizing radiation and without
      withdrawing any blood, in a cost-effective and rapid manner. Monitoring for the onset of
      circulatory shock in a wounded soldier on the battlefield is typically performed by
      measurement of arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, or simple auscultation of
      the pulse. Shock is typically recognized by non-specific signs and subjective symptoms such
      as cold clammy skin, pallor, weak thready pulse, unstable vital signs, and diminished
      mentation.

      The near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy can measure tissue regions deeper below the
      skin surface and reports on larger tissue volumes in muscle and brain. The near-infrared
      diffuse optical spectroscopy instrument generate harmless amounts of low-level non-ionizing
      near-infrared ligh can measure the tissue absorption and scattering properties at depths of 1
      cm or more below the skin surface include larger tissue volumes in muscle and brain. The
      absorption properties of tissue provide and can determine absolute concentrations of
      deoxygenated hemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and water, as well as the total hemoglobin
      saturation.
