  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a medicine called Sulodexide will help prevent or slow
      down the progression of Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis type II/Dense Deposit
      Disease. Sulodexide is not yet FDA approved and has not been studied in children.

      Study aim/hypotheses: to measure the efficacy of Sulodexide treatment in patients with the
      above disease/s.

      Study subjects will be asked to take Sulodexide twice a day. The Sulodexide will be taken in
      addition to the regular medications the subject is on. There will be no change in these other
      medications. The subject will also be asked to have blood tests each month to follow kidney
      function. The frequency of these tests is the normal/standard frequency for persons with MPGN
      II/DDD and is neither increased nor decreased because of participation in this study. The
      study will occur over 6 months for each subject.
