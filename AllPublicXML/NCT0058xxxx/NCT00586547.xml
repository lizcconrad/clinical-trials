  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the number of donor lymphocytes that can be given to
      recipients of haploidentical stem cell transplants after depletion of recipient-reactive T
      lymphocytes by ex-vivo treatment with a fixed dose of RFT5-dgA immunotoxin, and will result
      in a rate of Grade III/IV GVHD of &lt; / = 25%, to analyze immune reconstitution in these
      patients, and to measure their overall and disease free survival, at 100 days and at 1 year.

      Patients will receive cytosine arabinoside (3g/m^2) IV every 12 hours for 6 doses starting at
      1400 hours on day -8. Cyclophosphamide (45mg/kg) will be given on Day -7 and Day -6. MESNA
      (45mg/kg, divided into 5 doses) will be administered 15 minutes prior to each dose of
      cyclophosphamide and 3, 6, 9 and12 hours after each dose of cyclophosphamide. Campath 1H IV
      will be given on Days -3, -2 and -1. TBI, total dose 14.0 Gy will be delivered in 8 fractions
      of 1.75 Gy in two fractions per day beginning Day -4. The dose rate will be 10cGy/min.

      Approximately thirty days following transplantation (day +30), the cryopreserved T cells will
      be thawed and infused through a catheter line with normal saline.

      This study will begin with a dose of T cells known not to cause GvHD even in haploidentical
      recipients, even when the T cells administered have not first been allodepleted. A subset of
      patients who achieved engraftment will be included in the dose escalation study of
      allodepleted T-cells treated with RFT5-dgA. A continual reassessment method based on a
      logistic dose-response curve with cohorts of size 2 will be employed to determine the MTD.
      Cohorts of size 2 will be accrued beginning at dose level 1 and the dose-response curve is
      estimated after toxicity outcome is observed to determine the recommended dose level for the
      next patient cohort. Each and every patient will receive up to five additional injections of
      T cells at the same dose, at monthly intervals, provided there is no evidence of grade 2 or
      higher GVHD, until total T cell numbers are &gt; 1000/ul

      Patients will be entered starting at level 1, according to the following doses:

      Dose level -1 (1 x 10^3 T cells/Kg); Dose level 1 (1 x 10^4 T cells/Kg); Dose level 2 (1 x
      10^5 T cells/Kg); Dose level 3 (1 x 10^6 T cells/Kg); Dose level 4 (5 x 10^6 T cells/Kg).
