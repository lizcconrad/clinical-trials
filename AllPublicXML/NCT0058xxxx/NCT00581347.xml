  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether the implementation of an outreach program that employs a
      tracking/reminder/recall/home visiting strategy will have any impact on receipt of
      immunizations and preventive care among urban adolescents.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outreach workers will be placed at 9 primary care pediatric and family medicine practices
      throughout one urban area. Adolescent patients at these 9 practices will be identified and
      then randomized into two groups; (1) those receiving outreach intervention during Year 1 of
      the study and (2) those receiving outreach intervention during Year 2 of the study.
      Randomization will be stratified by practice site, patient age, and patient gender.

      After randomization, the list of Year 1 subjects will be distributed to the appropriate
      outreach worker. The outreach worker will track the immunization status of 11-15yo patients
      within their practice, identify patients who are eligible for but have not yet received
      immunizations recommended for their age group (MMR, Varicella, Hepatitis B, HPV,
      Meningococcal Conjugate, Tdap) and/or a well child visit within the past year, and then
      attempt to connect these patients with medical care through three levels of outreach
      activity. First level of outreach activity involves contacting the parent/guardian of the
      patient by telephone. Outreach workers will attempt to inform patient's parent/guardian of
      needed immunizations/preventive visit and facilitate the scheduling of a medical appointment.
      If unable to successfully complete the task through telephone contact, outreach workers will
      initiate the second level of outreach activity - contact by mail. If contact by mail is
      unsuccessful, the third and most intense level of outreach activity will be implemented. The
      outreach worker will attempt to notify the patient's parent/guardian of need for
      immunization/preventive appointment by visiting the patient's listed home address. During
      this visit, the outreach worker will attempt to inform the parent/guardian of recommended
      immunizations, provide information pertaining to these immunizations, facilitate appointment
      scheduling, and assist patient in compliance with scheduled medical appointment

      Interventions directed towards the subjects of the Year 1 group will cease after 15 months of
      outreach activity. A chart review of intervention and control groups will be conducted to
      determine immunization and well child visit rates within the two groups. At this time, the
      tracking/reminder/recall/home visiting strategy employed with the Year 1 group will be
      repeated for Year 2 subjects.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The target population was teens with birthdates between 7/1/92 &amp; 6/30/97 at 8 practices in Rochester, NY. 2 methods were used to identify eligible adolescents;(1)2 insurance plans in the region provided a list of all their pts at these practices. (2)2 practices added to the list all teens who made a visit within 2 years of the study start date.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>We preformed a stratified random sample, allocating all adolescents to either an intervention or standard of care group (using SAS 9.1). We stratified by practice, age and gender. For families with 2 or more eligible siblings, we assigned all siblings to the same group. Healthcare providers were unaware of group assignment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The intervention consisted of a tiered protocol, with each step being more intensive and targeting a progressively smaller proportion of adolescents who remained behind in immunizations. The intervention was delivered by trained patient immunization navigators.
Step 1- Patient tracking: We used a web-based database to track the adolescents in the intervention group, record immunizations and preventive visits, and document tasks they performed.
Step 2: Reminders and recall: The navigators performed reminder/recall for adolescents who were eligible for either a vaccination or a preventive care visit. They attempted to contact families by telephone and mail.
Step 3: Home visits: If adolescents remained unvaccinated despite the above steps, the navigators performed a home visit to further assess barriers, promote the importance of preventive care, and encourage families to make appointments.</description>

        <title>Receipt of a Well Child Visit Within a 12 Month Period</title>
        <description>We compared the number of participants in the intervention group who received a well child visit within a 12 month period versus those in the control group.</description>

            <title>Outreach</title>
            <description>The intervention consisted of a tiered protocol, with each step being more intensive and targeting a progressively smaller proportion of adolescents who remained behind in immunizations. The intervention was delivered by trained patient immunization navigators.
Step 1- Patient tracking: We used a web-based database to track the adolescents in the intervention group, record immunizations and preventive visits, and document tasks they performed.
Step 2: Reminders and recall: The navigators performed reminder/recall for adolescents who were eligible for either a vaccination or a preventive care visit. They attempted to contact families by telephone and mail.
Step 3: Home visits: If adolescents remained unvaccinated despite the above steps, the navigators performed a home visit to further assess barriers, promote the importance of preventive care, and encourage families to make appointments.</description>
