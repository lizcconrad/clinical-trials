  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from the wistar institute indicated that this anti-body labeled with iodine-125 would
      localized in the tumor cells of high grade gliomas of the brain. the project combines
      surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy with the labeled antibody in a prospective phase II
      trial in this disease entity.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase II study of postoperative radiation therapy followed by
      Iodine-125 radiolabeled anti-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor monoclonal antibody (125I-MAB
      425) derived from cell cultures for high grade malignant gliomas. Each subject will receive
      postoperative radiation therapy followed by 6.4 mg of 50 mCi labeled 125I-MAB 425 by
      injection. This dosing regimen will be given three times generally within a two-week period
      (days one, eight and 15 of therapy) for a total dose of 19.2 mg of 150 mCi labeled 125I-MAB
      425 for each course of therapy. The main objective of this study is to determine if the
      addition of 125I-MAB 425 to postoperative radiotherapy, with or without change, prolongs
      absolute survival compared to historical control (postoperative radiation therapy alone) in
      subjects with histologically proven high grade gliomas. The primary efficacy variable is
      absolute survival and the secondary target variable will be time to progression of the tumor.
      Multiple courses will be considered based on the subject`s clinical status.

    <description>All patients receive the same treatment of MAb-425 +Iodine 125 in a total of three injections. The purpose of this protocol is to allow you to receive course(s) of 1251-MAB 425 until your brain tumor begins to grow, you develop side effects to the treatment, or your medical condition changes (ie: become affected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or develop another cancer).</description>
