  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with prehypertension are at risk for developing cardiovascular disease and
      sustained hypertension. Modifying lifestyle behaviors (diet, weight loss, sodium intake,
      physical activity, alcohol intake) has been shown to reduce blood pressure in hypertensives.
      Participants in this study will be enrolled in one of two groups. Participants in the first
      group will receive usual care, and participants in the second group will receive a 4 session
      telephone-based lifestyle intervention. The goal of the study is to determine whether this
      intervention is effective in promoting behavior change and reducing blood pressure among
      prehypertensives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with prehypertension are at increased cardiovascular risk compared with
      normotension, as well as increased risk of progression to sustained hypertension. The
      recommended treatment for prehypertension is lifestyle modification, including weight loss,
      adoption of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, reduction of dietary
      sodium, physical activity, and moderation of alcohol intake. The proposed pilot study will
      test the effect of a 4 session telephone-based lifestyle intervention on blood pressure
      change in 125 prehypertensive participants. The intervention includes education and
      behavioral counseling strategies that have been shown to be effective in promoting behavior
      change and reducing blood pressure among hypertensives.

      Following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to the intervention or usual
      care, and will complete follow-up assessments at 6 weeks and 3 months post-randomization. The
      primary aim of the study is to examine the effect of the intervention on blood pressure at 3
      months. Secondary aims include examining intervention effects on lifestyle behavior changes
      at 6 weeks and 3 months. This study will provide pilot and feasibility data for a future
      application to study effects of the intervention on risk factor modification, blood pressure
      reduction, and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. If successful, this brief,
      cost-effective intervention could easily be incorporated into routine care, and could have a
      significant impact on the management of prehypertension.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Screening BP in prehypertensive range (SBP of 120-139 mmHg or DBP of 80-89 mmHg). If
             SBP or DBP is below these ranges, the patient is eligible. However, if either SBP or
             DBP is above the upper cutoffs (i.e., patient meets criteria for HTN), the patient
             will not be eligible.

          2. Able to read and communicate in English or Spanish.

          3. Must have access to a telephone at home or at work.

          4. Age 18 years or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are currently taking anti-hypertensive medication will be excluded.

          2. Patients with diabetes or kidney disease will be excluded, because pharmacologic
             treatment may be initiated to achieve the JNC 7 recommended BP goal of 130/80 mmHg in
             patients with these compelling indications.

          3. Patients who are currently participating in another HTN-related clinical trial will be
             excluded.
