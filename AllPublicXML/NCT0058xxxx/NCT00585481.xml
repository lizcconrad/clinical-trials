      The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of severe RSV LRTI
      requiring hospitalization among infants born &lt; 35 weeks gestational age for one year of
      follow-up.

    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiologic study of the incidence of severe RSV LRTI among Brazilian children
      born &lt;35WGA. The study will enroll competitively 350 subjects from 3 sites in Brazil. Preterm
      children will be identified after birth and up to 72 hours after hospital discharge and
      followed for one year after the enrollment. Subjects will be seen monthly for the first 6
      months and bimonthly until one year of follow-up. At each visit, a medical and social history
      will be updated and a physical examination will be performed. Legal representative will
      notify study personnel in the event of a respiratory illness or hospital admission at which
      time the subject will be seen by an investigator. Children with LRTI diagnosed by physical
      examination will have viral diagnostic tests performed. Subjects with a LRTI not requiring
      hospitalization will be followed by telephone weekly until illness resolution. Hospitalized
      children with a LRTI will be followed daily while hospitalized and followed by telephone
      until illness resolution. All medical interventions and outcomes will be recorded.

    <description>At Enrollment and Termination Visits all subjects will have phlebotomy performed for RSV antibody levels (3 mL of blood).
Subjects diagnosed with an LRTI during the study will have a nasopharyngeal lavage (NPL) for viral diagnosis. Phlebotomy for antibody levels will be performed if the current episode represents the first LRTI since study enrollment.</description>

    <description>Subjects enrolled in one study site (located in Porto Alegre city) will perform Lung Function Analysis. First measurement will be performed up to Visit 6 and repeated at Termination Visit. Measurements collected in the first analysis will include respiratory compliance and resistance by passive deflation pressure - volume curve, lung volumes by gas dilution method (washout with SF6), lung clearance index with SF6, and maximal flows (rapid thoracic compression from raised volumes).</description>
