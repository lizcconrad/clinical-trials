    <measure>Time-to-Exit From Current Study Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Period 1 (up to 4 weeks ±2 days), Period 2 (up to 4 weeks ±2 days), Period 3 (up to 4 weeks ±2 days), or Premature Discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Time-to-exit was defined as the number of days at which a patient either met the switching criterion [a 2-category change in the Pain Relief Scale (PRS) score in the worsening direction (increasing pain or decreasing pain relief) for 2 consecutive days] or discontinued from the study. The PRS is a 9-point categorical rating scale to assess pain relief in the last 24 hours in which 0 = completely worse and 8 = complete pain relief. Traditional survival models that consider event times (e.g. median survival time) as independent and homogeneous across patients were not suitable for this study.</description>

    <measure>Overall Treatment Difference in the LSMeans of the Average of the Last Two Daily Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Period 1 (up to 4 weeks), End of Period 2 (up to 4 weeks) and End of Period 3 (up to 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is an 11-point categorical rating scale to assess pain intensity (PI-NRS); 0= no pain and 10= worst possible pain. The scale is anchored on the left with &quot;No Pain&quot; and on the right with &quot;Worst Possible Pain.&quot; Patients were to complete this assessment at approximately the same time each day during the double-blind treatment period in their e-diary. The overall treatment difference for the Lidoderm (lidocaine patch 5%) and placebo patch was compared by combining data for patients receiving the respective treatment regardless of the randomized study sequence.</description>

    <measure>Overall Treatment Difference of the LSMeans of the Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Period 1 (up to 4 weeks), Period 2 (up to 4 weeks), Period 3 (up to 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PQAS measures individual pain qualities and the impact of treatment on those qualities. Items 1-19 are each rated on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (lowest score - no pain of that type) to 10 (highest score - the highest level of that type of pain). Average surface pain = average of PQAS items: cold, sensitive, itchy, numb, and tingling. Average deep pain = average of PQAS items: dull, cramping, throbbing, aching, and heavy. Average paroxymal pain = average of PQAS items: sharp, shooting, electric, and radiating.</description>

    <measure>Overall Treatment Difference in LSMeans of Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment period (up to 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Patients were to consider each item as it related to the way they felt for the previous 2 weeks. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression was summed to give a single score for the BDI-II, with a 4-point scale for each item ranging from 0-3. A total score of 0-13 is minimal, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe. Values were based on measurements taken at Screening, at Baseline (Visit 3), and at the end of each period.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This exploratory, Phase IIb study was initiated on March 6, 2007 at 21 study centers in the United States and completed on June 24, 2008.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the active Run-in Period, eligible patients applied Lidoderm patches every 24 hours for 28 days. During the 12-week Double-blind Treatment Period, patients were randomized to apply Lidoderm patches or matching placebo patches every 24 hours for 4 weeks and then crossed over to the other treatment for the next two 4-week treatment periods.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Time-to-Exit From Current Study Treatment</title>
        <description>Time-to-exit was defined as the number of days at which a patient either met the switching criterion [a 2-category change in the Pain Relief Scale (PRS) score in the worsening direction (increasing pain or decreasing pain relief) for 2 consecutive days] or discontinued from the study. The PRS is a 9-point categorical rating scale to assess pain relief in the last 24 hours in which 0 = completely worse and 8 = complete pain relief. Traditional survival models that consider event times (e.g. median survival time) as independent and homogeneous across patients were not suitable for this study.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Period 1 (up to 4 weeks ±2 days), Period 2 (up to 4 weeks ±2 days), Period 3 (up to 4 weeks ±2 days), or Premature Discontinuation</time_frame>
        <population>The modified intent-to treat (MITT) population consisted of all intent-to-treat (ITT) patients who were randomized on or after January 22, 2008.
Note: Kaplan-Meier estimates for median time-to-exit from current study treatment could not be calculated for Period 2 or Period 3, because the survival distribution function did not fall below 0.5000.</population>

        <description>The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report instrument intended to assess the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Patients were to consider each item as it related to the way they felt for the previous 2 weeks. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression was summed to give a single score for the BDI-II, with a 4-point scale for each item ranging from 0-3. A total score of 0-13 is minimal, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe. Values were based on measurements taken at Screening, at Baseline (Visit 3), and at the end of each period.</description>

Values were based on measurements taken at Screening, at Baseline (Visit 3), and at the end of each period.</description>

        <description>The VSH Sleep Scale is contained in a 15 item self-report instrument that measures the quality of a patient’s sleep over the last 24 hours. Each item is scored on a 0-100 visual analog scale. The VSH is categorized into 3 sleep scales: disturbance (which measures delays and interruptions in sleep)[maximum score = 700], effectiveness (which measures how well sleep refreshed the individual) [maximum score = 600], and supplementation (which measures the need for napping) [maximum score = 400]. The higher the score the greater the value of the sleep characteristic for that patient.</description>

A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is any condition that was not present prior to treatment with study medication, but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment initiation, but worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation, but resolved and then reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the treatment was initiated).
*NOTE: two subjects randomized to the treatment sequence Placebo - Lidoderm - Lidoderm (PLL) discontinued from the study during treatment with Placebo (Period 1); therefore, the number of subjects included in the safety analysis by treatment group (Lidoderm) is equal to 91.</description>
