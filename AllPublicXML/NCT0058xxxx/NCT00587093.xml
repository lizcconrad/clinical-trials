  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine if blood tests and a CT scan done before surgery
      can predict how successful the surgery will be. In patients who have cancer of the ovary that
      has spread, it is hoped that the CT scan will be able to identify the various places where
      the cancer has spread so that additional surgeons can be available to help with the surgical
      procedure.

      If you have confirmed stage 3 or 4 ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, you
      may undergo a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis after the surgery to compare how much cancer
      the surgeon thought was left after surgery to what is seen on CT scan. A CT scan of the chest
      will be done if your physician thinks it is necessary.

      This study is designed to assess the utility and impact of computed tomography (CT)scanning
      of the abdomen and pelvis and preoperative serum CA-125 levels in the management of patients
      undergoing surgery for presumed ovarian cancer.
