      Investigator initial study to evaluate the use of preoperative computer modeling and the
      intraoperative navigation to guide reconstruction of the maxillofacial skeleton.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of open reduction and internal fixation of facial fractures is well accepted.
      However, there are situations in which an accurate reduction and restoration of facial
      symmetry is challenging. In these more difficult cases, the PI uses computer aided
      design/modeling software as well as intra-operative computer aided surgical navigation
      systems to assist with repair of these complex injuries. A retrospective review of these
      cases has not previously been performed.
