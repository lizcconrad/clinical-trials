  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the this study is to compare pathological gamblers versus non-pathological
      gamblers using tests that measure different components of impulsivity. We aim to invite a
      total of 120 individuals to participate in this study.

      Impulsivity has been described as the cognitive inability to delay gratification, a failure
      to inhibit behavioral action or acting without forethought about consequences. Impulsivity
      has also been seen as a personality trait characterized by risk-taking or sensation seeking
      behavior. Pathological gamblers demonstrate aspects of impulsivity; they act without
      thinking, have difficult inhibiting urges to gamble and desire immediate gratification. The
      goal of this project is to clarify which components of impulsivity are associated with
      pathological gambling. Non-treatment seeking, pathological gamblers and controls will be
      recruited from the community and local casinos. Each participant will be administered a
      battery of tests that represent different operational definitions of impulsivity.

      Personality traits of impulsivity will be measured with the Barrett Impulsiveness Scale and
      the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. Behavioral components of impulsivity will be tested
      through delay and probability discounting tasks. Finally, measures of frontotemporal
      functioning are also included in a neuropsychology and neurocognitive battery. Recent studies
      have shown that these areas of the brain function differently in pathological gamblers; thus,
      the following neuropsychology/neurocognitive tests have been included: Attention/Information
      Processing Speed (via Simple Reaction Time Task and Continuous Performance Task), Episodic
      Memory (via Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test),
      Executive/Frontal Lobe Measures (via Wechsler Memory Scale-III, Choice Reaction Time Task,
      Working Memory Task (N-back), Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task, and Stop-Signal Task).
      Between group comparisons on this battery of impulsivity tests will be made to clarify which
      components of impulsivity are associated with pathological gambling. Secondly, within-group
      analyses will be performed to correlate impulsivity to gambling severity. Lastly, an
      exploratory analysis of subtyping pathological gamblers by performances on tasks of
      impulsivity and types of gambling will be conducted.
