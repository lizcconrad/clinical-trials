  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic response to Crohn's disease, including increased proteolysis and lipolysis and
      changes in energy expenditure, plays a significant role in the resulting malnutrition from
      which these patients suffer. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory
      cytokine, has been found to be elevated in children with ulcerative colitis. TNF-alpha has
      been incriminated in the mechanism of weight loss in many different chronic diseases, and
      causes net protein and lipid catabolism. Anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) has been proven
      to be an effective therapy for ulcerative colitis.

      The purpose of this study is to compare changes in protein and lipid metabolism, as well as
      resting energy expenditure, before and after therapy with anti-TNF-alpha antibody
      (infliximab) or corticosteroids in children with recurrent Crohn's disease. Performing this
      study will better define the changes in nutrition status observed in these children following
      remission of active Crohn's disease, and potentially lead to changes in medical and
      nutritional management of these children.
