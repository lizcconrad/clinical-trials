      The purpose of this research is to evaluate specific parenting programs that aim to improve
      the family's ability to keep children physically safe and emotionally secure. We would like
      to learn more about how the treatments actually help families and to find out how an
      intervention that focuses on child health and safety compares with one that focuses on the
      parent and child relationship. We also want to determine whether participating in one program
      type versus the other results in further reports for child maltreatment.
