  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of the proposed study is to describe the prevalence of the most common recurring
      mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, blmAsh , and the A636P MSH2 mutation among Ashkenazi Jewish
      individuals with a variety of cancer diagnoses. If a substantial proportion of these samples
      contain such mutations, future patients presenting with these diseases may wish to undergo
      genetic counseling and, if appropriate, formal genetic testing. The benefit from such a
      process would pertain mainly to the families of these individuals.

      Germline mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been demonstrated in the majority of
      hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. The increased risk to develop both breast and
      ovarian cancer associated with inheriting a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been well
      established. It has also been suggested that is an overrepresentation of other cancers such
      as colon, prostate and pancreatic cancer present in BRCA1 or BRCA2 families. Population
      specific mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been identified. In the Ashkenazi Jewish
      population, 3 specific mutations have been seen in 2% of the population. This study will
      anonymously screen archived tissue samples of Ashkenazi Jewish individuals diagnosed with
      cancer between 1993 and 1996 at MSKCC for the three founder mutations seen in the Ashkenazi
      Jewish population. Results will be stratified by tumor type and compared with the population
      frequency to determine whether individuals inheriting mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 may have an
      increased risk to develop other cancers, in addition to breast and ovarian cancer. This
      information will be useful in helping to identify individuals who may benefit from genetic
      counseling and possibly genetic testing who to date are not typically referred. It will also
      be useful in developing high-risk cancer screening strategies and determining appropriate
      options for prophylactic surgery.

      Blocks or extracted DNA from patients who have identified themselves as Jewish will be
      obtained and a determination will be made as to whether there is adequate material to proceed
      without exhausting the block or extracted DNA.

      Four unstained sections (research specimens) or paraffin &quot;curls&quot; will be cut from each block.
      In those cases where a block containing normal resection margin or any other biopsy of normal
      tissue are available, tissue will be cut from this block so as to preserve tumor tissue for
      later investigators. It is not necessary for sections to be reviewed to confirm that tumor is
      present in the section, since any germline DNA is adequate for this analysis.

        Cases will be identified in one of two ways. Pathology records will be reviewed for the
        years 1985-present. All patients with diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, uterine
        cancer,lymphoma, melanoma, cancer of the gallbladder and bile duct, stomach cancer, brain
        cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer and breast
        cancer(including DCIS) from 1985 to the present at MSKCC will be identified.
