      This study aims to determine whether a test, called the PET scan, may be useful in
      determining if there are additional locations of cancer not otherwise detectable by other
      tests.

      The PET scan is a nuclear medicine imaging study that measures how much radioactive sugar is
      used by your tumor. The study will compare pictures of the cancer from the PET scan to other
      x-ray exams, such as a CT scan, as well as to what your doctors find at the time of surgery.
      If the study results show that the PET scan gives us a good idea of what is happening to the
      tumor, then it may be useful in deciding which patients with colorectal metastases to the
      liver should be operated on and what operation should be performed.

      Additionally, by comparing the results of PET scans with the other studies that will be
      performed as part of your care, we will try to determine which test best tells us which
      patient is most likely to benefit from surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  initial diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma confirmed by the Pathology Department of
             Memorial Hospital or by diagnostic barium enema if the primary tumor is still in
             place.

          -  a candidate for liver resection for metastatic colorectal cancer as defined by members
             of the Department of Surgery of Memorial Hospital. Patients with metastatic colorectal
             cancer isolated to the colon, rectum, or liver are eligible. In addition, patients
             with limited, resectable pulmonary metastases are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must not be pregnant; females of child bearing age must use an adequate form
             of contraception.
