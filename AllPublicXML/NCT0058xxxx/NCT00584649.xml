      Hypothesis- Radiofrequency ablation, targeting the sympathetic input of the sinus node
      identified by 20Hz stimulation at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right
      atrium, will effectively reduce sinus rate acutely and will reduce palpitations due to
      inappropriate sinus tachycardia without the need for pacemaker implantation due to sinus node
      dysfunction post ablation.

      Inappropriate sinus tachycardia syndrome describes a condition in which a patient's heart
      rate is intermittently (or persistently) higher than expected for the physiological
      circumstances, with ECG appearance indistinguishable from normal sinus rhythm, after the
      exclusion of medical conditions causing sinus tachycarida.

      Hypothesis- Radiofrequency ablation, targeting the sympathetic input of the sinus node
      identified by 20Hz stimulation at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right
      atrium, will effectively reduce sinus rate acutely and will reduce palpitations due to
      inappropriate sinus tachycardia without the need for pacemaker implantation due to sinus node
      dysfunction post ablation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years old, who are scheduled for an ablation
             procedure for suspected inappropriate sinus tachycardia, with symptomatic palpitations
             during periods where documented electrogram recordings suggest sinus tachycardia
             (holter, event recorder, or 12 lead ECG).

          2. Sinus rate greater than 100 bpm with minimal physiologic challenge, or mean sinus rate
             during 24 hour holter more than 95bpm, or daytime resting heart rate more than 95bpm.

          3. Symptoms (or sinus rate) not explained by an alternative medical or
             electrophysiological diagnosis.

          4. Symptoms refractory to treatment with beta-blocker medication, or beta-blockers
             contra-indicated or not tolerated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children under 18 years of age (due to greater risk from exposure to X rays).

          2. Any medical condition significantly increasing the risk of extending the ablation
             procedure or of X ray exposure, including pregnancy.

          3. Significant orthostatic hypotension (due to need for rapid chronotropic response to
             fall in blood pressure)

          4. An alternative cause for sinus tachycardia identified (e.g. hyperthyroidism or
             pheochromocytoma).

          5. Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent.
