      The primary purpose of this study is to measure the efficacy of solifenacin succinate
      (VESIcare) on treating urinary incontinence in Parkinson's disease patients.

      The secondary objective of this study is to examine the effect of solifenacin succinate
      (VESIcare) on symptoms of PD and the patient's quality of life.
