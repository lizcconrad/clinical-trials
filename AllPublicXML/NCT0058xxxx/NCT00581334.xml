      Robotic-assisted Abdominal Sacrocolpopexy is both a feasible and safe method for apical
      prolapse repair of the vagina.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robotics offers many advantages over traditional laparoscopy: 1) intuitive movement of
      instruments, 2) &quot;wristed instruments&quot; with increased degrees of freedom, 3) enhanced 12X
      magnification, 4) 3-D depth perception, 5)tremor filtration, 6) enhanced surgeon comfort and
      ergonomics, and 7) a steeper learning curve. With robotic assistance, the surgeon can
      comfortably perform precise, repetitive motions, with greater dexterity and vision. To date,
      there have been a small number of published cases of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and two
      cases of series utilizing robotic-assistance. There have been no prospective, randomized,
      controlled trials comparing either of these modalities to conventional abdominal
      sacrocolpopexy.

    <intervention_name>Robotic-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy</intervention_name>
    <description>4 abdominal incisions will be made: 1 infraumbilical port and 3 lateral ports. The peritoneum overlaying the sacrum is entered and the anterior longitudinal ligament is exposed. 3 permanent sutures are placed through the ligament at the S2-S3. Then a vaginal obturator is placed transvaginally and the apex of vagina is elevated into the operative field. The peritoneum overlying the anterior and posterior vaginal epithelium is reflected and the bladder is dissected off the underlying vagina to expose 4cm of apical vagina. 2 segments of polypropylene mesh are prepared and one segment is anchored along the anterior vagina with a series of interrupted permanent suture and the second segment is anchored along the posterior vagina. These 2 segments are brought together to the previously placed sutures within the anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum. The peritoneum is then closed over the graft complex and the pelvis irrigated. The 4 robotic ports are removed and the abdomen closed.</description>
