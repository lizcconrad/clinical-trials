  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the development of new pain medications, the prevalence of persistent postoperative
      pain (for more than three to six months) remains alarmingly high. Chronic pain and reduced
      function after surgery are of great concern since they have a significant impact on a
      patient's quality of life and are costly to society in terms of longer hospital stays and
      lost work days. An important risk factor for chronic pain and reduced function after surgery
      is the amount of pain patients experience immediately after surgery which is highly
      influenced by the amount of pain patients have preoperatively. For many patients,
      longstanding pain prior to surgery is common and thus can compromise the outcome of the
      procedure. Therefore, the aim of this study is to reduce the amount of pain patients have
      before they undergo surgery by administering a novel pain-relieving regimen in the weeks
      before surgery. Crucially, this treatment will be continued for three weeks after surgery to
      reduce pain that arises from the surgical trauma. The novel regimen will include a
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (celecoxib) and the alpha2 delta ligand, pregabalin. This
      drug combination will provide the best opportunity to target several key sites in the pain
      pathway. This regimen will be tested in patients with pain related to osteoarthritis and who
      are undergoing orthopedic (hip) surgery because chronic preoperative pain is common in these
      patients and is the main reason for undergoing surgery. The goal of this research proposal is
      to adequately manage pain before and after surgery in order to improve function weeks after
      surgery. If controlling pain in this way does lead to improved long term postoperative
      function the findings from this study may lead to the development of a standardized regimen.
      This is highly relevant not only for orthopedic procedures but following other common
      surgical procedures which would be of great benefit to patients and the entire healthcare
      system.
