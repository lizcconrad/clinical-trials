  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One dose of either gabapentin or placebo will be given to patients prior to thoracotomy.
      Patients will also receive an epidural infusion, intravenous patient-controlled analgesia
      with fentanyl, oral acetaminophen and intravenous ketorolac as needed to achieve optimal
      analgesia. Pain ratings and supplemental medication use will be recorded for 48 hours and
      will also be assessed at 3 months postoperatively to determine whether the patients who
      received gabapentin had improved analgesia and/or required less supplemental medication than
      the placebo group.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gabapentin dose utilized is 600 mg. The epidural infusion utilizes bupivacaine 0.075%
      with hydromorphone 10 mcg/cc infusing at 6 cc/hour. The settings for the fentanyl
      patient-controlled analgesia device start at 10 mcg every 10 minutes with a 200 mcg 4 hour
      maximum.
