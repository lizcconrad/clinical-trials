  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation (MR) is common in the elderly and its prevalence is increasing with the
      aging of the population. Organic MR, due to primary valvular lesions, initiates a cascade of
      complications determined by its degree. MR of severe degree is associated with excess
      mortality and high cardiac morbidity (heart failure, atrial fibrillation). It also causes
      left ventricular remodeling which induces left ventricular dysfunction, which in turn leads
      to poor clinical outcome. Surgery can eliminate MR, but carries immediate and long-term
      risks, especially in the elderly. Therefore, chronically decreasing the degree of MR is a
      major goal of medical therapy but such an effect is yet unproved because of conflicting
      results of small and mostly non-randomized series. Our recent preliminary studies suggest
      that a sustained decrease of degree of MR and improvement of left ventricular remodeling can
      be achieved with powerful reduction of afterload, obtained in particular with angiotensin-II
      receptor blockade. Therefore, the present proposal seeks to address gaps of knowledge
      regarding vasoactive treatment of MR through the verification of the following hypothesis:
      Hypothesis: Vasoactive therapy using angiotensin-II receptor blocker (Candesartan Cilexetil)
      weighed against placebo produces a sustained reduction of the consequences of organic MR. The
      specific aims are that the treatment a) decreases the degree of MR (decreases the regurgitant
      volume, primary end-point) and b) improves left ventricular remodeling (decreases the
      end-diastolic volume index, secondary end-point), as compared to placebo.

      Patients with MR organic (intrinsic valve disease), isolated (no other valve disease),
      moderate or more severe (regurgitant volume *30 mL/beat). A Clinical trial, randomized,
      placebo controlled, double-blind, without cross-over, of 1 year oral treatment with potent
      angiotensin-II receptor blockade using 32 mg Candesartan daily. The trial is preceded in all
      patients by an acute open-label study to determine tolerance and immediate response. The
      methods used to measure the end-points will be: a) Doppler-Echocardiography for quantitation
      of the degree of MR (measurement of regurgitant volume) using a combination of three
      simultaneous methods (quantitative Doppler, quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography,
      proximal flow convergence) and b) of left ventricular remodeling (end-diastolic volume index
      measured by echocardiography and by electron beam computed tomography). This single center
      study seeks to enroll a total of 90 patients. The analysis will be based on intention to
      treat and compare the regurgitant volume and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index
      measured after one year of treatment with the active drug or placebo. The results of the
      trial should provide strong evidence regarding medical treatment of patients with organic MR.
