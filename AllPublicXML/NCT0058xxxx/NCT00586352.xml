  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is a
      disease of the gastrointestinal tract leading to symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and
      growth disturbance. Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory process that may affect any
      part of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas ulcerative colitis is typically present only in
      the colon. Children with inflammatory bowel disease frequently suffer from disturbances in
      growth, which may continue into adulthood and result in altered growth outcomes. The
      metabolic response to inflammatory bowel disease, including increased protein breakdown and
      decreased protein synthesis may play a significant role in the resulting malnutrition and
      growth failure from which children with inflammatory bowel disease suffer. The purpose of
      this study is to compare the rates of protein synthesis within the mucosal lining of the
      gastrointestinal tract in children Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis to children who have
      normal endoscopic examinations. By comparing children with inflammatory bowel disease to
      normal children, we can begin to determine how alterations in protein metabolism within the
      lining of the gastrointestinal tract affect whole body protein metabolism, and its consequent
      effects on growth. In those patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, a
      follow-up study will be conducted two weeks following the initiation of steroid therapy to
      determine its effects on protein metabolism. We hypothesize that children with active
      inflammatory bowel disease will have increased rates of protein synthesis in the lining of
      the gastrointestinal tract than patients who have normal endoscopy, and that increases in
      protein breakdown and protein synthesis will be improved following steroid therapy in
      children with newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease.
