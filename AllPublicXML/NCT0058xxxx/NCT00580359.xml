    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, single-center, and randomized phase II study designed to
      evaluate each efficacy and safety of S-1 and capecitabine in the elderly and/or poor
      performance status patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric cancer. The randomization
      will be stratified by age (70-85 years versus 65 years and &lt; 70 years) and performance
      status, which is dependent on age group; in 70-85 years, ECOG performance status 0-1 versus 2
      and in ³65 years and &lt;70 years, ECOG performance status 2 versus 3.

        -  S-1 40mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1 (evening) - 15 (morning)

        -  Capecitabine 1250mg/m2 orally twice daily on days 1 (evening) - 15 (morning) Treatment
           will be administered every 3 weeks and will be continued in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             metastatic disease

          2. Age of 70-85 years with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             0-2 or age ≥65 and &lt;70 with ECOG performance status ≥ 2

          3. Measurable disease as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
             Measurable lesions:

               -  Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension by any of the
                  following:

                    -  Computed tomography (CT) of abdomen, pelvis or thorax, if the longest
                       diameter to be recorded is at least 10 mm with spiral CT

                    -  Chest x-ray, if the lung lesion to be recorded is clearly defined and
                       surrounded by aerated lung and the diameter to be recorded is at least 20
                       mm- Physical examination, if the clinically detected lesions are superficial
