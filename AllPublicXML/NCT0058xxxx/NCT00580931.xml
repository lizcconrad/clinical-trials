      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nicotinamide, or vitamin B3, is safe and
      effective in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to show that, nicotinamide (NA), a B3 vitamin, is safe and
      effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). NA is
      known to block the ability of certain proteins to regulate other proteins by removing their
      acetyl groups. Recent evidence has demonstrated that inhibitors such as NA prevent nerve cell
      degeneration in models of Huntington's disease (HD), Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's
      disease (or ALS). Despite these beneficial effects in many different animal models, there
      have been no studies to date using these inhibitors in AD. In some of our recent studies we
      found that the potent inhibitor, NA, significantly improves learning and memory in transgenic
      mice that develop AD. NA treatment also resulted in striking changes in tau, a protein that
      abnormally accumulates in AD. NA has been extensively used in clinical studies over the last
      40 years and is generally safe and well-tolerated. As NA is a safe and readily available
      vitamin supplement, our recent results provide a strong argument for a study of NA in
      patients with AD. We therefore propose to treat 50 patients with mild to moderate AD with
      either NA (1500 milligrams twice a day) or an identical but inactive drug (placebo) for 24
      weeks. At 6 week intervals we will assess functions such as learning and memory, and ability
      to carry out daily activities as well as caregiver reports using standardized tests. We will
      also perform spinal taps at the beginning and end of the study to measure the level of
      abnormal tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. Blood tests will periodically be done to
      assess liver function and complete blood counts. The results of this study may provide the
      basis for a more extensive study of NA for the treatment of mild to moderate AD.
