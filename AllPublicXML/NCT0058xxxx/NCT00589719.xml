      The purpose of the study is to conduct a cross-sectional study to examine asthma prevalence
      and morbidity in a predominately minority, low-income population in rural Arkansas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is the leading chronic disease of childhood in the United States and an important
      public health concern in Arkansas. Arkansas, a predominately rural state, has one of the
      leading mortality rates in the nation for African Americans. The specific aims of the study
      will examine asthma prevalence in children age 4-17 years old in public schools in Eudora and
      Marvell Arkansas. The study will also examine asthma morbidity among identified asthmatics by
      characterizing activity limitation, days missed from school, daytime and nocturnal symptoms,
      healthcare utilization and medication use. The specific aims of the current study will
      provide novel data on an understudied population of asthmatics and will test our working
      hypotheses that pediatric asthma prevalence in the Delta region of Arkansas is higher than
      national estimates; and asthma diagnosis is related to significant morbidity among rural
      asthmatics.

        During the 2005-2006 school year, primary caregivers of all students aged 4-17 years
        attending public school in Eudora and Marvell Arkansas were asked to complete an asthma
        screening survey regarding their child. The schools are located in two non-contiguous
        counties in the Delta region of Arkansas and are in rural low-income areas of the state
        where more than one-third of families with children 5-17 years old meet the 2000 poverty
        line (Census bureau).
