  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the preliminary efficacy of 16.0 mg of Prazosin daily versus placebo in treatment
      seeking alcohol dependent individuals. This proposal is a laboratory and treatment outcome
      study to examine the effects of Prazosin on brief exposure to stress, drug cues and neutral
      situations on alcohol and drug craving, mood and neurobiological reactivity in a sample of
      cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individuals. Prazosin will be beneficial for reduction in
      stress and drug cue induced craving and related arousal. In a sample of 120 alcohol dependent
      men and women, we propose to examine (a) differences in measures of cocaine craving, emotion
      state, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation, physiological arousal and plasma
      catecholamine response to stress imagery and to drug cue imagery as compared to neutral
      imagery; (b) reduction in alcohol abstinence symptoms; and (c) improvement in alcohol
      treatment outcomes as measured by increasing abstinence, reduction in alcohol use, increased
      treatment attendance and decreased relapse risk.
