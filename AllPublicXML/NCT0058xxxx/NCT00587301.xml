      STUDY OBJECTIVES: Is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the use of the LAP-BAND®
      System in the morbidly obese adolescent population in the United States, and therefore
      provide these individuals with a significantly less morbid and reversible surgical option for
      weight loss.

      STUDY VARIABLES:The primary efficacy variable is weight loss evaluated in terms of % excess
      weight loss (EWL).

      DESIGN:Prospective, open-label, and single center
