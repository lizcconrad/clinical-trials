      The purpose of this study is to determine the specific genetic alterations associated with
      breast cancer. This will leat to a better understanding of the genetic causes of breast
      cancer.

      It is estimated that 175,000 new breast cancer cases and 44,5000 cancer deaths will result
      from female breast cancer in 1991. One of the most important risk factors is a family history
      of breast cancer. A susceptibility allele which accounts for a large proportion of familial
      breast cancer has been localized to chromosome 17q and attempts to clone the susceptibility
      are proceeding rapidly. The existence of recognized susceptibility loci and the awareness of
      a significan proportion of genetic predisposition and the associated penetrances remain
      unknown and are impossible to estimate without bias from previous studies. This study is
      designed to estimate heterogeniety and prenetrance in a series of unslected families,
      identify additional breast cancer susceptibility locs, as well as provide resources for gene
      isolation and mutation analysis studies.
