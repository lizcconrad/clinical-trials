  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal in these studies will be to assess the relative levels of the Stat4 alpha and Stat4
      beta isoforms in PBMCs from patients with Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease
      or from control patients. We hypothesize that the beta to alpha ratio will be higher in
      patients with active disease and that there will be a correlation between the ratio and the
      severity of disease.
