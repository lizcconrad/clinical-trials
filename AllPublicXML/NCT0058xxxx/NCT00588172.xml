  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes its microvascular and macrovascular complications have become a major global
      health problem. Metformin is often used as first-line therapy for this disorder given that it
      is cheap, may cause weight loss and does not have significant side-effects in healthy
      patients. On the other hand, as many as one third of all patients with type 2 diabetes
      initially treated with metformin never achieve a meaningful response to this intervention.
      Recently, genetic variation in the organic cation transporter 1 (Oct1) gene which encodes a
      protein, OCT1, mediating metformin uptake by the liver, its primary site of action, has been
      shown alter metformin action. In Oct1-deficient mice the glucose-lowering effects of
      metformin are completely abolished. Moreover a polymorphism with a 20% minor allele frequency
      in Caucasians also alters the effect of metformin on glucose tolerance (the net result of
      glucose uptake and glucose release) after ingestion of 75g of glucose. However, it is unknown
      if this polymorphism affects suppression of endogenous glucose production or stimulation of
      peripheral glucose uptake by metformin, or both, and to what degree. We propose to utilize
      established methodology to measure glucose turnover in response to a mixed meal to determine
      how common genetic variation in OCT1 alters response to metformin in healthy volunteers. This
      will clarify the effect of these variants on response to metformin in humans. The knowledge
      gained from this study will help to design future studies examining the role of OCT1 genotype
      in determining initial therapy for type 2 diabetes.
