  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was done to find out if the investigational medication, rituximab, could help
      relieve the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (such as numbness [abnormal protein in the
      blood] and weakness of the lower and upper extremities) in people who have monoclonal
      gammopathy of undetermined significance and people with a symptomatic or smoldering
      Waldestrom macroglobulinemia.

      Rituximab is an antibody which attacks a particular type of white blood cell (B Cell). By
      targeting the B-cells which make the abnormal protein which is involved in causing the nerve
      trouble, it is hoped that damage to nerve fibers will be stopped and improvement will be
      allowed to proceed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase II single arm trial evaluating the use of Rituximab administered at standard
      dose and schedule as an initial cycle of therapy, followed by a re-evaluation at 6 months.

      If progression in neuropathy (as indicated by an increase in the Neuropathy Impairment Score
      (NIS) of greater than or equal to 10 or a modified Rankin Score increase of &gt; 1 grade) the
      patient was off study. In addition, if the subject elected to pursue other active treatment
      including but not limited to plasmapheresis, high-dose intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIG),
      chemotherapeutic agents, or high dose corticosteroids, or if conditions in the exclusion
      criteria develop subsequent to enrollment, the subject was off study.

      If the neuropathy is stable or responding (NIS of &lt; 10 or a modified Rankin Score increase of
      &lt; 1 grade) the patient would have received Cycle 2 of rituximab followed by a reevaluation at
      12 months.

      The study had a Simon Optimal two-stage Phase II design (α 5%, β 10%, π0 5%, π1 20%). The
      minimum clinically important response rate was 20%. The first stage was to include 21
      patients and the second stage a total of 41 patients. The treatment would be rejected if
      there were fewer than 2 responders at the first stage or fewer than 5 responders at the
      second stage. The treatment would be accepted for further study if there were at least 5
      responders out of 41 patients.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least 10 Points Improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) for Either Side of the Body at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropathy Impairment Score [previously called the Neurologic Disability Score (NDS)] is derived from a neurologic examination obtained in a standard way by a specially trained neurologist. Decisions are based on the neurologist's judgment of what is normal considering site, age, sex, weight, height, and physical fitness. The instrument has 35 items, each ranked for left and right sides of the body; weakness is scored 0=normal, 1=25% disability, 2=50% disability, 3=75% disability and 4=100% disability. NIS total score was calculated as the sum of the 35 items, ranging from 0 to 140, with higher score indicating greater disability or impairment.
The neurologist measured the NIS score on both sides of the body, but recorded worst score and reported as 1 for each individual subject (i.e., each subject had only 1 reported score.)
Improvement was defined as at least 10 points improvement in NIS total score, that is, reduction in the number of points on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least 1 Grade Improvement in the Modified Rankin Score at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Rankin Scale was used to determine functional disability as follows: 0 = asymptomatic; 1 = symptoms not interfering with manual activities/walking normally; 2 = minor difficulties in manual activities/walking independently without support; 3 = unable to perform some manual activities/walking independently with support; 4 = unable to eat, dress or wash independently/needing assistance to walk; 5 = no useful tasks performed with upper limbs/confined to wheelchair. Therefore, scores could range from 0 to 5, with higher values indicating greater disability.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With at Least 10 Points Improvement in the Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) for Either Side of the Body at 6 Months</title>
        <description>The Neuropathy Impairment Score [previously called the Neurologic Disability Score (NDS)] is derived from a neurologic examination obtained in a standard way by a specially trained neurologist. Decisions are based on the neurologist’s judgment of what is normal considering site, age, sex, weight, height, and physical fitness. The instrument has 35 items, each ranked for left and right sides of the body; weakness is scored 0=normal, 1=25% disability, 2=50% disability, 3=75% disability and 4=100% disability. NIS total score was calculated as the sum of the 35 items, ranging from 0 to 140, with higher score indicating greater disability or impairment.
The neurologist measured the NIS score on both sides of the body, but recorded worst score and reported as 1 for each individual subject (i.e., each subject had only 1 reported score.)
Improvement was defined as at least 10 points improvement in NIS total score, that is, reduction in the number of points on the scale.</description>

      <time_frame>Subjects were monitored for adverse events weekly per cycle ( Day 1, 8, 15, and 22); each subject could receive up to 2 cycles (4 infusions each.) Adverse event monitoring continued for at least 12 months following the subject's last Rituximab infusion.</time_frame>

        <group group_id="E1">
          <title>Rituximab</title>
          <description>Subjects will receive rituximab administered at the standard dose and schedule as an initial cycle of therapy, followed by a re-evaluation at 6 months. If the neuropathy is stable or responding at 6 months, the subject will receive Cycle 2 of rituximab, followed by a re-evaluation at 12 months.
Rituximab will be given as a 375 mg/m^2 intravenous infusion once weekly for four doses (days 1, 8, 15, and 22).</description>
