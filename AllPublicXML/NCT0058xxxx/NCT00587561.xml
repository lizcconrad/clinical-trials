  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The term social cognition refers to how social information is processed. Individuals with
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder have been shown to have significant deficits in
      social cognition. Moreover, it has been speculated that these deficits may in turn have a
      negative impact on their overall functioning. Behavioral interventions targeting social
      cognition are just beginning to emerge, and there is a need to evaluate their efficacy.

      Objectives:

      This is a small trial evaluating the efficacy of social cognition interaction training (SCIT)
      an experimental behavioral treatment for improving social cognition in schizophrenia.

      Research Design and Methodology:

      Approximately 48 participants with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders will be randomized into
      one of two conditions: 1) a 20 to 24 session manualized social cognition interaction training
      group (SCIT), or 2) wait-list control. Pre-and post-group therapy assessments of symptoms,
      social cognition, basic cognition, and community function will be conducted. Data obtained
      from this study will allow us to determine the efficacy of SCIT training in improving
      symptom, cognitive, and functional measures.
