  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the concentration of itraconazole
      irrigation in nasal mucous specimens via collection and High-performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) assay.

      Eight (8) patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and two (2) healthy controls will be
      enrolled in the initial evaluation. After an initial control nasal specimen, followed by
      seven days of twice daily topical itraconazole irrigation, nasal specimens will be collected
      at varying time intervals and the concentrations measured.

      The primary endpoint is development of a reliable collection and assay technique with
      concentration curves over time of topically administered itraconazole. A secondary endpoint
      is to determine if the concentrations measured achieve a mean inhibitory concentration
      (MIC90) to commonly cultured fungal species in the nose.

      This is a pilot study for the purpose of gathering concentration data on a commonly used
      topical antifungal solution of itraconazole. CRS patients that meet the defined inclusion
      criteria will begin topical itraconazole antifungal irrigations on Day 1. This will consist
      of Itraconazole in Sterile Water 100 mg/1000 ml, irrigating each nostril with 20 ml of
      solution twice daily, with a bulb syringe as directed. The patient will return on Day 7 for
      repeat examination and nasal secretion collection. Two patients will be randomly selected to
      have blood drawn at the completion of day 7 testing to determine the concentration of
      itraconazole in the blood.
