  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiographic imaging plays a key role in managing the long-term effects of hyperuricemia on
      the skeletal system. Two of the accepted indications for prophylactic urate-lowering drugs in
      patients with hyperuricemia are gouty tophi and erosions. While much data exist on the plain
      radiographic changes that are seen in patients with chronic gout, far less is known about the
      changes seen on other imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      ultrasound (US). Further, there is very little data on the MRI and US appearance of
      asymptomatic joints in patients with hyperuricemia and symptomatic gout.

      There is vast emerging data to suggest that MRI and US are much more sensitive than plain
      radiographs at detecting the early stigmata of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Indeed, these
      imaging devices have revolutionized the treatment of RA, for the earlier detection of the
      skeletal changes of RA often mandates more aggressive therapy. These same changes would often
      be missed by plain radiographs.

      It is our hypothesis that MR imaging and US will detect the skeletal changes that are typical
      of gout much sooner than would plain radiography. We also hypothesize that these same imaging
      techniques will be able to detect signs of hyperuricemic silent deposition in asymptomatic
      joints of patients with symptomatic gout in other joints. As was the case with RA, the
      expected results of this study would mandate more aggressive therapy of both gout and
      hyperuricemia.

      Our primary aim of this proposal would be accomplished by studying patients with known gout
      and normal plain radiographs. Each patient would have their most frequently involved joint
      (index joint) analyzed by MRI and US to evaluate for any destructive changes (erosions or
      tophi with cortical damage). Any signs that may portend future joint destruction such as
      synovial pannus, bone marrow edema, soft tissue edema, or joint effusions will also be
      documented. In order to demonstrate the effects of hyperuricemic silent deposition, an
      asymptomatic joint from these same patients will be studied using these same imaging
      techniques. Any evidence of erosions, tophi, synovial pannus, bone marrow or soft tissue
      edema, or joint effusions will be recorded. By demonstrating destructive, or potentially
      destructive, skeletal changes in the index joint or asymptomatic joint of a significant
      number of patients, we will show that patients who are left untreated on the basis of normal
      plain radiographs are likely to already have skeletal damage.
