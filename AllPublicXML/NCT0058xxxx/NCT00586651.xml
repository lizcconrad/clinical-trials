      This is an 18-week open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of
      CEP-701 (lestaurtinib) treatment at a dosage of 80 mg bid for 18 weeks (126 days) in patients
      with Polycythemia Vera (PV) who have abnormal baseline neutrophil counts or require
      hydroxyurea therapy and patients with Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) who require hydroxyurea
      therapy for disease control.
