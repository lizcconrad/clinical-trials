  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in dyspneic patients increases diagnostic
      accuracy for congestive heart failure (CHF). Limited information is available regarding
      economic outcomes attributable to BNP assay. The aim of this study was to assess the economic
      impact of BNP assay in elderly dyspneic patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspneic patients 65 years were enrolled in a randomized, controlled trial; hemodynamically
      unstable patients were excluded. BNP (Biosite assay) levels were measured prior to physician
      assessment with randomization in 1:1 ratio to either BNP 1) level reported or 2) level not
      reported. ED physicians made triage decisions guided by clinical judgment and nomogram to aid
      in interpretation of BNP level. Primary outcome was mean total hospital cost per subject.
      Secondary outcomes included admission rate, service assignment, discharge diagnosis and
      length of stay. Differences between groups were compared by t-test with bootstrap. Costs
      reflect 2005 constant dollars.
