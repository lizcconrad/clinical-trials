  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate effectiveness of a non-ablative (does not
      remove skin) treatment for cellulite (dimpled fat) in conjunction with skin tightening using
      the Candela GentleYAG laser.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of a non-ablative
      treatment for skin laxity by increasing dermatofibrosis of the reticular dermis using the
      Candela GentleYAG laser. Treatment areas will be limited to the thighs.

        -  The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the laser for improvement
           in appearance of cellulite.

        -  The secondary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of the laser with cooling
           and the laser without cooling for improvement in appearance of cellulite.

      This is an open label trial. Treatment will be conducted on either the left or the right
      thigh, which will be randomly determined. The contra-lateral side will not be treated and
      will serve as a control. A comparison of baseline photographs (prior to treatments) to
      photographs taken 1 and 3 months after the completion of treatments will be conducted.
      Photographic equipment and the protocol for photography will be consistent at each visit.
      Ultrasound may be taken at baseline and at the follow-up visits to evaluate flatness of
      cellulite and dermal fibrosis or enlargement of the reticular dermis. The circumference of
      the area to be treated will be measured with a tape measure, weight/height will be recorded
      and the Body Mass Index (BMI) will be calculated at baseline and follow-up visits. In
      addition, skin elasticity may be measured at the treatment areas at baseline and follow-up
      visits. The photographs, ultrasound and measurements will be taken using consistent
      procedures at each visit by viewing the baseline photograph and using landmarks such as
      freckles and birthmarks.

    <time_frame>6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Nurnberger-Muller Scale :
Stage 0: No dimpling. Stage 1: No dimpling. Stage 2: Dimpling spontaneously standing. Stage 3: Dimpling spontaneously standing and lying down.
Texture Scale:
Hard or Solid: Pinch test &quot;firm folds and furrows.&quot; Adherent to deep planes. Not modified with lying versus standing position.
Soft or Flaccid: Pinch test &quot;spongy and floating folds and furrows.&quot; No adherence to deep planes. Not painful, flaccid. &quot;Orange peel skin&quot; appears spontaneously.
Edematous: Doughy consistency. Pain and cramps. Signs of venous and lymphatic insufficiency &quot;legs in boot/column&quot;.
At the 6month follow-up, a blinded assessor ranked changes in cellulite appearance on subject's thighs according to the prior cellulite dimpling and texture criteria. Change in cellulite appearance was assessed on a scale of 0-3, with 0 as &quot;no change&quot; and 3 as &quot;significant change.&quot; Improvement in cellulite appearance was characterized by an increase of one unit or more on this scale.</description>

    <description>At the 6 month follow-up, a blinded assessor ranked change in cellulite appearance on subject's thighs according to the prior cellulite dimpling and texture criteria. Change in cellulite appearance was assessed on a scale of 0-3, with 0 as &quot;no change&quot; and 3 as &quot;significant change.&quot;
Using this scale, the average reduction in cellulite appearance was calculated for each participant that experienced a mild to moderate reduction in cellulite appearance.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Mild to Moderate Reduction in Cellulite.</title>
        <description>Nurnberger-Muller Scale :
Stage 0: No dimpling. Stage 1: No dimpling. Stage 2: Dimpling spontaneously standing. Stage 3: Dimpling spontaneously standing and lying down.
Texture Scale:
Hard or Solid: Pinch test &quot;firm folds and furrows.&quot; Adherent to deep planes. Not modified with lying versus standing position.
Soft or Flaccid: Pinch test &quot;spongy and floating folds and furrows.&quot; No adherence to deep planes. Not painful, flaccid. &quot;Orange peel skin&quot; appears spontaneously.
Edematous: Doughy consistency. Pain and cramps. Signs of venous and lymphatic insufficiency &quot;legs in boot/column&quot;.
At the 6month follow-up, a blinded assessor ranked changes in cellulite appearance on subject's thighs according to the prior cellulite dimpling and texture criteria. Change in cellulite appearance was assessed on a scale of 0-3, with 0 as &quot;no change&quot; and 3 as &quot;significant change.&quot; Improvement in cellulite appearance was characterized by an increase of one unit or more on this scale.</description>
