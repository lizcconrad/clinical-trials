  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this new imaging method is to provide physicians with additional information
      not available with standard imaging methods. This includes information about the make up of
      different breast diseases. Using spectroscopy data, it may be possible to tell the difference
      between benign conditions of the breast from malignant tumors and provide more accurate
      information than can be obtained with regular MRI. Along with the MRI a new method of
      evaluating the images or pictures will be used. This new method is called spectroscopy and is
      used routinely on other parts of the body such as the prostate and brain. Pictures produced
      with this sequence look different than the regular MRI pictures. Performing spectroscopy on a
      1.5T magnet adds another imaging sequence (another scan) to the routine MRI protocol, thus
      increasing exam time (extra 10-15 minutes). This study will enroll patients who are scheduled
      for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination ordered by their primary physician.

      Our aim is to perform MR Spectroscopy (MRS) on 150 patients at the end of their clinically
      indicated routine breast MRI guided biopsy and breast MRI guided needle localization
      examination using a software package from General Electric Medical Systems (Milwaukee,WI).
      This will add time to the routine examination but will not involve additional injections of
      contrast. We will analyze the spectroscopic data to determine if benign lesions can be
      reliably differentiated from malignant ones. The MR Spectroscopy (MRS) will be administered
      at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, NY,NY 10021.

        Include women with lesions, &gt; or = to 1 centimeter that will undergo a diagnostic MRI exam,
        an MRI guided biopsy, or an MRI guided needle localization, such as women with breast
        cancer or women with clinical and/or mammographic findings suspicious for breast masses.
        However, any known breast lesion, benign or malignant, will be appropriate for evaluation
        with MR spectroscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient needs to be ≥ or = to 18 years of age

          -  scheduled for diagnostic breast MRI examination or interventional procedure for a
             suspected or known breast lesion ≥ or = to 1 centimeter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who would be normally excluded from undergoing an MRI examination include:

          -  Patients with a pacemaker, aneurysm clip or any other condition that would warrant
             avoidance of a strong magnetic field

          -  Patients who are pregnant are excluded from participation of this study

          -  Patients who are unable to comply or complete the MRI exam due to claustrophobia or
             high levels of anxiety.
