      4. Methods 4a. Overview The study will be conducted in participants in the African-American
      Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) Cohort study as a randomized three period cross-over trial.

      Eighty five percent of AASK cohort participants are currently on an ACE inhibitor or
      angiotensin receptor blocker; the most commonly used ACE inhibitor is ramipril. The new
      strategies proposed in this pilot study will remain ramipril-based, to maintain the overall
      blood pressure control achieved thus far.

      The antihypertensive regimens proposed are as follows:

        -  AM dosing of ramipril and other once daily medications in the participants
           antihypertensive regimen (termed USUAL),

        -  Bedtime dosing of ramipril and other once a day medications in the participant's
           antihypertensive regimen (termed HS-DOSING), and

        -  their current antihypertensive regimen plus an additional antihypertensive agent dosed
           at bed time; the choice of the additional agent will be tailored based on prespecified
           clinical guidelines (termed ADD-ON DOSING)

      The &quot;usual arm&quot; serves as the comparator arm. The &quot;hs dosing&quot; and &quot;add-on dosing&quot; arms test
      practical strategies that could be tested in a subsequent clinical outcomes trial and that
      could be implemented in clinical practice. We hypothesize that both arms will reduce
      nocturnal BP in comparison to &quot;usual dosing&quot;. We further hypothesize that the &quot;hs dosing&quot; arm
      will raise daytime BP somewhat but have no net effect on 24 hour BP and that the &quot;add on
      dosing&quot; arm will have no effect on daytime BP but lower 24 hour BP.

      This pilot study will begin after the last scheduled AASK Cohort study visit. Eligible
      participants will be treated for 6 weeks on each of 3 antihypertensive regimens. The sequence
      of the regimens will be random. Each period of the three periods will have 2 visits, one
      visit at 3 weeks and one visit at 6 weeks. In the last week of each 6-week period, a 24-hour
      ABPM will be obtained. The primary outcome variable is nocturnal BP; each pair wise
      difference between the regimens will be calculated.

For those on monotherapy with a once/day antihypertensive regimen, the time of administration will be changed to bed time.
For those on multi-drug therapy, the time of administration of all once a day antihypertensive drugs will be changed to bed time.</description>

    <description>ADD-ON DOSING - This regimen will start with the USUAL regimen to which an additional agent will be added at bed time. An additional dose of ramipril, diltiazem, or hydralazine are three possible options for the add on medication. The intent of the ADD ON therapy is to lower nocturnal BP with minimal impact on daytime BP. Thus, agents with &lt; 24 hr duration of action are preferred. The specific choice and dose of add-on therapy (of the three agents) will be up to the site investigator considering the clinical situation of each participant based on the guidelines below.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant in the AASK Cohort Study

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent

          -  Completion of a technically adequate ABPM at CO48 AASK cohort study visit.

          -  Participants must have had at least 2 visits in the last 12 months of the Cohort Study
             (July 1 2006 to June 1 2007)

          -  The average of last two BPs measured at least one week apart in the Cohort Study must
             be less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg. This would exclude a small percentage of the
             AASK cohort population; however, it would enroll a group of participants with stable
             BP who should not require adjustments to their antihypertensive medications during the
             course of this study.

          -  Antihypertensive medications at baseline visit: This refers to the participant's
             antihypertensive regimen at the time of the baseline visit ; the transition period may
             be used to adjust the participant's antihypertensive regimen to meet these criteria,
             based on the clinical judgement of the site investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Arm circumference greater than 50 cms.

          -  ESRD requiring renal replacement therapy or kidney transplantation

          -  Institutionalized participants

          -  Shift workers working at night

          -  MI or CVA within 3 months of AASK Cohort close out visit

          -  Participants with known ejection fraction less than 40%

          -  Females known to be pregnant or lactating

          -  Participants likely to reach end stage renal disease within the next six weeks, in the
             judgement of the site investigator
