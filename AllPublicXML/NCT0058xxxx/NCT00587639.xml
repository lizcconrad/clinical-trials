      The objective of this investigation is to examine the safety and feasibility of a series of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatments (10 Hertz [Hz]; Left
      Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex), with a Neuronetics Model 2100 Therapy System as adjuvant
      treatment for depression in adolescent subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High frequency rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) has been
      shown to have an antidepressant effect. Initial studies comparing electroconvulsive therapy
      (ECT) and rTMS suggest that rTMS has been as effective as ECT in treating non-psychotic
      depression. Given the high degree of ongoing dysfunction in depressed adolescents despite
      optimization of treatment with antidepressant medications, new concerns regarding suicidal
      thoughts and behaviors in adolescents treated with antidepressant medications, and the more
      interventional nature of ECT, the use of rTMS as adjuvant therapy may be of significant
      clinical benefit. Thus far, research using rTMS to treat depression in adolescents has been
      limited. The primary aim of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of using 10
      Hz rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) as adjuvant treatment
      for depression in adolescents.

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment (baseline visit) and post treatment (approximately 6-8 weeks after baseline visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Auditory Verbal Learning Test 2 (CAVLT-2) is a neuropsychological test that measures auditory verbal learning and memory. This test is designed for ages 6.6-17.11 years. Scores are reported as normalized standard scores. The minimum standard score is 60 and the maximum 140; a higher score indicates a better performance.</description>

    <description>The Children's Depression Rating Scale, Revised (CDRS-R) is a validated, 17-item, clinician rating tool to assess severity of depression. Parents provide input into 14 of the items. Scores range from 0 to 60, with the following scale: not depressed (&lt;20), borderline depressive symptoms (20-29), mild depression (30-39), moderate depression (40-59), severe depression (&gt;/=60).</description>
