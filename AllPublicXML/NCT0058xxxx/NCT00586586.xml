      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behaviour therapy program
      (FRIENDS) for anxiety disorders in children aged 8-15 years who have been referred to child
      and adolescent mental health clinics in Western Norway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to be an efficacious treatment for anxiety
      disorders in youths when delivered in university settings. However, there is a lack of
      studies evaluating the effectiveness of CBT in regular clinical settings.

      The current study will compare a CBT program developed for anxiety in youths (the FRIENDS
      program by Paula Barrett, Australia), with a wait-list control condition. Group and
      individual treatment will also be compared in the study. Groups will be divided by age, with
      younger including 8-12-year-olds, and older 12-15-year-olds. Parents are also involved at the
      end of all therapy sessions, as well as in separate parent sessions. Assessment and treatment
      is delivered by clinicians working in seven outpatient clinics in Western Norway.

      There will be 10 therapy sessions, with booster sessions 4 and 12 weeks later. Effectiveness
      will be evaluated post-treatment, and at 1 and 5 years follow-up. The study will have a
      randomized design. Children randomized to the wait-list condition will be offered treatment
      if they still meet inclusion criteria after the waiting period.
