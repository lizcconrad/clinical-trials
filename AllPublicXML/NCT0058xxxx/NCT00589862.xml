  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is recommended that patients who have drug-eluting stents placed in their coronary
      arteries take aspirin and Plavix (Clopidogrel) for at least a year. Patients who stop taking
      these antiplatelet drugs or who have resistance to the antiplatelet effects of these drugs
      are at a higher risk of clots occurring inside the stents which may result in a heart attack.
      At the present time, it is unknown if increasing the doses of the antiplatelet agents is
      effective in overcoming this resistance. The purpose of this project is to identify patients
      with antiplatelet drug resistance and to test whether an increase in the Plavix (Clopidogrel)
      dose overcomes antiplatelet drug resistance.
