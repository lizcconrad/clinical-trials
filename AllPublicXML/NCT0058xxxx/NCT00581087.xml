      DHEA prevents and reverses chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in a chronic
      hypoxic-pulmonary hypertension model in the rat. However, no study has been performed in
      human. The purpose of this study is to determine if DHEA is effective in the treatment of
      respiratory pulmonary hypertension in adults with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) on exercise capacity and haemodynamic variables. Patients will receive after
      randomization either 200 mg oral DHEA or placebo over a one-year period. Evaluation concerns
      clinical parameters, echocardiography and right catheterization after and before treatment.
      Primary end-point is the six-minute walk test. This is a prospective double blind,
      randomized, placebo controlled study which will be realized in four university hospitals in
      France : Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Toulouse and Limoges.

      Eight patients with pulmonary hypertension (New York Heart Association functional class III
      or IV) associated with COPD were included in a pilot study between 2004 and 2005. Inclusion
      criteria were: COPD was defined by FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% of reference values; resting mean pulmonary
      artery pressure (assessment by right pulmonary catheterization) ≥ 25mmHg with mean pulmonary
      capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15mmHg, PaO2 ≤ 60mmHg at rest or PaO2 ≥ 60mmHg associated with
      significant fall in O2 saturation with exercise; oxygen treatment initiated more than six
      months previously. Exclusion criteria were: clinical or respiratory instability during the
      three months before the inclusion in the study; corticosteroids therapy (&gt; 0.5mg/kg/day of
      prednisolone or as equivalent); hepatic (prothrombin time &lt; 50%) or renal (creatininemia &gt;
      130µmol/L) failure; diabetes; left ventricular dysfunction; PSA (prostatic antigens &gt;
      2,5ng/ml) and past history or diagnosis of cancer. The study was conducted in accordance with
      the Good Clinical Practices Guidelines. The study protocol was approved by the ethics review
      board of the University Hospital of Bordeaux (France). Written informed consent was obtained
      for all patients and investigations were conducted according to the institutional guidelines
      and to the Helsinki principles. This trial conducted enrollment between 2004 and 2005, but
      had not been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov because it preceded this policy.(Study design:
      The dose of oral DHEA administered was 200 mg once daily for three months. At baseline and
      after three months of treatment, clinical evaluation included 6MWT, Borg dyspnea index,
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure, right heart catheterisation, lung function testing and
      serum DHEA levels were performed.)

      • Principal Objective : Efficacy of DHEA on exercise capacity (six-minute walk test)

        -  Secondary Objective :

             -  Efficacy of DHEA on pulmonary arterial pressures (mean, systolic and diastolic), on
                systemic arterial pressures, pulmonary vascular resistances

             -  Observance of treatment by DHEA

        -  Study design :

      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III study. Patients will be randomized
      into two parallel groups to receive either 200 mg oral DHEA or placebo over a one-year
      treatment. This is a multicentric study in the departments of respiratory medicine of
      Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Limoges and Toulouse (France).

                months

             -  Pregnancy (ßHCG &gt; 20 UI /l) or breastfeeding on going

             -  General corticotherapy &gt; 0,5 mg/kg/j prédnisolone equivalent

             -  Hepatic insufficiency (TP &lt; 50%) or renal insufficiency (creatininemia &gt; 130
                µmol/l) or diabetes mellitus type I or II (treated by oral antidiabetic oral or
                insulin)

             -  Left-heart failure (coronary heart disease and/or left valvulopathy)

        -  Study plan:

      After the screening evaluation and written consent document, patients will be randomized into
      two groups placebo or DHEA, over a one year treatment.

      • Number of subjects : 60 patients based on the increase of 30 % of the primary end-point,
      (six-minute walk test), i.e., 30 patients will be included in each group.
