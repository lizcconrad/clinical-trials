  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are undertaking a study of patients with gastric or pancreatic cancer. A common place for
      cancer to return after surgery for gastric or pancreatic cancer is the inside lining of the
      abdomen, called &quot;peritoneal metastasis&quot;. At the time of surgery, washing the abdomen with a
      mild salt solution may reveal free cancer cells in the abdomen which could develop into
      peritoneal metastasis. Recently, surgeons here at Memorial Sloan-Kettering have found that
      patients who have these cells develop peritoneal metastases and are better treated with
      chemotherapy rather than surgery. Sometimes, though, these cells might be present but cannot
      be found by using current techniques. We are trying to figure out a better way to find these
      free cancer cells. This could improve our treatment of patients with gastric and pancreatic
      cancer. We need &quot;negative control&quot; population to which we can compare the peritoneal washings
      of these cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Positive peritoneal cytology is a predictor of poor outcome in gastric cancer. These patients
      generally have a prognosis similar to patients who are clinically or radiologically
      classified as having Stage IV disease. Similar, although fewer, observations have been made
      in patients with pancreatic cancer. If identified prior to scheduled resection, an extensive
      operation may not be required. The purpose of this pilot trial is to investigate the ability
      of a quantitative RT-PCR assay to detect cancer cells in peritoneal washings of patients
      undergoing laparoscopy for gastric or pancreatic cancer. This assay may detect mRNA overly
      expressed in gastric or pancreatic cancer patients with malignant cells in the peritoneum
      which cannot be detected by less sensitive means. Results of this assay will be compared to
      cytology results, as detected by standard Papanicolaou staining, during routine laparoscopic
      peritoneal washings in the absence of visible M1 disease. We anticipate enrolling 50 gastric
      cancer patients and 50 pancreatic cancer patients who will be undergoing laparoscopy as part
      of their initial management. We plan to enroll 30 patients undergoing laparoscopy for a
      presumed benign condition (e.g., gallstones, prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
      [BSO]) as negative controls. We estimate accrual will take approximately 12 months. Once this
      assay is established with this pilot study, we plan to evaluate prospectively the incidence,
      predictors, and clinical significance of positive cytology, as detected by standard
      Papanicolaou stainingand RT-PCR of tumor markers. This study does not conflict with any
      existing protocol at Memorial Hospital.

    <description>Positive controls will include patients who have positive cytology or positive biopsy of peritoneal metastases. Cell lines which over-express these tumor markers will also be used as positive controls. Sensitivity will be defined using serial dilutions of several established gastric and pancreatic tumor cell lines. The mRNA of the tumor markers will be normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression.</description>

    <description>Patients who are scheduled to undergo laparoscopy for benign disease (e.g., laparoscopic cholecystectomy, hernia repair, or prophylactic BSO) will be recruited as negative controls. A leukemia cell line which does not express epithelial cell markers will also be used as a negative control for the RT-PCR reactions.</description>

    <description>During the laparoscopy, a small amount of a mild salt solution will be introduced to gently wash the inside of the abdomen. The fluid will be removed and sent to the laboratory for two analyses: 1) washings for cytology (routine), and 2) washings for experimental marker testing (experimental).</description>
