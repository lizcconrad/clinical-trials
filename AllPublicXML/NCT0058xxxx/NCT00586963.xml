      This study is being done to for two reasons:

        -  To learn about the effects (good and bad) esomeprazole (an FDA approved drug for reflux
           esophagitis) has on your esophagus when taken correctly.

        -  To learn about the quality of life changes (good and bad) you may experience with this
           medication.

      The plan is to have 50 people take part in this study at Mayo Clinic Rochester. This research
      study is looking at people who have a new condition called erosive reflux esophagitis.
      Esophagitis is defined as mucosal damage produced by the abnormal reflux of gastric contents
      into the esophagus. Acid reflux, over time, can wear away or erode the lining of your
      esophagus. This condition is called erosive esophagitis. The treating physician may start you
      on prescription strength acid reducing group of medications called Proton Pump Inhibitors
      (PPI). PPI medications can provide 24-hour relief from your painful heartburn symptoms and it
      can help you heal the erosions in the esophagus that acid reflux may cause.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Have either mild-to-moderate erosive reflux esophagitis

          -  Meet criteria for GERD symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients already on esomeprazole therapy, have previously failed to respond to
             esomeprazole, or are intolerant to PPI therapy.

             PPI therapy.

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded as PPI's are not thought safe for the fetus (Pregnancy
             Category C). - Children younger than 18 years of age will be excluded.

          -  Other vulnerable populations, such as those with diminished mental acuity, will be
