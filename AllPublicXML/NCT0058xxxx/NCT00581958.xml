  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop blood tests and urine tests that can tell doctors how
      much radiation a person has been exposed to. Doctors know how much radiation patients are
      exposed to in certain medical situations. An example of this would be radiation treatment for
      cancer. Radiation treatment machines are programmed to give exact doses of radiation.

      MSKCC patients undergoing TBI as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) will
      have blood drawn and urine collected for use in the validation and refinement of new methods
      for rapid high-throughput radiation biodosimetry. These blood and urine samples will be
      collected before, and at defined times after TBI. Blood sampling will occur in the same
      manner that it does during routine patient care during HSCT.

    <description>Research subjects will have blood and/or urine sampled at three time points in the Department of Radiation Oncology. Participating patients will have at least a total two samples collected at each time point. The first sampling will occur before the first TBI treatment is given. The second sampling will occur before the second TBI treatment, usually 3 to 8 hours after the first treatment (in the case of multifraction TBI). If a patient is being treated with single fraction TBI, then the second sampling will occur approximately 3-8 hours after the first TBI treatment. The third and final sampling will occur at the next morning blood draw, prior to the fourth TBI treatment (in the case of multifraction TBI), 24 hours after the first TBI treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients greater than 4 years of age at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center

          -  Must be undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (either autologous or
             allogenic) in conjunction with a conditioning regimen that includes TBI (single or
             multiple fraction)

          -  Functional central venous catheter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No subjects will be excluded from the proposed research study for demographic reasons.
             Treatment with growth factors, such as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), will not be
             grounds for exclusion.

          -  Subjects who will receive radiation therapy within 5 days prior to TBI will be
             excluded.

          -  Subjects who will receive systemic antineoplastic chemotherapy within 7 days prior to
             TBI not have research bloods collected. Only urine will be collected from these
             patients.

          -  Based on current knowledge, we will not a priori exclude patients based on disease
             status (ie, patients in or out of remission will be included in this study), type of
             disease(ie, chromosomal breakage syndromes), or previous therapies (unless exclusion
             criteria is met).
