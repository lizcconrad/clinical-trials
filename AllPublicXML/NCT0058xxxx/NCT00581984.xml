      This study will collect 5 year data about any possible health problems associated with breast
      implants. This data will be used to help see if the implants are both safe and effective. If
      they are proven safe and effective, they will continue to be available. If they are not
      proven safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA, they may not be available in the
      future.

      This prospective clinical study is being undertaken to document the safety of McGhan Medical
      Silicone-Filled Breast Implants. Patients will be evaluated pre-operatively,
      intraoperatively, and at one, three and five years following implant surgery. Safety of
      McGhan Medical Silicone-Filled Breast Implants will be assessed based on the incidence of
      medical complications, implant failure and serious adverse effects.

      This prospective clinical study of McGhan Medical Silicone-Filled Breast Implants is part of
      an ongoing research effort to document the safety and effectiveness of silicone-filled breast
      implants.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of any age for which breast reconstruction is considered appropriate.
             (Patients under 18 years old require parental/legal guardian consent to participate).

          -  Have any of the following conditions or situations present:

               -  Post mastectomy surgical removal of the breast for cancer or other diseases;

               -  Post trauma or post surgery where there was total or partial removal of the
                  breast resulting in significant deformity.(for any reason);

               -  Severe ptosis requiring reconstruction (i.e. mastopexy);.

               -  Any congenital or acquired discrepancy in breast size such as to represent a
                  significant physical deformity. This does not include normal variants of
                  asymmetry. Examples include, but are not limited to:Pectus excavatum, Pectus
                  carinatum; Thoracic hypoplasia (Poland's syndrome, Scoliosis; Isolated rib
                  deformities; Tuberous breasts; Congenital absence

               -  Revision of implant procedure due to any of the following circumstances;

          -  Previous augmentation or reconstruction with silicone- or saline-filled implants where
             problems exist, such as implant. rapture or significant capsular contracture (Baker
             Grade III or IV) requiring revision;

               -  Contralateral mammaplasty in unaffected breast as a result of the affected breast
                  requiring surgery (for one of the aforementioned circumstances), when medically
                  indicated to provide symmetry.

          -  Adequate tissue available to cover implants.

          -  Saline-filled implants are not an appropriate choice.

          -  Willingness to follow all study requirements, such as agreeing to all required
             follow-up visits, and acceptance of the risks involved as indicated by signing of the
             Patient Informed Consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant-without accompanying
             subcutaneous mastectomy.

          -  Existing carcinoma of the breast, without mastectomy.

          -  Abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment.

          -  Pregnant or nursing.

          -  Have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes; which is clinically known to impact
             wound healing ability.

          -  Show tissue characteristics which are clinically incompatible with mammaplasty, such
             as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue, compromised vascularity
             or ulceration.

          -  Have, or under treatment for, any condition which, in the opinion of the surgeon, may
             constitute an unwarranted surgical risk.

          -  Show psychological characteristics which, in the opinion of the surgeon, may be
             incompatible with the surgical procedure and the prosthesis, such as inappropriate
             attitude or motivation.

          -  Wish to have augmentation mammaplasty, but do not have at least one of the diagnoses
             identified in Patient Inclusion Criteria item G #2, pages 7 &amp; 8.

          -  Are not willing to undergo further surgery for revision, if medically required.

          -  Diagnosis of lupus or scleroderma.

          -  Replacement of saline-filled implants solely for a less than desirable cosmetic
             outcome, such as wrinkling.
