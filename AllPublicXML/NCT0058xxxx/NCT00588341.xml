  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we want to find out how likely it is for temozolomide to shrink melanoma
      tumors that have spread only to areas that could be removed by surgery. We also want to study
      the melanoma before and after temozolomide treatment to learn why some tumors respond and
      others do not. This is a Phase II trial. This means that it will test a drug - in this case,
      temozolomide -- that has already been studied and shown to be safe.

      Surgery, when possible, is the main treatment for patients with melanoma like yours. In most
      people, however, melanoma cells have already spread to other places in the body. This means
      that even with surgery, many people will have the melanoma come back. This is often fatal.

      One goal of this trial is to treat the melanoma cells that might have spread before they have
      a chance to grow.

      As part of this trial, we also study which genes are turned on and which genes are turned off
      in your tumor. We will obtain tumor from the biopsy done before you started temozolomide
      treatment and from the tumor removed during the surgery done after you finish temozolomide
      treatment. This may help us understand how temozolomide works and how to recognize which
      tumors will respond.

      Before and during the temozolomide treatment, we will also test a new way of measuring the
      amount of tumor present. This involves a special way of analyzing the CT scan which you will
      have anyway. This new technique may allow us to see tumor shrinkage very early in the
      treatment course.

      In this Phase II trial, chemotherapy-naïve patients with palpable Stage III or Stage IV M1a
      melanoma scheduled to undergo surgical resection will be treated with TMZ in 8 week cycles
      according to the extended dosing schedule of 75mg/m2/day x 6 weeks with 2 weeks off. Patients
      will be treated until maximal response to TMZ and then undergo resection of residual disease.
      The primary endpoint will be tumor response as measured by the RECIST criteria. Patients will
      be seen monthly.

    <description>At the start of the trial a core needle biopsy of a palpable tumor will be obtained percutaneously in the office after administration of local anesthesia. Patients will then be treated with TMZ according to the extended dosing schedule of 75mg/m2/day x 6 weeks every 8 weeks. After each cycle, patients will be re-evaluated for response.
Responding patients will be offered another cycle of treatment. Patients will be treated until best response, progression of disease, or 6 cycles, whichever comes first.
After completing temozolomide treatment, patients will be evaluated for surgical resection. It is expected that, unless there is progression of disease, patients will undergo resection (i.e. therapeutic lymph node dissection). In patients who have a complete clinical response to temozolomide, whether or not to do a subsequent lymph node dissection will be left up to the discretion of the surgeon and the patient.</description>
