  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a new device can help obtain more accurate
      CT and PET scans of the lungs and chest tumors and the liver and liver tumors to help in
      delivering radiation therapy. When we breathe, the amount of air in the lung changes. Lung
      tumors may also move during breathing. Liver tumors may also move with breathing; as the
      lungs inflate, the liver can be pushed down. A CT scan (a special type of X-ray) is routinely
      obtained as part of planning for lung or liver radiation therapy. Since patients breathe
      during this CT scan and their lung or liver tumors move, these CT scans can sometimes be
      inaccurate. We are now testing a device to only obtain the CT and an additional PET scan
      while patients are breathing in or out. This will hopefully allow us to deliver radiation
      with more accuracy.

      The objectives are to measure the amount of tumor motion with respiration, measure changes in
      tumor definition with breathing synchronized PET compared to standard free breathing PET, and
      to determine the fraction of patients whose radiation treatment plans would be modified based
      on this information. Eligible patients are those receiving radiation treatment for thoracic
      or liver tumors.
