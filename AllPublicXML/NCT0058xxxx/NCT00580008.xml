  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of clinical research is to look at the nature of disease and try to develop
      improved methods to diagnose and treat disease.The goal of this study is to evaluate the use
      of computed tomography (CT) scan of the heart in the diagnosis of disease in vein grafts
      after bypass surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have bypass surgery with using vein grafts from their legs (saphenous veins)
      have a very high risk of developing blockages in the grafts. It has been shown in previous
      studies that the progression of disease in vein grafts is very quick and can result in chest
      pain, heart attacks or death. In the past, evaluation of the grafts was possible with heart
      catheterization only. The technique of CT scan is currently considered an effective way to
      look at vein grafts as well as the arteries around the heart to identify blockages.

      Certain blood proteins have been associated with rapid progression of vein graft blockages.
      Our purpose is to not only to identify blockages at different stages after bypass surgery,
      but to investigate the causes of the rapid progression of the disease, including clinical
      history, risk factors and the blood proteins.
