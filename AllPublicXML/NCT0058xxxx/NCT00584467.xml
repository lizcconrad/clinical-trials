  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated registry aimed at assembling a blood/serum and genomic
      resource (bank) of human blood samples with accompanying clinical data mainly from patients
      who are scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization at UC Davis Medical Center, but may also
      include other eligible individuals. Funding is from institutional/divisional research funds.

      This study is aimed at assembling a blood/serum and genomic resource (bank) of human samples
      with accompanying clinical data mainly from patients who are scheduled to undergo cardiac
      catheterization at UC Davis Medical Center, but may also include other eligible individuals.
      These samples will be analyzed at UC Davis Medical Center for determination of biomarker
      levels, and concomitantly analyzed at UC San Francisco in an IRB-approved protocol at that
      institution for genetic analysis (UCSF IRB approval # for this study is H711-15138-03;
      protocol name is &quot;Discovery of Gene Mutations and Polymorphisms that Contribute to the Risk
      of Atherosclerosis&quot;; principal investigator is John P. Kane, MD). All samples sent to UCSF
      will be de-identified and catalogued using an alphanumeric code. A number of candidate genes
      will be studied to detect mutations and polymorphisms that could contribute to the risk of
      atherosclerosis. The technique of hybridization sequencing will be employed for this. The
      techniques of classical statistical genetics will be employed for both cosegregation analysis
      and for the genome search approach. Clinical follow-up may be obtained at 6 and 12 months.
