  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of utilizing a reduced intensity conditioning regimen,
      in the setting of haploidentical transplantation, for patients with recurrent acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), AML and high risk or refractory solid tumors. In addition, the
      feasibility and safety of administering post-transplant NK cell infusions will be evaluated.
      Data obtained from this study will help determine the efficacy of allogeneic HSCT in the
      treatment of pediatric sarcomas and add to the small body of literature utilizing
      haploidentical HSCT to treat acute leukemia in pediatric patients. This study will also
      further elucidate the role of NK cells in mediating a graft vs. tumor effect in allogeneic
      HSCT. The main benefit to society is that this study will explore a novel therapy for
      children with highly refractory cancer who are felt to be incurable with conventional
      approaches. If feasibility is demonstrated, and there is evidence of anti-tumor activity,
      then this will open up a new area of clinical research to better define the efficacy of this
      approach for specific childhood malignancies.

    <description>patients will undergo a standard pre-transplant evaluation, but will also have blood drawn to evaluate their HLA class I killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand typing. Parents will undergo KIR genotyping and phenotyping, and a donor will be selected based on which parent shows the greatest degree of KIR receptor-ligand mismatching. Once the donor has been selected he/she will undergo a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection utilizing G-CSF and GM-CSF for stem cell mobilization. The PBSC collection will be performed utilizing standard procedures. The PBSC will then be processed in the UW BMT Laboratory in order to deplete the graft of T cells. This will be accomplished using the CliniMACS cell separation system. T cell depletion is a standard procedure for patients receiving haploidentical stem cell grafts. The resulting stem cell product will be analyzed for T cell, stem cell and NK cell content.</description>

When the donor had been selected he/she underwent a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection utilizing G-CSF and GM-CSF for stem cell mobilization. The PBSC collection was performed utilizing standard procedures. The PBSC was then be processed in the UW BMT Laboratory in order to deplete the graft of T cells. This was accomplished using the CliniMACS cell separation system. T cell depletion is a standard procedure for patients receiving haploidentical stem cell grafts. The resulting stem cell product were analyzed for T cell, stem cell and NK cell content.

            <description>Patients underwent a standard pre-transplant evaluation, but will also had blood drawn to evaluate their HLA class I killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) ligand typing. Parents underwent KIR genotyping and phenotyping, and a donor was selected based on which parent showed the greatest degree of KIR receptor-ligand mismatching. When the donor had been selected he/she underwent a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection utilizing G-CSF and GM-CSF for stem cell mobilization. The PBSC collection was performed utilizing standard procedures. The PBSC was then be processed in the UW BMT Laboratory in order to deplete the graft of T cells. This was accomplished using the CliniMACS cell separation system. T cell depletion is a standard procedure for patients receiving haploidentical stem cell grafts. The resulting stem cell product were analyzed for T cell, stem cell and NK cell content.
