  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are considered first-line therapy for both allergic and
      non-allergic rhinitis.1-3 Nasal congestion can persist despite maximum treatment with
      intranasal GCS. No other drugs are superior to intranasal GCS in relieving nasal congestion.
      For example, antihistamines are not effective in relieving congestion.1 Oral decongestants
      are somewhat beneficial in relieving nasal congestion but can elevate blood pressure, cause
      restlessness, and cause urinary retention. Oxymetazoline, however, is a potent decongestant
      and the addition of it to a nasal GCS should add a considerable decongestant benefit. It may
      also be beneficial in patients with persistent nighttime congestion despite maximum dosages
      of nasal GCS.

      Oxymetazoline is currently recommended for three days use because of the proposed risk of
      rhinitis medicamentosa,4 which is increased nasal congestion caused by prolonged use of nasal
      decongestant sprays.5-8 The term RM was coined early in the twentieth century after several
      case reports described patients developing rebound congestion after using first generation
      intranasal decongestants such as privine hydrochloride and ephedrine for prolonged
      periods6,7. The histopathology and mechanism of RM has been based on animal models which may
      not be pertinent to humans.9-13 Studies using oxymetazoline, a newer intranasal decongestant,
      in individuals without rhinitis have shown conflicting evidence for the development of
      RM.14-16 For example, normal individuals without rhinitis using oxymetazoline three times
      daily for four weeks did not develop RM.17 Also, it is unknown the frequency of
      administration and dosage of oxymetazoline it takes to induce RM or whether RM is just a
      return to a patient's baseline nasal congestion as present before beginning oxymetazoline. It
      is also unknown whether RM is more likely or only occurs with older vasoconstrictors such as
      privine hydrochloride and ephedrine rather than oxymetazoline.

      Nasal GCS reduce the amount of rebound congestion in patients with perennial allergic
      rhinitis who have reportedly developed RM.18 Nasal GCS decrease nasal mucosa edema,
      recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, cytokine production, and late-phase nasal
      mediators.19-21 They may offer a protective benefit from the risk of developing RM.
      Oxymetazoline may also decrease inferior turbinate hypertrophy thereby permitting better
      adsorption of the nasal GCS.

      Hypothesis

      The addition of oxymetazoline to a nasal GCS for fourteen days will decrease the amount of
      congestion in subjects with allergic or non-allergic rhinitis with persistent congestion
      despite maximum recommended dosages of a nasal GCS. It is also hypothesized that nasal GCS
      protect against the development of RM secondary to oxymetazoline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects 18 years of age and older

          2. At least a one year history of perennial allergic or non-allergic rhinitis

          3. Subjects receiving allergen immunotherapy must be on a stable maintenance regimen for
             at least 30 days before the first study visit and remain on this dosage during the
             study.

          4. Subjects must be on the maximum doses of one of the following nasal GCS for at least
             one month: beclomethasone, flunisolide, fluticasone, mometasone, or triamcinolone.
