  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help us understand more about your experience with penile
      injection therapy. Many men become anxious when thinking about penile injections. We would
      like to understand more about this anxiety. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires
      before you start penile injection training, at each training visit, and then at your four
      month follow-up visit.

      The treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) following radical pelvic surgery has become an
      increasingly important issue. For many men, oral medications for ED will not be effective
      immediately postoperatively. These medications enhance the effect of nitric oxide secreted
      from the cavernous nerves, however these nerves are usually transiently injured
      intraoperatively diminishing the amount of nitric oxide available. Consequently, oral
      medications are usually ineffective for up to 18 to 24 months postoperatively while the
      cavernous nerves are healing. As a result, penile injection therapy is the primary treatment
      for ED for those men. This treatment delivers intracavernosal vasodilators at the base of the
      penis with a 29 gauge needle. This direct application produces consistent results and has
      been found to be effective for 94% of injection users. Despite common sense and clinical
      experience that indicates men become very anxious about penile injection therapy, anxiety has
      rarely been assessed in studies of penile injection therapy. We have observed that men who
      are initially reluctant about penile injection therapy are more likely to try this treatment
      when they hear that the injection anxiety dissipates quickly, after only a few injections. We
      unfortunately only have clinical observation to support our claim describing the course of
      injection anxiety. This study would provide empirical data to support this claim and this
      data will be used in describing the treatment and encouraging men to try injection therapy.
