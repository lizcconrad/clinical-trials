  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multi-center study to
      estimate the improvement in progression free survival (compared to control subjects) and
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 386 in combination with Cisplatin &amp; Capecitabine
      in the treatment of subjects with Metastatic Gastric, Gastroesophageal Junction, or Distal
      Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. AMG 386 is a man-made medication that is designed to stop the
      development of blood vessels in cancer tissues. Cancer tissues rely on the development of new
      blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis, to obtain a supply of oxygen and nutrients to
      grow.
