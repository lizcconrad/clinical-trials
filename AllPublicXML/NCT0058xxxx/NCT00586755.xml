  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have a grave prognosis. They usually have an initial
      response to therapy, however progress early in the course of the disease and have very poor
      survival. We hypothesize that the emergence of drug resistance is responsible for this early
      failure of therapy and therefore intensive therapy at induction followed by high dose therapy
      immediately may produce a better outcome.

      Subjects will undergo an induction regimen consisting of 1 cycle of cytarabine (3 gm/m2
      Intravenously over 1 hour every 12 hours for 8 total doses) and mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2/d
      intravenously [IV] over 30 minutes daily on days 1, 2, and 3). This will be combined with
      Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 antibody) for 6-8 weeks. If, after this one cycle, subjects have not
      had progression of disease as noted on physical exam or radiographic scans, they will proceed
      to stem cell mobilization with cyclophosphamide. This will be immediately followed by high
      dose therapy with stem cell support. Following count recovery, rituximab will be used for 8
      total doses as consolidation therapy. Involved field irradiation may be given post-transplant
      to those with localized bulky disease as well. Day -6: Carmustine (BCNU): 15 mg/kg (or 550
      mg/m2) IV over 2 hrs. Day -4: Etoposide Day -2: Cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg in 1 liter D5W
      over 2 hours.

    <description>Number of patients who did not have documented recurrence for at 1 year after bone marrow transplantation.
We would like to detect an improvement over 0.25 in DFS at one year. Thirty (30) patients will be accrued and complete the transplant phase of therapy. We anticipate only 50% of patients enrolling to complete transplant, noting that approximately 60 patients total will need to be accrued. With 30 patients we can detect an improvement as small as 17% in magnitude, i.e., from an assumed 1-year DFS of 25% to a 1-year DFS of 42% with approximately 80% power. This is based on a one-sided test of hypothesis, testing at significance level 0.05 and the assumption that the true underlying 1-year DFS is 0.25. Greater differences in DFS are expected. If the 1-year DFS with the new treatment is greater than 42% the power is increased.</description>
