  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a new technology for obtaining x-ray images of your
      treatment fields when you are positioned on the treatment machine, to determine whether this
      new system is as reliable and easy to use as conventional systems.. These so-called portal
      images are normally taken on a weekly basis, prior to your radiation treatment. The new
      portal imaging system to be tested is designed to produce better quality images than are
      currently achievable, but with no additional dose or added treatment time.

      The objective of this proposal is to test the clinical practicality of a new technology; cone
      beam imaging, for verification of treatment set up accuracy of cancer patients receiving
      radiation therapy. Currently, treatment accuracy is checked via use of 2-dimensional
      projection x-rays taken with the megavoltage treatment beam and electronic portal imaging
      devices (EPID). Typically 2 orthogonal portal images are obtained to confirm patient
      positioning accuracy. This method of treatment verification, however, usually provides images
      of poor quality and lacks true 3D information, thus making it difficult for the radiation
      oncologist to definitively confirm treatment accuracy. New generation EPIDs are capable of
      obtaining higher quality images at significantly lower imaging doses. Thus, for the same
      total imaging dose new generation EPIDs permit acquisition of many projection images rather
      than just 2 or 3. The combination of more images and higher quality images should permit more
      definitive assessment of treatment accuracy. We propose here to test the clinical
      practicality and reliability of a new prototype portal imaging system.
