  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to learn about the needs and feelings of women who are infertile. Being
      infertile means not being able to have a child without the help of a third party. There are
      other options for building a family. The researchers are interested in the participants'
      thoughts about these options and want to learn about the experiences of infertile women due
      to cancer treatment as well as women who are infertile due to other causes. The researchers
      hope that what they learn will allow them to better care for infertile women in the future.

      As part of this study, you will be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires. These
      questions will ask about your feelings, sexual function, quality of life, and ideas about
      reproductive options. We will also ask some questions about you, your health, and your
      medical history. You can choose to answer these questions either at one of your doctor visits
      or over the telephone. You can decide the best way to complete this assessment.
