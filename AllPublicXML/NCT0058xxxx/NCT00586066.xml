  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether memantine improves memory function in
      participants with bipolar disorder who have minimal symptoms. Secondary analyses will test
      the role of memantine in improving residual mood symptoms (depression and mania) in
      participants with bipolar disorder.

      We hypothesize that in participants with bipolar disorder who have minimal symptoms memantine
      will be effective in improving cognitive functions, as measured by the difference in
      neuropsychological test scores at the beginning and at the end of the trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of participants with bipolar disorder experience significant cognitive
      dysfunction, even when euthymic, after adequate treatment. The cognitive deficits in
      asymptomatic patients with bipolar disorder are very important for the participant's
      psychosocial function. In this population, cognitive deficits have been associated with poor
      psychosocial functioning, such as inability to hold a job. Memantine is a glutamate
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which has shown efficacy in cognitive
      dysfunction due to moderate to severe Alzheimer disease.

      Demonstrating the role of memantine in reducing cognitive dysfunction in minimally
      symptomatic participants with bipolar disorder promises to provide important clinical
      information, which could lead to improvements in well-being and functional status for large
      populations of participants with bipolar disorder.

    <measure>California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CVLT is used to measure verbal learning and episodic long-term memory. It assesses learning, short- and long-delayed recall and recognition for a list of 16 shopping items. Subjects are expected to remember a list of words. They are asked to repeat the words remembered 5 times (5 trials). Each of the words correctly remembered, in each trial, is marked as 1 point. The reported data represent the number of correct items for the Trial 1, Trial 5, Short Delay Free Recall, and Long Delay Free Recall. The long-delayed recall is assessed at 20 minutes. The CVLT enables a comprehensive characterization of a participant's memory profile.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>RVP is a sensitive measure of sustained attention. In this test, a white box appears in the center of the screen with digits from 2-9 in a pseudorandom order at a rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are asked to identify target sequences of three digits and to register responses using the press pad.
RVPA is a measure of target sensitivity (i.e., the ability to discriminate between target and distractors). The outcome is defined as a z-score (statistical deviation from normal). A z-score of 0 is average. Higher z-scores represent better than average performance and negative z-scores represent worse than average performance.
RVPB is an index of response bias (i.e., the tendency to respond or not respond in general). The outcome is defined as a z-score (statistical deviation from normal). A z-score of 0 is average. Higher z-scores represent a stronger tendency to respond and negative z-scores represent a less than average tendency to respond.</description>

        <title>California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CVLT is used to measure verbal learning and episodic long-term memory. It assesses learning, short- and long-delayed recall and recognition for a list of 16 shopping items. Subjects are expected to remember a list of words. They are asked to repeat the words remembered 5 times (5 trials). Each of the words correctly remembered, in each trial, is marked as 1 point. The reported data represent the number of correct items for the Trial 1, Trial 5, Short Delay Free Recall, and Long Delay Free Recall. The long-delayed recall is assessed at 20 minutes. The CVLT enables a comprehensive characterization of a participant's memory profile.</description>

        <title>Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP)</title>
        <description>RVP is a sensitive measure of sustained attention. In this test, a white box appears in the center of the screen with digits from 2–9 in a pseudorandom order at a rate of 100 digits per minute. Participants are asked to identify target sequences of three digits and to register responses using the press pad.
RVPA is a measure of target sensitivity (i.e., the ability to discriminate between target and distractors). The outcome is defined as a z-score (statistical deviation from normal). A z-score of 0 is average. Higher z-scores represent better than average performance and negative z-scores represent worse than average performance.
RVPB is an index of response bias (i.e., the tendency to respond or not respond in general). The outcome is defined as a z-score (statistical deviation from normal). A z-score of 0 is average. Higher z-scores represent a stronger tendency to respond and negative z-scores represent a less than average tendency to respond.</description>
