  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate tumors in the laboratory to determine how and why
      they respond, or fail to respond to different drug therapies. This study will also
      investigate why high pressure develops within tumors and how this affects how well drugs
      work. We will also take blood samples before and/or after your procedure to measure
      biochemical factors that may help us predict the behavior of osteogenic sarcoma and other
      solid tumors.

      When tumor tissue known or presumed to be a primary or secondary bone cancer or solid tumor
      with known elevated intra-tumoral pressure such as retinoblastoma is being removed or has
      been removed for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons a small sample of it will be obtained for
      this study. The tumor samples will be used to study in vitro, determinants of chemotherapy
      resistance and oncogenesis. These determinants will be correlated with histologic response to
      preoperative chemotherapy and clinical outcome (event free survival). In addition, blood
      samples (20ml) may be obtained before or after the procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with a presumed or known diagnosis of a primary or secondary bone cancer
             or other solid tumor who are having or have had a biopsy or surgery to remove tumor
             for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons. No tumors will be obtained solely for research
             purposes.

          -  All adult patients (&gt; or = to 18 yrs.) will have given written informed consent.

          -  All minor patients (&lt;18 yrs.) will have given assent to the best of their ability to
             understand, and their parent or guardian will have given written informed consent
