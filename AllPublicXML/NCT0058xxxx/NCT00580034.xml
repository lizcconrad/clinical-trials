  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic transplantation is used to treat many malignant and non-malignant diseases, though
      the potential toxicities of the procedure remain high. We and others have shown that a less
      toxic preparative regimen allows reliable allogeneic engraftment for allogeneic
      transplantation.

      The primary purpose of this treatment trial is to follow patients undergoing allogeneic
      transplantation for long term outcomes. The regimen used has been tested in our prior phase I
      / II trial which has completed accrual. The issues of engraftment and rate of graft versus
      host disease have been answered and our success has led to this regimen being a standard
      approach for less toxic allogeneic therapy.

      Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may cure or ameliorate illnesses of many types;
      however the toxicity of the procedure limits its broad applicability. Hematologic
      malignancies of all types have shown responses. Those with marrow failure, such as aplasia,
      and hemoglobinopathies have further shown responses in multiple trials as well. Even patients
      with certain solid tumors, such as breast, renal cell, and melanoma have shown partial or
      complete responses to allogeneic therapy. The limiting effect of the historical methods of
      aggressive induction for allogeneic therapy were extremely toxic, requiring limiting those
      offered allogeneic therapy to the healthiest of the ill patients. Work over the last decade
      has shown that less toxic agents targeting the immune system effectively allowed engraftment
      with less effects on the patient's liver, lungs, and other vital organs. We and others have
      completed multiple trials showing the effective use of these less toxic, non-myeloablative,
      regimens for allogeneic therapy. Trials with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide at standard
      doses (patients are not ablated and recover blood counts in 2 weeks) allow for 80% of
      patients to engraft donor cells. Some groups have added low doses of radiation to this
      combination, with 80-100% allogeneic engraftment. The lessened toxicity of this approach has
      been confirmed in multiple studies, including our own data with the specific schema in this
      treatment plan reviewed below. Phase I results with this combination: Our group has combined
      the above combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with the antibody CAMPATH 1H. This
      antibody is given to the patient to purge the immune system and prevent rejection. It also
      purges the T cells in the donated stem cells to minimize graft versus host disease (GVHD).
      This approach has been proven successful in multiple trials using standard more toxic
      ablative procedures. Our approach over the last 3 years has been very successful using this
      antibody with the less toxic non-myeloablative procedure and our trials have completed.

      The primary purpose of this treatment trial is to follow patients undergoing allogeneic
      transplantation for long term outcomes. The regimen used has been tested in our prior phase I
      / II trial which has completed accrual. The issues of engraftment and rate of graft versus
      host disease have been answered and our success has led to this regimen being a standard
      approach for less toxic allogeneic therapy.

    <description>Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was graded according to the consensus criteria and common terminology criteria (CTC) v3.0 was used for all other toxicities. Recognizing that acute GVHD pathology in the non-ablative and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) setting may occur late, we tabulated skin, gut and liver toxicity consistent with acute GVHD (aGVHD) at anytime in the year following the infusion as aGVHD. Toxicities were formally recorded for all patients twice weekly for the first 100 days, at each follow up visit, and as needed intercurrently.</description>

    <description>Response Assessment included physical exam and evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow. There's no widely accepted criteria for response other than complete response (CR). CR for malignant hematologic diseases is met if all the following are met for &gt;/= 1 month: a) absence of pathologic lymphadenopathy by physical and radiographic exam b) absence of constitutional symptoms due to disease c) Polymorphonuclear leukocyte count &gt;1,500/uL; platelet count &gt;50,000/uL; and hemoglobin &gt;10.0 g/dL d) bone marrow aspirate/biopsy done after (a) through (c) have been met, &gt;/= 30% cellularity and an absence of abnormal lymphoid nodules or cells by flow cytometry, cytogenetics, etc. e) molecular markers of disease must be negative by polymerase chain reaction, Fluorescence in situ hybridization, cytogenetics etc. CR for solid tumors requires complete resolution of disease on physical exam and radiographs. CR for marrow failure is normal white cell, platelet and hematocrit values.</description>

Recognizing that acute GVHD pathology in the non-ablative and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) setting may occur late, we tabulated skin, gut and liver toxicity consistent with acute GVHD (aGVHD) at anytime in the year following the infusion as aGVHD.

Donor: Will receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10-16 mcg/kg/d subcutaneously (dose will be rounded to the nearest whole vial size and may be divided into twice daily dosing). Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 15 mcg/kg/d subcutaneous or similar growth factor for donor mobilization.

          <description>Campath Purged Non-myeloablative ASCT in lymphoma, myeloma, or marrow failure: leukemia or myelodysplasia; and solid tumors
Donor: Will receive granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) 10-16 mcg/kg/d subcutaneously (dose will be rounded to the nearest whole vial size and may be divided into twice daily dosing). Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 15 mcg/kg/d subcutaneously or similar growth factor for donor mobilization. Donors will receive at least 3-6 doses of daily growth factor until adequate cells are mobilized.
Preparative regimen: Begins on day -5 and consist of 4 days of daily fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/d infused over 30 minutes, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/d infused over 1 hour, 5 days of Campath-1H at 20 mg/d in 250 ml of D5 normal saline or normal saline infused over 3 hours.
Patient Evaluation: Will occur 2-3 times per week by physical exam for toxicity through day 45.</description>
