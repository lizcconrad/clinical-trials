      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and tolerability of
      atomoxetine and OROS methylphenidate, taken together, in the treatment of ADHD in children
      and adolescents ages 6-17.

    <measure>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the ADHD rating scale. Change scores for the ADHD Rating Scale (RS), from baseline to endpoint (week 7 or last observation carried forward), were analyzed with paired t-tests and nonparametric Wilcoxon sign-rank tests. The best score is a score of 0 (no ADHD symptoms) and the worst score is the highest score possible (54).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions - Level of Severity (CGIs) for ADHD and Other Psychiatric Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary analyses allowed us to evaluate the effects of treatment on additional measures of functioning (CGIs for ADHD and other psychiatric disorders). The CGI-Severity scale is as follows: 0 = Not assessed, 1 = normal, not at all ill, 2 = Borderline mentally ill, 3 = Mildly ill, 4 = Moderately Ill, 5 = Markedly Ill, 6 = Severely Ill, 7 = Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>

    <description>Total treatment period is 7 weeks. Atomoxetine treatment will be initiated and maintained for 4 weeks. If the subject is a partial responder to atomoxetine treatment, OROS methylphenidate will then be added to his or her treatment regimen for the final 3 weeks of the study.</description>

    <description>Subjects must have at least attempted to tolerate a dose of 1.2 mg/kg of atomoxetine. If tolerated, they must remain on this dose for at least two weeks. OROS methylphenidate will be target dosed and titrated to a maximum dose of 54 mg.</description>

             baseline) will be included.

          -  In phase II, only subjects receiving ATMX that also have evidence of persistent
             symptoms of ADHD and impairment related to their ADHD (a CGI-Severity of &gt; minor
             impairment OR ADHD RS &gt;18; AND GAF score &lt;65) will have Concerta added to their

             homicidality will not be enrolled.

          -  Subjects with a recent history (e.g. three months) of a substance use disorder; or
             those with a positive urine for substances of abuse will not be enrolled. Subjects

            <description>Atomoxetine (ATMX) treatment will be initiated and maintained for 4 weeks. If the subject is a partial responder to atomoxetine treatment, OROS methylphenidate (OROS MPH) will then be added to his or her treatment regimen for the final 3 weeks of the study. If the subject is not a partial responder to ATMX, they will end their study participation before entering into the ATMX + OROS MPH phase. Subjects already on ATMX before entering the study can enter directly into the OROS MPH phase of the study. 15 out of 55 completed Phase I only and 10 entered directly into Phase II.</description>

          <title>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD RS)</title>
          <description>The primary outcome was the ADHD rating scale. Change scores for the ADHD Rating Scale (RS), from baseline to endpoint (week 7 or last observation carried forward), were analyzed with paired t-tests and nonparametric Wilcoxon sign-rank tests. The best score is a score of 0 (no ADHD symptoms) and the worst score is the highest score possible (54).</description>
          <population>All analyses were intent to treat, with last observation carried forward.</population>

        <description>Secondary analyses allowed us to evaluate the effects of treatment on additional measures of functioning (CGIs for ADHD and other psychiatric disorders). The CGI-Severity scale is as follows: 0 = Not assessed, 1 = normal, not at all ill, 2 = Borderline mentally ill, 3 = Mildly ill, 4 = Moderately Ill, 5 = Markedly Ill, 6 = Severely Ill, 7 = Among the most extremely ill patients.</description>
