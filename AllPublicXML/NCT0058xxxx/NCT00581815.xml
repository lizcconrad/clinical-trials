  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain chemical information from part of your body without a
      biopsy. This is done using a technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) which is
      similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) except that signals are detected from the
      chemicals (spectroscopy) naturally present in your body using radio waves. To receive this
      information from your body, small loops of wire (surface coils), placed near the tissue of
      interest, may be used to more effectively detect signals that come from the chemicals in your
      body. The investigators may use a second radio channel simultaneously, which will allow us to
      obtain greater chemical information (decoupling). The results may also help us to understand
      how this study can be used to help other patients with your condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use 1H spectroscopy or 1H decoupled 31P NMR spectroscopy to
      obtain biochemical information about tumor metabolism in patients, both before and after
      antineoplastic therapy. In healthy volunteers, normal tissue metabolism will also be studied.
      It is hypothesized that metabolic information may be of prognostic significance, or may be
      useful for timing of therapy.

    <description>The study will use a dual 1H-31P surface coil pair obtained from IGG Medical Advances, Milwaukee, WI. The coil pair consists of a fixed, 12 cm square 31P resonator co-mounted with a flexible two-loop proton coil. The P.I. and colleagues have used this device for approximately 10 years with no apparent ill effects</description>
