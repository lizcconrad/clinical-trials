      Objective: To determine the efficacy of surgical correction of intranasal mucosal contact
      points in improving quality of life and decreasing medication use in patients with rhinogenic
      headaches.

      Significance: Chronic, debilitating headaches that resist maximal medical treatment by
      various headache specialists are sometimes linked to structural anomalies within the nose
      that exert pressure on apposing mucosal surfaces. A number of otolaryngologists have reported
      success in alleviating rhinogenic headaches with contact point correction surgery. This
      practice is supported by anecdotal reports along with retrospective and observational
      studies; however, a prospective study with an appropriate surgical control group has not been
      conducted. Because the specific effect of contact point correction has not yet been
      differentiated from the placebo effect of surgery itself, many headache specialists are
      reluctant to recommend surgical evaluation for their patients. To demonstrate the efficacy of
      contact point correction surgery to both the headache and otolaryngology communities - and
      thus, to make this treatment option more widely available to rhinogenic headache sufferers -
      a randomized controlled trial is needed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic (&gt; 2 months) pain or pressure over nasal bridge, glabella, or forehead

             nasal airway obstruction)

          -  Failure of standard medical therapy for headache

          -  Symptomatic contact points as demonstrated by physical examination, sinus CT and nasal

          -  Contact points that remain after mucosal decongestion

          -  Absence of any other obvious cause of headaches after a thorough evaluation by a
