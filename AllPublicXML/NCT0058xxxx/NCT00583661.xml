    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether use of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric
      Ventricular Assist Device for bridge-to-transplant is associated with a reasonable assurance
      of safety and probable benefit such that the EXCOR® Pediatric merits approval by the Food and
      Drug Administration under a Humanitarian Device Exception (HDE).

      Berlin Heart Inc. is sponsoring a prospective, multi-center, single arm study to access the
      safety and probable benefit of the Berlin Heart EXCOR® Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device
      [EXCOR® Pediatric]. The study will compare the EXCOR® Pediatric with a historical control
      population supported with extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a bridge to cardiac
      transplantation in children.

    <measure>The Safety of EXCOR® Pediatric Was Evaluated by Summarizing the Serious Adverse Event Rate Experienced While the Subject Was Supported on the Device.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants were followed while on device support, an average of 58 days</time_frame>
    <description>The serious adverse event rate was calculated by totaling the number of serious adverse events all subjects experienced during device support (from implant to explant, an average of 58 days) divided by the total support time (in days) for all subjects. The serious adverse event rates were calculated separately for each primary study cohort.</description>
