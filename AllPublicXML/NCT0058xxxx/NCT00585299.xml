  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess whether reversal of fatty liver by moderate weight loss (8% of body weight) will
      lead to improvements in insulin sensitivity, which will be associated with changes in both
      glucose status and lipid profiles, in obese children and adolescents with fatty liver who
      have normal glucose or pre-diabetes.

      This study will have two groups: one group that eats a moderate calorie, low-fat diet and is
      weighed regularly (every other week for 16 weeks) and the other who receives traditional diet
      therapy and returns in 16 weeks. Both groups will undergo procedures that test glucose
      tolerance and measure liver and muscle fat content before and after study period.
