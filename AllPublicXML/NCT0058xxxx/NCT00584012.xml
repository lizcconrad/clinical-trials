      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of two medications, docetaxel and
      lovastatin. There are two phases. Subjects in Phase I can have any cancer. This phase will
      determine the highest dose of lovastatin and docetaxel that can be given safely as well as
      the safety of combining the two drugs and the effect on the subject's tumor. Phase II will
      administer lovastatin and docetaxel only to subjects who have breast cancer tumors.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      lovastatin and docetaxel in patients with various different cancers (phase I). Once the MTD
      for this drug combination has been determined, patients with breast cancer will be entered
      into a single cohort, the phase II portion of this study, and treated with the MTD doses of
      both lovastatin and docetaxel.

    <description>Docetaxel (60 mg/m2) will be given on day 0 every three weeks in Phase I with incrementally increasing doses of lovastatin. Lovastatin will be administered p.o. following a four times a day schedule, for four consecutive days (days -1 to +2) and repeated every three weeks. For purposes of this phase I/II study, intermittent drug administration, six dose levels, ranging from 2 to 24 mg/kg/day (2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 18, and 24 mg) will be used. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lovastatin has been determined, docetaxel will be escalated in a stepwise scheme from 60 to 80 to 100 mg/m2.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Performance Status (ECOG) &lt;2

          -  Peripheral Neuropathy &lt; grade I

          -  Signed Informed consent

          -  Hematologic-Inclusion Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl
             Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3.

          -  Hepatic-Inclusion Total Bilirubin must be within normal limits.

          -  Transaminases (SGOT and/or SGPT) may be up to 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
             normal (ULN) if alkaline phosphatase is &lt; ULN, or alkaline phosphatase may be up to 4
             x ULN if transaminases are &lt; ULN.

          -  Patients may have received prior chemotherapy including treatment with the following
             agents: anthracycline, platinum, vinorelbine, or other Vinca alkaloids. The patient
             must have recovered from the side effects of the prior treatment including prior
             drug-induced peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Patients who have received prior taxane therapy will be eligible. (However, patients
             who have progressed within 6 months of receiving docetaxel will be excluded.)

          -  A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed from the completion of any prior chemotherapy
             or radiation treatment.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving bisphosphonates for bone disease will be allowed
             to enter the trial, however their bone lesions will not be considered assessable for
             response, but will be assessable for progression.

          -  Initiation of bisphosphonate treatment during the trial will be discouraged but
             allowed in the absence of progressive disease. If bisphosphonates are initiated, then
             bone lesions will be assessed for progression only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other serious illnesses, which would limit survival to &lt;2 months, or a psychiatric
             condition, which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.

          -  ECOG Performance Status &gt;2

          -  Anticipated survival &lt; 2 months

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, or
             infection, which in the opinion of the treating physician would make this protocol
             treatment unreasonably hazardous for the patient.

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they
             have completed therapy and considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk
             of relapse within one year.

          -  Patients who have received any investigational agent within the prior 4 weeks.

          -  Age &lt; 18 as there is no safety data for lovastatin in this age range.

          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to TaxotereÂ® or other
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.

          -  Patients who have received anticancer endocrine therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             registration are not eligible.

          -  Patients currently on daily statin therapy will also be excluded.

          -  Patients who have progressed within 6 months of receiving docetaxel are not eligible.

          -  Treatment with the anti-emetic Aprepitant is not allowed.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving , or have received Herceptin therapy within 4
             weeks prior to registration are not eligible.

          -  Pregnant and/or Nursing. Patients must not be pregnant or nursing at the time of
             enrollment nor while under the treatment of this protocol. Treatment under this
             protocol would expose an unborn child to significant risks. Women and men of
             reproductive potential should agree to use an effective means of birth control.
