  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to compile information on the efficacy of the GliaSite RTS
      combined with radiosurgery in the treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic brain tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data relevant to the evaluation the effectiveness of the GliaSite RTS for a resected dominant
      brain metastases will be collected. The GliaSite RTS is a radionuclide applicator and liquid
      radionuclide (Iotrex) designed to deliver intracavitary radiation therapy for resected brain
      tumors. In this case, it will irradiate the resected margins. Brain metastases not surgically
      removed will be then treated with radiosurgery

    <description>GliaSite RTS is designed to deliver intracavitary radiation therapy for brain tumors. Following surgical resection, the balloon catheter is inflated to fill the cavity and Iotrex radiotherapy solution infused. It is a single applicator system that provides a uniform and conformal dose to the resection cavity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have 1-3 newly diagnosed supratentorial metastatic brain lesions with at least one
             being dominant and eligible for surgical resection as visualized on enhanced MRI scan

          -  Have histological evidence of metastatic carcinoma on intraoperative pathology (frozen
             section) or final pathology report

          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) &gt;=70

          -  Have systemic disease which is judged to be stable and has been staged within the last
             6 weeks

          -  Have a life expectancy of &gt;= 6 month, based upon extent of systemic disease

          -  Be at least 18 years of age Give informed consent (or have legal representative give
             informed consent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be receiving or have plans to receive conventional or investigational systemic agents
             for the metastatic brain tumor.

          -  Be receiving or have plans to receive external beam radiation therapy to the brain.

          -  Have received prior conventional or investigational systemic agents, including the use
             of Gliadel Wafers or Temodar, for the treatment of the brain metastasis.

          -  Be pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, evidence of uncontrolled
             cardiac dysrhythmia.

          -  Have other serious concurrent infection or other medical illness which would
             jeopardize the ability of the patient to safely undergo resection and brachytherapy.

          -  Have histology of lymphoma or small-cell lung cancer.
