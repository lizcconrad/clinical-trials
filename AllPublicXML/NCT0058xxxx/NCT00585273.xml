  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, second generation antipsychotics have been increasingly utilized. Since
      their introduction, however, atypical antipsychotics have been increasingly associated with
      significant metabolic complications including hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance/diabetes
      mellitus, and obesity. These metabolic complications increase the risk for cardiovascular
      disease in populations with an already elevated risk.

      The initial goal of the proposed study is to identify early signs of endothelial dysfunction
      and vascular disease in those treated with atypical antipsychotics. The identification of
      early signs of vascular disease may further link metabolic complications with any
      cardiovascular risk. Demonstration of changes in vascular function associated with atypical
      antipsychotics represents an important identifiable intermediate of more long-term
      cardiovascular risk.

      The second goal of the proposed study is to identify genetic factors that may be associated
      with the development of cardiovascular disease, which can later serve as a guide to predict
      risk. Accurate prediction of risk may facilitate the future development of an empirical,
      risk-based, individualized selection process for antipsychotic medications.

      Aim 1: To quantify the role of antipsychotic-induced metabolic complications on the
      development of vascular disease using measures of endothelial function.

      Hypothesis 1: Atypical antipsychotics will lead to greater impairments in endothelial
      function, evidenced by decreased flow-mediated dilation from baseline measures and compared
      with changes over time in controls. Medication-induced metabolic complications will be
      temporally associated with these impairments in endothelial function.

      Aim 2: To investigate the role of candidate pharmacogenetic polymorphisms with cardiovascular
      and metabolic complications of atypical antipsychotics.

      Hypothesis 2: Profiles of polymorphisms at receptors targeted by atypical antipsychotics will
      be associated with impaired cardiovascular function and metabolic complications.

        Thirty patients, 18 - 50 years of age, who are being started on a first-line,
        second-generation, antipsychotic associated with weight gain (risperidone, olanzapine, or
        quetiapine) for the treatment of an affective or psychotic disorder, will be invited to
        participate. Participants must not have taken any of these antipsychotics or clozapine in
        the preceding three months. Another twenty psychiatric controls not taking antipsychotic
        medications will also be enrolled. Statistically, controls will serve primarily to compare
        changes in flow-mediated dilation over time rather than for direct comparison of variables
        between groups. Participation will be voluntary and initiated upon clinician or
        self-referral.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-50 years of age

          -  Being started on a first-line, second-generation, antipsychotic associated with weight
             gain (risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine) for the treatment of an affective or
             psychotic disorder -OR- psychiatric controls not taking antipsychotic medications will
             also be enrolled

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include the presence of any of the following: neoplasm, active
             thyroid disease (i.e. not euthyroid), pregnancy or planned pregnancy, diabetes
             mellitus, Raynaud's disease, anticoagulant therapy, or inability to provide informed
             consent. We will exclude participants who have started valproic acid derivatives in
             the preceding 6 months, given its association with insulin resistance and weight gain.
             Participants with active substance abuse or dependence will also be excluded.
