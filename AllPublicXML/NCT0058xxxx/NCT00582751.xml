        90 patients from 3 different sections will be accrued (30 liver lesions, 30 lung lesions,
        30 lymph node lesions).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Registered and being treated on one of the following therapeutic protocols:

        06-043, 07-052, 07-057, 07-112, 07-116, 08-093, and 08-054

          -  Have at least one measurable lesion* as per RECIST criteria situated in lung, liver or
             lymph node meeting RECIST criteria noted on a baseline CT scan.

          -  Baseline** and at least one follow-up CT scan to likely to be obtained at an MSKCC
             facility

          -  All patients must be &gt; or = to 18 years old

               -  The measurable lesions are metastatic in the liver, lung and lymph nodes. The
                  algorithms do not distinguish between primary and metastatic disease, therefore,
                  in selected cases, a primary lesion such as in the liver or lung may also be
                  assessed.

                    -  Baseline CT are prefer but if not able to obtain for volumetric
                       reconstructions follow up studies will still be use for other objectives if
                       the study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women
