  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how well family therapy works if given while a family
      member is being treated for a serious illness and whether it helps their family to continue
      meeting for a time after their death. The therapy aims to assist the family communication and
      support during both palliative care and bereavement. The investigators also want to learn how
      many family therapy sessions spread out over time are best for helping patients and their
      families.

      Patients are randomly assigned to one of three groups: patients who receive standard
      palliative care, patients and their families who take part in 6 sessions, and patients and
      their families who take part in 10 sessions.

      This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) seeks to test the efficacy and dose responsiveness of
      a manualized family therapy intervention called Family Focused Grief Therapy (FFGT), which is
      delivered to families of patients with advanced disease and continued into bereavement.
      Randomization is to three arms: 6 sessions of FFGT, 10 sessions of FFGT, or standard care.
      The study also explores the potential mediators of effective outcome, empowering further
      refinement of the intervention, and undertakes an analysis of health-related costs of
      bereavement care. It is a multi-site study involving Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied
      Diseases (a comprehensive cancer center), Calvary Hospital (a dedicated palliative care
      hospital with home hospice care program)and Beth Israel (a medical center with a dedicated
      pain and palliative care department. Consenting families will be assessed at baseline through
      completion of questionnaires that appraise each individual's psychosocial well-being and
      perception of their family's functioning. Therapy will be delivered by family therapists
      (social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists), who will attend regular supervision
      sessions to sustain fidelity of the model of intervention. Follow-up of family members for
      psychosocial well-being, perceptions of family functioning, and costs of heath-related care
      will occur at 3, 6, 9, &amp; 13 months after the patient's death or completion of therapy
      sessions.

    <description>6 Sessions of Family Focused Group Therapy (FFGT). The FFGT intervention will have assessment, focused therapy, consolidation, and termination phases. The first two sessions are assessment sessions and occur one week apart. There will be two or six focused intervention sessions depending on the predetermined length of therapy. The first focused intervention session is approximately two weeks after the last assessment session. Subsequent focused intervention sessions are expected to follow once every month. Finally, there will be two consolidation/termination sessions, which will occur one time each, approximately two months apart. The six session program is expected to extend over a period of 6 months and the 10 session program over 10 months.</description>
