  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the fibrinogen metabolic changes in relation to coagulation disorder in patients
      with severe burns and trauma injuries. As a result of the burn or trauma injury breakdown of
      fibrinogen is accelerated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this protocol, we will investigate fibrinogen metabolism in burn and trauma patients,
      using an 8h infusion of stable isotopes labeled amino acids (1-13C-phenylalanine,
      2H5-phenylalanine, and 2H3-ketoisocaporate). The increase of the labeled amino acids
      incorporating into fibrinogen during the infusion and the decay of labeled fibrinogen after
      stopping the isotopes infusion (as measured by GC-MS) will be used to calculate fibrinogen
      synthesis and degradation. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive.
