      This research study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ablation
      (destruction) of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) using electrocautery heating guided by
      ultrasound. We are doing this to look for a less invasive method of treatment for patients
      with uterine fibroids. One method that is being used in other areas of the body to treat
      masses is radiofrequency electrocautery. This method may be performed for the treatment of
      uterine fibroids by placing a small diameter needle through the wall of the vagina into the
      fibroid guided by an ultrasound probe. An optional approach is to place the needle through
      the skin of the abdomen into the fibroid guided by an ultrasound probe. Once the needle is in
      the fibroid, the electrocautery current is applied and the fibroid is destroyed by heating.
      This would be done before hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). We are trying to test to see
      if this type of treatment can be applied to uterine fibroids. We are trying to develop
      radiofrequency electrocautery as one of the methods to treat fibroids without surgery.
