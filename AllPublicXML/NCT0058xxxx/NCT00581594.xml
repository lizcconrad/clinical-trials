  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who undergo posterior colporrhaphy with graft augmentation will have a lower recurrence
      of their posterior wall defect than women who undergo a traditional posterior colporrhaphy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional approach to surgical repair of posterior wall defect is the posterior
      colporrhaphy. Although this technique has been successful in the anatomic correction of the
      defect, the functional outcomes have been disappointing. This fact suggests improvement in
      the functional and anatomic outcomes following a traditional posterior colporrhaphy.
      Consequently, the idea of incorporating graft material into the repair to augment the
      patient's own tissue has been examined. Placing a piece of graft material in between the
      vagina and rectum adds an extra layer of support and thus augments the strength of the
      repair. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anatomic and functional outcomes of
      posterior compartment, graft-augmented traditional posterior colporrhaphy vs. traditional
      posterior colporrhaphy alone.

    <description>Patients will undergo randomized surgical procedure. Patients will be seen at 6 weeks for a pelvic exam and evaluation of the posterior wall. Points Ap and Bp will be recorded with values at 0.5cm intervals being on the posterior vaginal wall that is 3cm above the hymen. Point Bp is the most dependent portion of the posterior vaginal wall when the patient performs a Valsalva maneuver. Patients will be seen at 6 months for a pelvic exam evaluation of posterior wall support and completion of SF-36, PISQ and FISI. Patients will be given 60 minute Questionnaires on defecatory dysfunction, pelvic pain and/or symptoms of prolapse. Patients will be seen at 1 year and yearly intervals up to five years for a pelvic exam for evaluation of posterior wall support and the questionnaires.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo randomized surgical procedure. Patients will be seen at 2 weeks for routine post-op care and evaluation of any post-op complications. Patients will be seen at 6 weeks for a pelvic exam and evaluation of the posterior wall. Points Ap and Bp will be recorded with values at 0.5cm intervals being on the posterior vaginal wall that is 3cm above the hymen. Point Bp is the most dependent portion of the posterior vaginal wall when the patient performs a Valsalva maneuver. Patients will be seen at 6 months, for a pelvic exam evaluation of posterior wall support and completion of SF-36, PISQ and FISI. Patients will be given 60 minute Questionnaires on defecatory dysfunction, pelvic pain and/or symptoms of prolapse. Patients will be seen at 1 year and yearly intervals up to five years to have a pelvic exam for evaluation of posterior wall support and the questionnaires.</description>
