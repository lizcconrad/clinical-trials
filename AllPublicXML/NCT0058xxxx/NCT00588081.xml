    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out more about the experience women have with vaginal
      reconstruction. We hope to learn about their quality of life, sexual function, and body
      image. We would like to find out how happy women are with surgery. We also want to know what
      things should be changed or improved. Since you have had this surgery, we would like to ask
      you to take part in an interview.

      The purpose of this study, entitled immediate vaginal reconstruction following oncologic
      resection: Surgical outcomes, patient satisfaction and sexual function is to determine
      postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, quality of life and level of sexual
      functioning among patients who have undergone vaginal reconstruction following tumor
      resection and/or pelvic exenteration.This study will have three components: 1) a chart review
      to determine postoperative complications and anatomic characteristics of the neo-vagina, 2) a
      postoperative questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments to assess quality of
      life, body image and sexual function and 3) a postoperative qualitative interview to examine
      quality of life after vaginal reconstruction.
