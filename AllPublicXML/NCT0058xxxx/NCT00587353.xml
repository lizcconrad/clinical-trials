  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco prevention and intervention strategies in the general population are ongoing and
      evolving. However, strategies to help cancer patients overcome tobacco dependence have been
      limited. Radiation oncology patients who continue to smoke despite their cancer diagnosis
      have a lower quality of life (QOL), increased frequency and severity of side effects during
      their cancer treatment, higher risks of developing a smoking-related primary cancer, and may
      have a poorer survival rate than their non-smoking counterparts. These are all compelling
      reasons to be more pro-active in helping cancer patients stop smoking. The overall objective
      of this project is to adapt a model of an effective tobacco use intervention that can be
      delivered by any trained radiation oncologist and their staff.

    <description>A novel approach to providing an intervention for tobacco users who are receiving radiation therapy is to provide an individual tobacco use intervention that utilizes concepts of motivational interviewing strategies to facilitate self-exploration of the reasons for continued smoking and a treatment plan that is comprehensive and builds self-efficacy, provides one-on-one counseling, and includes tobacco treatment pharmacotherapies. The pharmacotherapies will be tailored to the patients needs. One could utilize varenicline, bupropion, and/or nicotine replacement therapies.</description>
