  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to develop a standardized technique for simultaneous capturing bi-planar
      images of patients against a standard background with a grid that can be used later for the
      quantitative determination of global balance and thoracic symmetry.

      We hypothesize that patients who are successfully managed with surgery will demonstrate an
      improvement in global balance and thoracic symmetry that can be accurately measured. This
      measurement station will be specifically developed to provide a standardized, reproducible
      means to compare clinical assessments of surgical and non-surgical outcomes, and establish
      normative data for comparison. This standardized tool can be established at multiple centers
      for use in multicenter trials.

    <description>We intend to photograph male and female subjects from age 1 through skeletal maturity. Healthy children will be photographed to determine the normative characteristics of thoracic function using this technique. We will also enroll patients with thoracic pathology to determine how digital imaging can document thoracic dysfunction. There are no specific disease related exclusion criteria. Participation is voluntary.</description>
