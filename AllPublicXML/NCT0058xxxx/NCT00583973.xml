  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral iron therapy is now commonly administered to dialysis patients with the majority
      of patients receiving this therapy as part of the treatment for their anemia. Although
      intravenous iron has improved clinical response to recombinant erythropoietin, there is a
      concern that iron therapy may have deleterious effects in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
      patients. Iron can damage tissues by catalyzing the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to
      free-radical ions that attack cellular proteins, DNA and membranes as part of oxidative
      stress. Numerous in vitro studies have shown tissue toxicity from iron and increased
      infectious potential. Oxidative stress can also lead to activation of the systemic
      inflammatory response with the release of a number of key cytokines and growth factors. There
      is now a link between inflammation, oxidative stress and acceleration of vascular disease in
      both patients with normal as well as reduced renal function. In a study comparing normal
      versus low hematocrit levels in hemodialysis patients, mortality was higher in the normal
      hematocrit group. The major difference between the two groups has been attributed to the fact
      that patients in the normal hematocrit group received significantly more iron than the
      patients with low hematocrit. There was a 2.4 fold greater mortality rate in patients
      receiving parenteral iron.

      The effect of parenteral iron administration on activation of the systemic inflammatory
      response in hemodialysis patients has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to
      measure a number of key cytokines, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in hemodialysis
      patients receiving iron repletion therapy as part of their standard care.

      Study Design

      Patients who have been prescribed iron repletion therapy (100 mg IV every dialysis treatment
      for ten treatments) by their primary nephrologist will be recruited for the study. Baseline
      blood samples will be obtained before and after each dialysis treatment for two dialysis
      treatments prior to the administration of iron. On the day of dialysis that iron therapy is
      started, blood samples will be obtained before and after the dialysis treatment via the
      patient's vascular access. This procedure will be repeated each dialysis treatment for the
      ten sessions during which the patient is receiving intravenous iron. Subsequently,
      pre-dialysis blood samples will be obtained every week for four weeks after the
      administration of intravenous iron has been completed
