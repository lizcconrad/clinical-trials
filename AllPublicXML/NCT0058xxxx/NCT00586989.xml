    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if a new endoscope will help doctors identify
      pre-cancer or early cancer lesions in patients who have Barrett's esophagus. This new
      endoscope allows the doctor to look at the lining of the esophagus in 3 different ways by
      modifying light.

    <textblock>
      Patients with Barrett's esophagus are advised to undergo periodic endoscopic surveillance
      with random biopsies in an attempt to identify high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early
      adenocarcinoma (ACA) at a time when intervention can be curative. This approach, however, can
      be time-consuming and is hindered by low sampling yield and random sampling error. Endoscopic
      Tri-Modal Imaging (ETMI) is a novel diagnostic modality that encompasses three advanced
      imaging features in one system: high-resolution endoscopy (HRE), autofluorescence imaging
      (AFI) and narrow-band imaging (NBI). HRE and AFI provide a bird's-eye view of 'red flag'
      areas which are then assessed by NBI for focused and more specific tissue characterization.
      The aim of this prospective, multi-center study is to compare the diagnostic performance of
      ETMI with that of standard white-light endoscopy (WLE) for identifying high-grade dysplasia
      (HGD) and early adenocarcinoma (ACA) in BE. A total of 84 BE patients will be recruited for
      the study and they will undergo both ETMI and WLE examinations in a randomized, crossover
      fashion. Standard surveillance biopsies and ETMI-targeted biopsies will be performed. The
      primary outcome will compare the number of patients and lesions with HGD or early ACA
      detected with WLE and ETMI. It is anticipated that ETMI will enhance the detection of
      high-grade Barrett's lesions relative to WLE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 18 years

          2. Prior diagnosis of BE, defined as the presence of columnar-lined epithelium in the
             distal tubular esophagus with specialised intestinal metaplasia on histological
             investigation

          3. Prior diagnosis of HGD or early ACA that was endoscopically inconspicuous according to
             the referring source

          4. A minimum Barrett's length of C&gt;2M&gt;2 or C&lt;2M&gt;4 according to the Prague C&amp;M
             classification for the endoscopic appearance of BE

          5. Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Description of a visibly suspicious lesion within the Barrett's segment according to
             the referring source

          2. Presence of a type 0-I or type 0-III lesion, or a lesion that, according to the
             discretion of the endoscopist, does not allow delay in intervention for a period of 6
             weeks (minimum interval between the two crossover endoscopies)

          3. Prior endoscopic therapy for Barrett's lesions, such as photodynamic therapy or
             endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)

          4. Presence of esophagitis &gt; Los Angeles grade A classification

          5. Presence of conditions precluding histological sampling of the esophagus (e.g.,
             esophageal varices, coagulation disorders, anticoagulant therapy)

          6. Pregnancy
