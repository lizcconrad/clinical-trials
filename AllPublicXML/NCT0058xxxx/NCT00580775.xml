    <textblock>
      As an ancillary study to the KEEPS study (see ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00154180),
      the primary purpose is to measure effects of estrogen vs. placebo in menopausal women, on
      autonomic function and repolarization; both measured non-invasively via holter monitoring.

      The parent study KEEPS, will be a randomized, placebo-controlled double blinded, prospective
      trial with two active groups and one placebo group. Only patients enrolled in KEEPS will be
      invited to participate in this ancillary study.Duration of the KEEPS study will be for 4
      years after randomization for each study subject, with assessment of the primary endpoint,
      carotid CIMT, twice at baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. Ancillary to the KEEPS study,
      patients will undergo holter monitoring at baseline, 24 and 48 months.Data will be analyzed
      after 24 and 48 months (corresponding to data analysis of the primary endpoints.) Holter
      monitors will be put on during the scheduled KEEPS visits, will be worn for 24 hours and will
      be returned the following day. Effects of estrogen on heart rate variability (HRV) and
      repolarization parameters will be evaluated, and also correlated with clinical, quality of
      life, sleep and mood information gathered through the parent study. Anticipated enrollment
      from the parent study at this site is 90 study subjects. This ancillary does not involve the
      use of drugs or investigational devices.
