    <textblock>
      While stem cell transplantation has proven an effective means of treating a wide variety of
      diseases involving hematopoietic stem cells and their progeny, a shortage of donors has
      proved a major impediment to the widest application of the approach. Until recently, only MHC
      identical donors could be used with safety. Such donors were originally siblings or other
      closely related family members. Over the past decade, the growth of allogeneic donor panels
      has allowed transplantation with stem cells obtained from a volunteer donor panel.

      While it is now possible to obtain HLA identical unrelated donor stem cells for approximately
      75% of individuals of Northern European backgrounds, the situation for most other ethnic
      groups is much less satisfactory. Even when a matched donor can be found, the elapsed time
      between commencing the search and collecting the stem cells usually exceeds three months, a
      delay that may doom many of the neediest patients. Hence there has been considerable interest
      in making use of HLA haploidentical family donors. Most individuals have a first-degree
      relative who would be suitable for such protocols. Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal
      recessive disorder characterized by the development of progressive aplastic anemia usually
      evident by about age seven years and often associated with various diverse congenital
      anomalies such as short stature, microcephaly, radial anomalies, horseshoe kidney, and cafe
      au lait spots.

      This study will determine the number of donor lymphocytes that can be given to recipients of
      haploidentical stem cell transplants with Fanconi anemia after depletion of
      recipient-reactive T lymphocytes by ex-vivo treatment with a fixed dose of RFT5-dgA
      immunotoxin, and will result in a rate of Grade III/IV GVHD of &lt; / = 25%.

      Patients will have received a haplo-identical stem cell transplant on our on-going study
      &quot;CD45 (YTH-24 and YTH-54) and CD52 (Campath 1H) Monoclonal Antibody Conditioning Regimen for
      Allogeneic Donor Stem Cell Transplantation of Patients with Fanconi Anemia&quot; (H-9938 IND#
      7233) and will become eligible to receive allodepleted T Cells following engraftment. What
      follows is a summary of the treatment plan including initial transplant phase as well as
      generation and infusion of allodepleted T cells.

      Preparative Regimen for Patients with Fanconi Anemia:

      The study will be open to patients who received a haploidentical PBSCT on the MAFIA protocol
      and for patients who failed to engraft and receive a second haploidentical transplants with
      alternate conditioning consisting of ATG, Fludarabine, TBI (450cGY single dose) and Cytoxan.

      In Outline MAFIA conditioning (primary conditioning regimen)

      Day 8 Campath 1H 10mg iv over 4hr Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 7 Campath 1H 10mg iv over 4hr
      Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 6 Campath 1H 10mg iv over 4hr Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 5 YTH 24/54 400ug/kg
      over 6 hr Fludarabine 30 mg/m2

        -  4 YTH 24/54 400ug/kg over 6 hr Fludarabine 30 mg/m2

        -  3 YTH 24/54 400ug/kg over 6 hr

        -  2 YTH 24/54 400ug/kg over 6 hr

        -  1 Rest

        -  0 CD34-selected PBSC infusion

      Stem Cell Infusion: One day after the completion of pretransplant conditioning therapy (day
      0), CD34+ cells will be infused through a central venous catheter as outlined in CAGT SOPs.

      This study will begin with a dose of T cells known not to cause GvHD even in haploidentical
      recipients, even when the T cells administered have not first been allodepleted. Dose
      escalation will follow a traditional up and down method, but as results become available they
      will be used to determine subsequent dose levels by the continual reassessment method.
      Initially, 2 patients will be entered beginning at dose level 1. Each and every patient will
      receive up to three additional injections of T cells at the same dose, at monthly intervals,
      provided there is no evidence of grade 2 or higher GVHD, until total T cell numbers are &gt;
      1000/ul.

      Dose level -1 (1 x 10^3 T cells/Kg); Dose level 1 (1 x 10^4 T cells/Kg); Dose level 2 (1 x
      10^5 T cells/Kg); Dose level 3 (1 x 10^6 T cells/Kg); Dose level 4 (5 x 10^6 T cells/Kg)
