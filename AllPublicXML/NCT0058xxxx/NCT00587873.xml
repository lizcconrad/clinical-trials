  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of complete and partial response
      and the duration of response in patients with recurrent or resistant Hodgkin's disease (HD)
      treated with sequential administration of oral 6-Thioguanin (6-TG) after IV Methotrexate
      (MTX).
