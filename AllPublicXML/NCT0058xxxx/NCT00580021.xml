      pancreatic cancer patients of Ashkenazi descent with or without germline founder mutations in
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 .

    <description>Samples for DNA extraction will be shaved from archival paraffin-embedded tissue blocks (using normal lymph node preferentially)and placed in appropriate receptacles labeled only with the subject unique study number. This material will be transported to the genotyping laboratory, where it will be stored until the clinical record abstraction is complete. Briefly, DNA will be extracted from the archive paraffin-embedded material using standard protocols and the samples will be analyzed for the presence of the Ashkenazi BRCA founder mutations using either PCR-based or gel-electrophoresis-based approaches.</description>

      Once potential subjects are identified, pathology records will be reviewed to establish which
      of the potential subjects have archived pathology material available at MSKCC. It is
      important to note that the material does not have to be tumor and, in fact, benign tissue,
      such as uninvolved lymph node, will be sought by preference. However, tumor tissue will be
      used if no benign tissue is available.
