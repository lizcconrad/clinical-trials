  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to utilize already obtained biopsy specimens for investigation
      of the utility of a new, non-invasive optical diagnostic technique. The study will allow a
      careful correlation between the Optical coherence tomography findings and conventional
      histology.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive diagnostic technique that can provide
      information about tissue abnormalities, change in structure of an organ. This technique uses
      a near-infrared diode to emit light that can produce images of the specimen under
      investigation without causing damage or alterations.
