      This study is being done to find out if breast cancer detection will be improved using a
      short MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, in addition to mammography, in patients who are
      at an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. High risk for the development of breast cancer. For the purposes of this study high
             risk women will be defined as those having one of the following:

               1. One or more first degree blood relative(s), maternal or paternal, with known
                  primary breast cancer, PLUS a Gail model calculated 5 year risk of greater than
                  or equal to 1.67%

               2. First, and/or second degree blood relative(s) with a family history suggestive of
                  a BRCA mutation (those families having a member(s) with primary breast cancer
                  diagnosed at or before the age of 40, primary breast cancer and ovarian cancer
                  within the same family or family member, male relative with primary breast
                  cancer, a relative with bilateral breast cancer, or multiple generations of
                  family members with primary breast and/or ovarian cancer)

               3. A known BRCA mutation

               4. A family member carrying a known BRCA mutation

               5. A personal history of a high risk breast lesion, including lobular carcinoma in
                  situ and atypical hyperplasia

               6. A personal history of primary breast cancer (invasive or in-situ) treated with
                  unilateral mastectomy

          2. Patients must have a mammogram performed within the last 6 months, and the mammography
             images must be available for review at the time of the MR interpretation.

          3. Age 25-75

          4. Female

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. They are unable to return in one year for follow-up exam

          2. Medical history includes:

               1. Previous breast cancer treated with breast conservation

               2. History of benign excisional biopsy in the previous 24 months

               3. History of a benign core needle biopsy or FNA in the previous 12 months

               4. History of metastatic cancer

          3. 45 minute prone scan cannot be tolerated

          4. Pregnant, as a mammogram for correlation with MR is required

          5. History of breast MR in the last 6 months
