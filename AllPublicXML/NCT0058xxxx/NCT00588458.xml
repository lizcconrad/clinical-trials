  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for this study is to see if a new radiologic technique called computerized
      tomographic cholangiography (CT cholangiography) could be helpful to demonstrate the bile
      ducts features and measure the amount of space of bile duct canals that should be filled with
      bile fluid. It may be useful to find out how well these findings correlate with the
      previously known clinical predictors in term of the clinical outcomes that will happen in the
      future for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prognostic models, which have been produced based on clinical, histological and biochemical
      feature, are useful in predicting survival and determining timing for liver transplantation.
      Preliminary feasibility studies in patients with PSC using high resolution CT with a contrast
      agent (CT cholangiography), has shown excellent depiction of bile ducts. CT cholangiography
      also has the potential to allow quantification of intraductal volume by using sophisticated
      computer programs. This assessment may be an important clinical feature to assess disease
      severity and progression.The information about cholangiographic features could be important
      for therapeutic decisions (e.g., in determining the usefulness of balloon dilatation or
      stenting for a dominant extrahepatic duct stricture), for counseling patients, and for
      therapeutic trials in stratifying patients and assessing efficacy of treatment.

    <description>Cholografin 20ml will be diluted in 100 ml of normal saline and infused over 30 minute time interval. Following the infusion of the cholografin, morphine (0.04 mg/kg) will be administered to contract the sphincter of Oddi and improve bile duct distension and visualization. Thirty minutes following the administration of morphine a test scan (CT cholangiography) will be performed through the liver to determine if there is adequate biliary excretion. The test scan will consist of 10 mm thick image obtained through the mid liver. If there is evidence of biliary excretion, high-resolution images will be performed through the liver and bile ducts. The axial images will be reconstructed into maximum intensity projection models and volume rendered models that can be viewed in 3-dimension.</description>

          -  Renal impairment as defined as known renal disease, a creatinine higher than 2.0 mg/dL
             or a diabetic patient with a creatinine higher than 1.5 mg/dL.

          -  Any known pre-existing medical condition that could interfere with the patient's
             participation in and completion of the study such as significant cardiovascular
             dysfunction or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring specific therapy.
