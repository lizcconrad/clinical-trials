      This study will address a true clinical problem by developing a risk/benefit analysis for
      rapid surgical weight loss in the ESRD population. The risks of surgical intervention, as
      well as, potential nutritional concerns, balanced with that of the potential medical benefits
      associated with significant weight loss.

      The study will be designed to compare two cohorts of patients that will undergo laparoscopic
      RYGB. Cohort 1 will include ESRD patients on HD who meet the NIH guidelines and preoperative
      requirements for RYGB. Cohort 2 will include non-ESRD patients who meet the NIH guidelines
      and preoperative requirements for RYGB. Laparoscopic RYGB will be performed in ESRD patients
      who meet the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health consensus statement
      . This includes patients who either have a BMI≥40 kg/m2 or have a BMI≥35 kg/m2 and have a
      significant morbidity attributed to their obesity (i.e. sleep apnea, hypertension, and
      diabetes mellitus). All patients will undergo a complete pre-operative evaluation inclusive
      of dietary instruction, assessment of surgical risk, psychosocial evaluation and compliance
      evaluation. This evaluation will be conducted through an existing infrastructure at the
      investigators Bariatric Surgery Center. Patients will be required to be on hemodialysis or
      able to be converted to hemodialysis for the perioperative period. All procedures will be
      performed by the same team of surgeons, experienced in both laparoscopic RYGB, organ
      transplantation and general surgery in ESRD patients. The risks involved with Roux-en-Y
      gastric bypass surgery will be discussed with the patient. These risks are inherent to the
      procedure, however the procedure is being conducted for medical appropriate reasons and
      therefore the benefits to the procedure outweigh the risks. At the present time, it is
      believed, without any justification, that this procedure is more risky or too risky in the
      ESRD population. A primary objective of this study is to investigate this question.
