      This was a multicenter, Phase 1, standard 3+3 dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety
      and anti-neoplastic activity of moxetumomab pasudotox in relapsed or refractory participants
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) or Small Lymphocytic
      Lymphoma (SLL).

      This was a multicenter, Phase 1, standard 3+3 dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety
      and anti-neoplastic activity of CAT-8015 in relapsed or refractory participants with CLL,
      PLL, or SLL. Participants in the initial dose cohort were to receive CAT-8015 at a dose of 5
      microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg) CAT-8015, increasing to 10 mcg/kg in the second dose cohort,
      and then increasing by 10 mcg/kg increments in subsequent cohorts (that is, to doses of 20,
      30, 40, 50, 60 mcg/kg, etc) until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was identified. Following
      identification of the MTD, the MTD cohort was to be expanded to 16 participants.

    <description>Participants tested for immunogenicity to moxetumomab pasudotox prior to enrollment, before each cycle and at end of study. The neutralization assay measures the capacity of participant's plasma (antibodies) to inhibit the binding of moxetumomab pasudotox to its target, cluster of differentiation 22 (CD22), coated onto enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. It was used as a direct surrogate for biological activity based on the mechanism of action of this drug. Significant level of neutralizing antibody activity defined as the capacity of test plasma to inhibit greater than (&gt;)50 percentage (%) of the binding of CAT-8015 to CD22 using an ELISA-based method.</description>

        <description>An abnormal laboratory finding which required an action or intervention by the investigator, or a finding judged by the investigator to represent a change beyond the range of normal physiologic fluctuation were reported as an adverse event.

Number of participants with grade 3 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events for laboratory abnormalities were reported as clinically relevant laboratory changes.</description>

        <description>Participants tested for immunogenicity to moxetumomab pasudotox prior to enrollment, before each cycle and at end of study. The neutralization assay measures the capacity of participant's plasma (antibodies) to inhibit the binding of moxetumomab pasudotox to its target, cluster of differentiation 22 (CD22), coated onto enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. It was used as a direct surrogate for biological activity based on the mechanism of action of this drug. Significant level of neutralizing antibody activity defined as the capacity of test plasma to inhibit greater than (&gt;)50 percentage (%) of the binding of CAT-8015 to CD22 using an ELISA-based method.</description>
