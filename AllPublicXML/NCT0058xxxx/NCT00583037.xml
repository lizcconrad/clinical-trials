    <textblock>
      Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a new mode of mechanical ventilation that is
      controlled by the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi). The EAdi is a signal that
      represents the patient's breathing effort, and hence with NAVA, the assist being delivered is
      synchronized and proportional to the demands of the patient. This is a prospective
      physiological study of the feasibility of NAVA ventilation over 24 hours. The aim is to
      demonstrate that NAVA can maintain spontaneous breathing and unload the respiratory muscles
      during both sleep and wake cycles over a 24 hour period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, studies using NAVA technology have been limited to short term evaluations (under 3
      hours). No serious adverse events have been observed in patients enrolled in our 3-hour study
      of NAVA in patients with acute lung injury. All 15 patients successfully tolerated the period
      of ventilation (i.e. there were no dropouts) with NAVA and the stability of the blood gas
      parameters over time reveals the efficiency of this new mode of ventilation in regards to
      oxygenation.

      A longer study may help to evaluate patient tolerance of NAVA and stability over time. A
      longer study will also demonstrate the feasibility of NAVA to adapt to changes in respiratory
      drive, changes in patient status, and the interventions of health care providers. A longer
      time frame should help us understand the parameters for titration of NAVA settings over time
      and establish some indications/limits for the future use of this promising technique. This
      intermediate study will generate the data necessary for the development of additional
      protocols to refine NAVA application and to compare NAVA to other assist modes.
