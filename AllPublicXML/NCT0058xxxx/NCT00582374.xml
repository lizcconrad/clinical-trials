      To determine the relationship between periodontal disease and upper genital tract
      inflammation in pregnancy. To determine whether certain fluid levels in the oral cavity and
      the vagina are associated with preterm birth or low-birth weight.

      Patients will be enrolled in the study at their first prenatal visit after the details of the
      study have been discussed. Potential subjects will be presented with a questionnaire to
      determine eligibility for the study. The patient will be scheduled for an exam between 18-24
      weeks at which time they will undergo a periodontal assessment, to determine the presence or
      absence of periodontal disease, a sampling of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and a vaginal
      swab collection. Periodontal disease will be determined by measuring the depth of gingival
      sulci, amount of periodontal attachment loss, and prevalence of gingival bleeding at six
      sites for each tooth present.
