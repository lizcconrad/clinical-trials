      The purpose of this pilot study is to see if taking anastrozole (Arimidex) for 10 days causes
      changes in breast cancer cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex) is a drug used in the treatment of a
      type of breast cancer that depends on estrogen to grow. This type of breast cancer is called
      estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Anastrozole (Arimidex) works by blocking an enzyme
      in your body called aromatase. Aromatase is found in your muscles, fat, liver and in breast
      tumors. This enzyme is important for making estrogen in women who are no longer having
      menstrual periods. Anastrozole decreases levels of estrogen in the body. We are interested in
      seeing if taking anastrozole for 10 days will cause changes in breast cancer cells. We will
      study cell processes such as how they make new blood vessels, how quickly the cells multiply,
      and how soon they die. We will also study which genes in the breast cancer tissues are turned
      on or off by taking anastrozole for 10 days.

      This is an exploratory study utilizing micro-array technology and immunohistochemistry to
      test the hypothesis that changes in gene expression occur as an early event in response to
      endocrine therapy and that these changes can be correlated with changes in surrogate
      biological markers.
