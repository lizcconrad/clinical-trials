      SUMMARY A prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial is proposed to compare three
      tibial tray designs for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. This study is designed
      to address the clinically important issues of tibial component modularity and fixation in
      total knee replacement. The Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee system is an FDA approved device and in
      this study will be used with 1) a modular tibial tray inserted with cement and 2) a
      non-modular tibial tray inserted with cement, and 3) a non-modular tibial tray inserted
      without cement. The insertion of total knee components without cement has been done
      clinically for over 20 years but has not been specifically approved by the FDA. Thus
      treatment arm 3, a non-modular tray inserted without cement, would involve the so-called
      off-label use of the device.

      136 cases will be assigned to each arm of the study. Each patient will be assessed two months
      after surgery, one year after surgery, two years after surgery, five years after surgery, and
      every three to five years thereafter. The principal outcome measures will be the Knee Society
      Clinical rating scale, the SF-36 and the presence of significant lucent lines.. These
      measures will be compared among patients in the 3 trial arms at 5 years post surgery (or at
      the last follow-up point for those who drop out or become lost to follow-up). The Knee
      Society scores and SF-36 scores will be analyzed using analysis of variance models Rates of
      significant lucencies, perioperative mortality, as well as complications such as deep vein
      thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, neurovascular complication, and infection will be compared
      among the groups using chi-square tests . Rates of revision surgery will be compared among
      the groups using survivorship methods.

      PURPOSE The primary aim of the study is to compare the results obtained with each of three
      tibial designs for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Those results will be
      measured with disease-specific (Knee Society Scores), global (SF-36), and outcome measures.
      Radiographic results consisting of standing alignment, lateral and skyline views of the
      surgical knee will be recorded and analyzed. Completion of the intial investigation will
      occur at the 5-year interval after the last enrolled patient.
