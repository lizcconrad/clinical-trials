      The guiding hypotheses are that (1) mechanisms in addition to diastolic dysfunction, while
      normal at rest, are compromised with stress, leading to symptoms of HF, and (2) that an
      increased proportion of the increase in LV diastolic pressures seen in HFpEF is mediated via
      exaggerated pericardial/right heart-LV coupling (restraint).

      Nearly half of all patients with heart failure have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)1-3.
      This group is increasing in prevalence, has similar morbidity and mortality to systolic HF,
      and, despite increasing awareness of the healthcare burden, is without proven treatments1.
      This is related largely to a limited understanding of the basic mechanisms causing the
      disease3. Recent studies have added to contemporary understanding, but the pathophysiology
      remains controversial and incompletely understood4-8. A limitation of most prior studies is
      that the noninvasive measurements employed are merely surrogates for gold standard, invasive
      hemodynamic assessment9. There is general consensus that HFpEF patients have increased left
      ventricular filling pressures (LVDP) and relatively normal systolic function at rest5,8,10,
      but two critical questions remain: what causes the increase in LVDP, and, are there important
      deficits in the cardiovascular response to exercise stress in HFpEF patients3,4? The current
      study will resolve these questions by performing comprehensive hemodynamic analysis in HFpEF
      patients referred to the cardiac cath lab, compared to age and gender matched controls
      without HF. LV systolic, diastolic, and vascular function will be examined at rest and during
      graded supine exercise at fixed and varied preload to definitively characterize both baseline
      differences and discrepancies in cardiovascular reserve function that only become apparent
      during stress, when HFpEF patients typically become symptomatic11. This study will yield
      valuable information describing the roles for systolic, diastolic and pericardial
      abnormalities in the pathogenesis of HFpEF, providing critical preliminary data upon which
      better targeted therapeutic trials of this common disorder can be based.

    <description>All pressure-volume data is acquired at 250 Hz and stored on the Leycom system for offline analysis. Volume data will be calibrated using the most recent EF from echocardiogram and stroke volume from the Fick method.
