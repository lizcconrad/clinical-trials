      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of iodine I 131monoclonal antibody
      BC8 when given together with fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, total-body irradiation,
      and donor bone marrow transplant, and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia that has spread to nearby or other
      places in the body (advanced), or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Giving chemotherapy
      drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation before
      a donor bone marrow transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells and helps
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, radiolabeled
      monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8, can find cancer cells
      and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy
      stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow
      make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving cyclophosphamide together with mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus after the
      transplant may stop this from happening. Giving a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody together
      with donor stem cell transplant, fludarabine phosphate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate
      mofetil, and tacrolimus may be an effective treatment for advanced acute myeloid leukemia,
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered via 131 I-BC8 antibody
      (iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8) when combined with pre- and post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine phosphate (FLU), 2 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI),
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and a haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic marrow
      transplant in patients who have advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL), or high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      II. To estimate rates of immune reconstitution, engraftment, and donor chimerism resulting
      from this combined preparative regimen.

      III. To determine rates of disease relapse, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and day
      100 disease-free survival in patients receiving 131 I-BC8 antibody (Ab) combined with CY,
      FLU, 2 Gy TBI, tacrolimus, MMF, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8.

      RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive therapeutic iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody BC8 via
      central line on day -14.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE CONDITIONING: Patients receive FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -6 to -2 and CY IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo TBI on day -1.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      POST-TRANSPLATATION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive CY IV over 1-2 hours on day 3, MMF IV
      or orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 4 to 35, and tacrolimus IV over 1-2 hours or PO on
      days 4 to 180 with taper on day 84.

      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months,
      and then annually thereafter.

             treatment in radiation isolation

          -  Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with disease refractory to intrathecal
             chemotherapy and/or standard cranial-spinal radiotherapy
