  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is not an independent research study, but rather a means to aggregate
      Children's Cancer Group protocols that are closed to patient entry for the purpose of
      collecting current status information on those patients treated under those protocols.

    <textblock>
      Children's Cancer Group clinical trials are conducted to improve understanding of the biology
      and treatment of childhood cancers. Protocols are developed by expert committees and
      distributed from the Group Operations Center to the member institutions. Before a protocol
      can be opened to patient accrual at a CCG institution, the protocol, consent form and any
      activation amendments are reviewed and approved by the local Institutional Review Board QRB).

      Protocols remain open to patient accrual until sufficient evaluable patients have been
      entered to answer the study questions. During this time, the protocol and any new amendments
      are reviewed annually by the IRB. When the study has been closed to patient accrual it
      remains open solely for the purpose of collecting life status and occurrence of adverse
      events. The IRB must continue its annual review as long as a patient treated on the protocol
      is alive and follow-up data are being collected. The CCG Long Term Follow-up protocol
      (CCG-LTF1) is meant to allow continued collective review of all protocols that meet the
      following criteria: (a) It is closed to patient accrual, (b) all patients have completed
      treatment, and (c) there are patients who are alive and being followed. The protocols that
      meet these criteria will be listed as being aggregated under CCG-LTF1 such that an IRB review
      of CCG-LTF1 will constitute a review of that protocol.
