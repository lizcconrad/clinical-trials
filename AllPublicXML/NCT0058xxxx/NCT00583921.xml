        Patients implanted with a new Guidant ICD/ CRT-D: Indication for CRT-D and ICD with history
        of atrial fibrillation. Patients with new implants will not be enrolled until their three
        month follow up visit in the pacemaker clinic.

        Patients currenlty implanted with a Guidant ICD/ CRT-D: More than 20% atrial fibrillation
        burden as recorded by defibrillator follow up report or with history of atrial
        fibrillation.
