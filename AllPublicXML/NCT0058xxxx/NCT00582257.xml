  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish a gastric cancer registry. A registry is a database
      of information. With the registry, we can learn more about the genetic causes of gastric
      cancer in order to develop better methods of early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of
      gastric cancers. As part of this study, you will be asked to join a registry of families who
      are affected with various forms of gastric cancer. These registries are important because
      they may help physicians better manage gastric cancer now and in the future. Participating in
      the Early Onset and Familial Gastric Cancer Registry can also be educational for families,
      since it will provide important information to patients, families, and physicians. All of
      this will help to further our understanding of genetic causes of gastric cancer and
      eventually, help determine better ways to diagnose, treat, and survey patients with gastric
      cancer and people who may have a higher risk for gastric cancer.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>High Genetic Risk:</arm_group_label>
    <description>Early Onset Gastric Cancer - diagnosis of gastric cancer before the age of 50 without a family history of the disease.
Familial Gastric Cancer - having a family history of gastric cancer as defined as one first degree relative or 2 second degree relatives.
Relative - Relatives of participants eligible for the High Genetic Risk Cohort will be eligible for participation. These relatives may also be at high risk of developing gastric cancer. These individuals will fall under the Cancer Cohort. Eligible relatives will be defined as someone having a relative who meets criteria for either the Early Onset Cancer Cohort or the Familial Gastric Cancer Cohort, or having a family history of a genetic mutation known to be associated with gastric cancer.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low Genetic Risk: Closed to Accrual</arm_group_label>
    <description>Sporadic Gastric Cancer - gastric cancer that appears to have occurred by random or sporadic mutation. Specifically, a patient with gastric cancer not eligible for either High Genetic Risk cohort.
Control (closed to accrual) - A participant that is not a blood relative of a patient or relative participant, without gastric cancer and without a family history of a CDH1 gene mutation. Select MSK participants with Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer with identified CDH1 germline genetic mutation will be invited by MSKCC only to complete the onetime Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis (HDGC PGD) survey. These patients may be verbally consented over the telephone.</description>

    <description>Participation in the registry will consist of adequately completing the family history questionnaire (one per family) the gastric cancer risk factor questionnaire and providing a blood sample for future correlative studies. Registry participants (both Patient/Relative and Control cohorts) will be required to submit tissue (both normal and/or tumor) to create a Tissue and DNA repository. Select participants will be invited to undergo Genetic Counseling, eg. those participants who meet clinical criteria for HDGC.</description>

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,
        the protocol investigator, or research team at MSK or collaborating centers. If the
        investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their patient's medical
        records for suitable research study participation and discuss the study and their potential
        for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by their treating
        physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient/Relative Cohort:

        Must meet one or more criteria below:

          1. A person with a diagnosis of gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
             confirmed at the treating institution.

          2. A person without gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who has or had a first degree relative
             eligible for a High Risk Genetic sub-group (EOGC/FGC).

               1. Early Onset Gastric Cancer - diagnosis of gastric cancer before the age of 50
                  without a family history of the disease.

               2. Familial Gastric Cancer - having a family history of gastric cancer as defined as
                  one first degree relative or 2 second degree relatives.

          3. A person without gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who has a personal family history of a
             genetic mutation associated with the development of gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma
             (i.e. family history of CDH1 mutation).

        II. Must be willing to provide a blood sample for germline DNA. These individuals will sign
        the &quot;Patient/Relative Consent&quot;. Following enrollment, we will assign individuals to the
        appropriate High Genetic Risk or Low Genetic Risk groups based on the age of diagnosis and
        their family history.

        Subject Exclusion Criteria

        Patients are ineligible for the study if they:

          -  Have any condition, which in the opinion of the primary MSK clinician or investigators
             precludes their ability to provide informed consent.

          -  Relatives of patients that are not eligible for the High Genetic Risk Cohorts who are
             less than 18 years of age are excluded.

          -  Relatives of patients eligible for the High Genetic Risk Cohorts who do not have a
             proband available to join the study are excluded. (Unless there is a known CDH1
             mutation in the family).
