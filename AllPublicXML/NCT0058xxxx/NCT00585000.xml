    <textblock>
      This will show if CP-675,206 can be administered safely as an intravenous infusion lasting
      one hour. CP 675,206 already has been administered to 835 subjects over 1.0 - 7.5 hours.

      This study was prematurely discontinued on April 28, 2008 because a concomitant Phase 3 study
      met pre-specified futility criteria. The decision to close enrollment early was not based on
      any safety concerns.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed melanoma that is surgically incurable Note: Prior therapies
             for melanoma, including cancer vaccines, are permitted but are not required. There is
             no limit to the number of prior regimens for melanoma a patient may have received.

          -  Evidence of at least one lesion

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

          -  CT scan of the brain with contrast or MRI of the brain within 6 weeks prior to
             enrollment showing no evidence of active brain metastases. PET scans and PET/CT scans
             are also acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with other anti CTLA4 agents (eg, ipilimumab, MDX 010).

          -  Previously randomized to Pfizer study A3671009: A Phase 3, Open Label, Randomized
             Comparative Study of CP 675,206 and Either Dacarbazine or Temozolomide in Patients
             with Advanced Melanoma.

          -  History of chronic autoimmune disease (eg, Addison's disease, multiple sclerosis,
             Graves disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             lupus erythematosus, hypophysitis, etc.).

          -  History of inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis),
             celiac disease, or other chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea,
             or current acute colitis of any origin, and any history of diverticulitis (even a
             single episode) or evidence of diverticulitis at baseline, including evidence limited
             to CT scan only.

          -  Brain metastases that have not been adequately treated with surgery or stereotactic
             radiosurgery and have not been stable at least 3 months prior to enrollment.
