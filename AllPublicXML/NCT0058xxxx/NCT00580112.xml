  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of trabectedin in 3
      subpopulations of participants with previously treated progressive metastatic ( spread of a
      cancer from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ or part) breast cancer (abnormal
      tissue that grows and spreads in the body until it kills) participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (study
      following participants forward in time), multi-center (when more than 1 hospital or medical
      school team work on a medical research study) study evaluating the effectiveness and safety
      of trabectedin in 3 subpopulations of breast cancer participants: Group A: triple negative
      profile for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human estrogen receptor, Group B:
      human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 overexpressing tumors (HER-2+) and Group C: familial
      breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) mutation carrier. Participants
      will receive trabectedin 1.3 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenous infusion (a
      fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) over 3-hour every 3 weeks, on
      Day 1 of each cycle. Each cycle length will be 3 weeks. Treatment will be continued until
      disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, participant refusal or treatment delay no longer
      than 3 weeks due to toxicity. Efficacy will be primarily evaluated by percentage of
      participants with confirmed objective response by independent external review and
      Investigators assessment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Percentage of participants with confirmed objective response will be based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is those with at least 30 percent decrease in the sum of longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference baseline sum longest dimensions. IER will be done to re-examine all Investigator assessed outcomes.</description>

    <description>Duration of Response is considered as time in months from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Duration of tumor response was calculated as: (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that will be subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.44. DR will be calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response. IER will be done to re-examine all Investigator assessed outcomes and to provide an independent assessment of response and progression date.</description>
