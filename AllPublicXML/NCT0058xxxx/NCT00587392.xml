  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to gather long-term follow-up data on patients treated with the
      Plicator in a previous open-label multi-center study. Originally, 64 subjects were treated at
      seven U.S. sites. A subset of those patients were subsequently reassessed via symptom
      questionnaires in this long-term (60-month) follow-up analysis. The initial open-label study
      was completed and officially closed at the completion of 1-year follow-up. This current study
      was designed to collect long-term follow-up data on previously plicated subjects all of whom
      were recruited de novo from the original study population. Study endpoints were prospectively
      defined. The primary study objectives were to assess: reduction in GERD symptoms through
      analysis of the GERD Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) questionnaire and the
      Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS); reduction in use of GERD medications, and
      change in overall physical and psychological health as measured by the Short Form Health
      Survey (SF-36).
