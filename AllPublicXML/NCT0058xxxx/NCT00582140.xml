  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to find new methods to treat prostate cancer. The approach they
      investigators are taking is to try to enhance patients own immune response against the
      cancer. In this study the investigators will be testing the safety of a vaccine that may be
      able to help the body fight prostate cancer.

      The purpose of this research is to determine the safety of serial intradermal vaccinations of
      a DNA vaccine encoding human PAP, with GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant, in subjects with stage
      D0 prostate cancer. In addition, to determine whether PAP-specific IFNУ-secreting CD8+ T
      cells can be augmented in subjects with stage D0 prostate cancer by means of immunization
      with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding PAP.

      This is a phase I design where patients will receive the vaccine pTVG-HP with rhGM-CSF
      administered i.d. biweekly for 6 total doses. There will be three escalating dose cohorts.
      The dosing cohort considered to be the maximum tolerated dose level will be expanded up to a
      total of 16 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Must have completed local therapy by surgery and/or ablative radiation therapy at
             least 2 months prior to entry.

          -  Must have clinical stage D0 disease defined by the following: In patients treated by
             surgery, serum PSA values must be &gt; 2 ng/ml by two measurements at least two weeks
             apart. In patients treated with ablative radiation therapy, three consecutive
             increases in serum PSA must be documented, with at least a one month interval between
             values with the finalPSA &gt; 2ng/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No evidence of immunosuppression or have been treated with immunosuppressive therapy,
             such as chemotherapy, chronic treatment dose corticosteroids (greater than the
             equivalent of 10 mg prednisone per day), or radiation therapy to &gt;30% of the bone
             marrow, within 6 months of the first vaccination.
