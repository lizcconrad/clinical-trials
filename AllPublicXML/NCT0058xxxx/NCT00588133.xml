    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid is administered intravenously to prevent bleeding associated with cardiac
      surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. We have developed an assay for tranexamic acid. We have
      developed an alternative dosing schedule for tranexamic acid. The objective of this
      preliminary study is to determine if this new dosing schedule can achieve the desired plasma
      concentration of tranexamic acid and reduce intra and inter patient variability in tranexamic
      acid plasma concentrations relative to the current dosing schedule.

      Tranexamic acid is administered intravenously to prevent bleeding associated with cardiac
      surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. The current dosing regimen for tranexamic acid was
      empirically derived based upon pharmacokinetics in normal patients receiving the drug. We
      have developed an assay for tranexamic acid and found that the plasma concentration of
      tranexamic acid varies greatly between patients and also over time within each patient,
      especially in patients with renal insufficiency. We have developed an alternative dosing
      schedule for tranexamic acid that incorporates the effects of renal function on tranexamic
      acid concentrations. The objective of this preliminary study is to determine if this new
      dosing schedule can achieve the desired plasma concentration of tranexamic acid and reduce
      intra and inter patient variability in tranexamic acid plasma concentrations relative to the
      current dosing schedule. The results of this study will be used in a larger subsequent study
      of what level of plasma tranexamic acid concentration is needed to prevent bleeding and
      transfusion of blood products in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years old.
