  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic response to ulcerative colitis, including increased proteolysis and lipolysis
      and changes in energy expenditure, plays a significant role in the resulting malnutrition
      from which these patients suffer. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a pro-inflammatory
      cytokine, has been found to be elevated in children with ulcerative colitis. TNF-alpha has
      been incriminated in the mechanism of weight loss in many different chronic diseases, and
      causes net protein and lipid catabolism. Anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab) has been proven
      to be an effective therapy for ulcerative colitis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine changes in protein and lipid metabolism, as well as
      resting energy expenditure, before and after therapy with anti-TNF-alpha antibody
      (infliximab) in children with ulcerative colitis. Performing this study will better define
      the changes in nutrition status observed in these children following remission of active
      ulcerative colitis, and potentially lead to changes in medical and nutritional management of
      these children
