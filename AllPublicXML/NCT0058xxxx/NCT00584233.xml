  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have studied the potential of breast computed tomography (bCT) for breast
      imaging under an NIH-funded Biomedical Research Partnership (BRP) grant (R01 EB002138-10),
      and 4 breast CT scanners have been developed that have imaged over 600 women to date (under
      more than one IRB-approved protocol). The BRP grant cannot be renewed, and with this
      (resubmitted) R01 grant application, the investigators seek to finalize the investigators'
      research in breast CT - The specific aims have been significantly modified as a result of the
      first critique, and the investigators now focus on a narrower set of remaining issues.

      This version of the protocol will add breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the
      experimental procedures.

      Clinical evaluation: Four hundred women who will be having breast biopsy as part of their
      standard care (BIRADS 4 and 5) will be recruited to undergo additional imaging prior to
      biopsy, including (research) pre-and post-contrast enhanced breast CT imaging of both
      breasts, as well as (standard, FDA approved) contrast enhanced breast MRI. The potential of
      non-contrast enhanced breast CT will be compared using receiver operating characteristic
      (ROC) methodology against mammography alone, as well as with mammography + tomosynthesis. The
      breast CT images (including both pre-and post-contrast images) will be compared using ROC
      methodology against standard-of-care contrast-enhanced MRI (which includes both non-contrast
      and contrast images). The results of the clinical trials proposed in this investigation
      should provide strong evidence in regards to the potential of breast CT for breast cancer
      screening in the normal risk and high risk populations.
