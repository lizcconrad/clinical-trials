      The purpose of this prospective study is to measure the clinical effectiveness of EUS-guided
      CB in subjects, 50 who have chronic pancreatitis and 50 who have pancreatic cancer, that are
      already undergoing celiac block for clinical reasons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic abdominal pain from documented chronic pancreatitis or
             pancreatic cancer or other visceral malignancy that are undergoing EUS-guided CB (for
             purposes other than this study) will be eligible to participate in this study.

          -  Patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer must have documented disease
             by CT, ERCP, or EUS.

          -  No evidence of dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the giving and
             understanding of informed consent, and no evidence of psychiatric risk that would
             preclude adequate compliance with this protocol.

          -  Patient must provide signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have had a previous celiac plexus block are eligible for this study
