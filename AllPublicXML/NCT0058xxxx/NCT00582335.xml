      Colorectal cancer is one of the most significant causes of cancer morbidity and mortality in
      the United States. In 1997, approximately 130,000 men and woman were diagnosed with
      colorectal cancer (fourth most common cancer site) and approximately 55,000 died of this
      disease (second most common cause of cancer deaths); (Cancer Facts &amp; Figures, 1997).

      Genetic factors clearly contribute to the etiology of colorectal cancer. Because there is
      evidence to suggest genetically determined susceptibility to colorectal cancer exists in a
      proportion of newly diagnosed cases each year, we are conducting a study to identify new
      genes that are associated with an increased susceptibility to familial colorectal cancer by
      analysis of families with a clustering of colorectal cancers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or greater

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Any family in which a minimum of two first-degree relatives either are, or have
             previously been, affected with primary colorectalcancer. These &quot;minimum inclusion
             criteria&quot; must be met within three generations of the proband or kindreds in which
             colorectal cancer and lymphoma or renal cell cancer are present or in kindreds in
             which lymphoma alone or lymphoma and renal cell cancer are present

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years

          -  Family not at increased risk for familial colorectal cancer (see Section 4.1)

          -  Family with a hereditary polyposis syndrome (e.g. classic FAP)
