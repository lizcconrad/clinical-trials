  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how people with a family history of colon cancer and
      other related cancers respond to recommendations for cancer screening after genetic
      counseling. The purpose of your participation would be to help us learn more about whether
      people with a personal and/or family history of colorectal cancer and other cancers follow
      cancer screening recommendations.
