  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common digestive disorder. After excluding dietary factors, drugs and other
      secondary causes, at least three broad pathophysiologic subtypes are recognized- dyssynergic
      defecation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C) and slow transit
      constipation (STC), all predominantly affect women and elderly. Many patients also
      demonstrate abnormal rectal perception with both rectal hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity
      being common. Recent surveys show that most constipated patients are dissatisfied with
      current therapy. Also, constipated patients showed significant psychological dysfunction and
      impaired quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To investigate a novel biofeedback technique of
      improving rectal hypersensitivity.

      METHODS: A large compliant balloon attached to a barostat was placed in the rectum in 8
      patients with rectal hypersensitivity (urgency/pain threshold &lt;30 mm Hg). Sensory
      deconditioning was performed by incremental balloon distensions (1-2 mmHg) until normal
      thresholds were reached.

    <description>This study will last for approximately 3 months and will include 4-6 clinic visits with each visit lasting 2 hours every week or every 2 weeks. At the beginning of each visit we will ask you about your health status and level of satisfaction of your bowel habits. We will then place the pencil-thick probe and balloon inside your rectum and attach it to the barostat device and a computer. We will increase and decrease the volumes of the balloon until the most pressure you can tolerate or a certain level of pressure as measured by the machine is reached, whichever occurs first. You will continue to keep stool diaries and pain diaries for 7 days before and after each visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients must fulfill the diagnostic criteria for IBS-C (Rome III) as defined below and
        have rectal hypersensitivity (see below).

          -  Patients must report recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per
             month in the last 3 months with two or more of the following symptoms:

               -  Improvement with defecation; and/or

               -  Onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; and/or

               -  Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool

          -  No structural diseases

          -  On a diary:

               -  Pain/discomfort for at least 2 days/week;

               -  No loose or watery stool &lt;25% of bowel movements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with mixed-IBS.

          -  Patients currently on SSRI or MAO inhibitors. Patients on stable doses of other
             antidepressants will be included provided the dose is unchanged during study.

          -  Patients taking drugs that are constipating, (e.g.; calcium channel antagonists will
             either be excluded or drug discontinued)

          -  Patients with co-morbid illnesses; severe cardiac disease, chronic renal failure or
             previous gastrointestinal surgery except cholecystectomy and appendectomy.

             cord injuries.

          -  Impaired cognizance (mini mental score of &lt; 15) and/or legally blind.

          -  Pregnant or likely to conceive during the course of the study. Women with potential
             for pregnancy must be willing to use contraceptive measures during the study. Urinary
             pregnancy tests will be performed on such women prior to any radiologic procedures.

          -  Hirschsprung's disease.
