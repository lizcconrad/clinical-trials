      The purpose of this study is to examine risk factors for relapse of bipolar disorder during
      pregnancy and the postpartum period. The main goal of this study is to find the risks that
      may make it more likely for a woman with bipolar disorder to experience a depressive, manic,
      or hypomanic episode during her pregnancy and the postpartum period.
