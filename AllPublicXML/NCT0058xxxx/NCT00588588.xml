  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reported incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is 10 to 15 per 1,000
      ventilator days. VAP leads to an excess cost exceeding $40,000 per patient and is associated
      with a crude mortality rate as high as 76%. The clinical criteria for the diagnosis of VAP
      have low specificity and may lead to unnecessary antibiotic use. The Clinical Pulmonary
      Infection Score (CPIS) and bronchoscopic approaches lower unnecessary antimicrobial use,
      antimicrobial resistance, and superinfection compared to the traditional clinical criteria.

      Based on the available evidence and local microbiology data, we have developed a VAP
      management protocol guided by CPIS or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in adults with suspected
      VAP. These two approaches have not been compared against each other. Although the diagnostic
      studies in the CPIS guided approach are inexpensive and easily available, BAL has the
      potential to minimize the unnecessary use of antibiotics and reduce the development of drug
      resistant pathogens.

      In this study, we propose to test the hypothesis that BAL leads to a reduction in antibiotic
      use compared to CPIS in patients with suspected VAP. The study design will be a randomized,
      clinical trial comparing CPIS versus BAL. The primary outcome measure will be antibiotic
      utilization. The secondary outcome measures will be mortality, morbidity, development of
      resistant pathogens and superinfection and infection related financial burden.

      Completion of this trial will help us identify the best approach to avoid unnecessary
      antibiotic utilization and minimize the development of resistant pathogens (with their
      associated morbidity and mortality) in critically ill patients.
