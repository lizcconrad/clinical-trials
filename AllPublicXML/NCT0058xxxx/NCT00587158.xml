      This study is being done to find out whether patients who receive a kidney transplant can
      benefit from taking the medication paricalcitol (trade name Zemplar®) as compared to kidney
      transplant recipients not taking this medication. The main possible benefits being studied
      are:

        -  Lower risk for overactive parathyroid glands after kidney transplantation.

        -  Lower risk of low bone density in the spine and hip after kidney transplantation. By
           dividing patients in the study into a group receiving Zemplar® and a group not receiving
           Zemplar®, it will be possible to understand the good and bad effects of Zemplar® during
           the first year after a kidney transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most significant challenge in kidney transplantation at present is that of reducing the
      risk of long-term complications. This includes hyperparathyroidism, a common post kidney
      transplant complication that contributes to loss of bone density and fracture risk and
      necessitates surgical intervention in approximately 5% of kidney transplant patients.

      In order to take part in the study you will already have been accepted for kidney
      transplantation from a living donor or from a deceased donor at Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
      Minnesota. After you have agreed to take part in the study you will be put in one of two
      groups by chance (as in the flip of a coin):

      Group 1 (Standard Treatment or &quot;Control&quot;): Patients in this group will receive a combination
      of four anti-rejection medications that have been used at Mayo Clinic Rochester for many
      kidney transplant patients and does not include any research study medicines. These
      medications will include:

        1. Alemtuzumab (Campath®) - this medicine will be given intravenously (IV) on the day of
           the transplant during surgery.

        2. Methylprednisolone (Solumedrol®) - this medicine, which is part of a family of medicines
           often referred to as corticosteroids, will be given intravenously on the day of the
           transplant during surgery. This will be the only planned dose of corticosteroid medicine
           you will receive although this medicine and a tablet form called Prednisone may be given
           at a later time if you have an episode of transplant rejection.

        3. Mycophenolate Mofetil (Cellcept®) - this medicine will be given by mouth twice daily
           beginning the evening before the transplant (for living donor transplants) or the day of
           the transplant (for deceased donor transplants). It will be continued for as long as you
           have your transplant unless there is a medical reason to stop it.

        4. Tacrolimus (Prograf®) - this medicine will be given by mouth once daily beginning on the
           fourth day after the transplant. It will continue for as long as you have your
           transplant unless there is a medical reason to stop it. The dose will be adjusted based
           on a blood test that will be done between twice a week and once a month for as long as
           you take the medicine.

      Group 2 (Zemplar® + Standard Treatment): Patients in this group will receive the same
      combination of anti-rejection medications as the patients in Group 1 (a-d above) plus
      Zemplar®, which is the medicine being studied, will also be started on the day of the
      transplant. Zemplar® will be given as a capsule containing 1 microgram of Zemplar® once daily
      beginning the day after the transplant. It will be continued at the same dose for the first
      two weeks then, depending on the results of blood and urine testing, will be increased to 2
      micrograms daily. The dose will remain at 2 micrograms daily until the end of the study
      unless there is a medical reason to reduce or stop it or unless the study is stopped early.

      Both groups of patients will be treated by the same team of doctors, nurses and nurse
      coordinators that care for all kidney transplant patients at Mayo Clinic. The procedures and
      treatments for your transplant will be the same as those recommended at Mayo Clinic for all
      patients receiving a kidney transplant. These include the surgical operation to carry out the
      transplant; the need to take anti-rejection medicines by mouth for the rest of your life; the
      need to have blood and urine testing at regular intervals for the rest of your life to
      monitor the progress of your transplant; and the recommendation to have a biopsy of your
      transplant carried out on three occasion during the first two years after the transplant
      surgery. These procedures and their potential complications will be described to you in
      detail by your transplant physician, transplant surgeon, and transplant coordinator. The
      study will not require extra hospital or outpatient visits compared to the usual care for all
      kidney transplant patients at Mayo Clinic Rochester.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Hyperparathyroidism at One Year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a measure of how well the parathyroid gland is working and is measured by a blood test. Hyperparathyroidism (increased PTH) is defined as PTH blood value greater than 65 picograms/milliliter in the absence of hypocalcemia (low calcium) or if the subject had a parathyroidectomy (surgical removal of parathyroid glands) during the first year post-transplant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Osteopenia/Osteoporosis of the Hip at One Year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Osteopenia/Osteoporosis are conditions where bone mineral density is lower than normal, reported by T-scores, measurements of the hip made using an Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The T-score is measured and compared to a normal healthy adult. A normal bone density results in a T-score between +1.0 and -1.0. A T-score of less than or equal to -1.5 was used for this study to define the presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Each participant will be categorized as having or not having osteopenia/osteoporosis of the hip at the end of the first post-transplant year based on bone mineral density results.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Osteopenia/Osteoporosis of the Lumbar Spine at One Year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Osteopenia/Osteoporosis are conditions where bone mineral density is lower than normal, reported by T-scores, measurements of the lower spine made using an Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The T-score is measured and compared to a normal healthy adult. A normal bone density results in a T-score between +1.0 and -1.0. A T-score of less than or equal to -1.5 was used for this study to define the presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Each participant will be categorized as having or not having osteopenia/osteoporosis of the lumbar spine at the end of the first post-transplant year based on bone mineral density results.</description>

    <measure>Serum Bone Alkaline Phosphatase (BAP) Level Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 21 days, 90 days and 1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>BAP is a marker of bone turn-over, is measured in the serum and reported in micrograms per liter (mcg/L).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>BMD was measured using a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and reported by T-scores, measurements of the lower spine made using the scan. The T-score reflects how your bone density measurement compares to normal healthy adults. A normal bone density results in a T-score between +1.0 and -1.0. A T-score of less than or equal to -1.5 was used for this study to define the presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Osteopenia is a condition of decreased bone mass or density but not thin enough to be diagnosed as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition where bone mass/density has diminished to a level causing higher risk of fracture. The average change in T-score from baseline to one year is reported.</description>

    <measure>24-hour Total Protein in the Urine at 1 Year Post Transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>A urine total protein test is conducted to detect excess protein in the urine. This test helps determine an individual's kidney functioning. Protein is not usually present in urine; therefore, presence of protein in the urine is a sign of abnormality. The quantity of protein in a sample of urine collected over 24-hour was measured and reported in milligrams per day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of Interstitial Fibrosis on Graft Biopsy at One Year</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post kidney transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Interstitial fibrosis refers to degree of scarring or fibrous tissue formed in the kidney. Renal pathologists reviewed biopsies of the subject's kidney grafts for fibrosis, with results expressed using the Banff schema; Quantitative criteria: ci0 = fibrosis observed in up to 5% of cortical area, ci1 = fibrosis in 6%-25% of cortical area (mild) , ci2 = fibrosis in 26%-50% of cortical area (moderate), ci3 = fibrosis in greater than 50% of cortical area (severe). The degree of interstital fibrosis for this study was defined and reported as follows: a Banff ci score of greater than 0 and less than 2 considered &quot;mild&quot; fibrosis and a ci score greater than or equal to 2 as &quot;moderate to severe&quot; fibrosis.</description>

          <title>Degree of interstitial fibrosis</title>
          <description>Interstitial fibrosis refers to degree of scarring or fibrous tissue formed in the kidney. Renal pathologists reviewed biopsies of the subject's kidney grafts for fibrosis, with results expressed according to the Banff schema. The degree of fibrosis was reported using Banff scores (ci) as &quot;mild&quot; (ci greater than 0 and less than 2) or &quot;moderate to severe&quot; (ci greater than or equal to 2). Because not all subjects had interstitial fibrosis in their kidneys, the number with fibrosis will differ from the overall number of subjects in each treatment group.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Hyperparathyroidism at One Year</title>
        <description>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a measure of how well the parathyroid gland is working and is measured by a blood test. Hyperparathyroidism (increased PTH) is defined as PTH blood value greater than 65 picograms/milliliter in the absence of hypocalcemia (low calcium) or if the subject had a parathyroidectomy (surgical removal of parathyroid glands) during the first year post-transplant.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Osteopenia/Osteoporosis of the Hip at One Year</title>
        <description>Osteopenia/Osteoporosis are conditions where bone mineral density is lower than normal, reported by T-scores, measurements of the hip made using an Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The T-score is measured and compared to a normal healthy adult. A normal bone density results in a T-score between +1.0 and -1.0. A T-score of less than or equal to -1.5 was used for this study to define the presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Each participant will be categorized as having or not having osteopenia/osteoporosis of the hip at the end of the first post-transplant year based on bone mineral density results.</description>

        <title>Change in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD)</title>
        <description>BMD was measured using a Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and reported by T-scores, measurements of the lower spine made using the scan. The T-score reflects how your bone density measurement compares to normal healthy adults. A normal bone density results in a T-score between +1.0 and -1.0. A T-score of less than or equal to -1.5 was used for this study to define the presence of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Osteopenia is a condition of decreased bone mass or density but not thin enough to be diagnosed as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a condition where bone mass/density has diminished to a level causing higher risk of fracture. The average change in T-score from baseline to one year is reported.</description>

        <title>Degree of Interstitial Fibrosis on Graft Biopsy at One Year</title>
        <description>Interstitial fibrosis refers to degree of scarring or fibrous tissue formed in the kidney. Renal pathologists reviewed biopsies of the subject's kidney grafts for fibrosis, with results expressed using the Banff schema; Quantitative criteria: ci0 = fibrosis observed in up to 5% of cortical area, ci1 = fibrosis in 6%-25% of cortical area (mild) , ci2 = fibrosis in 26%-50% of cortical area (moderate), ci3 = fibrosis in greater than 50% of cortical area (severe). The degree of interstital fibrosis for this study was defined and reported as follows: a Banff ci score of greater than 0 and less than 2 considered &quot;mild&quot; fibrosis and a ci score greater than or equal to 2 as &quot;moderate to severe&quot; fibrosis.</description>
