      The purpose of this study is to compare patient functional outcomes for surgical fixation of
      calcaneus fractures with and without tricortical iliac crest bone grafting
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized, prospective evaluation of patients who have
      sustained an intra-articular calcaneus fracture that requires open reduction with internal
      fixation as the preferred method of treatment. Patients who desire to participate in this
      study will be randomized into one of two groups. Group A will be made up of patients that
      undergo open reduction with internal fixation and Tricortical iliac crest bone grafting.
      Group B will consist of patients that undergo open reduction with internal fixation without
      bone grafting. All other surgical techniques and management of the fracture and patient will
      remain unchanged.
