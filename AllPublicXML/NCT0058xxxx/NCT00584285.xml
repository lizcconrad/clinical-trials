      The objective of this study is to determine if corneal topography can be used to predict the
      fluorescein pattern of keratoconus lenses on the eye. A corneal topography image will be
      taken and the computer selected lens will be placed on the eye. After placement of the lens
      color photographs will be taken of the eye's fluorescein pattern and compared to the computer
      predicted pattern.

      Subject population: keratoconus patients who have not undergone corneal surgery 100 subjects
      who come to UIHC for their contact lens care. We will approach them at their visit. We will
      not call potential participants from a database.

      If topography is impossible to capture. Concommitant Corneal Disease Minors will be excluded
