  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new
      investigational laser device for treatment of acne scarring, for improvement in the
      appearance of surface texture and topography (recessed or uneven surfaces).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty subjects between two research locations with an acne scar severity score greater than
      4 will receive up to 3 treatments with an FDA IDE and Institutional Review Board approved
      10,600nm fractional carbon dioxide laser system. Improvement of acne scarring is evaluated at
      1 month and 3 months post-treatment.

      Post-treatment responses evaluated are immediate erythema, immediate edema, and any other
      immediate responses. Evaluations are conducted immediate post treatment and one week
      post-treatment. Key safety data include the severity scoring of post-treatment responses, as
      well as by photodocumentation.

      The incidence of side effects such as scarring, pigmentary changes, etc. are evaluated at
      follow-up visits one and three months post-treatment. Key safety data include the incidence
      rates and severity scoring of side effects, as well as by photodocumentation

    <description>The average pain score reported over all three treatments was 5.67, corresponding to &quot;moderate&quot; pain based on a 10-point scale. The pain score is recorded on a 10-point scale, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; All subjects reported that any discomfort associated with the procedure was only during active intervention and resolved immediately post-procedure. Increased pain scores correlated with increased density, but not increased energy.</description>

             Scar Severity Scale. Subjects will be eligible for treatment if the area to be treated
             is scored as having an Acne Scar Severity Score &gt; 4 according to the Acne Scar
             Severity Scale (0-9).

          -  Are able to read, understand, and sign the Informed Consent.

             history of collagen vascular disease (e.g. lupus, scleroderma, history of keloid
             formation (raised and thickened scars), atrophic dermatitis (extreme skin irritation
             or itchiness) or immunologic abnormalities such as vitiligo (white patches of skin due
             to loss of pigment)

          -  Have immunocompromised status (inability to resist infection, etc.)

          -  Have been treated with lasers, chemical procedures, or other cosmetic procedures on
             the area to be treated within 6 months of enrollment

        <title>Pain Tolerance</title>
        <description>The average pain score reported over all three treatments was 5.67, corresponding to &quot;moderate&quot; pain based on a 10-point scale. The pain score is recorded on a 10-point scale, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; All subjects reported that any discomfort associated with the procedure was only during active intervention and resolved immediately post-procedure. Increased pain scores correlated with increased density, but not increased energy.</description>
