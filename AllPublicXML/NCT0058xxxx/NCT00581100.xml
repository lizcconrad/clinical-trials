  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if Etanercept administered at a higher initial dose
      provides greater improvement in nail and skin psoriasis symptoms than a regimen with a lower
      initial dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of the 2 Etanercept regimens on fingernail psoriasis over
      24 weeks among patients with both skin and fingernail symptoms who have previously failed at
      least one therapy for nail psoriasis. The endpoint of 24 weeks was chosen to allow sufficient
      time for normal nail growth.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Score for Target Fingernail</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Target fingernail (highest matrix + bed scores at baseline) divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and graded for nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis. Sum of scores = total score for that nail (0-8). Nail Matrix Psoriasis = pitting, leukonychia, red spots in lunula, and/or nail plate crumbling. Nail Bed Psoriasis = onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salmon patch) discoloration, and/or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Range for both scores: 0 (none), 1 (present in 1/4 nail), 2 (present in 2/4 nail), 3 (present in 3/4 nail), 4 (present in 4/4 nail). Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>

    <description>Self-administered questionnaire to measure health-related quality of life (QoL)of adult patients suffering from skin disease; 10 questions concerning patients' perception of impact of their disease over last week encompassing aspects such as symptoms, feelings, daily activities, leisure, work, school, personal relationships and side effects of treatment. Questions scored on a 4-point Likert scale: 0 (not at all/not relevant), 1 (a little), 2 (a lot), and 3 (very much). Scores of individual items (0-3) were added to yield a total score (0-30); higher score = greater impairment of patient's QoL.</description>

Sum of scores = total score for that nail (0-8). Nail Matrix Psoriasis = pitting, leukonychia, red spots in lunula, and/or nail plate crumbling. Nail Bed Psoriasis = onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salmon patch) discoloration, and/or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Range for both scores: 0 (none), 1 (present in 1/4 nail), 2 (present in 2/4 nail), 3 (present in 3/4 nail), 4 (present in 4/4 nail). Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>

        <description>Target fingernail (highest matrix + bed scores at baseline) divided with imaginary lines into quadrants and graded for nail matrix and nail bed psoriasis. Sum of scores = total score for that nail (0-8). Nail Matrix Psoriasis = pitting, leukonychia, red spots in lunula, and/or nail plate crumbling. Nail Bed Psoriasis = onycholysis, splinter hemorrhages, oil drop (salmon patch) discoloration, and/or nail bed hyperkeratosis. Range for both scores: 0 (none), 1 (present in 1/4 nail), 2 (present in 2/4 nail), 3 (present in 3/4 nail), 4 (present in 4/4 nail). Higher scores = more severe psoriasis.</description>
