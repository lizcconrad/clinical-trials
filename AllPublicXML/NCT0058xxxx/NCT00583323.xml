    <textblock>
      2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyD-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) has proven to be a
      valuable clinical tool for the staging and surveillance of lymphoma.1-6 Occasionally, lymph
      nodes in the mesentery and retroperitoneum can be difficult to distinguish from normal bowel
      activity on PET scans despite three-plane and cine maximal image projection (MIP) imaging.
      This uncertainty limits the clinical usefulness of PET in some cases of lymphoma.7-8 In
      addition, bowel activity can also hinder interpretation of PET scans in other types of solid
      tumors including melanoma and colorectal cancer.6,9,10 Our goal is to determine how well
      diphenoxylate/atropine 5mg/0.05mg (Lomotil) decreases bowel activity and how this decrease
      impacts clinical decision-making, specifically for lymphoma staging and surveillance. This is
      a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study involving 60 patients undergoing PET scans
      for newly diagnosed or recurrent, untreated lymphoma.
