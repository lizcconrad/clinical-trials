  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an accurate and useful way of measuring patients'
      thoughts and feelings about hope and hopelessness as they relate to their illness. Doctors
      and psychologists from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Calvary Hospital, the Peter
      MacCallum Cancer Centre, and Fordham University are working together to design a new measure.
      Findings from this research will help us study the nature of illness and develop improved
      methods of diagnosis and treatment. We hope what we learn from you will help us learn more
      about how to care better for patients with cancer and other severe illnesses.
