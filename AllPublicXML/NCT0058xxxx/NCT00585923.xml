    <measure>Fusion Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Last Follow-Up (Last follow-up ranged from no visit after surgery to 24 months of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The fusion criteria will include radiographic evidence of no motion at the affected levels on flexion/extension and evidence of bony bridging and no lucent lines on AP/lateral views.
Fusion Grading
&quot;fused&quot; &quot;probably fused&quot; &quot;pseudarthrosis&quot;
This determination was made by Dr. Nunley and there was never any more specific details given on how the determination was made between fused and probably fused.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain at Rest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Last Follow-Up visit (Last follow-up ranged from no visit after surgery to 24 months of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain is calculated by patient making an X on a visual analog scale (VAS) line at each visit. Mark on x is measured via a mm ruler. Number of Participants with the Level of Pain at Rest Improved, Maintained or Worsened from Baseline to &quot;last follow-up visit&quot;. This is calculated by subtracting the pain at the last follow-up from the pain at the baseline visit. Best Case is 0 and worst case is 100.</description>

    <measure>Pain With Activity</measure>

    <description>Pain is calculated by patient making an X on a visual analog scale (VAS) line at each visit. Mark on x is measured via a mm ruler. Number of Participants with the Level of Pain with Activity Improved, Maintained or Worsened from Baseline to &quot;last follow-up visit&quot;. This is calculated by subtracting the pain at the last follow-up from the pain at the baseline visit. Scores range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the best score.</description>

    <measure>Neurological Status Change in Neurological Status Since Surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Last follow-up visit (Last follow-up ranged from no visit after surgery to 24 months of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were categorized as maintained, improved or decreased Neurological Status. This was assessed pre-operatively and at each follow-up visit but reported on last follow-up. Motor Function was measured at each cervical level Reflex Function (0: Not elicitable; 1: Elicited with reinforcement; 2: Normal; 3:Brisk; 4:Clonus, unsustained; 5: Clonus, sustained) was measured for Bicep, Brachioradialis, and Triceps Sensory Function (0: Sensation is absent; 1: Sensating is diminished; 2: Sensation is normal; 3: Sensation is present, but pathological, was measured at each cervical dermatome</description>

    <measure>Level of Function (Neck Disability Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Last follow-up visit (Last follow-up ranged from no visit after surgery to 24 months of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients who have an improved, maintained or decreased level of function based on the results of their NDI (Neck Disabillity Index) from surgery to last follow-up visit. The NDI scale ranges from 0-100. If a subject has a score of 0, it means that they have no limitations and no pain. This is calculated by subtracting the NDI at the last follow-up from the NDI at the baseline visit.</description>

        <title>Pain at Rest</title>
        <description>Pain is calculated by patient making an X on a visual analog scale (VAS) line at each visit. Mark on x is measured via a mm ruler. Number of Participants with the Level of Pain at Rest Improved, Maintained or Worsened from Baseline to &quot;last follow-up visit&quot;. This is calculated by subtracting the pain at the last follow-up from the pain at the baseline visit. Best Case is 0 and worst case is 100.</description>
