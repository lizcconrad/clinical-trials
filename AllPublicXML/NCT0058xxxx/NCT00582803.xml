  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with strong family histories of breast cancer are at increased risk to have breast
      cancer. Women whose close relatives have had breast cancer often have more breast cancer
      screening than other women their age. To increase the chance that any breast cancer will be
      caught early, women at risk often take part in special screening programs. These programs
      involve more frequent visits to the doctor for breast exams, yearly mammography, and new
      types of exam like breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Studies are going on to find out
      whether these programs are better than standard screening. The purpose of this study is to
      find out how these programs impact women's quality of life. The study will also try to learn
      what factors make it hard to take part in the programs. We hope to be able to design new
      programs that are easier to follow.

      Women at risk for hereditary breast cancer are recommended to undergo intensive surveillance
      to maximize the likelihood of detecting the disease at an early, more curable, stage (Burke
      et al. 1997, Eisenger et al. 1998, Moller et al. 1999). Although the particular
      recommendations of different groups have varied, all suggest programs that incorporate
      clinical and radiographic screening performed more frequently than in the general population,
      beginning at a considerably younger age. Recent studies demonstrating the sensitivity of
      breast MRI have led several groups to incorporate this technology as an incremental (not
      replacement) modality, further increasing the intensity of the surveillance regimen. While
      data are beginning to accumulate regarding the effectiveness of aggressive surveillance,
      little is known about the ability and willingness of women to adhere to these rigorous
      schedules, nor about the psychosocial and economic costs of the programs. Based upon the
      Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP)model (Miller, Shoda, Hurley 1996), we
      hypothesize that the ability to adhere to a proposed screening regimen will result from a
      complex and dynamic interaction between the nature of that regimen, events that can be
      expected to occur in the course of screening (such as abnormal results and practical
      barriers) and key psychological factors such as the individual's attentional style, affective
      state, perceived risk of cancer, cancer-specific worries, and beliefs regarding the
      effectiveness of screening. To test the hypothesis, we propose to prospectively study women
      with a hereditary risk for breast cancer participating in a structured surveillance program
      of monthly breast self-examination, semi-annual clinical examination and annual mammography,
      augmented by annual interval breast MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female

          -  Age 25 years or greater

          -  Genetic predisposition as defined by one of the following:

               -  Known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (deleterious or uncertain significance) OR

               -  Untested first-degree relative of an individual with a known deleterious BRCA
                  mutation OR

               -  Unaffected first-degree relative of an affected individual within a hereditary
                  breast-ovarian kindred in which no testing has been performed or testing is
                  negative, defined as: 3 or more women in 2 generations affected with breast or
                  ovarian cancer. Women with bilateral breast cancer and woman with both breast and
                  ovarian cancer count as single individual AND 1 woman must be first-degree
                  relative of the other two, or related to the other two through a male AND At
                  least 1 woman affected with breast cancer before age 50 or ovarian cancer at any
                  age

          -  Able to understand and complete English-language questionnaires

          -  Intend to receive clinical and radiographic follow-up at MSKCC

               -  Women will not be excluded if they have previously received clinical and
                  radiographic follow-up at either MSKCC or another institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of breast or ovarian cancer

          -  Contraindication to breast MRI examination (e.g. aneurysm clips, pacemaker, cochlear
             implant, severe claustrophobia, weight over 300 pounds) or to paramagnetic contrast
             (prior IgE-type allergic reaction, sickle cell anemia, renal failure)

          -  Pregnant or planning to begin attempts at conception within 1 year of enrollment. A
             negative serum Î²-hCG will not be required for study entry, nor for radiographic
             examination, as this test is not routinely performed before clinically indicated
             radiographic study.

          -  Unable for physical, psychological, or financial reasons to receive clinical and
             radiographic follow-up at MSKCC

          -  Concurrent medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the attending
             physician or Principal Investigator, would place the subject at risk were she to
             participate
