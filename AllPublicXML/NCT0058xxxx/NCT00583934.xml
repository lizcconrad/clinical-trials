      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of esophageal pathology in
      asymptomatic patients with a history of head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are certain factors (i.e. alcohol, tobacco, decreased saliva production from radiation)
      that predispose patients with a history of head and neck cancer to have esophageal disease.
      Often, in the initial stages of the disease, patients do not have symptoms. However, the
      early detection of precancerous lesions or small cancers improves patients' chances of being
      cured. There is no direct data supporting the practice of screening patients with a history
      of head and neck cancer after treatment for esophageal disease if they are not experiencing
      symptoms. However, many argue that screening endoscopy is justified in high risk patients to
      detect early esophageal cancer or dysplasia at a curable state. We are, therefore, performing
      this study to determine the value of endoscopic screening of the esophagus after treatment
      for head and neck cancer in patients without symptoms.
