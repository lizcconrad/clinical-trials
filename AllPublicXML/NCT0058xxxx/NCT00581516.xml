    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths among men in the United
      States.1 Although still controversial, there is growing evidence that early detection will
      reduce prostate cancer mortality. Currently the most useful biomarker to aid in early
      detection is measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Despite the value
      of PSA it has substantial limitations. To overcome the limitations of total PSA testing,
      there is emerging evidence demonstrating that relevant cancer biomarker can be detected in
      urine.

      Patients who present to the urology clinic for a radical prostatectomy will be asked to enter
      this study. After obtaining informed consent, the following exam and specimen collection
      scheduled will be followed:

      Visit 1 (pre-op):

      Digital Rectal Exam (DRE) - Voided urine collection &amp; serum collection

      Visit 2 (time of prostatectomy):

      Under anesthesia- catheterized urine collection and serum collection

      Visit 3 (approximately 8 days post-prostatectomy):

      Catheterized urine collection

      Visit 4 (approximately 3 months post-prostatectomy):

      Voided urine collection and serum collection

      Some patients will not have the serum collection at visits 1, 2, and 4. The patients will be
      notified as to whether or not their blood will be drawn during the visits. Pre-operative
      Digital Rectal Exam, urinary catheterization and blood draws are part of standard of care in
      this patient population with localized prostate cancer. The catheter will be inserted during
      the time of surgery preparation in the operating room and removed during the post operative
      clinic appointment.
