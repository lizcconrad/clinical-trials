  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to study the accuracy of 3-dimensional ultrasound (which does not involve
      radiation) to measure the size of the stomach, comparing it with a previously validated
      method that involves radiation. This will make it possible to check the stomach function of
      children without exposing them to radiation. A second goal is to measure the size of the
      stomach and the effect of a standard meal on stomach volume in adolescent boys and girls.

      Specific Aims

        1. To compare the fasting and postprandial volumes measured by 99mTc- SPECT (standard test)
           and 3-D ultrasound in 12 healthy adults in order to test latter's external validity

        2. To assess the performance characteristics of 3-D ultrasound for the measurement of
           gastric volumes during fasting and in response to a standard meal, specifically, the
           intra- and inter-individual coefficient of variation in 12 healthy adults who undergo
           two estimations of fasting and postprandial volumes

        3. To develop normative data for fasting and postprandial gastric volumes in 24
           asymptomatic adolescents.

      Study Design

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: first, 12 healthy adults will undergo SPECT and 3-D
      ultrasound in random order (aim 1); one week after the first ultrasound examination, a second
      Ultrasound examination will be conducted in all participants (aim 2) In the second part, 24
      adolescents (12 in each gender, 12 aged 13-15, 12 aged 16-18)) will undergo a single
      determination of fasting and postprandial gastric volumes during fasting and post-prandially.
      The methods and validation of the SPECT study have been previously published (2). Three D
      ultrasonography will be conducted using state of the art equipment following methods
      published in the literature. (3)

      The study will screen 80 healthy adults or adolescents in order to enroll 12 healthy adulkts
      for the first two aims, and 24 adolescent healthy subjects for the third aim.

      For subjects in group 1, the order of SPECT and 3D- ultrasound tests will be randomized.

      The randomization assignments will be made according to a pre-study schedule prepared by the
      Section of Biostatistics. Medical investigators will be blinded to assignment, allocation
      will be concealed

        ealthy adolescents and adults: The study will screen up to 80 healthy adults or adolescents
        in order to enroll 12 healthy adults for the first two aims, and 24 adolescent healthy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 13-65 years

          2. Body mass index (BMI): 18 to 32 (exept in adolescents)

          3. Negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

          4. Absence of gastrointestinal symptoms (abridged Bowel Disease Questionnaire)

          5. Signed informed consent

          1. Subjects with body mass index (BMI) of less than 18 or more than 32.

          2. Structural or metabolic diseases/conditions that affect the gastrointestinal system,
             or functional gastrointestinal disorders. For screening, the Bowel Disease
             Questionnaire will be used to exclude subjects with irritable bowel syndrome.

          3. Use of drugs or agents within the past 2 weeks that alter GI transit including
             laxatives, magnesium or aluminum-containing antacids, prokinetics, erythromycin,
             narcotics, anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants, SSRI and newer
             antidepressants.

             respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological,
             psychiatric, or other disease that interfere with the objectives of the study. Any
