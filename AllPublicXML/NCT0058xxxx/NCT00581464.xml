  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80 nicotine dependent adults ages 18-65 who desire to quit smoking will be screened and, if
      eligible, enrolled and randomized to one of two four-week treatments for smoking cessation.
      The treatments are standard behavioral therapy and Mindfulness Based Addiction Therapy
      (MBAT), which is standard therapy plus mindfulness. Standard therapy and MBAT incorporate
      elements of widely-used tools for smoking cessation including managing craving and strong
      emotions, problem solving, tips on healthy eating and keeping active, and exercises based on
      cognitive and behavioral therapy. MBAT uniquely incorporates mindfulness practice (a
      relaxation therapy) into standard therapy. Participants complete questionnaires and undergo
      an fMRI scan at baseline and at the end of therapy (after they complete the 4 weeks of
      standard therapy or MBAT). During each scan, participants will complete a validated
      smoking-related cue paradigm and a validated affect labeling paradigm.
