  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in the Netherlands.
      Approximately 11,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually, of whom about 30% are
      below 50 years of age. Premenopausal women with breast cancer treated with chemotherapy or
      hormonal therapy may experience a premature onset of the menopause. Estrogen deficiency
      following adjuvant treatments leads to primary endocrine symptoms, including vasomotor and
      urogenital problems. Secondary symptoms include insomnia due to night sweats, dyspareunia due
      to vaginal dryness, weight gain, and psychological distress. The symptoms resulting from
      accelerated estrogen withdrawal can be pronounced and severe, and may adversely affect
      women's sexual functioning, body image, and overall HRQL. Healthy women who enter natural
      menopause are often prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate vasomotor and
      sexual symptoms. However, due to possible tumor-promoting effects, HRT is contraindicated for
      patients with a history of breast cancer. For these women, non-hormonal medications are
      frequently prescribed to treat vasomotor symptoms. Although these medications have been shown
      to yield moderate symptom relief, they also have a number of bothersome side effects. To
      alleviate urogenital symptoms, local vaginal moisturizing or estrogen cream is often
      prescribed. There is growing evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including
      relaxation techniques, and physical exercise may effectively reduce vasomotor symptoms in
      naturally occurring menopause. CBT and relaxation techniques are aimed primarily at the
      modification of precipitants of hot flushes and at stress management. Physical exercise on a
      regular basis affects neurotransmitters, which regulate central thermoregulation.

      Purpose: The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of a supportive intervention program
      in alleviating menopausal symptoms, improving sexual functioning and enhancing the quality of
      life of younger women (&lt; 50 years) with breast cancer who have become prematurely menopausal
      as a result of their treatment. Specifically, the study will evaluate CBT including
      relaxation (A), physical exercise (B), and a combination of A and B.

      Plan of investigation: This multicenter study will employ a prospective, full-factorial
      design. In total, 325 consenting women will be randomized to group A, group B, group AB or a
      usual care, 'waiting list' control group (N = 81-81 per group). Upon completion of the study,
      the patients assigned to the control group will be given the opportunity to undergo either
      the A or B intervention program. The program will begin with a structured assessment of the
      target symptoms: hot flushes, night sweating and vaginal dryness. The overriding goal of the
      intervention is to provide symptomatic women with information skills and support to manage
      their symptoms more effectively. For group A, the intervention will consist of 6 weekly group
      CBT sessions of 1.5 hours, of 15 minutes of daily homework and a booster session at 3 months.
      The CBT will focus on understanding and self-control of menopausal symptoms. Relaxation
      techniques (paced respiration and muscle relaxation) will focus on the reduction of
      sympathetic nervous system activity, and are expected to have a positive impact on the
      frequency and intensity of hot flushes. For group B, the intervention will be an individually
      tailored, 12 week home-based physical exercise program of 2.5-3 hours per week, with
      instructions provided in-clinic on 2 occasions, and telephone support on 2 additional,
      interim occasions. The physical exercise program is intended to enhance fitness levels, in
      general, and to improve thermoregulation specifically related to hot flushes. Group AB will
      receive both the CBT and exercise program elements. Women allocated to the intervention
      groups will be asked to complete a battery of questionnaires assessing menopausal symptoms
      (the primary outcome), sexuality, body- and self-image, psychological distress and generic
      HRQL prior to the start of the program (baseline, T0), at 12 weeks (T1) and at 6 months
      follow-up (T2). Women allocated to the control group will complete the same questionnaire
      battery at parallel points in time.

      Results/ relevance: If demonstrated to be effective, the availability of a structured
      supportive intervention program (modules A, B or AB) will be a welcome addition to regular
      medical care offered to breast cancer patients with treatment-induced menopause. It is
      anticipated that such a program will have direct benefit in terms of symptoms relief and the
      improvement of patients' HRQL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study sample will be composed of 325 women, younger than 50 years of age, with
        histologically confirmed primary breast cancer (stages: T1 - T4, N0 - N1 and M0). All women
        will have been premenopausal at the time of diagnosis, have completed adjuvant chemotherapy
        (with the exception of herceptin, which can continue to receive) a minimum of 4 months and
        a maximum of 5 years prior to study entry. Women may currently be receiving adjuvant
        hormonal therapy. All women should be disease-free at time of study entry. Potentially
        eligible women will be screened for the presence of at least one of the following 3
        menopausal symptoms during the previous 2-month period: hot flushes, sweating and/or
        vaginal dryness.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women will be excluded from the study if they lack basic proficiency in Dutch, if they have
        serious cognitive or psychiatric problems, or serious physical comorbidity that would
        preclude them from participating in a physical exercise program. Since physical exercise
        may be contraindicated as a treatment for hot flushes in obese women, 49 patients with a
        BMI ≥ 30 will be excluded from the study. Patients participating in concurrent studies or
        rehabilitation programs containing psychosocial interventions will also be excluded.
