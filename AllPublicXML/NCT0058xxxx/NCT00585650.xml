      The purpose of this research study is to see how well (compared to placebo) Enbrel®
      (etanercept) 50 mg twice a week affects plaque psoriasis of the hands and/or feet
      (Palmoplantar Psoriasis)

    <textblock>
      This 24-week multicenter study consists of two phases. The first phase is a 12 week,
      double-blind, randomized trial of etanercept, 50 mg twice weekly versus placebo in subjects
      with PPP. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to either 50 mg
      etanercept twice weekly or placebo. Subcutaneous injections will occur twice weekly at
      approximately the same time of day over the first 12-week treatment period. The primary
      efficacy endpoint will be assessed after 12 weeks of treatment. At the end of the first 12
      weeks, all patient (both treatment and placebo arms) will be treated with etanercept 50 mg
      twice a week (BIW) for an additional 12 weeks.

    <measure>The Number of Subjects Who Achieve a 50% Reduction in the Palmoplantar Psoriasis Severity Index at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) is the most widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. This tool is used to assess the skin lesions of the entire body however, the palmoplantar psoriasis severity index is a modified form of the the PASI that is assessed for skin lesions of the hands and feet only. The severity is estimated by three clinical signs: erythema induration and desquamation. Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4.. The sum of all three severity parameters is then calculated based on surface area affected.</description>

        <title>The Number of Subjects Who Achieve a 50% Reduction in the Palmoplantar Psoriasis Severity Index at 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) is the most widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. This tool is used to assess the skin lesions of the entire body however, the palmoplantar psoriasis severity index is a modified form of the the PASI that is assessed for skin lesions of the hands and feet only. The severity is estimated by three clinical signs: erythema induration and desquamation. Severity parameters are measured on a scale of 0 to 4.. The sum of all three severity parameters is then calculated based on surface area affected.</description>
