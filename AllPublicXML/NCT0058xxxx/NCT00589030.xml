      RATIONALE: Internal radiation therapy uses radioactive material placed directly into or near
      a tumor to kill tumor cells. Using radiolabeled glass beads to kill tumor cells may be
      effective treatment for liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      PURPOSE: To provide expanded access and study the side effects of yttrium Y 90 glass
      microspheres in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Provide supervised access to treatment with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres
           (TheraSphere®) to eligible patients with primary cancer to the liver and who are not
           surgical resection candidates.

        -  Evaluate patient experience and toxicities associated with TheraSphere® treatment.

        -  Enter treatment experience into a liver database.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tumor response rates in patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a humanitarian device exemption use study.

      Patients receive yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres (TheraSphere®) via percutaneous hepatic
      arterial infusion. Patients may be retreated between 30-90 days after the initial infusion.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days and then annually
      thereafter for up to 2 years.
