  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to first understand how MSKCC Clinical Genetics Service doctors
      talk to women with breast cancer about any genetic risks they might carry, and if they help
      women to think about what they might say, in turn, to their relatives, especially their
      daughters.

      A second part of the study asks women for their opinions about when and how their daughters
      should be told about any genetic risks.

      All of this will help us develop teaching methods to help our doctors improve the way they
      talk about genetic risk when women with breast cancer have adolescent daughters.

    <description>The group will discuss its views about how and when to talk about the risk of getting breast cancer. The focus group will be video recorded and the video recorded material will be later transcribed and carefully analyzed. In addition you will be asked to answer questions about yourself, such as education and marital status.</description>

    <description>The focus group will last about 90 minutes. However, your involvement in this study will last from the time you join until you read over the summary of what happened during the focus group and return your comments. This should be approximately 2 months. Patient will complete a questionnaire and we estimate total time for completion to be approximately 7 minutes.</description>
