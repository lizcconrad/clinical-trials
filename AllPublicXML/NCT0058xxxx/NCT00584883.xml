      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ABT 510 when administered concurrent with
      radiation therapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      1. To describe the toxicity associated with this regimen in adult patients with newly
           diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

        2. To determine the duration of disease free survival and overall survival associated with
           this therapy.

        3. Evaluate thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) and 2 (TSP-2) in tumor vs. corresponding normal tissue
           using quantitative real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (Q-RT-PCR).

        4. Determine the effect of ABT 510 on tumor permeability and tumor blood volume as measured
           by non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

    <description>ABT 510 (TSP-1 mimetic peptide) is a parenterally available nonapeptide analog of the heptapeptide and is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. ABT 510 competes with TSP-1 for binding to endothelial cells, but the exact mechanism of anti-angiogenesis is unknown. ABT 510 is administered by SQ injection. The starting dose of ABT 510 will be 20mg once daily (QD) SQ. Doses will be escalated by approximately 50% increments in consecutive cohorts of 3-6 patients until maximum tolerated dose is achieved.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be 19 years of age or older.

          2. Patients must have histologically proven newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

          3. Patients must have fully recovered from the immediate post-operative period and be
             maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for 5 days prior to entry.

          4. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60% (i.e. the patient must be able
             to care for himself/herself with occasional help from others).

          5. Patients must have adequate hematologic, renal and liver function (i.e. Absolute
             neutrophil count &gt; 1500/mm3, Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3, creatinine 1.5 mg/dl .

          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

          7. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. The effect of the
             investigational drugs on the developing human fetus is not known, but these drugs are
             likely to be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing infant. Women of child-bearing
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (either surgical sterilization;
             approved hormonal contraceptives such as birth control pills Depo-Provera, or Lupron
             Depot; barrier methods such as condom or diaphragm along with spermicide; or an
             Intrauterine device (IUD)). Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician and study
             PI immediately.

          8. The patient is able to self-administer or has a caregiver who can reliably administer
             subcutaneous injections.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          2. Prior therapy for the brain tumor (except surgery)

          3. Prior treatment with antineoplastic agents.

          4. Exclude sexually active males and females unwilling to practice contraception during
             the study.

          5. Serious concurrent infections.

          6. Clinically significant cardiac disease not well controlled with medication (e.g.
             congestive heart failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias
             ) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.

          7. Patients who have had prior cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to radiation therapy.

          8. Patients with other serious uncontrolled co-morbid diseases that the investigator
             feels may comprise the study findings.

          9. Patients must be able to learn to self -administer or have another person administer
             subcutaneous(SQ) injections.

         10. Patients who have received any other investigational agents within the 28 days prior
             to Day 1 of the study.
