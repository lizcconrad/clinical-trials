  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the S.T.A.R. device for patients with
      bilateral disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific objectives are to show that the safety data of the S.T.A.R. ankle arthroplasty
      is similar for treatment of single ankle disease (as defined in the pivotal study) and
      bilateral ankle disease. The bilateral disease may be identified at the time of enrollment or
      may have progressed after enrollment and treatment of the first ankle in the pivotal study.

    <description>The S.T.A.R. ankle system is the study device. The device has three parts: two metal bearing surfaces (cobalt-chromium alloy) plates with bars that fit into the bone and one plastic (polyethylene) spacer that moves between the metal plates like a ball bearing. The materials in the S.T.A.R. device are the same materials used in total hip and knee implants. Both ankles of every subject will be treated with the STAR ankle.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate or severe pain, loss of mobility and function of the ankle

          -  At least six months of conservative treatment for severe ankle conditions

          -  Bilateral ankle disease that have not been enrolled in the pivotal study or single
             ankle disease and enrolled in the pivotal study but have subsequently developed ankle
             disease in the contralateral ankle and require surgical intervention

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not reached skeletal maturity

          -  Active or prior deep infection in the ankle joint or adjacent bones

          -  Prior arthrodesis at the involved site

          -  History of prior mental illness or patient demonstrates that their mental capacity may
             interfere with their ability to follow the study protocol

          -  Obesity (weight greater than 250 lbs)

          -  History of current or prior drug abuse or alcoholism

          -  Any physical condition precluding major surgery

          -  Prior surgery and/or injury that has adversely affected the ankle bone stock

          -  Severe osteoporotic or osteopenic condition or other conditions that may lead to
             inadequate implant fixation in the bone

          -  Insufficient ligament support
