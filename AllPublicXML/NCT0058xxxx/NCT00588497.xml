  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tubal sterilization is the most prevalent form of contraception in the United States and the
      world. Currently, approximately half of these are performed with a laparoscope and half
      through a mini-laparotomy after delivery. Micro-insert hysteroscopic sterilization system
      received FDA approval for elective sterilization in 2003. Compared to other forms of female
      sterilization, this procedure is minimally invasive and does not require entering the
      abdominal cavity. In addition, it is at least as effective in preventing pregnancy as other
      forms of tubal occlusion. Given the distinct advantages of this method, it could become the
      preferred method of tubal sterilization for physicians and their patients. Currently, there
      is no published data concerning the appearance of the micro-inserts system using other
      imaging modalities that are commonly used in gynecologic practice. As the use of this device
      becomes more widespread it will be more commonly encountered in radiographic imaging
      performed as part of routine patient care. The main objective of this study is to provide
      important descriptive data concerning the ultrasonographic and x-ray appearance of the
      micro-insert hysteroscopic sterilization device. An additional objective of this study is to
      identify characteristics on plain film and ultrasound (US) that correlate with tubal
      occlusion or patency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients requesting sterilization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unsuccessful placement of the hysteroscopic sterilization system in one or both
             fallopian tubes. In addition, a patient will not be offered the opportunity to
             participate in the study if there are any conditions that would preclude attempted
             placement of the hysteroscopic sterilization system. These include hypersensitivity to
             nickel-titanium or contrast media, current or recent pregnancy (within the previous
             six weeks), active genital tract infection, prior tubal ligation, or known congenital
             uterine malformation.
