  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of hospitalization among Americans over the age of 65
      years, affecting greater than 5 million in the U.S. alone. Significant improvements in
      morbidity and mortality have been achieved through the use of medications that antagonize
      adverse neurohormonal signaling pathways, particularly therapies that reduce left ventricular
      (LV) afterload.

      Vascular stiffness increases with aging, contributing to the increase in cardiac load. One
      important repercussion of such stiffening is an increase in pulse wave velocity. As the
      incident pressure wave generated by cardiac ejection encounters zones of impedance mismatch
      (such as arterial bifurcations), part of the wave is reflected backward, summing with the
      incident wave, increasing central blood pressure (CBP). With normal aging, hypertension, and
      heart failure, increased wave velocity causes the reflected wave to reach the heart earlier,
      in mid to late systole, considerably increasing late-systolic load, impairing cardiac
      ejection, and diastolic relaxation in the ensuing cardiac cycle.

      The magnitude of this reflected pressure wave can be quantified by the augmentation index
      (AIx). The use of vasoactive agents which antagonize this increase in late systolic load (and
      AIx) may prove useful in the treatment of heart failure, by facilitating cardiac ejection
      during late systole when reflected pressure waves predominate. However, it has never been
      conclusively shown in humans that CBP-targeted therapy is useful in the management of HF.

      LV afterload, measured centrally in the ascending aorta, may differ considerably from
      brachial cuff-measured pressure, and has traditionally required invasive hemodynamic
      assessment to determine, limiting the applicability of techniques targeting CBP and
      late-systolic load. Recently, a novel, hand-held tonometer (SphygmoCor, Atcor Medical) has
      been developed for the noninvasive assessment of CBP. This pencil-like device is applied over
      the radial artery, and uses a validated mathematical transformation to derive central aortic
      pressure. This device has received FDA approval for clinical use in the assessment of central
      pressures. However, it remains unknown whether knowledge of CBP and late-systolic load (AIx)
      confers any clinically-significant incremental benefit in the management of patients with
      heart failure. The primary objective of the proposed investigation will be to determine if
      this assessment might have such a role.

      Research Design and Methods

      Hypotheses Knowledge of central aortic pressure waveforms (central pressure therapy, CPT)
      will affect the intensity of antihypertensive medication prescription, and treatment
      decisions based upon this knowledge in turn will lead to an enhanced reduction in CBP and
      AIx. Finally, it is hypothesized that this reduction in AIx/CBP will lead to improved
      exercise performance and LV systolic and diastolic reserve function.

      Basic Study Plan This is a single-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group intervention
      study examining the effects of a novel, noninvasive diagnostic test for determining AIx and
      CBP (SphygmoCor, Atcor Medical) on medical care, blood pressure control, exercise
      performance, and LV functional reserve in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) and
      systolic dysfunction (25%&lt;EF&lt;50%) and with preserved systolic function (EF&gt;50%). Eligible
      subjects will undergo resting echocardiogram, noninvasive CBP assessment, and metabolic
      exercise stress testing on a recumbent cycle ergometer to quantify exercise performance.
      Echocardiography and CBP assessment will be performed at rest, during graded exercise, and
      immediately after peak exercise to determine indexes of LV systolic and diastolic performance
      and changes in CBP. Subjects will then be randomized (1:1) to subsequent determination of CBP
      at 1 month heart failure clinic visits versus sham (tonometry information acquired, but not
      shared with investigator). Investigators will then make adjustments to subject's medical
      therapy and antihypertensive regimen based upon the additional data procured via the
      Sphygmocor device. Subjects randomized to sham will have adjustments made as per standard
      clinical judgment based upon brachial blood pressure assessment and other clinical variables.
      In addition to standard clinical assessment, each subject will undergo 6 minute walk test at
      each visit, administered by the study coordinator.

      At the 6 month follow up visit, subjects will undergo resting and exercise echo/CBP/metabolic
      stress testing exactly as performed at visit 1. The co-primary endpoints will be the change
      in central augmentation index (defined below) and change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2) from
      baseline. Secondary endpoints will include the changes in resting and exercise-induced CBP
      and brachial blood pressures, number of antihypertensive medications prescribed, resting and
      exercise change in LV systolic and diastolic function (see below), changes in: cardiac
      output, exercise time, anaerobic threshold, minute ventilation (VE) over carbon dioxide
      produced (VCO2) slope (ventilatory efficiency). There will be a total of 7 visits, the first
      and last for exercise testing; the intervening 5 visits will be routine heart failure clinic
      follow up appointments.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Peak oxygen uptake (VO2) is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption as measured during incremental exercise, most typically on a motorized treadmill. Maximal oxygen consumption reflects the aerobic physical fitness of the individual. VO2 data was obtained via standard breath-by-breath expired gas analysis. Ejection Fraction Subgroups are based on participants reported at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Aortic Augmentation Index (AIx) According to Ejection Fraction Subgroups</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Aortic stiffness increases with aging, further augmenting cardiac load. One important repercussion of aortic stiffening is an increase in pulse wave velocity. As the outgoing pressure wave caused by ventricular ejection encounters zones of impedance mismatch, it is partially reflected backward, summing with the incident wave, to increase central aortic blood pressure. The magnitude of this systolic pressure wave reflection can be quantified by AIx.
Aortic pressures were assessed in the seated position after 5 minutes rest. Aortic pulse waveform analysis was performed using a noninvasive, high-fidelity hand held tonometer placed over the radial artery. The built-in, custom software was then used to convert radial pressure waveforms to central aortic waveforms, which more accurately reflect LV afterload. The ratio of this augmented pressure to aortic pulse pressure is defined as the augmentation index (AIx).</description>

    <measure>Change in Left Ventricle (LV) End Diastolic Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>End-diastolic volume (EDV) is the volume of blood in the right and/or left ventricle at end load or filling in (diastole). An increase in EDV increases the preload on the heart and, through the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart, increases the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle during systole (stroke volume).
Ventricular Data was derived from comprehensive echo-Doppler/Tissue Doppler Echo (TDE) study performed at rest, during and immediately after exercise, along with noninvasive blood pressure assessment (GE Vivid7). LV EDV was determined from the apical 4 and 2 chamber views using Simpson's method of discs, along with ejection fraction (EF).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in LV End Systolic Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>End-systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood in a ventricle at the end of contraction, or systole, and the beginning of filling, or diastole. ESV is the lowest volume of blood in the ventricle at any point in the cardiac cycle. End systolic volume can be used clinically as a measurement of the adequacy of cardiac emptying, related to systolic function.

    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ejection fraction is the percentage of the volume in the left ventricle ejected during a cardiac cycle. The normal ejection fraction is 55 to 75 percent. EF = (EDV ‑ ESV) / EDV where EF = ejection fraction, EDV = volume of blood in the left ventricle at end‑diastole, ESV = volume of blood in the left ventricle at end‑systole.

    <measure>Change in Mitral E Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Mitral E velocity is the speed at which blood fills the ventricle. It is determined by echocardiography, an ultrasound-based cardiac imaging modality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mitral E/A Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The E/A ratio is a marker of the function of the left ventricle of the heart; it is determined by echocardiography, an ultrasound-based cardiac imaging modality. Abnormalities in the E/A ratio on Doppler echocardiography suggest that the left ventricle, which pumps blood into the circulation, cannot fill with blood properly in the period between contractions. The E/A ratio is the ratio of peak early transmitral inflow velocity and peak late mitral inflow velocity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mitral E Wave Deceleration Time</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The deceleration time (DT) is the time taken from the maximum E point to baseline. Normally in adults it is less than 220 milliseconds. The DT was measured by pulse wave doppler.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brachial Systolic Blood Pressure (BP)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure is a measure of the force of the blood flowing against the walls of your arteries as it moves through your body.
There are two numbers in a blood pressure reading. This tells how high in millimeters the pressure of your blood raises a column of mercury. The numbers usually are expressed in the form of a fraction; an example of a blood pressure reading is 120/80 mm Hg. The first, or top, number (120 in the example) is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the measure of your blood pressure as the heart contracts and pumps blood. The second or lower number is the diastolic pressure and is the measure taken when your heart is at rest (80 in the example)
Brachial systolic BP was determined by a standard oscillometric device (Dinemap, Critikon).</description>

          <title>Body Mass Index</title>
          <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a health index for comparing weight to height. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by his or her height in meters squared. The body mass index is an indication if a person is at a suitable weight for his height on an approximation of body fat. A body mass index of under 20 is considered to be underweight, while a body mass index between 20 to 25 is considered healthy. A body mass index in the range of 25 to 30 is regarded as overweight. A body mass index over 30 is regarded as obese.</description>

        <title>Change in Aortic Augmentation Index (AIx) According to Ejection Fraction Subgroups</title>
        <description>Aortic stiffness increases with aging, further augmenting cardiac load. One important repercussion of aortic stiffening is an increase in pulse wave velocity. As the outgoing pressure wave caused by ventricular ejection encounters zones of impedance mismatch, it is partially reflected backward, summing with the incident wave, to increase central aortic blood pressure. The magnitude of this systolic pressure wave reflection can be quantified by AIx.
Aortic pressures were assessed in the seated position after 5 minutes rest. Aortic pulse waveform analysis was performed using a noninvasive, high-fidelity hand held tonometer placed over the radial artery. The built-in, custom software was then used to convert radial pressure waveforms to central aortic waveforms, which more accurately reflect LV afterload. The ratio of this augmented pressure to aortic pulse pressure is defined as the augmentation index (AIx).</description>

          <title>Change in Aortic Augmentation Index (AIx) According to Ejection Fraction Subgroups</title>
          <description>Aortic stiffness increases with aging, further augmenting cardiac load. One important repercussion of aortic stiffening is an increase in pulse wave velocity. As the outgoing pressure wave caused by ventricular ejection encounters zones of impedance mismatch, it is partially reflected backward, summing with the incident wave, to increase central aortic blood pressure. The magnitude of this systolic pressure wave reflection can be quantified by AIx.
Aortic pressures were assessed in the seated position after 5 minutes rest. Aortic pulse waveform analysis was performed using a noninvasive, high-fidelity hand held tonometer placed over the radial artery. The built-in, custom software was then used to convert radial pressure waveforms to central aortic waveforms, which more accurately reflect LV afterload. The ratio of this augmented pressure to aortic pulse pressure is defined as the augmentation index (AIx).</description>

        <description>End-diastolic volume (EDV) is the volume of blood in the right and/or left ventricle at end load or filling in (diastole). An increase in EDV increases the preload on the heart and, through the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart, increases the amount of blood ejected from the ventricle during systole (stroke volume).
Ventricular Data was derived from comprehensive echo-Doppler/Tissue Doppler Echo (TDE) study performed at rest, during and immediately after exercise, along with noninvasive blood pressure assessment (GE Vivid7). LV EDV was determined from the apical 4 and 2 chamber views using Simpson's method of discs, along with ejection fraction (EF).</description>

        <title>Change in Brachial Systolic Blood Pressure (BP)</title>
        <description>Blood pressure is a measure of the force of the blood flowing against the walls of your arteries as it moves through your body.
There are two numbers in a blood pressure reading. This tells how high in millimeters the pressure of your blood raises a column of mercury. The numbers usually are expressed in the form of a fraction; an example of a blood pressure reading is 120/80 mm Hg. The first, or top, number (120 in the example) is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the measure of your blood pressure as the heart contracts and pumps blood. The second or lower number is the diastolic pressure and is the measure taken when your heart is at rest (80 in the example)
Brachial systolic BP was determined by a standard oscillometric device (Dinemap, Critikon).</description>

        <title>Change in Augmentation Index</title>
        <description>Aortic stiffness increases with aging, further augmenting cardiac load. One important repercussion of aortic stiffening is an increase in pulse wave velocity. As the outgoing pressure wave caused by ventricular ejection encounters zones of impedance mismatch, it is partially reflected backward, summing with the incident wave, to increase central aortic blood pressure. The magnitude of this systolic pressure wave reflection can be quantified by AIx.
Aortic pressures were assessed in the seated position after 5 minutes rest. Aortic pulse waveform analysis was performed using a noninvasive, high-fidelity hand held tonometer placed over the radial artery. The built-in, custom software was then used to convert radial pressure waveforms to central aortic waveforms, which more accurately reflect LV afterload. The ratio of this augmented pressure to aortic pulse pressure is defined as the augmentation index (AIx).</description>
