  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effect taking cisplatin in combination with
      bevacizumab before surgery and then standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab after surgery will
      have on participants with Estrogen Receptor (ER) negative, Progesterone Receptor (PR)
      negative and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer.
      Cisplatin is used to destroy cancer cells in many types of cancers, and has shown to be
      effective and have manageable side effects. Bevacizumab is an antibody, which is a protein
      that attacks a foreign substance in the body. Bevacizumab slows or stops cell growth in
      cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors.

      -  To prepare for surgery, a small &quot;clip&quot; will be placed into the tumor area so that the
           surgeon can locate the site of the tumor at the time of surgery. This is a standard
           procedure for breast cancer.

        -  The study drugs will be given in four 3-week cycles (about 3 months). Participants will
           come into the clinic each day they receive study treatment intravenously. Cisplatin will
           be given on day one of the treatment cycle (once every 3 weeks) for four cycles.
           Bevacizumab will be given on day one of the treatment cycle for three cycles.

        -  On day one of each 3-week cycle a physical exam, routine blood tests and urine test will
           be performed. 7-8 days after chemotherapy, blood tests and a hearing test will be
           performed. A preoperative study visit will take place 7-10 days before surgery and a
           physical exam, routine blood tests, Electrocardiogram (EKG) and an Magnetic Resonance
           Imaging (MRI) of the breast will be performed.

        -  Surgery to remove the tumor will occur at least three weeks after the last dose of
           cisplatin and is considered standard of care.

        -  Postoperative chemotherapy will begin at least three weeks after surgery. Everyone on
           the research study will receive four 2-week cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
           plus bevacizumab. After the 8 weeks, the doctor will decide which of the following two
           treatment regimens the participant will receive: Bevacizumab for four 2-week cycles
           (once every two weeks) or; Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab for four 2-week cycles (once
           every two weeks).

        -  At the end of the postoperative chemotherapy, the participant will return to the clinic
           for a medical history, physical exam, vital signs, performance status, routine blood
           tests, multiple gated acquisition scan (MUGA) or Echocardiogram Scans, and a hearing
           test.

A Miller-Payne (MP) score of 3 indicates a decrease in the size of the cancer by 30% to 90%. A MP score of 4 indicates marked decrease in the size of the cancer by greater than 90%. A MP score of 5 indicates there is no residual cancer remaining (the same as a pathologic complete response).</description>
