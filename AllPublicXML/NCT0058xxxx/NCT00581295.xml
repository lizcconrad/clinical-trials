  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma remains the leading cause of death and disability for Americans age 1-44. Trauma can
      cause internal bleeding, and this bleeding is often hard to detect without sophisticate tests
      that take time to complete and analyze.

      In addition, internal bleeding, including bleeding into the lung and chest cavity, as well as
      other blood loss, happens in many critically ill patients. For example, for hemorrhage, it is
      very difficult to detect active hemorrhage and to determine optimal rates of fluid and blood
      resuscitation.

      Diffuse optical spectroscopy has the potential to accurately assess adequacy of tissue
      perfusion, oxygenation, tissue oxygen extraction, and cytochrome oxidation states that may be
      critical to optimal treatment, end- organ preservation, and survival.

      The research' want to monitor tissue perfusion and indicators of tissue damage and viability
      in critically ill patients by using DOS.

      Non-invasive Optical Techniques DOS,near-infrared diffuse optical spectroscopy (NIR-DOS.

      NIR-DOS provides functional physiologic tissue/organ information without ionizing radiation
      and without withdrawing any blood, in a cost-effective and rapid manner. The application of
      frequency-domain photon migration analysis (FDPM) to NIRS allows independent measurements of
      tissue absorption and scattering properties at depths of 1 cm or more below the skin surface.

      Such capabilities will improve early diagnosis, detection, optimization of therapy,
      assessment of adequacy of resuscitation, and alteration in management plans for all of these
      critical conditions.
