  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intravesical treatment of bladder cancer with Abraxane is more desirable than other
      taxanes due to its ability to be diluted in water and not lipid-based solutions allowing it
      greater access to sites in the bladder. Thus, we are interested in investigating Abraxane's
      safety, toxicity, and efficacy profile for the treatment of recurrent transitional cell
      cancer of the urinary bladder in a combined phase I &amp; II trial. The phase I trial is designed
      as a dose-escalation study with cohorts of threes that will enroll a maximum of 18 patients.
      Dose increases will occur in groups of three patients, with each successive group receiving
      an increased concentration of Abraxane intravesically. No dose increase will occur until each
      member of the previous cohort has undergone the first instillation of the medication without
      experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Any patient who experiences a DLT will be
      removed from the trial and treated appropriately.

      If one patient in the cohort experiences a DLT an additional three patients will be enrolled
      and treated at that dose-level. If none of the additional three patients experience a DLT,
      the next group of patients will be started on the next higher dose level.

      If at any dose level, two or more patients experience a DLT the previous dose level will be
      considered as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An additional three patients (for a total of
      six patients) will then be treated at the MTD. If less than two patients experience a DLT
      this dose level will be established as the MTD. The phase II aspect is designed in a Simon II
      stage format in which to satisfy our study powering, the first stage there will be 10
      patients enrolled. If there are 2 or more successful treatments in that group (negative urine
      cytology and bladder biopsy after 6 months), then the first stage will pass the rejection
      rule, and up to another 19 patients will be enrolled. If at any point in the study, there
      have been a total of 6 or more successes, then the phase II aspect will be considered a
      successful trial and the study will be completed at that point.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary
             bladder confirmed at the study institution. The patient must have demonstrated
             superficial recurrent bladder cancer refractory to standard intravesical therapy. This
             will include stage Ta, T1, Tis and exclude all patients with muscle invasion (T2). All
             patients with stage Ta will require documentation of high-grade histology. All grossly
             visible disease must be fully resected and pathologic stage will be confirmed at the
             institution where the patient is enrolled. Patients must exhibit disease recurrence
