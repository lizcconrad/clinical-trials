  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study about why some people have certain types of proteins in their blood, called
      anti-phospholipid antibodies. The presence of these antibodies and associated complications
      (e.g. blood clots) are known to change over time. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      these changes and improve our ability to determine the long-term outcome of affected
      individuals.

      Aim:

        1. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for aquiring aPL in a cohort of aPL-negative
           pediatric SLE subjects.

        2. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for developing a first APS-associated
           complication among SLE subjects with detectable aPL.

        3. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for developing a second APS-associated event
           among subjects with a history of an APS-associated event.

        4. Determine the incidence, and time frame, for developing SLE among subjects with a
           history of an APS-associated event in the absence of SLE.

        5. Identify laboratory and clinical predictors for the events described in aims
           1-4.Research Design and Methods:

      This is a prospective cohort study to determine the risk of developing aPL or APS-related
      symptoms in a young group of SLE and APS subjects. Patients will be followed over a ten year
      period and will undergo annual serologic and clinical evaluations to identify disease
      progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Age: Less than 21 years at baseline exam

          -  Diagnosis: patients must meet criteria for one of five diagnostic categories based on
             classification according to three parameters; aPL positivity, APS criteria, and SLE
             criteria.

        The five diagnostic categories are:

          -  SLE with no aPL

          -  SLE with aPL, but without manifestations of APS

          -  SLE-like APS

          -  SLE with APS

          -  Primary APS.
