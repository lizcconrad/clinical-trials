  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI imaging makes it
      possible to distinguish benign conditions of the breast from malignant tumors and provide
      better information than can be obtained with regular MRI. DCE MRI uses a new way of
      collecting and analyzing the images or pictures which provides doctors extra information not
      available with standard imaging methods. This includes information about the blood vessels of
      different breast diseases. Pictures produced this way look just like the regular MRI
      pictures. The DCE MRI adds another imaging sequence (another scan) to the MRI examination
      ordered by your physician to evaluate your breast lesion, thus increasing the exam time
      (extra 10 min). The information gained from doing the new test, the DCE MRI, will not be used
      in your treatment and will not affect the type of care you receive for your breast lesions.

      Our aim is to perform dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI on 150 patients during their
      routine breast MRI examination at MSKCC. This will add extra 10 min scanning time to the
      routine examination. High resolution (submillimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic
      quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular
      volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE MRI data. These results will be correlated
      with pathology to determine new pharmacokinetic threshold so that the negative predictive
      value for benign lesions is close to 100%. The improvement in diagnostic specificity may help
      to reduce unnecessary biopsies in the future.

    <description>With an IV catheter in place, the patient will lie prone on the MRI scanner table with the breasts positioned in the commercial breast coil and then be moved feet first to the center of the MRI scanner. The only difference introduced by the addition of DCE MRI is that before the patient is moved into the scanner for the first time, the IV catheter will be hooked up with a programmable power injector (Medrad, Indianola, PA) which is loaded with Gd contrast and saline. The contrast injection and saline flush will be delivered by the injector while the patient is inside the scanner and the DCE MRI data collection is in process. The Gd contrast dose used for DCE MRI is the same as for clinical MRI: 0.1 mmol/kg. The injection speed of 2 mL/sec is safe and similar to that of manual injection.</description>

        Participants will be selected at the time of the MRI interventional procedure by the
        radiologist who is protocoling the MRI examinations and who is an investigator on this
        protocol. Any known breast lesion, benign or malignant, will be appropriate for evaluation
        with DCE MRI. Pathology results will be obtained for each patient as a result of surgery or
        MRI guided biopsy, allowing correlation between the pathology and DCE MRI data.
