    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the preliminary efficacy of 3.0 mg of guanfacine (GFC) daily versus
      placebo in cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individuals. This proposal is a laboratory and
      treatment outcome study to examine the effects of guanfacine on brief exposure to stress,
      drug cues and neutral situations on cocaine/alcohol craving, mood and neurobiological
      reactivity in a sample of cocaine and/or alcohol dependent individuals. Guanfacine will be
      beneficial for reduction in stress and drug cue induced craving and related arousal. In a
      sample of 60 cocaine and/or alcohol dependent men and women, we propose to examine (a)
      differences in measures of cocaine craving, emotion state, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      (HPA) activation, physiological arousal and plasma catecholamine response to stress imagery
      and to drug cue imagery as compared to neutral imagery; (b) reduction in cocaine/alcohol
      abstinence symptoms; and (c) improvement in cocaine and alcohol treatment outcomes as
      measured by increasing abstinence, reduction in cocaine/alcohol use and increased treatment
      attendance. Hypothesis 1: Guanfacine will decrease stress-induced cocaine craving, negative
      emotions and related arousal in the laboratory as compared to placebo. Hypothesis 2a: As
      compared to the PLA group, the GFC group will show significant reductions in protracted
      withdrawal symptoms as measured by the CSSA/CIWA during the 9-week treatment period.

      Hypothesis 2b: As compared to the PLA group, a higher percentage of the GFC patients will
      remain abstinent during the 9-week treatment period with a higher percent of negative cocaine
      urines and alcohol-free days.

      Hypothesis 2c: The GFC group will show greater adherence to treatment as measured by the days
      in treatment as compared to the Pla group.
