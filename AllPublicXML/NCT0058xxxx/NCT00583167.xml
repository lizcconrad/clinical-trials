      Understanding whether or not viral replication occurs in the brain during chronic untreated
      HIV-1 infection is of undeniable importance, and has implications for treatment and research
      priorities. Evidence suggests that viral replication in the CNS occurs at the extremes of
      HIV-1 disease. Brain involvement has been reported during acute infection, and there is
      convincing evidence of CNS viral replication during HIV-associated dementia (HAD) and
      advanced AIDS. Some human and primate data suggest that viral RNA and proteins may be absent
      from brains of some individuals with chronic untreated HIV-1 infection despite abundant
      proviral DNA. However, the extent of viral replication in the brain is not known for most of
      the 42 million people worldwide living with untreated HIV-1 infection.

      Why is viral replication in the brain such a pivotal issue? Microglial cells and macrophages
      are primary targets for intrathecal HIV-1 replication, and this can promote neuronal injury
      through direct effects of gp120 and tat, and indirect induction of toxic mediators. Low-grade
      injury over years or decades would likely be deleterious, particularly as the population
      ages. Because treatment guidelines allow systemic HIV-1 replication to continue until CD4+ T
      cell counts decline considerably, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not recommended for many
      persons living with HIV. Demonstrating replication in the brain during chronic HIV-1
      infection may affect treatment strategies and encourage investigation.

      Identifying factors that modulate intrathecal viral replication is equally important.
      Anti-HIV-1 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) partially control systemic viral replication and
      delay disease progression. Although available data has been provocative, the role of anti-HIV
      CTL in the CNS has received little attention. To fill this gap we will examine relationships
      between intrathecal viral replication, CTL responses, and glial activation/proliferation
      during HIV-1 infection. These studies will be relevant not only to AIDS but to other
      inflammatory diseases of the CNS as well.
