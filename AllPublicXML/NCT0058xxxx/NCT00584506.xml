      A retrospective review to assess the performance and clinical predictive value of a novel
      software program (Maxillo) designed to perform complex volumetric analysis with application
      in the field of orbital trauma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of open reduction and internal fixation of large and complex traumatic orbital
      deformities is well established. It is known that successful orbital reconstruction hinges
      upon restoration of native orbital volume in order to establish pre-morbid function and avoid
      long-term complications. To date, a facile, reliable, and reproducible method to measure
      orbital volume has not been rendered, despite numerous approaches. The objective of this
      study is to assess the performance and clinical predictive value of a novel software program
      designed to perform complex volumetric analysis with application in the field of orbital
      trauma.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with complex maxillofacial and orbital trauma that underwent operative repair of
        orbital fractures. Computer tomography scans from a cohort of patients with normal CT data
        sets will also be collected to assess &quot;normative&quot; orbital volumes.
