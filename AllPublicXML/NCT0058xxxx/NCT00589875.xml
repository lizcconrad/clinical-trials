  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Gene Mediated
      Cytotoxic Immunotherapy for malignant gliomas. The approach used an adenoviral vector
      (disabled virus) engineered to express the Herpes thymidine kinase gene (aglatimagene
      besadenovec, AdV-tk), followed by an antiherpetic prodrug, valacyclovir. The AdV-tk vector
      was injected into the resection bed after standard tumor surgery and valacyclovir pills were
      taken for 14 days. Standard radiation and chemotherapy were administered which have been
      shown to work cooperatively with AdV-tk + prodrug to kill tumor cells. The hypothesis is that
      this combination therapy can be safely delivered and will lead to improvement in the clinical
      outcome for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma
      multiforme (WHO grade IV) and anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients had resectable or partially resectable malignant glioma and received injection of
      AdV-tk into remaining tumor or tumor bed after resection. Pathologic confirmation of
      malignant glioma must be made prior to AdV-tk injection; if this was not possible, the
      injection was not performed and the subject was no longer eligible for the study. The oral
      prodrug, valacyclovir, started 1-3 days after AdV-tk injection and continued for 14 days.
      Standard radiotherapy began on average 7 days after AdV-tk injection for the up-front course.
      Patients received temozolomide as per standard of care after completion of prodrug.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have presumed resectable or partially resectable malignant glioma based on
             clinical and radiologic evaluation (pathologic confirmation of malignant glioma must
             be made at the time of surgery if not previously determined). Patients who have
             previously received AdV-tk + prodrug on this study may receive an additional AdV-tk +
             prodrug course at recurrence if eligibility criteria are still met.

          -  Tumor must be accessible for injection and must not be located in the brainstem,
             midbrain, contained within the ventricular system, or located in an infratentorial
             location.

          -  Must be planning to undergo standard radiation therapy.

          -  Performance status KPS 70 or more.

          -  SGOT (AST) &lt; 3x upper limit of normal.
