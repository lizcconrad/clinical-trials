    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out the toxicities of doxercalciferol given in
      combination with docetaxel (TaxotereÂ®), as well as to see how well this combination works in
      the treatment of prostate cancer.

      This is a multi-institutional, double-blinded, randomized study comparing docetaxel plus
      doxercalciferol versus docetaxel plus placebo in patients with metastatic hormone refractory
      prostate cancer. Docetaxel is given intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 for every 28 day cycle
      and doxercalciferol or placebo is taken orally every day of the 28 day cycle. Please refer to
      the Eligibility Criteria below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

               1. At least one new lesion on bone scan,

               2. Increase in size or number of measurable disease lesions,

               3. At least 2 rising PSA measurements at least two weeks apart.

          -  Prior bilateral orchiectomy or on LHRH agonist therapy with a serum testosterone level
             of &lt; 50.

          -  Must be off flutamide, nilutamide, or ketoconazole or herbal supplements used to treat
             prostate cancer at least 4 weeks prior to registration and bicalutamide at least 6
