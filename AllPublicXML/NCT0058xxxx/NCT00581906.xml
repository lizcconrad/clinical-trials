  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic study that makes pictures of organs of the
      body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses that can not be felt. Dynamic contrast
      enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) uses faster imaging and contrast material (a
      substance used to make specific organs, blood vessels, or tumors easier to see) that is given
      by vein. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) allows to measure the motion
      of water around the cells in the tumor. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) obtains
      chemical information from the tumor. During MRS, signals are detected from the chemicals
      (spectroscopy) naturally present in your tumor using radio waves. DCE-MRI, DW-MRI and MRS
      give extra information which is not available with the regular MRI. The regular MRI only
      shows pictures of the tumor while the DCE-MRI also gives information about the blood vessels
      of the tumor. DW-MRI provides information related to the state of the tumor tissue with
      regards to the quality or condition of cells present in it and MRS gives information about
      the chemical makeup of the tumor.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether DCE-MRI, DW-MRI and MRS done before treatment can
      predict which patients will do well with either surgery or chemo-radiation therapy. This
      study will also see if DCE-MRI, DW-MRI and MRS done early in treatment can tell if the
      therapy is working.

    <description>Pts undergo DCE-MRI, DW-MRI or 1^H-MRS studies on either the 1.5T scanner or the 3T MRI scanners. Patients will be grouped based on their treatment: group one will include pts who undergo surgery (we will no longer accrue pts in this group) &amp; group two will include pts who undergo chemoradiation therapy.Pts who undergo surgery will have pretreatment DCE-MRI, DW-MRI &amp;/or 1H-MRS studies on the GE 1.5T or 3T MRI scanner. Pts who participate in chemo-radiation therapy protocols will have pretreatment DCE-MRI, DW-MRI &amp;/or 1H-MRS studies on the 3T Philips MRI scanner in the radiation oncology suite &amp; will undergo additional recommended weekly DW-MRI including IVIM studies at the same MRI scanner during the course of treatment. Pts will undergo two recommended DCE-MRI studies (unless contraindicated) when possible. 1st intra-treatment DCE-MRI is recommended between the 1st &amp; 2nd weeks of treatment &amp; the 2nd intra-treatment DCE-MRI is recommended between the 3rd &amp; 4th weeks of treatment.</description>
