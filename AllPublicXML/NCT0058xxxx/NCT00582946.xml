  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to design and build a new hearing aid system, which mitigates the most common
      complaints that hearing aid users have. These include hearing in multi-talker situations,
      poor sound quality, unwanted whistling resulting from feedback, and a dislike of the sound of
      their own voice. Current efforts, with limited success, use signal processing methods rather
      than restoring more closely the normal auditory function. We plan to achieve our goal by
      reducing to practice three key enabling concepts. The first is to replace the current
      acoustic transducer with a non-acoustic mechanical output transducer that directly actuates
      the tympanic membrane (TM). This transducer, called the EarLens, floats on the tympanic
      membrane in a manner similar to the way a contract lens floats on the eye. The second is to
      increase the output bandwidth of the hearing aid. The third key concept is to place a
      wide-bandwidth microphone in the ear canal to capture the pinna diffraction cues similarly to
      the way the normal ear functions. Our central hypothesis is that a hearing aid that delivers
      amplified wide-bandwidth mechanical stimuli, directionally dependent cues, in an open canal
      configuration will perform better than conventional hearing aids when there are competing
      talkers in the background. First phase includes verification the capability of the system to
      deliver sufficient maximum equivalent pressure output (MEPO) to treat the degree of hearing
      loss in the target fitting range.

    <description>A primary outcome measure of interest is an estimate of the insitu maximum equivalent pressure output (MEPO) of the EarLens system, which represents the sound pressure level that would have to be applied at the eardrum (or tympanic membrane) to produce the same degree of tympanic membrane (TM) vibration that the EarLens system produces with the coil current set to its maximum value, and given the anatomical constraints on the coupling between the coil and magnet for a given subject. The target fitting range included hearing loss up to 60 decibels (dB) Hearing Level (HL). In order for the device to be an effective hearing aid for this target population, the maximum output of the device needs to be able to provide output and gain to treat this maximum hearing loss.</description>
