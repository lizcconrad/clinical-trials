    <textblock>
      A non-invasive urinary test that detects kidney injuries in liver transplant (LT) candidates
      would be useful for monitoring of kidney damage. Particularly, the ability to predict
      irreversibility of such renal damage or progressive nature of renal disease in LT candidates
      would be of importance to determine the need for dual kidney-liver transplantation (KLT)
      versus LT alone. We will correlate kidney histology with cytokine/chemokine profile
      expression in the urine as a potentially useful noninvasive diagnostic tool.
