  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate low oxygen areas called hypoxia within the tumor.
      These low oxygen areas are thought to be the reason why tumors are more resistant to
      radiation treatment. A tracer is an extremely small quantity of a substance. Tracer to which
      radioactivity has been attached may be used to &quot;trace&quot; events in the body. A tracer called
      iodo-azomycin galactopyranoside (or *IAZGP) appears to be able to detect low oxygen areas
      within tumor.

      Radioactive iodine in this molecule can be detected by an imaging technique called a PET
      scan. This present study involves obtaining three scans using this new imaging technique. The
      goal of carrying out many scans is to determine which scan will best show any areas in your
      tumor that may have low levels of oxygen.

    <description>You will receive the radioactive tracer through an injection in your vein. Blood (about 5 tablespoons in all) will be taken after the radioactive tracer has been given. Over the course of study day 1, bloods will be drawn 8 times and then 4 more times on study day 2. You will undergo three *IAZGP PET scans, one shortly after you receive the injection, one later the same day and one the following day. Each scan will take about an hour. This means you would be asked to come back 2 days in a row.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have locally advanced cancer as determined by currently accepted
             diagnostic work-up, including CT/MR/US.

          -  KPS &gt;70%.

          -  Patients must be &gt; or equal to 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they fulfill any of the following
             criteria:

          -  Patients with abnormal baseline thyroid function tests, or any thyroid disorder
             including but not limited to hypothyroidism and thyroiditis. Patients with thyroid
             cancer who have had a thyroidectomy are not excluded.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.
