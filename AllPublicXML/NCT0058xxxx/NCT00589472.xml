    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy and vorinostat followed by
      radical prostatectomy works in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not spread to
      other parts of the body. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone
      therapy, such as bicalutamide, goserelin acetate, and leuprolide acetate, may lessen the
      amount of androgens made by the body. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving androgen deprivation therapy and
      vorinostat before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue
      that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of pathologic complete response in patients with localized prostate
      cancer treated with androgen depletion therapy (ADT) and oral vorinostat administered for a
      minimum of 6 weeks and maximum of 8 weeks before radical prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine and evaluate pre- and post-treatment levels of prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA), testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and
      dehydroepiandrosterone-dulfate (DHEA-S) in blood.

      II. To determine and evaluate pre- and post-treatment levels of testosterone,
      androstenedione, androstenediol, DHT, DHEA, and DHEA-S in prostate.

      III. To determine and evaluate gene and protein expression analysis including androgen
      receptor (AR) target genes, PSA and TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2), in
      pre-treatment biopsy and post-treatment radical prostatectomy.

      IV. To determine and evaluate exploratory gene microarray analysis. V. To determine and
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ADT in combination with vorinostat (SAHA) as assessed
      by physical examinations, adverse events, and laboratory assessments.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bicalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 1 month and leuprolide acetate
      intramuscularly (IM) or goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) once a month until surgery.
      Patients also receive vorinostat PO QD beginning on the first day of androgen depletion
      therapy and continuing for up to 8 weeks or until the day of surgery. Patients then undergo
      an open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Patients with positive surgical margins
      undergo immediate adjuvant external beam radiotherapy to the prostatic fossa, based on the
      judgment of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 1 year.

    <measure>Pathologic Complete Response at the Time of Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be pathologic complete response at the time of surgery. This represents the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease in the prostate (ie, the absence of tumor in the posttherapy pathology specimen) at the time of radical prostatectomy. Pathologic complete response at the time of surgery is the primary endpoint for this study. A Simon 2-stage optimal design that differentiates between response probabilities of 0.05 and 0.20 will be used in the analysis of the pathological complete response at 12 weeks (Type I error 10% and power 90%). A maximum of 38 pts were planned for accrual onto this study. If zero or one response was observed, then the trial was to be stopped. The design had power 0.90 for a population response proportion to 0.20 using a one-sided 0.10 size test. pT2 indicates that the cancer is confined to the prostate, while pT3 indicates that there is an extraprostatic extension of the cancer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gleason Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A Gleason score is the sum of two numbers. Pathologist determines where the cancer is most prominent and assigns the primary grade, the secondary grade is assigned based on where the cancer is next most prominent. A score from one to five is assigned for each area based on how aggressive the tumor appears. A tumor with cell that appear close to normal is assigned a low Gleason score (six or below). A tumor with cells that appear clearly different from those of a normal prostate is assigned a high Gleason score (seven or above). A system of grading prostate cancer tissue based on how it looks under a microscope. Gleason scores range from 2 to 10 and indicate how likely it is that a tumor will spread. A low Gleason score means the cancer tissue is similar to normal prostate tissue and the tumor is less likely to spread; a high Gleason score means the cancer tissue is very different from normal and the tumor is more likely to spread.</description>

        <title>Pathologic Complete Response at the Time of Surgery</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint will be pathologic complete response at the time of surgery. This represents the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease in the prostate (ie, the absence of tumor in the posttherapy pathology specimen) at the time of radical prostatectomy. Pathologic complete response at the time of surgery is the primary endpoint for this study. A Simon 2-stage optimal design that differentiates between response probabilities of 0.05 and 0.20 will be used in the analysis of the pathological complete response at 12 weeks (Type I error 10% and power 90%). A maximum of 38 pts were planned for accrual onto this study. If zero or one response was observed, then the trial was to be stopped. The design had power 0.90 for a population response proportion to 0.20 using a one-sided 0.10 size test. pT2 indicates that the cancer is confined to the prostate, while pT3 indicates that there is an extraprostatic extension of the cancer.</description>

        <title>Gleason Score</title>
        <description>A Gleason score is the sum of two numbers. Pathologist determines where the cancer is most prominent and assigns the primary grade, the secondary grade is assigned based on where the cancer is next most prominent. A score from one to five is assigned for each area based on how aggressive the tumor appears. A tumor with cell that appear close to normal is assigned a low Gleason score (six or below). A tumor with cells that appear clearly different from those of a normal prostate is assigned a high Gleason score (seven or above). A system of grading prostate cancer tissue based on how it looks under a microscope. Gleason scores range from 2 to 10 and indicate how likely it is that a tumor will spread. A low Gleason score means the cancer tissue is similar to normal prostate tissue and the tumor is less likely to spread; a high Gleason score means the cancer tissue is very different from normal and the tumor is more likely to spread.</description>

            <description>Patients receive bicalutamide PO QD for 1 month and leuprolide acetate IM or goserelin acetate SC once a month until surgery. Patients also receive vorinostat PO QD beginning on the first day of androgen depletion therapy and continuing for up to 8 weeks or until the day of surgery. Patients then undergo an open or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Patients with positive surgical margins undergo immediate adjuvant external beam radiotherapy to the prostatic fossa, based on the judgment of the treating physician.
