  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to test the value of embryoscopy in women with missed abortions after
      recurrent miscarriages (at least two previous miscarriages) in the past. This project will
      assess two functions of embryoscopy:-

        1. Whether embryoscopy allows the diagnosis of structural anomalies (disorganized embryos).
           This is a fetal cause of embryo loss which cannot be diagnosed by other means.

        2. Whether embryoscopy allows an accurate biopsy of embryonic tissue for karyotyping.

      However, it may be that embryoscopy will be found to have no advantage.

    <textblock>
      In this project, embryoscopy will be evaluated in women with missed abortions (pregnancies
      which have ceased developing and in which the embryo is dead), after at least two previous
      (recurrent) miscarriages. The procedure will have two main purposes:- To allow the diagnosis
      of structural anomalies (disorganized embryos), and to allow an accurate biopsy of embryonic
      tissue for karyotyping. Hence, this procedure will lead to a more accurate diagnosis of the
      cause of recurrent miscarriage.

      After confirmation of missed abortion by ultrasound, dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) is
      normally performed under general anesthetic to evacuate the uterus in missed abortions. In
      this project embryoscopy will be added to the standard D&amp;C. An 8mm hysteroscope with
      irrigation channel and 300 view will be used with continuous saline flow. The embryo will be
      visualized, and the findings recorded. Biopsies will be taken for chromosomal analysis from
      the embryo and the placental villi. Embryoscopy will be performed with a hysteroscope which
      is in normal clinical use for investigating the uterine cavity, but for a slightly different
      indication.

      The first stage will be a pilot study on 20 patients to judge the value of embryoscopy.

    <description>Embryoscopy will be evaluated in women with at least two previous miscarriages, after confirmation of missed abortion by ultrasound. Embryoscopy will only be performed in patients in whom curettage is clinically indicated, and will only be added to the D&amp;C if there is a possibility of visualizing embryonic tissue, i:e. from approximately 5½ weeks onwards when there is an embryonic pole detected on ultrasound.</description>
