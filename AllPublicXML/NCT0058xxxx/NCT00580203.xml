  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a protocol to collect tissues, blood, and other specimens from patients with
      malignant or nonmalignant diseases of the head and neck. Collected specimens will be used in
      laboratory studies to investigate the growth, development, and transformation of normal and
      abnormal cells in the future.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with head and neck diseases are eligible if they have had tissue, serum,

          -  Patients will be entered onto this protocol without preference for any racial or
             ethnic group.

          -  Patients may have received prior chemotherapy, radiation, surgical therapy,
             immunotherapy, or differentiation therapy.

          -  The specimen collected must be large enough to allow conventional testing necessary
             for patient care, with the portion of the specimen reserved for research laboratory
             analysis excised from residual tissue that would otherwise have been discarded.
