  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain greater understanding of the problems breast cancer
      survivors experience related to difficulty sleeping and insomnia. Poor sleep can affect a
      person's mood, increase feelings of fatigue, as well as pain. A greater knowledge and
      understanding of sleep disturbances can lead to more effective treatment of sleep problems
      and significantly improve quality of life.

      Individuals who consent to participate in this study will be asked to complete a battery of
      questionnaires that will take approximately 1 hour. Based on answers they give to the
      questionnaires, 45 patients will be asked to participate in a sleep study done at a sleep
      lab.

      If you choose to take part, then you will be asked to do the following:

      Spend approximately 1 hour answering questionnaires either at the breast cancer center with a
      research assistant, at home on the phone with a research assistant, or by completing the
      questionnaires at home and returning them by mail. You will only be asked to complete
      questionnaires one time. The questionnaires will ask you questions about your:

        -  Past medical history

        -  Demographics

        -  Sleep quality

        -  Sleep habits

        -  Energy level, pain, daytime sedation

        -  Quality of life

        -  Menopausal symptoms

        -  Depression

        -  Fears

      If you are then selected to participate in the sleep study, further information will be
      provided for you.

      After you are finished with the questionnaires, the research assistant will provide you with
      any necessary further information and feedback. The research assistant will also be able to
      put you in contact with a study doctor should you require any further assistance. After you
      are finished with the study, the study doctor may contact you for clarification of your
      answer on a question, or for an answer if you have by any chance missed a question.
