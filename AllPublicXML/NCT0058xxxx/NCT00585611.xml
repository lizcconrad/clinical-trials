      The study is designed to define the underlying vascular abnormalities present in patients
      with diastolic heart failure and test the effect of a therapy aimed at vascular
      abnormalities. This study is designed to investigate the effects of therapy with atorvastatin
      in subjects with diastolic heart failure to improve abnormalities of vascular and myocardial
      structure and function, with particular emphasis on arterial stiffness and endothelial
      dysfunction.

      Forty subjects will be given either drug (atorvastatin 40 mg) or placebo in a randomized
      fashion once daily for six months. Using echocardiography, tonometry, and flow mediated
      dilation of conduit arteries and arterioles, baseline cardiovascular anatomy and physiology
      will be defined. Subjects that enroll in the study will be required to come in for 5 study
      visits. The initial visit is a screening visit; subject consent is obtained and an
      echocardiogram is performed as well as blood tests. At the randomization visit (4-14 days
      following screening), the subject will be provided with drug or placebo in a blinded
      fashion.Also at this visit, subjects will be asked to do a 6 minute walk, QOL questionnaire,
      and vascular function testing. There will be follow-up study visits at 1 and 3 months
      following randomization. At each follow-up visit a medical history, pill count and brief
      physical examination will be performed, a repeat QOL questionnaire administered, and blood
      tests to assess safety of the statin therapy. At 6 months, the final study visit will occur.
      At this visit a full history and detailed physical examination will be performed. Repeat
      echocardiogram, 6 minute walk test, QOL questionnaire, and vascular function examinations
      will be performed.
