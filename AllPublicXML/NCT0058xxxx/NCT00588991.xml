    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given
      together with topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin in treating patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, high-risk myelodysplasia, or aggressive
      myeloproliferative disorders. Veliparib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan
      hydrochloride and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving veliparib together with
      topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility, tolerability, and toxicities of ABT-888 (veliparib) when
      administered alone and in combination with topotecan hydrochloride with or without
      carboplatin in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, high-risk myelodysplasia,
      or aggressive myeloproliferative disorders.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ABT-888 when administered with topotecan
      hydrochloride and carboplatin in these patients.

      III. To determine if ABT-888 when administered with topotecan hydrochloride and carboplatin
      can induce clinical responses in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 when administered alone and in combination
      with topotecan hydrochloride with or without carboplatin in these patients.

      II. To obtain pharmacodynamic data regarding the ability of ABT-888 to inhibit poly
      (ADP-ribose) levels in leukemic blasts.

      III. To obtain descriptive data regarding the mutational status and/or methylation status of
      key genes in selected DNA repair pathways (Fanconi complementation groups A-F, Blooms, and
      ataxia-telangiectasia) in leukemic blasts.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally twice daily on days 1-8, 1-14, or 1-21 and topotecan
      hydrochloride with or without carboplatin IV continuously over 120 hours on days 3-7.
      Treatment repeats every 28-63 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.

    <description>Relevant individual PK parameters will be estimated using non-compartmental PK methods. PK parameters will be compared when administered alone or in combination by a paired student's t-test. Comparison of PK parameters among dose levels will be performed using non-parametric statistical methods for K-independent samples. Associations between exposure parameters (Cmax and AUC) and pharmacodynamic endpoints (cellular PAR levels, mutation and/or altered expression of selected DNA repair genes) will be assessed using the appropriate non-parametric statistical tests.</description>
