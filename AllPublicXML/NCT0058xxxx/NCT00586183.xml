      Our hypothesis is that altered cardiac sympathetic activity is present and may contribute to
      the myocardial stunning observed in the apical ballooning syndrome.

      Aim: Assess the extent and reversibility of cardiac adrenergic neuronal dysfunction using
      carbon-11 hydroxyephedrine (C-11 HED), a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, in
      patients with the apical ballooning syndrome.

      General methods: Five patients will undergo PET scans within a few days of or during the
      initial hospital admission for apical ballooning syndrome and during follow-up at 4 to 6
      weeks to evaluate regional perfusion using N-13 ammonia and cardiac sympathetic activity with
      C-11 HED.

      PET scanning protocol On the morning of the study, patients will arrive at the Mayo Clinic
      PET Imaging Center in a fasting state. The use of medications will be ascertained and
      recorded. An intravenous cannula will be placed in each arm. The subject will then be
      positioned in the PET scanner . After optimal positioning of the left ventricle within the
      field of view, a transmission scan will be performed with either a germanium-68 or CT source
      for subsequent attenuation correction. The PET scanning sequence is outlined below. Because
      11C-HED uptake is dependent on flow characteristics, a flow study will be performed using
      N-13 ammonia. N-13 ammonia (10 to 20 mCi) will be injected over 20 seconds, and dynamic
      acquisition will be performed for 20 minutes with the following sequence:16 frames at 3
      seconds, 10 frames at 12 seconds, and 2 frames at 240 seconds. Following a 50-minute period
      of N-13 ammonia decay, 11C-HED (20mCi) will be injected over 30 seconds, and a dynamic
      acquisition will be performed with the following sequence: 6 frames at 30 seconds, 2 frames
      at 60 seconds, 2 frames at 150 seconds, 2 frames at 300 seconds, 2 frames at 600 seconds, and
      1 frames at 1,200 seconds. To correct for 11C-metabolites in the blood activity, venous
      samples will be drawn at 0, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes (total ~25 ml of blood) after
      the injection of C-11 HED. Heart rate, systemic blood pressure, and a 12-lead
      electrocardiogram will be obtained noninvasively with each peak isotope activity.
