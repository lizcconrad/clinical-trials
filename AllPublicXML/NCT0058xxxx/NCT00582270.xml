      The purpose of this study is to determine if an infectious disease may be associated with the
      new lymphoma diagnosis.

      Infections to be tested include:

        1. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori): This is a bacteria sometimes found in the stomach that
           has been associated with a particular kind of lymphoma, gastric MALT. We are interested
           to learn if the H. pylori infection may be associated with other indolent lymphomas.

        2. Hepatitis C: This virus infection of the liver has been found in association with
           non-follicular lymphomas in Italy. We want to determine if the infection is associated
           with lymphomas in the United States.

        3. Bacterial overgrowth of the small bowel: Since indolent lymphomas often affect the lymph
           nodes surrounding the small bowel, it may be possible that an infection within the bowel
           is stimulating lymphoma growth. This has never been demonstrated to date, and will be
           studied in this clinical study.

        4. Epstein-Barr virus: This is the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis or &quot;mono.&quot; It
           has been associated with other rapidly growing lymphomas, but not indolent lymphoma.

      This is a prospective observational clinical study of possible infectious disease-associated
      antigen drive in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphoma (follicular and
      nonfollicular cohorts).

      Eligible patients with a new diagnosis of indolent lymphoma will be enrolled after informed
      consent. All patients will be tested for possible known infectious diseases that may
      contribute to antigen drive (H. Pylori; Hepatitis C), as well as for other infectious
      diseases not yet established as contributing to antigen drive (Borrelia; Chlamydia; and small
      bowel overgrowth). All patients will have a complete history recorded regarding other
      possible chronic infections, and an infectious disease consultation, as indicated.

      Patients with positive antigen-drive infectious disease studies will be treated as indicated
      with standard antibiotic regimens and response (both infectious disease as well as lymphoma
      status)will be documented and recorded.

      The primary objective of this study is (1) to evaluate the possible association of infectious
      diseases in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphoma. The secondary objective of
      this study is to evaluate possible lymphoma response the in patients treated for positive
      infectious disease studies; and to evaluate EBV immune responses in these previously
      untreated patients.
