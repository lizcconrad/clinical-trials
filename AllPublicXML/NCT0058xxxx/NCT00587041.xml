  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of two probiotic preparations
      (Agri-King Synbiotic and Oxadrop) on urinary oxalate excretion in patients with mild
      hyperoxaluria. Probiotics are live microorganisms thought to be beneficial to the host
      organism. Hyperoxaluria is a hereditary disorder that causes a special kind of stone to form
      in the kidney and urine. Oxalates are naturally-occurring substances found in plants,
      animals, and in humans. Excretion of oxalates in the urine is a risk factor for kidney stone
      formation.

      Our hypothesis was that the mild hyperoxaluria is due to over absorption of oxalate from food
      and that probiotics will improve gastrointestinal barrier function to decrease oxalate
      absorption across the gut (and hence its elimination in the urine).

      In the study, participants were randomized to placebo, Agri-King Synbiotic, or Oxadrop, and
      were treated for 6 weeks. Patients were maintained on a controlled diet to remove the
      confounding variable of differing oxalate intake and availability from food.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal manifestations of chronic hyperoxaluria include nephrolithiasis and, when extreme,
      interstitial scarring and progressive loss of function. The clinical outcome can be dismal.
      Although primary hyperoxaluria is relatively rare, hyperoxaluria secondary to
      gastrointestinal malabsorption is not. Furthermore, the formation of calcium oxalate kidney
      stones is extremely common, and evidence suggests that minimal, perhaps transient elevations
      in urinary oxalate concentration may be an important factor in at least a subgroup of these
      patients with &quot;idiopathic&quot; calcium oxalate urolithiasis. In the case of enteric hyperoxaluria
      the pathogenic role of oxalate is clear, and renal scarring is commonly observed as a
      consequence of oxalate exposure and calcium oxalate crystal deposition, in addition to
      stones. Unfortunately, few satisfactory specific treatments for enteric hyperoxaluria are
      available. Typical strategies include dietary restriction of oxalate to limit its delivery to
      the colon; low fat diets to limit malabsorption and distal colonic effects of fatty acids and
      bile acids; oral calcium to bind oxalate; and bile acid sequestrants like cholestyramine. In
      its entirety, this regimen is quite rigorous for patients, and even if compliance is achieved
      the therapy is not always effective. Previous studies have shown that components of the
      endogenous digestive microflora can utilize oxalate, potentially limiting its absorption from
      the intestinal lumen. A recent preliminary study demonstrated that a preparation of lactic
      acid bacteria degraded oxalate in vitro and reduced urinary oxalate excretion when given by
      mouth. We have recently demonstrated that the same preparation of lactic acid bacilli
      (Oxadrop) can reduce urinary oxalate excretion in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. In the
      current proposal, in a placebo-controlled trial we will determine the effectiveness of this
      and another probiotic preparation (Agri-King Synbiotic) [AKSB] for the treatment of
      hyperoxaluria in patients with mild hyperoxaluria, as well as enteric hyperoxaluria.

      Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the effect of two probiotic preparations (AKSB and Oxadrop on
      urinary oxalate excretion in a well-defined group of patients with enteric hyperoxaluria; and
      2) Determine the effect of two probiotic preparations (AKSB and Oxadrop) on urinary oxalate
      excretion in a well-defined group of patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis
      and mild hyperoxaluria. If results are positive, treatment for calcium oxalate kidney stones
      could be revolutionized.

    <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate. Values for supersaturated ions are expressed in units of Gibbs free energy.</description>

        <title>Change in 24-hour Urinary Supersaturation for Calcium Oxalate</title>
        <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate. Values for supersaturated ions are expressed in units of Gibbs free energy.</description>
