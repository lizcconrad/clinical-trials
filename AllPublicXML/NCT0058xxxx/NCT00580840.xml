    <textblock>
      During the run-in period, CZP will be administered at 400 mg (2 injections) at Wks 0, 2, and
      4 and 200 mg with placebo (1 injection placebo, 1 injection CZP) at Wks 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and
      16. At Wk 18 patients will be grouped as responders or non-responders based on results of the
      ACR20 at Week 16.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with a stable methotrexate (MTX) dose enter the run-in period in which certolizumab
      pegol (CZP) will be administered at a dose of 400 mg (2 injections) at Weeks 0, 2, and 4 and
      at a dose of 200 mg with placebo (1 injection placebo, 1 injection CZP) at Weeks 6, 8, 10,
      12, 14 and 16. The dose of MTX should be stable for at least 2 months prior to the Baseline
      visit and will remain stable throughout the trial, unless there is a need to reduce the dose
      for reasons of toxicity.

      At the Week 18 visit, subjects who were ACR20 (American College of Rheumatology 20%
      Improvement) responders at Week 16 will be randomized in a double-blinded way to receive
      either 400 mg CZP given every 4 weeks and placebo given every 4 weeks given as two injections
      (alternating CZP and placebo every two weeks) plus MTX, 200 mg CZP and placebo administered
      every 2 weeks (one injection of each) plus MTX, or Placebo administered as two injections
      every 2 weeks plus MTX. Non-responders will be withdrawn from the study.

    <description>MCS norm-based scores are calculated based upon the following 8 domain scores, Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional and Mental Health, and range from -9 to 82, where 50 represents the normative value. A larger positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using an ANCOVA model on Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) data with factors treatment and Baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PAAP (Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain) at Week 34 in Patients Randomized at Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 34</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-VAS (0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, 0 being no pain and 100 being most severe pain) is computed as the value at Week 34 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using an ANCOVA model on Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) data with factors treatment and Baseline score.</description>

    <description>Change from Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-VAS (0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, 0 being no symptoms and 100 being severe symptoms) is computed as the value at Week 34 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.

    <measure>Median Time to Loss of ACR20 (American College of Rheumatology 20% Improvement) Response After Week 18 in Patients Randomized at Week 18.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 18 up to Week 34</time_frame>
    <description>ACR20 loss are subjects with &lt;20% improvement from Baseline for tender joint count, swollen joint count, and at least 3/5 core set measures: 1) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 2) C-reactive Protein, 3) Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale, 4) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale, 5) Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale at 2 consecutive visits. Subjects losing response for 2 consecutive visits are considered as having the event on the day of the visit where response was first lost.</description>

    <measure>Ratio From Baseline in ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) Level at Week 16 in All Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Ratio is defined as the ESR value at Week 16 divided by the ESR value at Baseline. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

    <measure>Ratio From Baseline in ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) Level at Week 34 in Patients Randomized at Week 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 34</time_frame>
    <description>Ratio is defined as the ESR value at Week 34 divided by the ESR value at Baseline. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method with an ANCOVA model on observed log transformed data with factors treatment and log transformed Baseline CRP level. The number presented is the geometric least squares mean with it's 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated using the tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Global Assessment of Arthritis where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.

        <title>Change From Baseline in SDAI (Simplified Disease Activity Index) at Week 16 in All Patients</title>
        <description>SDAI is calculated as the sum of tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), C-reactive protein (CRP in mg/dL), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in cm), and Investigator’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in cm). 28 joints are examined where a lower score indicates less disease activity. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) Score at Week 16 in All Patients</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Thus, the mean also has a range from 0-3. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 16 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method.</description>

        <description>DAS28-ESR is calculated using the tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Global Assessment of Arthritis where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity.

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) Score at Week 34 in Patients Randomized at Week 18</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is derived based on the mean of individual scores in 8 categories of daily living actives (using 20 questions). Each question is scored 0-3 (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, and 3 = unable to do). Thus, the mean also has a range from 0-3. Change from baseline is computed as the value at Week 34 minus the baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using an ANCOVA model on Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) data with factors treatment and Baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) at Week 34 in Patients Randomized at Week 18</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in Fatigue Assessment scale (0 to 10, 0 is “No Fatigue” and 10 is “Fatigue as bad as you can imagine”) is computed as the value at Week 34 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from baseline indicates an improvement. This analysis was carried out using an ANCOVA model on Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) data with factors treatment and Baseline score.</description>

          <description>MCS norm-based scores are calculated based upon the following 8 domain scores, Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional and Mental Health, and range from -9 to 82, where 50 represents the normative value. A larger positive value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.

        <description>Change from Baseline in Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity-VAS (0 to 100 mm visual analog scale, 0 being no symptoms and 100 being severe symptoms) is computed as the value at Week 34 minus the Baseline value. A negative value in change from Baseline indicates an improvement.
