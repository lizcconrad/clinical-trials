  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is thought to involve an interaction
      between multiple and variable susceptibility genes, environmental factors, and epigenetic
      effects. Great concern has been raised about the marked increase in the prevalence of autism
      spectrum disorders in the last decade. Risperidone, the most studied atypical antipsychotic
      used in children, has been shown to improve severe behavioral difficulties in over half of
      children with autism who have these difficulties. However, not all children with autism and
      severe behavioral problems respond to risperidone, and for a few, it has significant side
      effects.

      Two controlled studies and numerous open-label and long term studies in children with autism
      spectrum disorders using the atypical antipsychotic risperidone show a significant decrease
      of associated serious behavioral problems. The use of atypical antipsychotics is of great
      concern, however, because of their significant side effects and the fact that only two-thirds
      of children positively respond. Ways to predict response, appropriate dosage and serious side
      effects are needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, we will identify 40 children (4 to 18 years old) with autism who also have
      serious behavioral problems. We will then treat them with risperidone. Blood samples will be
      obtained prior to treatment and at eight weeks of treatment or study exit. At that time,
      efficacy will be assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) and
      the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Blood genomic profiles
      before and after risperidone treatment will be determined using Affymetrix oligonucleotide
      microarrays combined with RT-PCR.

      Blood genomic profiles are shown to predict medication response for disorders such as cancer
      and epilepsy. This exploratory or discovery study will use blood genomic profiles before and
      after risperidone treatment in children with autism and severe behavioral difficulties to
      determine if the profiles can predict response to treatment. The ultimate goal of this line
      of research is to develop methods to predict which medications work for which child before
      initiating treatment, to predict which child might develop particular side effects, and to
      identify new treatment targets for future medication development.

      Risperidone will be started at 0.5 mg at bedtime for 4 days and, if the current dosage is
      tolerated as evidenced by no more than mild sedation, no EPS or other moderate to severe AEs,
      and if there are continued behavioral symptoms, the dose will be increased to 1 mg at bedtime
      for an additional 4 days. If tolerated and indicated, 0.5 mg will be added in the AM for a
      daily total of 1.5 mg. After that, dosages may be increased if there does not appear to be an
      adequate clinical response. Dosage will not be increased if there are side effects (e.g.
      excessive sedation, salivation, EPS, lactation) and may be decreased if it is not tolerated.
      If the investigator determines that a significant adverse reaction occurs or if the subject
      or his or her family wants to stop the study, the medication will be tapered or stopped
      depending on the dose and reason for stopping and the subject will be offered alternative
      treatment at the M.I.N.D. Institute Clinic or referred elsewhere. This dosing schedule
      mirrors that used in the two recent positive trials of risperidone for treating severe
      behavioral problems in autism (McCracken et al., 2002; Shea et al., 2004).

    <description>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I)subscale: measure of assessing changes in symptoms of irritability in children with autism (survey that was normed on a developmentally delayed population of children and adults and is usually completed by a parent or caregiver. There are 45 items that are rated on a 4-point scale from &quot;no problem&quot; to &quot;major problem.&quot; ABC-I scores ranges from 0 (best) to 45 (worst). A negative change signifies improvement.
We measured percent change of ABC-I scores from 8 weeks after risperidone treatment compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to obtain gene expression values. Raw data (Affymetrix.CEL files) was imported into Partek Genomics Suite 6.4 (Partek, St Louis, MO, USA). Probe summarization and probe set normalization were performed using robust multichip average, which included background correction, quantile normalization, log2 transformation and median polish probe set summarization.
Exons in genes correlated with percentage improvement on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale were identified.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willingness to participate and written informed consent obtained from parent and when
             indicated by subject

          2. Confirmed DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of Autistic Disorder or Asperger's Disorder using the
             ADOS and the ADI-R, the current gold standards for diagnosing autism spectrum
             disorders, subject history, and clinical consensus with PI. The ADI-R and ADOS will be
             administered by research-reliable clinicians, including a clinical psychologist, a
             certified trainer on the ADOS and the ADI-R

          3. rated by study clinician as at least &quot;moderate&quot; on the CGI-Severity scale (a rating of
             ≥ 4) and greater than 18 on the ABC Irritability subscale

        Males or females of any race between 4 and 18 years of age (5) A nonverbal IQ greater than
        or equal to 55 on the Stanford-Binet:V (6) Women of childbearing potential must use an
        adequate method of contraception throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or autism spectrum disorder
             other than Autistic and Asperger's Disorders

          2. Nonverbal IQ lower than 55 (Stanford-Binet:V)

          3. History of seizure activity in the past year (active seizures might confuse efficacy
             ratings)

          4. fever, infection, metabolic disturbance or any severe medical illness in the past year

          5. typical or atypical antipsychotic use within 8 weeks of study entry

          6. Inability of parents or care takers to give informed consent, travel to the visits,
             administer medication, or arrange for completion of rating scales. Other
             non-antipsychotic medications and non-pharmacological treatments will be allowed if
             started at least 2 months prior to the initial screening and must remain constant for
             the 8 weeks of this study. These treatments will be recorded as will a history of past
             trials of medications. Prohibiting ongoing treatment would be difficult to justify to
             parents and to the IRB and would make adequate recruitment for this pilot study
             difficult.

        <description>Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I)subscale: measure of assessing changes in symptoms of irritability in children with autism (survey that was normed on a developmentally delayed population of children and adults and is usually completed by a parent or caregiver. There are 45 items that are rated on a 4-point scale from “no problem” to “major problem.&quot; ABC-I scores ranges from 0 (best) to 45 (worst). A negative change signifies improvement.
We measured percent change of ABC-I scores from 8 weeks after risperidone treatment compared to baseline.</description>

            <description>Risperidone was started at 0.5mg at bedtime for 4 days. If that dosage was tolerated and there were continued behavioral symptoms, the dose was increased to 1mg at bedtime for an additional 4 days. If tolerated and indicated, 0.5mg was added in the morning for a daily total of 1.5 mg.</description>

        <title>Exon Expression Positively or Negatively Correlated With Percentage Improvement in ABC-I</title>
        <description>Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to obtain gene expression values. Raw data (Affymetrix.CEL files) was imported into Partek Genomics Suite 6.4 (Partek, St Louis, MO, USA). Probe summarization and probe set normalization were performed using robust multichip average, which included background correction, quantile normalization, log2 transformation and median polish probe set summarization.
Exons in genes correlated with percentage improvement on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Irritability subscale were identified.</description>
