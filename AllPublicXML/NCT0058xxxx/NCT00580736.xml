  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research hypothesis is that topical application of a mixture of pre-polymers of
      polypropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol (an optical clearing agent) will reduce skin
      light scattering, increasing the amount of light reaching the target for diagnostic as well
      as therapeutic purposes.

      The researchers expect that application of the optical clearing agent for treatment of benign
      vascular lesions, tattoos, nevus of Ota, hypertrichosis, scars, acne and sebaceous
      hyperplasia will result in

        1. decreased reflectance of the predominant color from the surface of skin (decreased red
           light scattering in case of benign vascular lesions, etc) as compared to the control
           group.

        2. greater Optical Coherence Tomography a non-invasive light based imaging method imaging
           depth as compared to the control group.

        3. greater improvement in the treatment outcome (decrease in the erythema index following
           laser treatment of vascular lesions as compared to the laser alone group; improved
           lightening of the tattoo or nevus of Ota as compared to the laser treatment alone group;
           significant decrease in hair re-growth as compared to laser treatment alone in patients
           seeking hair removal; greater improvement of scars, acne and sebaceous hyperplasia).
