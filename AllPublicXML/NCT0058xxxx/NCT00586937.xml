  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out about the quality of life of individuals who have
      been diagnosed and treated for lung cancer (lung cancer survivors). By quality of life, we
      mean how you are feeling about different aspects of your life, including your physical
      health, your emotional health, and your ability to carry out daily activities. We are
      interested in people's opinions about their quality of life, as well as the factors that
      affect their quality of life. Learning about quality of life will help us to develop new
      services for lung cancer survivors.

    <description>In the first phase, a random sample of lung cancer survivors will complete a comprehensive telephone interview or questionnaire by self-report focusing on assessment of quality of life and related covariates. We estimate the total time for completion of the survey by telephone interview or self-report to be 45-60 minutes. second phase of the study, a subset of telephone survey participants will take part in a focus group discussion that will explore their perceptions of barriers for delivery of post-treatment medical and psychosocial follow-up care.</description>
