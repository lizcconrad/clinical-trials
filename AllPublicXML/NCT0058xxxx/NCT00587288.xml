      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of reslizumab in the
      treatment of subjects with poorly controlled asthma.

      Objectives:

      Primary: To demonstrate the ability of reslizumab to improve asthma control in subjects with
      active asthma and eosinophilic airway inflammation.

      Secondary:

        -  To study the ability of reslizumab to reduce induced sputum eosinophil (EOS) counts in
           subjects with asthma.

        -  To study the ability of reslizumab to reduce the number of eosinophilic clinical asthma
           exacerbations (CAE) in subjects with asthma. A CAE is defined as a ≥ 20% decrease in
           forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1; absolute value) from the baseline value or a
           requirement for emergency treatment of asthma, hospital admission for asthma or
           treatment with three or more days of oral corticosteroids (OCS) for asthma worsening.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of reslizumab in subjects with asthma.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to End of Therapy in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through End of Therapy (up to 15 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ is a 7 question instrument. Each question has 7 possible answers of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each increasing value is an indication of poorer asthma control. At protocol specified visits, the participant answered questions 1 to 6, circling the response that best described how that participant was during the past week, on the basis of a daily diary for the week before the visit. At the actual visit, study center personnel reviewed the questions and responses with the participant and determined the response and score for question 7. The overall ACQ score was presented as the mean of these 7 individual scores and was a number between 0 and 6, but not necessarily an integer.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of ACQ Responders at End of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Therapy (up to 15 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Responders were defined as participants achieving at least a 0.5 reduction from baseline to End of Therapy in ACQ score. The ACQ is a 7 question instrument. Each question has 7 possible answers of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each increasing value is an indication of poorer asthma control. At protocol specified visits, the participant answered questions 1 to 6, circling the response that best described how that participant was during the past week, on the basis of a daily diary for the week before the visit. At the actual visit, study center personnel reviewed the questions and responses with the participant and determined the response and score for question 7.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Therapy in Forced Expiratory Volume in the First Second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Therapy (up to 15 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The change in FEV1 from baseline to End of Therapy was determined. FEV1 was measured during pulmonary function tests using standard spirometry measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Therapy in Percent Predicted FEV1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End of Therapy (up to 15 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline to End of Therapy was calculated from the FEV1 measured during pulmonary function tests using standard spirometry measurements. Each participant's percent predicted FEV1 was calculated by adjusting the FEV1 for age, sex, height and race. The percent predicted FEV1 was then calculated by comparing the predicted FEV1 to the observed FEV1 using the Crapo formula (Crapo et al 1981a, Crapo and Morris 1981b, Crapo et al 1982).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Asthma Exacerbations (CAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A CAE was defined as a 20% or more decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1, absolute value) from the baseline value, a requirement for emergency treatment of asthma, hospital admission for asthma, or treatment with 3 or more days of oral corticosteroids for asthma worsening.</description>

    <description>Participants may have been included in more than 1 category. AEs summarized were those that began or worsened after dispensation of the study drug and before 30 days after the last dose of study drug. If the severity of an AE was missing, the AE was reported as &quot;severe.&quot; If drug relationship of an AE was missing, the AE was reported as &quot;probably related.&quot; WFT=withdrawn from treatment.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to End of Therapy in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score</title>
        <description>The ACQ is a 7 question instrument. Each question has 7 possible answers of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each increasing value is an indication of poorer asthma control. At protocol specified visits, the participant answered questions 1 to 6, circling the response that best described how that participant was during the past week, on the basis of a daily diary for the week before the visit. At the actual visit, study center personnel reviewed the questions and responses with the participant and determined the response and score for question 7. The overall ACQ score was presented as the mean of these 7 individual scores and was a number between 0 and 6, but not necessarily an integer.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Therapy in Percent Predicted FEV1</title>
        <description>The change in percent predicted FEV1 from baseline to End of Therapy was calculated from the FEV1 measured during pulmonary function tests using standard spirometry measurements. Each participant’s percent predicted FEV1 was calculated by adjusting the FEV1 for age, sex, height and race. The percent predicted FEV1 was then calculated by comparing the predicted FEV1 to the observed FEV1 using the Crapo formula (Crapo et al 1981a, Crapo and Morris 1981b, Crapo et al 1982).</description>

AEs summarized were those that began or worsened after dispensation of the study drug and before 30 days after the last dose of study drug. If the severity of an AE was missing, the AE was reported as “severe.” If drug relationship of an AE was missing, the AE was reported as “probably related.” WFT=withdrawn from treatment.</description>
