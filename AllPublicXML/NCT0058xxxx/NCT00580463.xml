      The purpose of the study is to collect samples of brain or spine tumors. Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center would then store them for use by researchers who study brain or
      spine cancer and try to find better ways of treating it. We will also collect blood and
      spinal fluid from patients with brain or spine tumors. The blood and spinal fluids are also
      used for research studies of cancer and its treatment.

      The main objective of the protocol is the establishment of a repository of central nervous
      system (CNS) tumors or metastases to the CNS and related tissues as an invaluable resource
      for current or future research studies of the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of human
      central nervous system tumors. The database will be established through the intra-operative
      acquisition of brain or spine tumors as well as the collection of blood and spinal fluids
      from consenting CNS tumor patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For acquisition of intra-operative brain or spine tumor specimens, blood specimens and
             spinal fluid specimens, all patients who undergo surgery for resection or biopsy
             qualify for inclusion in this protocol.

          -  If spinal fluid is not accessed as part of the operative procedure, it will not be
             collected.

          -  All patients must be under the care of one or more members of the MSKCC CNS disease
             management team at the time of tissue acquisition. Patients may have been previously
             diagnosed and/or treated at another institution.

          -  Subjects are eligible regardless of sex, age or race.

          -  Parental or guardian consents will be obtained in the case of minors (less than 18
             years of age)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients or their guardians, in case of a minor, may choose to be excluded at any
             time.

          -  If a patient, or guardian, decides to withdraw after some or all of the tissues have
             been collected, such tissues will be destroyed at their request.

          -  Patients or their guardians will be counseled at the time of obtaining their consent,
             of the possibility of withdrawing from the protocol.
