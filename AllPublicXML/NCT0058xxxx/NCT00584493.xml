    <description>This is a single arm study. Patients will receive intravenous administration of CP-675,206 at a dose of 15 mg/kg on Day 1 of every 90-day cycle for up to 4 cycles. For purposes of treatment visits and scheduling, each cycle is defined as a 90 (Â± 4 day) period. Patients who discontinue treatment after 4 doses of CP-675,206 without disease progression and who subsequently experience disease progression more than 3 months after the last dose may receive 2 additional doses of CP-675,206 provided that they have not received other systemic therapy for their melanoma
Survival in this study will be monitored on all patients for up to 5 years from the date of first dose of CP-675,206.</description>
