    <textblock>
      This study focusses on finding out if osteosarcoma can be detected in blood. The cells will
      be measured by a new laboratory technique called the polymerase chain reaction. This new
      technique can identify one tumor cell among one million normal cells. Using this technique
      Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center research doctors may be able to detect tumor cells
      that could not be identified any other way. This test will be in addition to cancer treatment
      and will not replace any other test used normally. As this technique is still unproved the
      results will not be given to patients or patient's doctors and will not be used to change
      cancer treatment.

    <description>Peripheral blood samples (6-9 ml) will be collected in purple top tubes, when routine laboratory tests are being drawn. The blood will be drawn through central venous catheters, whenever possible. Blood will be drawn once from patients with malignant diagnoses other than osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma or synovial sarcoma. In patients with osteosarcoma we will obtain blood when baseline laboratory tests are obtained, after every two cycles of treatment (approximately every six weeks), at the end of planned surgery and chemotherapy, every three months for the first year off therapy and yearly thereafter. We will also obtain blood if the patient relapses.</description>
