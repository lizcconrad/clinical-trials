      This is a study to determine if people with Lupus have weak bones.

      Test which is a better method for detecting bone changes:

        -  Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)

        -  Single energy quantitative computed tomography (SEQCT)

      Evaluate whether weak bones are associated with things like medications or amount of fat and
      muscle.

      This is a longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the natural history of osteoporosis in
      children and adolescents with SLE.

      The specific Aims are:

        -  To compare the BMD of children and adolescents with SLE to healthy controls utilizing
           Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and Single energy quantitative computed
           tomography (SEQCT). The following questions will be addressed at baseline:

      What is the variation of BMD seen among subjects with SLE? Is the BMD of children with SLE
      diminished relative to healthy controls? If BMD is diminished, what is the severity of the
      reduction?

        -  To characterize the annual change in BMD for children and adolescents with SLE over a
           five year period in a longitudinal cohort study utilizing arial and volumetric
           densitometry methods of both trabecular- and cortical-rich regions of bone.

        -  To compare the use of DXA and SEQCT for measuring BMD in children and adolescents with
           SLE.

        -  To characterize the determinants of BMD and corresponding markers of bone metabolism in
           a longitudinal cohort of pediatric SLE subjects.

        -  To bank SLE subject blood and urine specimens for future analysis. Future analysis will
           focus on newly developed bone metabolism markers, as this is a currently evolving area.

        -  To evaluate body composition in SLE utilizing whole body DXA and to determine the
           contribution of body composition abnormalities to BMD.

      Research Design and Method: This study includes a baseline cross-sectional component
      comparing SLE subjects to normal healthy controls followed by a longitudinal follow up study
      of SLE subjects. SLE subjects and controls will be evaluated in a single-day visit to the
      UCSF PCRC for clinical assessment and phlebotomy followed by a radiologic evaluation at the
      Department of Radiology.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  SlE subjects 4/11 of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE (23), age
             less than 22 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonatal SLE or drug-induced SLE

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, and subjects weighing over 300 pounds, as the densitometry
             techniques are not reliable above this weight.

          -  Subjects receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation will not be excluded but this
             information will be recorded and evaluated further in the dietary/nutritional
             assessment.
