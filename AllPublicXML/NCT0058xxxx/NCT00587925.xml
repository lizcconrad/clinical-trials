    <textblock>
      Bone Mineral Density (BMD) as measured by X-ray shows the amount of calcium in the bone. Low
      BMD may reflect osteoporosis, a condition where there is an increased risk of fracture. Women
      who have gone through menopause have a higher risk of getting osteoporosis because they lose
      calcium from their bones much faster than younger women. Women with breast cancer may have an
      additional risk for getting osteoporosis because of the effects of their treatment with
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to see what levels of BMD post-menopausal women
      with breast cancer have, and to see if the level of BMD changes during a women's treatment
      after her surgery. This trial studies changes in BMD and markers of bone activity in women
      receiving treatment for early stage breast cancer.

      Breast cancer patients may be at increased risk for osteoporosis secondary to cancer
      treatment. The hypothesis of this study is that adjuvant chemotherapy increases the risk of
      osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The objective of this pilot study is to describe the
      effects of chemotherapy on bone mineral density and serum markers of bone metabolism.

      There is limited data on the change in bone mineral density due to chemotherapy in
      postmenopausal women. This prospective study will gather data on the effects of systemic
      breast cancer therapy on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant care
      for early stage (0, I, II or III) breast cancer. Postmenopausal women are the focus of this
      study because: (1) they are the largest subgroup of women with breast cancer (2) they are
      expected to have a rate of BMD loss unless disturbed by disease or medications, unlike the
      pre and perimenopausal women whose BMD is dramatically affected by changes in hormonal status
      (3) this group of patients is at greatest risk for acute osteoporotic fractures.

    <description>Clinic visits twice during the first 2 years of the study with medical care directed by your treating doctor.BMD is measured by an X-ray test. The most common type of BMD testing is by energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Usually BMD is measured every other year, but to closely monitor women on this study, the BMD will be evaluated more often. The BMD will be measured 3 times (baseline, 12 months and 24 months) on this study. Study blood work is obtained three times (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). Blood (about 3 teaspoons).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of breast cancer

          -  Non-metastatic breast cancer tumor with the diagnosis of Tis, T1-T4, N0-3, M0 (Stage
             0, I, II or III breast cancer) by the American Joint Committee on Cancer revised
             tumor-nodal-metastases staging system (Singletary, JCO 2002). DCIS is allowed, but
             LCIS (only) is not. Adjuvant care is administered as clinically indicated. Adjuvant
             treatment decisions are not stipulated in this trial.

          -  Postmenopausal as defined by last menstrual cycle occurring more than 5 years
             previously. Women who have had a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy will be
             considered postmenopausal if greater than 55 years of age. Women who have had a
             bilateral oophorectomy more than 5 years previously will be considered postmenopausal.

          -  Chemotherapy Arm: Patients about to begin adjuvant, or neoadjuvant, treatment with
             Doxorubicin (60mg/m2), Cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2) followed by Paclitaxel (175mg/m2)
             (AC-T) or Doxorubicin (60mg/m2) for 4 cycles followed by Paclitaxel (175mg/m2) for 4
             cycles followed by Cyclophosphamide (600mg/m2) for 4 cycles (A-T-C) administered in
             the dose dense regimen every 2 weeks with growth

          -  factor support. The patient may enter this trial within 3 months of initiating
             adjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Observation Arm: Patients begin adjuvant follow up with expectant monitoring (no
             systemic therapy). The patient may enter this trial within 2 months of initiating
             adjuvant care.

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Assessment of the complete blood count and complete biochemical profile must indicate
             absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000/ul, hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl and platelets &gt;100,000/ul and
             the bilirubin, liver transaminases (AST/ALT) and serum creatinine must be within 2.5
             times the institutional upper level of normal at the time of enrollment into the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any metabolic bone disease (including Paget's disease of the bone) other than
             postmenopausal osteoporosis or osteopenia.

          -  Use of systemic gonadal hormonal medications or supplements within the past 24 months.

             associated with systemic absorption are allowed.

          -  Prior use of tamoxifen or raloxifene is permitted if the medication was discontinued
             more then 24 months prior to the diagnosis of breast cancer. No adjuvant antiestrogen,
             antineoplastic, therapies are permitted on study.

          -  Chronic use of systemic steroids (equivalent of prednisone 5mg daily for more then 3
             months) for disease process other than breast cancer chemotherapy premedications or
             antiemetics. Inhaled steroids are allowed, as is the occasional use of low to moderate
             dose short pulse steroids.

          -  History of rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, hyperparathyroidism, renal
             osteodystrophy, moderate to severe inflammatory or autoimmune diseases or newly
             diagnosed thyroid condition requiring titration of medications (stable dose and minor
             dose modifications of thyroid medications are acceptable). Other exclusionary comorbid
             conditions include thalassemia, moderate to severe malabsorptive syndromes and HIV.
             Patients diagnosed with the above conditions or similar comorbid and/or inflammatory
             diseases associated with changes in BMD either from the disease process or the therapy
             of such condition(s) during the course of the study will be removed from the study at

             disease, or severe calcification of the aorta.

          -  Patients with concurrent medical or psychiatric conditions, which at the judgment of
