  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to extend previous observations in animal models regarding the
      effects of adenosine in the release of cytokines to human subjects. We intend to accomplish
      this in two study protocols. In the first we will infuse intravenously adenosine and measure
      the plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines. In the second one, we will use a microdialysis
      technique to infuse intradermally small amounts of adenosine and will measure skin blood flow
      and will take a biopsy to measure levels of mRNA for cytokines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Protocol 1 we will infuse adenosine at a dose of 80 mcg/kg/min for 30 minutes while
      measuring plasma levels of adenosine at different time points, ranging from 30 minutes to 6
      hours. Because activation of A2B receptors also mediates the release of inflammatory
      cytokines, including IL-6, samples will be taken to measure these and other
      inflammatory/angiogenic cytokines.

      In a second protocol, we will administer adenosine intradermically via a microdialysis probe
      for 30 minutes while we measure the local effect on skin blood flow using laser Doppler
      techniques. One hour after the end of the infusion we will obtain a skin biopsy from the
      perfused area for measurement of mRNA for VEGF, IL-8, IL-6 and other cytokines. In addition,
      we foresee the possibility of further testing looking for and genetic association between
      angiogenesis and adenosine.

      These are proof-of-concept pilot studies. We will study up to 12 subjects in each protocol
      but an interim analysis will be performed after 6 subjects are studied. This will help us
      determine if a trend is observed, to perform power calculations, and determine if more
      extensive studies are warranted.

    <description>The local effects of adenosine or sodium nitroprusside will be studied in response to microinjection (intradermally) of both drugs. Two microdialysis catheters (CMA 100) will be inserted intradermally in the volar aspect of the forearm after numbing the area with local cold (ice applied in the study area). After 30 minutes,one catheter will be infused with sodium nitroprusside (2microliters/min of a 28 mM solution) and the other with adenosine (2mcl/min of a 100 microM solution) will then be started and continued for 60 minutes. Skin blood flow will be monitored throughout the study with the used of a skin laser Doppler fluxometer mounted adjacent to the area of the microdialysis probe.
A 2 mm skin biopsy punch will be performed 60 minutes after the end of the infusion.</description>
