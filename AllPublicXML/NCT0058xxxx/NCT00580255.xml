  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that elevated BNP level correlate with an elevated thoracic
      impedance/fluid index as measured separately by CRT-D devices and external impedance
      cardiography. Ultimately, it is also hypothesized that both BNP and thoracic impedance/fluid
      index measurements are predictive of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

      The primary aim of this study:

        1. To assess the correlation between elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels and elevated
           thoracic impedance/body fluid index as measured by selective biventricular
           resynchronization devices and an external impedance cardiography device.

        2. Correlate impedance measurements and brain natriuretic levels with occurrence of atrial
           and ventricular arrhythmias as assessed by interrogation of biventricular devices.

        Potential candidates with criteria for implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy who
        have or will undergo implantation of a Medtronic CRT-D device with thoracic impedance
        measurement capabilities, will be eligible to enter the study if they meet all of the
        inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Patients will be enrolled in the
        study either at the time of device implantation or if they have already undergone device
        implantation will be enrolled at next routine outpatient clinic visit.
