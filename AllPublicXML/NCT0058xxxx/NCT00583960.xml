      Retrospective chart review of UCDMC patients who have undergone esophageal or tracheal
      balloon dilation to record data including age, gender, diagnosis pre-and post-procedure
      eating assessment tool, esophagoscopy findings, tracheobronchoscopy findings, and pre-and
      post-procedure videofluoroscopic findings.

      Dilation of the esophagus is performed for strictures, webs, and rings at all levels of the
      esophagus. Dilation of the trachea is performed for subglottic and tracheal stenosis. Radial
      expansion balloons have been developed by Bost Scientific Corporation for the purpose of
      dilating the esophagus and trachea through flexible esophagoscopies. These sequential
      controlled radial-expansion balloons can be introduced via a guide wire through the working
      channel of a 5.1 mm transnasal esophagoscope. Traditionally, otolaryngologists have performed
      esophageal and tracheal dilation per oral under general anesthesia. This technique allows the
      procedure to be performed in the office, sparing the patient the risk of anesthetics. The
      purpose of this study is to review the UCDMC experience with esophageal and tracheal balloon
      dilation using the transnasal esophagoscope.
