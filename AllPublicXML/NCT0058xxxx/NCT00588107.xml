    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare two different ways of helping people who have had
      childhood cancer, leukemia, tumors or similar illnesses learn health information and
      information about trying to quit smoking. All participants received materials in the mail
      about their health, survivorship, and smoking. Some participants were also invited to use a
      website. The goal of the study was to see which is a better way to get information about
      health issues, survivorship, and smoking.

      The study was a randomized controlled trial with two groups. It was designed to demonstrate
      the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a Web-based format of the PFH intervention, compared
      to a written Materials control condition. The study was conducted among childhood and young
      adult cancer survivors, who smoke, at four survivor clinics. Participants in both conditions
      received access to pharmacotherapy at no cost. Participants in the Web condition received
      access to an interactive Web site that focuses on survivorship, health, and smoking.

      Participants in the Web condition received access to an interactive Web site that focuses on
      survivorship, health, and smoking. Participants in the Materials control group received
      tailored and targeted print materials.
