      The purpose of this study is to collect a blood sample from patients with breast disease
      (cases) and from individuals without breast cancer (controls)that may be used for research
      purposes. These blood samples will be used by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
      Center who study the causes of breast cancer, as well as more effective ways to prevent,
      diagnose, and treat breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For acquisition of existing breast cancer tissue specimens from the MSKCC Tissue
             Procurement Service, the only criteria are a pathologically-confirmed diagnosis of
             invasive breast cancer and the availability of corresponding nonmalignant tissue from
             each case.

          -  For the prospective acquisition of blood or saliva from control subjects without
             breast cancer, eligibility criteria include:

          -  Any patient with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer who undergoes a
             palliative procedure related to the presence of a pleural effusion is eligible for the
             pleural fluid collection aspect of this protocol.

          -  Any female patient, or any female over the age of 18 accompanying a patient under the
             care of a physician in the Department of Urology, Department of Surgery, or Department
             of Medicine.

          -  Subjects will have no history of preinvasive (carcinoma in situ) or invasive breast
             cancer.

          -  Subjects will be eligible without regard to racial, or ethnic status. Attending
             physicians authorized to obtain informed consent may exercise discretion in excluding
             individuals for appropriate medical or other (e.g., mentally impaired) reasons.

          -  For the prospective acquisition of blood, saliva, pleural fluid or cerebrospinal fluid
             from patients who have or are suspected of having breast cancer or carcinoma in-situ,
             eligibility criteria include:

          -  Any patient at MSKCC with a previously confirmed or suspected diagnosis of malignant
             or premalignant (e.g., carcinoma in situ) breast disease is eligible for inclusion in
             the blood acquisition aspect of this protocol.

          -  Any patient with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer who undergoes a
             palliative procedure related to the presence of a pleural effusion is eligible for the
             pleural fluid collection aspect of this protocol.

          -  Any patient with a previous diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with leptomeningeal
             metastasis who undergoes a routine procedure associated with the collection of
             cerebrospinal fluid is eligible for the cerebrospinal fluid collection aspect of this
             protocol.

          -  All subjects must be under the care of one or more members of the MSKCC Breast Disease
             Management Team at the time of enrollment.

          -  Subjects may have received prior hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation
             therapy, or surgical therapy at MSKCC or another institution.

          -  All subjects must be 18 years or older

          -  Subjects will be eligible without regard to sex, racial, or ethnic status. It is
             anticipated that approximately 99% of the patients will be female. Attending
             physicians authorized to obtain informed consent may exercise discretion in excluding
             individuals for appropriate medical or other (e.g., mentally impaired) reasons.

          -  If, after pathologic diagnosis, preinvasive or invasive breast disease is not found,
             patients previously consented for the blood collection aspect of this protocol will
             not be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For the prospective acquisition of blood or saliva from control subjects without
             breast cancer, ineligibility criteria include:

               -  A first degree relative (mother, daughter, sister, father, brother or son) who
                  has been diagnosed with breast cancer.

               -  A personal history of breast cancer, lobular carcinoma in situ or atypia.
