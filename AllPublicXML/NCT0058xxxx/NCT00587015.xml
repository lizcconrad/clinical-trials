  <brief_summary>

      A dose-escalation study to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of CAT-8015 that can be
      safely administered to a patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the highest dose that can be safely
      administered to a patient, and to establish a safe dose, based on MTD, for subsequent
      clinical testing.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to a lack of IP supply and then terminated because they were combined into one new study

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in the
        study:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Evidence of CD22-positive malignancy by the following criteria, &gt; 30% of malignant
             cells from a disease site CD22+ by FACS analysis or, &gt; 15% of malignant cells from a
             disease site must react with anti-CD22 by immunohistochemistry

          -  Disease characteristics: Patients with indolent subtypes of CD22+ B-cell non-
             Hodgkin's lymphoma, including, but not limited to mantle cell lymphoma, follicular
             lymphoma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, are eligible if stage III-IV. if stage
             III-IV. Patients must have failed at least two or more courses of prior standard
             chemotherapy and/or biologic therapy (e.g. Rituxan). Patients with progressive mantle
             cell lymphoma may be eligible if they have failed one prior standard therapeutic
             regimen.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients with other cancers who meet eligibility criteria and have less than 5 years
             of disease free survival will be considered on a case-by-case basis

          -  Life expectancy of less than 6 months, as assessed by the principal investigator

          -  Must be able to understand and sign informed consent

          -  Must be at least 18 years old

          -  Female and male patients must agree to use an approved method of contraception during
             the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for participation in the
        study:

          -  History of allogeneic bone marrow transplant

          -  Documented and ongoing central nervous system involvement with their malignant disease
             (history of CNS involvement is not an exclusion criterion)

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females

          -  HIV positive serology (due to increased risk of severe infection and unknown
             interaction of CAT-8015 with antiretroviral drugs)

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen positive

          -  Uncontrolled, symptomatic, intercurrent illness including but not limited to:
             infections requiring systemic antibiotics, congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness, or social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients whose plasma contains either a significant level of antibody to CAT-8015 as
             measured by ELISA, or antibody that neutralizes the binding of CAT-8015 to CD22 as
             measured by a competition ELISA.

        Hepatic function Serum transaminases (either ALT or AST) or bilirubin:

          -  ≥ Grade 2, unless bilirubin is due to Gilbert's disease

        Renal function:

          -  serum creatinine clearance ≤ 60mL/min as estimated by Cockroft-Gault formula

        Hematologic function:

          -  The ANC &lt; 1000/cmm, or platelet count &lt;50,000/cmm, if these cytopenias are not judged
             by the investigator to be due to underlying disease (i.e. potentially reversible with
             anti-neoplastic therapy).

          -  A patient will not be excluded because of pancytopenia ≥ Grade 3, or erythropoietin
             dependence, if it is due to disease, based on the results of bone marrow studies

          -  Baseline coagulopathy greater than or equal to Grade 3 unless due to anticoagulant
             therapy.

        Pulmonary function:

          -  Patients with &lt; 50% of predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or &lt;50% of predicted
             diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), corrected for hemoglobin concentration
             and alveolar volume. Note: Patients with no prior history of pulmonary illness are not
             required to have PFTs. FEV1 will be assessed after bronchodilator therapy.

        Recent prior therapy:

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy, corticosteroids (except stable doses of prednisone), whole
             body electron beam radiation therapy, hormonal, biologic or other standard or any
             investigational therapy of the malignancy for 3 weeks prior to entry into the trial

          -  Less than or equal to 1 month prior monoclonal antibody therapy (i.e. rituximab)

          -  Patients who are receiving or have received radiation therapy less than 3 weeks prior
             to study entry will be not be excluded providing the volume of bone marrow treated is
             less than 10% and also the patient has measurable disease outside the radiation port

          -  Any history of prior pseudomonas-exotoxin immunotoxin (PE) administration.
