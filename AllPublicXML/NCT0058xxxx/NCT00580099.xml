    <textblock>
      Briefly our study is looking at the effects of 4 weeks of assisted exercise on the body
      composition and neurological/behavioral development of healthy growing premature infants
      enrolled between the ages of 30-33 weeks. It is a blinded study where the active group gets
      the exercise intervention and the control group is cuddled for the same amount of time
      -approximately 20 minutes. We get baseline data using muscle ultrasound, bone speed of sound
      and DEXA. We also get baseline blood samples to look at inflammatory mediators and growth
      hormone. Video of each subject is recorded an hour at two time points during the study to
      assess the babies for spontaneous activity. Nutritional intake information is collected daily
      and in the 4th week of the study assessments made for total energy expenditure using doubly
      labeled water. At this point in the study we repeat the ultrasounds and DEXA for comparison.
      Finally in the period just before discharge we do a complex neurological exam using the
      Brazelton NBAS assessment.
