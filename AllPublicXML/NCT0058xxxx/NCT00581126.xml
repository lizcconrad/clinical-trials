      To assess efficacy and safety of BeneFix® for prophylaxis in &quot;Short-term&quot; therapy and on

      Phase IV, open-label, non comparative, multicenter, previously treated patients (PTP)
      clinical trial. Patients with severe or moderate hemophilia B with baseline levels of plasma
      factor IX &lt; 5% activity will participate in this study for both treatment regimens: &quot;on
      demand&quot; therapy for acute bleeding episodes and therapy for prophylaxis of bleeding episodes
      ( &quot;Short-term therapy&quot;)*.

      * Short-Term Therapy: Prophylactic therapy given before surgery, including dental procedures,
      prior to a event that would likely result in bleeding ( sports, exercise, or heavy work), as
      well as to prevent further bleeds into a target joint). This short-term therapy for
      intermittent secondary therapy.
