  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the quality of life and emotional changes
      that patients experience during their treatment for cancer of the mouth. We want to learn
      more about the emotional and quality of life problems that occur during and after treatment.
      This will help us better understand these complex issues and improve treatment.

      The objectives of this project are to prospectively assess quality of life (QOL) and
      psychosocial adaptation in patients undergoing treatment for carcinoma of the oral cavity,
      including squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity (SCCOC) and to validate new instruments
      (shame &amp; stigma, demoralization) that will guide quality of life assessment of patients with
      cancer of the oral cavity. We will utilize modifications of previously described and
      validated questionnaires that will be administered to eligible patients before the start of
      their therapy and at several predefined time points during the post-therapy period. This
      prospective longitudinal assessment will allow us to study the impact of patient demographic,
      tumor, treatment and lifestyle related variables on the quality of life of patients treated
      for oral cavity cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PATIENT INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE LONDITUDINAL STUDY:

          -  Carcinoma of the oral cavity including one or more of the following anatomic
             sub-sites: Anterior 2/3rds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, the upper and lower
             gums, buccal mucosa, retromolar trigone, hard palate and minor salivary glands.

          -  Surgically resectable disease in the oral cavity and the neck.

          -  Patients with prior cancers other than Head and Neck cancers who are currently in
             remission, have no evidence of disease and are not undergoing any active chemotherapy
             or radiation therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        EXCLUSION FOR THE LONDITUDINAL STUDY:

          -  Primary tumor of the lips (these are skin cancers).

          -  Surgical treatment excluding diagnostic biopsy of the primary site or biopsy of neck
             node/s prior to referral to MSKCC.

          -  Surgically unresectable disease in the neck; including carotid encasement, massive
             dermal infiltration, and other clinical and radiographic findings which would preclude
             surgically resectable nodal disease in the neck, prior to initiation of treatment.

          -  Patients with more than one simultaneous primary tumor.

          -  Patient unable to read or comprehend the content of the questionnaires due to language

          -  Upper aerodigestive squamous cell carcinoma, including the oropharynx, hypopharynx and
             larynx - newly diagnosed or recurrent cancers.

          -  Newly diagnosed and recurrent carcinoma of the oral cavity including one or more of
