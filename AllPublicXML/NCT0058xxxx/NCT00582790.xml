    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if we can improve the response of Interleukin-2 by adding
      Zoledronic acid. The effectiveness of the combination of drugs in kidney cancer is unknown
      and will be investigated in this study. In particular, this study will evaluate the effect of
      this combination on kidney cancer and will also examine the safety and side effects of IL-2
      with Zoledronic acid.

      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the antitumor response of low-dose Interleukin-2
      in combination with Zoledronic acid on subjects with previously untreated, unresectable
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Also, the study will assess the tolerability, safety,
      pharmacodynamic effects, and immunologic effects of low-dose Interleukin-2 in combination
      with Zoledronic acid on angiogenesis inhibition and anti-metastatic potential by measuring
      serum/plasma angiogenic/metastatic factor levels and by quantitating changes in cytokine
      expression, antigen-specific T-cell immune responses, and peripheral gd T-cell frequency and
      function.

    <time_frame>CT scans obtained at baseline, then every 2 cycles</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-tumor response was measured per RECIST criteria (V1.0) and assessed by chest/abdomen/pelvis CT: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all target lessions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; Stable Response (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

    <time_frame>Time frame is from study entry until time to disease progression and time to death, up to 50 months</time_frame>
    <description>All 12 patients were followed for survival until death. 8 participants who received more than one cycle of treatment and who were considered evaluable for response were followed until time to progression. Disease progression was determined by CT scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis obtained every 2 cycles and based on RECIST version 1.0. Progression is defined using RECIST (V1.0) at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD)of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Overall Survival and Progression-free Survival at 24 Weeks</title>
        <description>All 12 patients were followed for survival until death. 8 participants who received more than one cycle of treatment and who were considered evaluable for response were followed until time to progression. Disease progression was determined by CT scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis obtained every 2 cycles and based on RECIST version 1.0. Progression is defined using RECIST (V1.0) at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD)of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</description>
