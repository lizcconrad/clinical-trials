  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic
      resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can tell which patients with prostate cancer are at a
      low risk for their cancer growing and spreading. Magnetic resonance methods use magnets and
      radio waves to take pictures of body structure (MRI) and to measure amounts of important
      chemicals within the body (MRSI). This study will look at the structural and chemical
      properties of prostates before undergoing treatment. Hopefully, doctors will be able to use
      this method before making treatment decisions for patients with newly diagnosed cancer of the
      prostate. This study will continue our work to assess the value of MRI/MRSI in addressing
      what is currently one of the greatest clinical challenges in the management of prostate
      cancer: the identification of low-risk organ-confined prostate cancer that can be managed
      expectantly with deferred treatment.

      In this study, patients with low-risk, organ-confined prostate cancer identified in clinic or
      prior to their already scheduled standard of care MRI in the Department of Radiology will be
      approached for the study. Eligible patients will undergo a baseline eMRI/MRSI exam between 6
      and 24 weeks following biopsy. Patients will undergo definitive treatment (radical
      prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT)) or will be placed on deferred therapy.
      Predictor variables will be recorded for each patient after enrollment, before treatment and
      during treatment follow-up. Patient outcome-disease progression will be determined by long
      term clinical follow-up

    <measure>In the patients who are identified as harboring indolent prostate cancer by both clinical guidelines and eMRI/MRSI, clinical progression of disease will be evaluated in a cohort of patients receiving deferred therapy.</measure>

    <measure>We will explore whether eMRI/MRSI markers of progression correlate with clinical markers of progression.</measure>

    <description>Patients undergoing deferred treatment will undergo followup eMRI/MRSI exams before surveillance biopsies, beginning approximately 12-18 months after confirmatory biopsy.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo eMRI/MRSI examination. All subjects will be asked to administer a Fleet enema on the day of the study in order to reduce the potential for fecal residue to interfere with imaging acquisition and quality. Upon arrival at the MRI suite, patients will be asked to complete a standard MRI screening form. Patients will be scanned in the supine position. The entire eMRI/MRSI study will be performed within 55-60 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Gleason ≤6 (grade 3 + 3 or lower) biopsy proven prostate cancer

          2. Clinically low-risk localized disease as defined by NCCN guidelines (clinical stage
             T1-T2a, maximum Gleason score 2-6, peak serum PSA level &lt; 10 ng/ml)

          3. No evidence of disseminated disease (bone or lymph node metastases)

          4. Treatment—radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or deferred therapy—will be at
             MSKCC

          5. Willingness to undergo serial surveillance TRUS-guided prostate biopsies and eMRI/MRSI
             examination at MSKCC if placed on deferred therapy protocol

          6. In the surgical cohort, RP (radical prostatectomy) is scheduled to occur within six
             months of eMRI/MRSI study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment (e.g. with hormonal therapy, radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy
             or cryosurgery)

          2. Inability to give informed consent because of age, general medical or psychiatric
             condition, or physiologic status

          3. Presence of known contraindication to eMRI

          4. Unwillingness or inability to undergo placement of endorectal MR coil or ultrasound
             probe. As is the case for a standard MR exam, the presence of a pacemaker or aneurysm
             clips could pose a risk to patients, making them unable to have an eMRI, and therefore
             unable to participate in this study.
