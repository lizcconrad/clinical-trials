  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of a levonorgesterel-releasing
      intrauterine device (LNG IUD, Mirena速) versus a copper IUD (Paraguard速) on coagulation
      parameters known to be associated with risk of thrombosis (blood clots). Both the LNG IUD and
      the copper IUD are FDA approved devices for contraception.

      Women enrolled in this study will be randomized to receive either the LNG IUD or the copper
      IUD. They will complete a one month bleeding diary prior to insertion of the IUD and again
      for one month while the IUD is in place. They will undergo phlebotomy (blood draw) at
      baseline (prior to insertion of the IUD), two and four months. Stored samples will be used to
      measure D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), antithrombin (AT), factor VIIIc, activated partial
      thromboplastin time (aPTT) and activated partial thromboplastin time plus activated protein C
      (aPTT + APC). Both groups will undergo a GYN exam with screening for bacterial vaginosis and
      gonorrhea/chlamydia cultures prior to insertion of the IUD. A brief survey to assess the
      women's experience with the IUD, including symptomatology and satisfaction with the device,
      will be conducted at the four months after insertion.
