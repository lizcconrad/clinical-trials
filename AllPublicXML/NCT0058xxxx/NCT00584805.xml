    <description>Subjects will receive 0.5ml SQ, as a two-dose primary series (days 0 and 28) and 0.1ml, as a mandatory booster dose at 6 months. A booster dose may be administered before 6 months if PRNT80 is &lt; 1:40 after day 28. Up to four booster doses may be given in any 1-year period.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Over 65 years of age (for Primary Immunization).

          -  Clinically significant abnormal lab results including evidence of Hepatitis C,
