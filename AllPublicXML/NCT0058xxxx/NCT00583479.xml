      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of
      EUS-guided CB performed with a single injection versus two injections of medication into the
      celiac ganglion region.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic abdominal pain from documented chronic pancreatitis or
             pancreatic cancer that are referred for EUS-guided celiac block will be eligible to
             participate in this study. Chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer must be measured
             and documented by prior CT, ERCP, or EUS.

          -  Patients should not have significant co-morbidities such as uncontrolled heart
             failure, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that would limit
             survivability of the sedation given or the procedure.

          -  Age &gt; or = to 18 years

          -  No evidence of significant active infection (ie. pneumonia, peritonitis, wound sepsis,
             etc)

          -  No evidence of serious ongoing illness such as uncontrolled metabolic disease
             (diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, etc)

          -  No evidence of dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the giving and
             understanding of informed consent, and no evidence of psychiatric risk that would
             preclude adequate compliance with this protocol.

          -  Patient must provide signed written informed consent.

          -  Patients that have had a previous celiac plexus block are eligible for this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient's celiac trunk should be imaged clearly under endoscopic ultrasound. The
             patient's celiac plexus should be accessed easily with a needle for the medication
             injection. If this cannot be done safely due to the patient's anatomy (intervening
             blood vessel or tumor), the patient will not be eligible for the procedure or study.
