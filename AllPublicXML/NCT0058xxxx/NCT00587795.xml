      Objectives:

      - To obtain clinical evidence for the safety and efficacy in using the StabilAir Wrist
      Fracture Brace for the following cases:

        1. Acute (emergency department) treatment of non-displaced, stable extra- articular distal
           radius fractures;

        2. To obtain comparative data between traditional therapies (sugar tong, plaster backslab,
           long arm or short arm cast) and the use of the StabilAir brace for each patient
           qualified by specific criteria.

      Hypothesis:

      1) For stable, non-displaced fractures, the StabilAir Brace is as effective as a sugar tong
      splint in the acute setting. 2) In cases where full forearm immobilization is initially
      preferred, the StabilAir is effective as a follow-up to sugar tong splitting once the need
      for full immobilization has passed.

      Data Collection and Study Design:

      This will be a single center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The investigators
      planned to collect data from 80 patients with undisplaced distal radius fractures. Half were
      to be treated with the plastic back slab or sugar tong splint (if there were an ulnar styloid
      fracture) and half were to be treated with the StabilAir splint. The initial treatment, which
      was to occur upon the patient's arrival at the emergency room and prior to study
      randomization, required full forearm and wrist immobilization in the acute phase treated with
      sugar tong splinting. At the patient's follow-up visit, which was to happen ≤10 days post
      injury and initial evaluation, when it was determined that full forearm immobilization was no
      longer necessary, patients were informed of the study, consented, and randomized (as in the
      flip of a coin) to one of the two study groups using a computerized randomization process
      that was controlled by the study coordinator. One study group was to consist of patients
      treated with either sugar tong splint or plaster casting and the other study group was to
      consist of patients treated with the StabilAir brace. Throughout entire study, the sugar tong
      splint/casting patients was to be the control group.

      Patients were to be asked to return for the following visits after they were randomized:

        -  10-14 days post randomization

        -  35 to 42 days (5 to 6 weeks) post randomization

        -  77 to 84 days (11 to 12 weeks) post randomization;

        -  And at 12 and 24 months.

      At each visit they were to have x-rays of their wrist and an exam with the physician. In
      addition, they were to be asked to complete questionnaires regarding their general health,
      daily activities and pain.
