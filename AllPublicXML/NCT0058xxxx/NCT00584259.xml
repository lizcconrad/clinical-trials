      Many patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) report that drinking coffee causes
      heartburn. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of coffee on
      gastro-esophageal acid reflux, and its relation to esophageal motility parameters in patients
      who are already scheduled to undergo 48 hour wireless pH testing as a result of having
      symptoms suggestive of GERD. The specific aims are to evaluate the effects of coffee on GERD
      during daily life and to elucidate the underlying pathogenic mechanism by which coffee
      induces reflux.
