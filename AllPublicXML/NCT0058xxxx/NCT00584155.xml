  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Lactated Ringer's solution is effective in
      patients undergoing chemotherapy with cisplatin for head and neck cancer in regards to
      cisplatin-induced hearing loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About one-third of people who have been given Cisplatin, as part of their chemotherapy
      treatment, develop hearing loss. The purpose of this study is to determine if some degree of
      hearing loss can be prevented by use of Lactated Ringer's solution in the middle ear. To
      study this, patients will use drops in their ears; Lactated Ringer's will be placed in one
      ear and an inactive saline solution will be placed in the other. Ofloxacin, an eardrop
      antibiotic will be placed in each ear at the same time. Each participant will receive a
      hearing evaluation before each dose of Cisplatin and another evaluation 2 to 4 weeks after
      the final treatment.
