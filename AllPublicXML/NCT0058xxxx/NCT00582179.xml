  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed as a prospective, randomized, comparative study evaluating the use
      of a negative pressure vacuum device in treating draining hematomas following traumatic
      injury.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Application of the VAC device may significantly decrease the incidence of draining hematomas
      that require surgical irrigation and debridement. The aim of this project is to perform a
      prospective, randomized study evaluating the VAC negative pressure device as a treatment for
      draining hematomas. We will also analyze the cost of treating a hematoma with a VAC compared
      with currently employed treatments. Additionally, we will document the incidence of infection
      of the hematoma with and without use of the VAC device.

      Patients who have a draining hematoma five days following surgery and who give informed
      consent to enter the study will be randomized into two groups. Group A will be patients
      treated with a pressure dressing and observation, which is the most common current method of
      treatment. Group B will be patients treated with a VAC negative pressure device. Patients
      will be carefully monitored for continued drainage by evaluating the wounds and dressings
      clinically. Patients in either group that are still draining at ten days following surgery
      will be taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement. Patients in either group
      who develop infection will be immediately treated with irrigation and debridement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who has had an orthopaedic surgical procedure following trauma and has a
             draining wound for at least five days

          -  No clinical evidence of infection

          -  Adult patient (19 years and older)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An infected hematoma. Infection will be defined by clinical signs and symptoms of
             infection that include increasing drainage, increasing pain, purulent drainage, and
             increasing erythema. Any hematomas that are thought to be infected will be cultured to
             confirm the diagnosis

          -  A surgical incision that can not be covered with VAC sponges and a water impermeable
             sheet (such Tegaderm) to achieve a closed vacuum environment over the wound

          -  Wounds associated with the surgical incision that are intentionally left open to heal
             with either a delayed primary closure or secondary granulation

          -  Abnormal coagulation leading to an expanding hematoma that will require surgical
             debridements

          -  Prisoners

          -  Pregnant Women

          -  Inability to comply with protocol

          -  Patients or family members who are unable or unwilling to sign study consent
