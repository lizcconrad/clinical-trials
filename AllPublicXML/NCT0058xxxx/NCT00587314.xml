  <detailed_description>

      To assess the effect of ablation therapy on Barrett's esophagus. Proposal Ablation therapy is
      an FDA approved treatment to decrease cancer risk in Barrett's esophagus mucosa. This is
      being performed in our Barrett's Esophagus Unit on a regular basis. However, the longterm
      outcomes of this therapy is not established and there are patients who have been treated who
      later re-develop Barrett's mucosa. This study will allow us store tissue samples that can
      later be used to assess the effect of ablative therapy on Barrett's esophagus.
