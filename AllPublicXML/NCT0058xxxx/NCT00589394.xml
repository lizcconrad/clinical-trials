  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of clear guidelines and studies addressing the proper response to the pneumococcal
      vaccine (Pneumovax ®) has hampered our ability to diagnosis and care for our immunodeficiency
      patients. Should an age matched normal response range to the Pneumovax ® be established, it
      would have a profound impact in the diagnosis, safety and care of immunodeficiency patients.
      Moreover, characterizing the B cell compartments response to the Pneumovax ® may better
      delineate the mechanism of protective immunity from Pneumovax ® and provide an additional
      tool for the diagnosis and care for immunodeficiency patients.

      The ability to respond to a polysaccharide vaccine antigen is an integral part of evaluating
      a patient with immunodeficiency. The pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax ®) remains the only
      readily available and the most widely used unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine. Although the
      pneumococcal vaccine is widely used test the immune systems response to a polysaccharide
      antigen, no clear guidelines or studies exist to what is considered a proper response to the
      Pneumovax ®. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) memory B cells are thought to play an important role in
      protection against pneumococcal disease. It is not known to what extent the ability of B
      cells to be activated in response to pneumococcal vaccination contributes to protective
      immunity. To address these issues, the following two specific aims are proposed:

      Specific Aim 1. Assess Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to pneumococcus pre- and
      post-pneumococcal immunization in healthy controls Specific Aim 2. Analysis of B cell subsets
      in blood of healthy controls pre-and post-pneumococcal immunization to identify changes in
      memory B cell, class switched and activated B cells.
