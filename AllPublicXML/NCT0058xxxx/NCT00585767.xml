        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females 18 years of age or older.

          -  All female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically accepted
             method of contraception at the time of the study.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide
             written and informed consent to participate, and agree to abide by the study
             requirements.

          -  Patients who have known or suspected hydronephrosis or patients with solitary kidneys.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known or suspected hypersensitivity to gadolinium-based agents.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients with a condition that is a contraindication to MRI (e.g., cardiac pacemaker,
             epicardial pacemaker leads, cochlear implants, ferromagnetic aneurysm clip,
             ferromagnetic halo device, or other conditions that would preclude patient proximity
             to a strong external magnetic field).

          -  Patients with a recent history of hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia or other
             hemoglobinopathy.

          -  Patients with a history of significant claustrophobia.

          -  Patients with impaired renal function based on 24-hr urine collection (creatinine
             clearance &lt;10 ml/min or serum creatinine &gt;1.8 mg/dl)
