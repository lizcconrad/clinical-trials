  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to test whether giving campath (also known as alemtuzumab) on a
      maintenance schedule will prolong the time until the patient requires chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, proof-of-principle study of Campath (also known as
      alemtuzumab) maintenance therapy administered subcutaneously at varying intervals for up to 1
      year. Ongoing prophylactic anti-infectives will be provided. Patients will be assessed for
      response every 2 months and for quality of life every 3 months while on treatment. Patients
      achieving a presumptive complete response will receive no further treatment but will be
      followed for response. Non-responding patients, with confirmed progressing disease following
      a minimum of 8 doses will be discontinued from treatment and followed for survival.
      Responding patients or patients with stable disease will undergo confirmatory assessment 2
      months following their end-of-treatment assessment. If remission has occurred, patients will
      be followed off treatment until documented disease progression.
