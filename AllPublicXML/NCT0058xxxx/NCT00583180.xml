  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of capsaicin as a potential analgesic drug for postoperative pain relies on the
      ability of capsaicin to induce membrane lysis of c-nerve fibers. In a previous randomized
      placebo controled blinded study of this effect we found a significant effect of capsaicin
      versus placebo. Before surgery all patients were examined by quantitative sensory testing to
      evaluate sensory function. In this study an identical sensory testing will examine if changes
      to the sensory function in capsaicin treated patients is identical to placebo treated
      patients.No new intervention will be performed
