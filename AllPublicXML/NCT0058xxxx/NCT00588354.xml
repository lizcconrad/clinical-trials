  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, blinded study of transforaminal epidural injection of clonidine versus
      a similar injection of corticosteroid for acute lumbosacral radiculopathy. The hypothesis was
      that clonidine will be as effective as steroid for this condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with approximately 3 months of low back pain and leg pain due to intervertebral disc
      herniation were randomized to transforaminal epidural injections of 2% lidocaine and either
      clonidine (200 or 400 micrograms) or triamcinolone (40 mg) (corticosteroid). Patients
      received one to three injections administered at about 2 weeks apart. Patients,
      investigators, and study coordinators were blinded to the treatment. The primary outcome was
      an 11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale at 1 month. The hypothesis was that
      clonidine will be as effective as steroid for this condition.

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire measures a patient's permanent functional disability. The questionnaire consists of 10 sections with 6 statements each of increasing point value (from 0 to 5). The score is a percentage of the total, with higher score showing greater disability. Minimum detectable change is 10%, with a 90% CI. Change of less than this may be attributable to error in measurement.</description>

    <description>The MPI is a comprehensive instrument comprised of 12 scales divided into three parts for assessing a number of dimensions of the chronic pain experience including pain intensity, emotional distress, cognitive and functional adaptation, and social support. Reference: Kearns RO, Turk DC, Rudy TC. The West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI). Pain 1985; 23:345-356. Subscales were not used; the DOS WHYMPI computer program version 2.1 was used to score the instrument. Scores range from 0 (no pain) to 100 (highest pain). A score of 50 is the mean for patients with chronic pain.</description>

        <title>Pain Disability Score at 2 Weeks as Measured by Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (ODI)</title>
        <description>This questionnaire measures a patient's permanent functional disability. The questionnaire consists of 10 sections with 6 statements each of increasing point value (from 0 to 5). The score is a percentage of the total, with higher score showing greater disability. Minimum detectable change is 10%, with a 90% CI. Change of less than this may be attributable to error in measurement.</description>

        <description>The MPI is a comprehensive instrument comprised of 12 scales divided into three parts for assessing a number of dimensions of the chronic pain experience including pain intensity, emotional distress, cognitive and functional adaptation, and social support. Reference: Kearns RO, Turk DC, Rudy TC. The West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI). Pain 1985; 23:345-356. Subscales were not used; the DOS WHYMPI computer program version 2.1 was used to score the instrument. Scores range from 0 (no pain) to 100 (highest pain). A score of 50 is the mean for patients with chronic pain.</description>
