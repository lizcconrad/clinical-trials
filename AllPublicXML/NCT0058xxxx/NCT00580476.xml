      The goal of this study is to learn more about how we measure depression in elderly cancer
      patients (patients aged 70 and older). Depression is one of the most common causes of
      emotional distress in the elderly and continues to be under-recognized. This is a problem
      because depression can have a negative impact on quality of life. The symptoms of depression
      are linked to poor health outcomes and higher costs of health care. In fact, depression is
      one of the top five concerns facing the elderly today.

      We have a few questionnaires that have been used to measure depression, but we do not know
      how these measures work with people with cancer. This study will help us answer this
      question. To complete this study, we need people who may or may not be feeling down or
      depressed.

      If you choose to take part, you will be asked to do the following:

        1. Fill out questionnaires that ask about:

             -  Your age, eduction, race, and income

             -  Your mood

           In all, these questionnaires will take about 10 minutes to complete.

        2. Answer questions about your mood. This will also take about 10 minutes to complete.
