      Prospective, two academic center, non-randomized pilot, acute in-patient study correlating
      pre-operative imaging studies, intra-operative measurements and intra-operative balloon
      aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) in patients with degenerative aortic stenosis undergoing surgical
      aortic valve replacement (SAVR) to understand the requirements (device size and radial
      strength) of emerging percutaneous heart valve technologies in the treatment of aortic
      stenosis.
