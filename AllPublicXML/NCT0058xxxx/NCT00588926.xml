  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation is commonly used for the treatment of movement disorders. Electrode
      positioning is usually performed under local anesthesia in fully awake patients. The
      procedure is uncomfortable to the patients who has to remain motionless during the whole
      surgery. Previous reports of electrode positioning under general anesthesia was found to be
      less accurate. This result was probably due to the effect of the anesthetics on the
      electrical activity of the basal ganglia.

      The purpose of this study is to detect possible changes in the electrical activity of the
      basal ganglia related to remifentanil sedation. electrical activity of single neurons will be
      recorded before, during and after sedation.

    <description>After the mapping electrode is in situ, recording of baseline electrical activity is done for two-three minutes and an infusion of Remifentanil, 0.1 microgram per kilogram per minute is started. This procedure continues for a few minutes until the patient is sedated and then the infusion is stopped and the patient allowed to recover. The recordings continue during the whole procedure.</description>
