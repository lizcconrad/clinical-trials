      This study will use PET scans, which is a type of x-ray test that uses a radiotracer, to see
      whether these scans may be better able to find places in the body where your prostate cancer
      may have spread.

    <textblock>
      Our preliminary studies have shown that whole body FDG-PET imaging identifies areas of
      abnormal metabolism in a majority of tumor sites in patients with progressive disease and
      that changes in FDG accumulation parallel changes in PSA after treatment. This suggests that
      changes in FDG metabolism may provide an early assessment of treatment outcomes. In previous
      work we established a methodology to examine a radiotracer in patients with progressive
      disease and abnormal imaging studies, which we have applied to the clinical states of
      non-castrate and castrate metastatic disease. This design is characterized by:

      1) Evaluation of uptake on a site-by-site basis in relation to conventional studies 2)
      Standardization of uptake values in tumor relative to a normal organ 3) Controlling for
      progression using standard measures of progression including a rising PSA, new or enlarging
      lesions on bone or transaxial imaging, and new symptoms of disease. In the present study we
      are evaluating fluorinated dihydrotestosterone (FDHT) in addition to FDG. FDHT is targeted to
      the AR and has been shown in preliminary studies to visualize prostate cancers in man. This
      study will apply our established methods to investigate FDHT imaging in patients with
      progressive prostate cancer. In the selected cases where tumor is available, we will study
      associations between FDHT accumulation and AR expression.

    <description>Registered patients will undergo PET scanning using either FDHT alone or FDG and FDHT depending on the clinical question being asked. Scans will be performed serially at baseline, week 4, week 12, and every 12 weeks of treatment up to a maximum of 8 FDHT/FDG scan set in a 12 month period (maximum 40 scan sets per lifetime) unless the therapeutic protocol or scientific rationale of the therapeutic drug being applied specifically dictates an alternative schedule. Patients may have blood drawn for the purposes of establishing the pharmacokinetics of FDHT and may also undergo an initial dynamic scan if further pharmacokinetic information is warranted, followed by a standard whole body image. If no further pharmacokinetic information is warranted, then patients will only undergo a standard whole body image.</description>
