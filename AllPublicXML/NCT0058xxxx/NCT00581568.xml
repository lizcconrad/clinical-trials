  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryogen Spray Cooling spurt is applied to the skin surface immediately before laser exposure.
      As liquid cryogen rapidly evaporates, the superficial skin temperature is reduced as a result
      of supplying the latent heat of vaporization. Tetrafluoroethane, an environmentally
      compatible, non-toxic, non-flammable freon substitute, has been demonstrated in multiple
      studies to be a safe and effective cooling agent and is the only cryogenic compound currently
      approved for dermatologic use by the Food and Drug Administration.

      The researcher can use laser treatment in combination with Cryogen Spray Cooling. The
      specific aim of this study is to characterize the clinical cutaneous effects of varying spurt
      durations and spurt delivery patterns that spurt durations of 100 ms or less will result in a
      very low incidence (less than 2%) of clinical skin effects (redness, blistering, local skin
      allergic reaction or skin discoloration) in any skin type.

      Researchers can use Cryogen Spray Cooling to protect the skin epidermis during laser therapy
      to decrease treatment pain, allow safe treatment of darker skin types, and safe use of high
      laser fluences. Cryogen Spray Cooling with Tetrafluoroethane has been incorporated into many
      Food and Drug Administration approved, commercially available laser devices currently used
      for treatment of vascular lesions, hair removal and non-ablative skin rejuvenation.
