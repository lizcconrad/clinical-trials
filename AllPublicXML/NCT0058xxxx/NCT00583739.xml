    <textblock>
      A randomized trial from the British National Health Service found that supervised exercise
      benefits women with early stage breast cancer with improved functional and psychological
      benefit after a 12-week intervention and 6 months later. Considering the needs of breast
      cancer patients and survivors and the reported benefits of exercise and yoga intervention,
      the investigators propose a pilot study of an 8-week yoga intervention in breast cancer
      patients. This study would specifically address measures of fatigue and psychosocial distress
      in the population of breast cancer patients during treatment and within the year following
      treatment. Currently there is very limited literature on yoga intervention in this
      population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential subjects must have had histologically or cytologically confirmed breast
             cancer. This includes, but is not limited to: breast cancer-in situ; ductal carcinoma
             in situ; lobular carcinoma in situ; cystosarcoma phyllodes; inflammatory breast
             carcinoma; invasive breast carcinoma; and breast cancer not otherwise specified;
             cancer must be stage 0 through stage III.

          -  Treatment completion within the past calendar year.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years. While breast cancer can occur in the pediatric population, the
             pediatric population is best served by trials specifically designed for their age
             group.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.

          -  Karnofsky ≥ 60%; see Appendix A.

          -  Women of childbearing potential are eligible for this study.

          -  Pregnant women are eligible for this study pending a doctor's note.

          -  The ability to understand and complete the study questionnaires.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients with known metastasis.

          -  Patients who are actively participating in a yoga class.

          -  Known uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise
             subject health during yoga.
