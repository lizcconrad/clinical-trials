  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the role of SISCOM (see below) in aiding clinicians to
      manage epilepsy surgery candidates. SISCOM is already a routine component of pre-surgical
      epilepsy evaluation at Mayo Clinic. In particular, we are interested in assessing whether use
      of SISCOM can minimize the need for prolonged (&gt;24 hours) invasive monitoring with electrodes
      placed on the surface of the brain prior to surgical resection.

      Note: this study has recruited the required number of patients and is closed to further
      enrolment.

    <textblock>
      Successful epilepsy surgery depends on accurate identification of the area of brain from
      which seizures originate (the epileptogenic zone). There are many non-invasive tests
      (including EEG and MRI) to indicate this area. Some patients require implantation of
      intracranial electrodes in order to determine the epileptogenic zone. A test known as SISCOM
      (subtraction ictal-interictal SPECT co-registered with MRI) has been validated as a
      non-invasive means of indicating the epileptogenic zone. However, this test is not widely
      available in the US, and it is not known how often the additional information provided by
      SISCOM makes a difference to clinical decision-making.

      In order to determine the contribution of SISCOM towards clinical decision-making in epilepsy
      surgery candidates, we will ask epileptologists at Mayo Clinic to consider case presentations
      given all clinical information except for SISCOM results, and then to reconsider those same
      cases in conjunction with SISCOM data. This will indicate the degree to which SISCOM
      influences decision making.

      50 patients at Mayo Clinic (38 adults, 12 children) will be enrolled.
