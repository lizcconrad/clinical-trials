  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how people's diets, other aspects of their lifestyles,
      and their individual genetic makeup affect their chances of getting endometrial cancer
      (cancer of the uterus).

      This survey will enroll several hundred women who have or have had endometrial cancer and
      several hundred who do not. We will compare these two groups of women to see what factors may
      lead to endometrial cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a population-based case-control study in six counties of New Jersey. Cases
      will be women with newly-diagnosed endometrial or ovarian cancer. Controls will be matched by
      5-year age groups and selected by random digit dialing (for those under 65), from Centers for
      Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) files (for those 65 and over), or from neighborhood
      sampling. Controls will not have had a hysterectomy.

      There will be 400 cases with endometrioid tumors, 60 with serous tumors or clear cell tumors,
      300 with ovarian cancer, and 400 controls. In addition, there will be a small group of black
      women included from MSKCC.

      We will interview participants about known and potential risk factors for endometrial and
      ovarian cancer and obtain information on diet. We will obtain DNA for genetic analysis from
      buccal specimens collected using a mouthwash rinse method. We will use logistic regression to
      determine odds ratios for disease with various exposures. For endometrial cancer, we will
      examine the association of risk with genotypes in strata defined by body mass index and
      dietary fat consumption.

    <description>The main questionnaire will cover established risk and protective factors for endometrial and ovarian cancer, as well as other possible risk factors. This includes: menstrual history; pregnancy history; use of hormones for menopausal symptoms or other reasons; smoking history; height and weight; use of oral contraceptives and other methods of birth control; family history of cancer; medical history; demographic characteristics. We will also collect dietary data using the Gladys Block questionnaire, to which we have added a supplement to measure consumption of phytoestrogens. We will also obtain a buccal sample from each respondent as the source of DNA for genetic analysis.</description>

        In collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services NJDHSS), we
        will use rapid case ascertainment to identify patients as they are diagnosed.For controls
        aged 65 and over, we will obtain lists from CMS of a sample of women in the 6 counties. As
        an alternative way of reaching controls, we will conduct area sampling.
