      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the equivalency of the skin test reactivity
      to penicilloate prepared by our new method of penicilloate preparation versus our old method
      of penicilloate preparation. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      significance of the different diastereoisomers of penicilloate on skin test reactivity.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the equivalency of the skin test reactivity
      to penicilloate prepared by our new method of penicilloate preparation versus our old method
      of penicilloate preparation. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      significance of the different diastereoisomers of penicilloate on skin test reactivity.

      Five (5) adult subjects without a history of penicillin allergy and fifteen (15) adult
      subjects with a history of penicillin allergy and previous positive penicillin skin test to
      the minor determinant (penicilloate) and/or major determinant (penicilloyl) will be enrolled
      into the study. Each subject will be skin tested with our current penicillin skin test which
      includes penicilloate conducted in the Division of Allergic Diseases will be compared the
      skin test of our penicilloate prepared by our newer method along with the different
      diastereoisomers of penicilloic acid on the same day and time. The adult subjects without a
      history of penicillin allergy will serve as our control.

    <description>Prick skin tests will be performed on the volar surface of the forearm with each penicilloate and control reagents. The skin test sites will be examined at 15 minutes. A positive test result is defined as a wheal of 3x3 mm or greater with a surrounding zone of erythema. Patients with negative prick test results to penicillin will undergo intradermal testing.
Intradermal skin tests will be performed on the volar surface of the forearm. The test reagents will be injected intradermally to produce an initial wheal of 2x2 mm. The skin test sites will be examined at 15 minutes. A positive intradermal test is defined as a wheal of 3x3 mm or greater with a surrounding zone of erythema. In order to ensure patient safety, we will consider using an end point titration technique.</description>
