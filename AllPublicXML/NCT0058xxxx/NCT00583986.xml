  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the reliability, ruggedness and safety of the top mounted
      actuation indicator (TMAI) when used with Levalbuterol HFA MDI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, TMAI study with Levalbuterol HFA MDI in adult and
      pediatric subjects with asthma or COPD. Period I: One week, open-label, run-in period during
      which subjects must have asthma or COPD symptoms requiring use of, as needed, Levalbuterol
      HFA MDI(without TMAI) on at least half of the days [4-12 actuations on a single day]. Period
      II: Nine week, open-label period during which subjects will use the Levalbuterol HFA MDI with
      TMAI PRN. The total study duration for a subject will not exceed 10 weeks. This study was
      previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired by Dainippon
      Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to Sunovion
      Pharmaceuticals Inc.
