  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how effective celecoxib is in limiting production of a
      hormone, prostaglandin, in the subject's body. It is felt that this hormone is involved in
      the evolution of pre-cancerous growths in the colon to cancerous stage or in the progression
      of an existing cancer. To answer this question, some subjects are given the new
      investigational drug, and other subjects a placebo. A placebo is a capsule that contains
      inactive ingredients. Only by comparing the response of two subject groups, one receiving
      placebo (inactive), and one receiving celecoxib (active), will we be able to know whether or
      not celecoxib actually works. The outcome we are assessing is the hormone activity before and
      after celecoxib is given.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test the hypothesis that celecoxib, a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase -2
      (COX-2), will effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity in all tissues sampled after oral
      administration of celecoxib for 7 days preoperatively. One hundred twenty patients (120)
      undergoing standard surgical resection for the treatment of primary colorectal adenomas or
      carcinomas would be randomized to celecoxib or placebo given for 7 days prior to operation.
      Peripheral blood will be drawn prior to drug or placebo administration, and then morning of
      operation. At the time of definitive resection of the specimen, normal intestinal mucosa and
      primary tumor would be harvested and immediately snap frozen at -80 degrees. Levels of COX-2
      activity (prostaglandin production) as well as expression of COX-2 and other markers (matrix
      metalloproteinases(MMPs), tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), cell adhesion and cell cycle
      control molecules will be evaluated in normal mucosa and primary tumor compared between
      celecoxib and placebo treated patients.

    <measure>Number of Subjects Witha Change (IMPROVEMENT) in Colo-rectal Adenocarcinoma as Measured by Cyclooxygenase-2 Activity After 7 Days of Celecoxib</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Colo-Rectal adenocarcinoma will be measured by cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) activity at 7 days post baseline. Cox-2 activity is measured by assessing tumors and normal tissue using &quot;Electron microscope and Tandem mass Spectrometry&quot; methodology though the UAB shared Mass Spectrometry facility. Improvement was measured by 2-fold increase in COX-2 activity from baseline. The methodology used was High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC). additional studies include expression of genes thought to be important in colorectal carcinogenesis: COX-1 and 2, MMP, 2 7, and 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases(TIMPs) 1 ans 2 and beta-catenin.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Mass suspicious for carcinoma, clinical diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon (to
             be histologically confirmed upon study entry) or an adenoma that is not removable by
             endoscopy.

          2. Patient must be undergoing colo-rectal resection

          3. age &gt; 18yrs

          4. Karnofsky performance status(KPS) &gt; 60.

          5. Signed and dated informed consent.

          6. Complete history and physical examination within 30 days of study entry.

          7. Laboratory evaluations within 30 days of study entry to include: Complete Blood
             Count(CBC) with differential and platelets, Blood Urea Nitrogen(BUN), creatinine,
             bilirubin, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic
             transaminase(SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase(LDH), alkaline phosphatase, total protein,
             albumin and carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA).

          8. Chest x-ray within 30 days of study entry.

          9. The subject has no other serious medical illness, other than that treated by this
             study, which would limit the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy, or
             psychiatric condition which would prevent informed consent.

        Absolute exclusion criteria:

          1. severe infection ;White Blood Cell Count(WBC) &gt; 2 times normal, fever, sepsis)

          2. immunosuppression (steroids, transplant patient)

          3. emergent operation(perforation, obstruction).

          4. Patients with serum bilirubin or creatinine levels greater than two times the normal
             upper limit would be excluded.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women or subjects of child bearing age who do not practice
             effective means of birth control

          6. Sulfonamide allergy

          7. Recurrent or previous history of known ischemic heart disease or thrombotic events as

        Relative exclusion criteria:

          1. Medications taken by the patient that are listed in section 9.0 of this protocol would
             be reviewed by the enlisting physician prior to entry into the study. Warfarin,
             aspirin and methotrexate would be stopped prior to protocol entry as these are stopped
             prior to any surgery. The most common of the listed medications would be ACE
             inhibitors and furosemide. The dose, schedule and indications of the medications would
             be reviewed with the patient and a decision regarding entry into the study would be
             made by the enlisting physician. Other less common medications will be similarly
             reviewed, however most had little or no clinical side effects despite potential
             biochemical interactions.

          2. Medications known to be COX inhibitors would have to be stopped prior to entry into
             the study. This would include any aspirin,nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs(NSAID)
             (ibuprofen, naproxen, rofecoxib, celecoxib, Mobic, etc) or over the counter cold
             medication that might contain these substances. A list of common over-the-counter
             medications that might contain such substances will be reviewed with the patient and
             if there are any questions after the study has begun, instructions to call before
             taking any medications will be given.

        <title>Number of Subjects Witha Change (IMPROVEMENT) in Colo-rectal Adenocarcinoma as Measured by Cyclooxygenase-2 Activity After 7 Days of Celecoxib</title>
        <description>The Colo-Rectal adenocarcinoma will be measured by cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2) activity at 7 days post baseline. Cox-2 activity is measured by assessing tumors and normal tissue using &quot;Electron microscope and Tandem mass Spectrometry&quot; methodology though the UAB shared Mass Spectrometry facility. Improvement was measured by 2-fold increase in COX-2 activity from baseline. The methodology used was High Performance Liquid Chromatography(HPLC). additional studies include expression of genes thought to be important in colorectal carcinogenesis: COX-1 and 2, MMP, 2 7, and 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases(TIMPs) 1 ans 2 and beta-catenin.</description>
