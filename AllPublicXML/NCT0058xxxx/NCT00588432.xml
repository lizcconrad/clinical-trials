  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is two-fold: (1) to further develop and validate a technology,
      magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), for quantitatively imaging mechanical properties and
      tension distribution in muscle and (2) to apply the technique for in vivo evaluation of
      patients with four common, and clinically significant muscle disorders (spasticity, disuse
      atrophy, myofascial pain and a metabolic myopathy). These studies will employ a magnetic
      resonance imaging sequence with synchronous motion-sensitizing gradients to map propagating
      shear waves in the muscle. The technique will assess the mechanical properties of the muscle
      and its tension distribution. Specifically, the study can be divided into three specific
      aims. Aim 1: Optimize MRE methods of acquisition and analysis for the assessment of muscle,
      including electromechanical drivers, data acquisition techniques, and methods for image
      analysis. Advanced techniques for very rapid MRE assessment of muscle will continue to be
      developed. Aim 2: Validate the MRE assessment of muscle properties and tension with phantom,
      ex-vivo muscle, and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) techniques. Finite Element Analysis will be
      performed by using both phantom and bovine muscles to better correlate MRE wave-length
      findings as function of muscle properties, tension and fiber architecture. Aim 3: Study In
      Vivo Normal and Abnormal Muscle. The MRE technique will be applied in vivo to provide
      elastographic images of abnormal muscle with known disorders. The patient groups chosen for
      study are each important in their own right, and furnish unique information across the
      spectrum of muscular disease and dysfunction. Groups to be studied include individuals with
      new onset of spasticity following an ischemic, hemispheric stroke, disuse atrophy as a result
      of immobilization, metabolic (hyperthyroid) myopathy and myofascial pain for trigger point
      identification. The overall hypothesis of this work is that will bring benefits to both basic
      research and clinical care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Normals:

          -  Healthy individuals

        Stroke:

          -  a first stroke (i.e., a unilateral, ischemic hemispheric stroke) within the previous
             one to two months, ability to cooperate and follow simple commands, and gastrocsoleous
             strength in the affected lower extremity of between trace and 50% of normal.

        Immobilization:

          -  immobilized in a cast (typically 6 weeks) following sugical repair of a severe
             Achilles tendon tear or rupture, ankle injury or plantar fascial pain

        Myofascial Pain:

          -  history of pain in trapezius confirmed by clincal examination. The examiner will
             perform snapping palpation over the MFTP. If a localized, transient contraction is
             observed, the response is considered to be positive and the subject will be considered
             eligible for entry into the study.

        Hyperthyroid Myopathy:

          -  clinical assessment in combination with a serum hormone profile of increased Free
             Thyroxine (FT4) and Triiodothyronine (T3) in the face of suppressed levels of Thyroid
             Stimulating Hormone (TSH).
