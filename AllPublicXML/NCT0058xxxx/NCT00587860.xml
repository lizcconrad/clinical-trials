    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if St. John's wort helps people with irritable bowel
      syndrome, otherwise known as &quot;IBS&quot;. St. John's wort is a herbal supplement derived from the
      St. John's wort plant. It has been shown to be helpful in several medical conditions such as
      depression as well as other pain syndromes.

    <measure>Overall Bowel Symptom Scores (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point was the overall self-reported BSS after 12 weeks of therapy for all randomized participants to assess for differences between treatment groups at the end of the treatment period (12 weeks).
The BSS is a 100-mm visual analog scale for the different symptoms of IBS (pain/discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity). Symptoms on the BSS can range from 0 = no pain to 100 = extreme pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bowel Symptom Score (BSS) Amongst Subgroups</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Median (average) BSS amongst the different IBS subgroups (diarrhea, constipation, pain, and bloating). The BSS is a 100-mm visual analog scale for the different symptoms of IBS (pain/discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity). Symptoms on the BSS can range from 0 = no pain to 100 = extreme pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adequate Relief ≤ 50% During the Last 4 Weeks of Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 4 weeks of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who reported &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to having adequate relief of their IBS symptoms at least 50% during the last 4 weeks of therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Quality of Life (IBS-QoL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The IBS-QOL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBS-QOL was measured at baseline, week 12 and week 24. The individual responses to the 34 items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We measured CES-D Score at baseline as well as bi-weekly throughout the study. The CES-D is a self-reported 20 question survey designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. The possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>IBS Symptoms Moderately or a Lot Better</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who stated their IBS symptoms were moderately better or a lot better at 24 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bowel Symptom Score (BSS) at 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BSS is a five question, 100-mm visual analog scale of four IBS symptoms (pain/discomfort, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea), and an overall severity scale. The best possible value would be 0 (no symptoms) and the worst is 500 (severe symptoms). BSS was assessed on a bi-weekly basis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were identified through community, institutional advertisement, clinicaltrials.gov, through the IFFGD webpage as well as through the outpatient clinics beginning in February 2006. Participants who participated in previous IBS studies were also mailed a recruitment letter to ask if they would be interested in participating.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>For this study, there was a 2-week screening and enrollment phase. During this period, participants were screened, a symptom questionnaire was completed, and there was a physician exam. After the in-person screening visit, a phone call was made prior to mailing the study materials to ensure the participant was still willing to participate.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The BSS is a five question, 100-mm visual analog scale of four IBS symptoms (pain/discomfort, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea), and an overall severity scale. The best possible value would be 0 (no symptoms) and the worst is 500 (severe symptoms). BSS was assessed on a bi-weekly basis.</description>

The CES-D is a self-reported 20 question survey designed to measure depressive symptomatology in the general population. The possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology.</description>

          <description>The IBS-QOL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBS-QOL was measured at baseline, week 12 and week 24. The individual responses to the 34 items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life.</description>

The BSS is a 100-mm visual analog scale for the different symptoms of IBS (pain/discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, and overall severity). Symptoms on the BSS can range from 0 = no pain to 100 = extreme pain.</description>

        <description>The IBS-QOL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBS-QOL was measured at baseline, week 12 and week 24. The individual responses to the 34 items are summed and averaged for a total score and then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS specific quality of life.</description>
