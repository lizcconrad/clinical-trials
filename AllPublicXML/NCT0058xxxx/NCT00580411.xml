        We wish to study individuals who meet lifetime criteria for alcohol dependence, abuse or
        heavy drinking and who self-report current insomnia.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 18-70, may be male or female, and from any ethnic
             background.

          -  Individuals must have the capacity to give IRB-approved study consent.

          -  Subjects must at least have a lifetime history of being heavy alcohol drinkers (i.e.,
             drinks approximately 21 alcoholic drinks or more per week). Alternatively, subjects
             are eligible if they meet criteria for a lifetime history of either alcohol dependence
             or alcohol abuse. Overall, a subject must meet at least one of these alcohol criteria:
             a lifetime history of heavy drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.

          -  Subjects must have a complaint of chronic insomnia, reporting either six or less hours
             TST, on average at least three times per week.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Potential subjects with a lifetime diagnosis of Bipolar Affective Disorder,
             Schizophrenia, Borderline Personality Disorder, dementia of any type, or epilepsy will
             not be admitted to the study.

          -  Subjects will be excluded with a diagnosis of any other substance dependence syndrome
             other than alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, and/or caffeine dependence.
             However, individuals may have a history of episodic abuse of cannabis, cocaine,
             sedatives/hypnotics and opiates, amphetamines, and hallucinogens. Also, subjects may
             be on prescription benzodiazepine or related sedative/hypnotic therapy.

          -  Any condition or treatment of a condition that is likely to confound the experimental
             design or the results will be prohibited by the PI.
