  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insertion of electrode array in scala vestibuli, rather than the preferred location within
      scala tympani, leads to loss of native hearing in those patients with isolated high-frequency
      hearing loss undergoing cochlear implantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to determine the surgical placement in patients with high frequency who had long
      electrode array insertions because they did not meet audiometric criteria for short array
      devices.

      From this basis we will be able to determine if suboptimal insertion (e.g., in the scala
      vestibuli) leads to loss of low-frequency hearing in these patients. We also will look at the
      possibilities of using this data in predicting outcomes, modifying implant design, and
      perfecting surgical technique.
