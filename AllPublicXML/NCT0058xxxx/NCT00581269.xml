  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The oxidative stress and inflammatory state is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of
      atherosclerosis, and is predictive of cardiovascular events and mortality rates in the
      general population and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in patients
      with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis therapy 1. Increased oxidative stress and
      inflammation has been identified in all stages of CKD, ranging from moderate renal
      insufficiency to ESRD. However, the pathophysiology of increased oxidative stress and
      inflammation associated with the development of CKD is currently poorly understood.

      There is also concern about the epidemic of obesity in the United States, as the overall
      health status of the general population is adversely affected by increasing adiposity. Recent
      studies indicate a strong relationship between adiposity and incident CKD. Furthermore, the
      presence of an elevated body mass index (BMI) is an independent predictor for progression to
      ESRD, even after additional adjustments for baseline blood pressure and the presence or
      absence of diabetes mellitus. Limited data in the general population show that healthy
      lifestyle interventions, such as exercise and dietary caloric restriction, either alone or in
      combination, reduce the inflammatory and oxidative stress burden seen in obese subjects. The
      impact of healthy lifestyle modifications on inflammation and oxidative stress has not been
      investigated in the obese CKD population. Based on the foregoing observations, the purpose of
      this investigation will be to determine whether healthy lifestyle interventions in the form
      of low-impact aerobic exercise and dietary calorie restriction in obese subjects (BMI ≥
      30kg/m2) with moderate to severe (Stage III-IV) CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (GFR) 20-59 ml/min] will improve oxidative stress, inflammation, insulin resistance,
      adipocytokines, endothelial dysfunction, and quality of life.
