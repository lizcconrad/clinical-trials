  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fulvestrant has proven effective in the treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic
      breast cancer. The dose used in studies so far has been well tolerated and may be too low for
      optimal effectiveness. In this study, a higher dose will be used to see whether an improved
      outcome will result.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Fulvestrant will be administered by intramuscular injection on day 1, day 15 and day 29
           and then every 28 days thereafter.

        -  Participants will have a physical examination and blood work performed on each treatment
           date. After teh study treatment has been completed, the physical examinations will be
           done every three months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for years 2-5, and
           annually after 5 years.

        -  Participants may remain on study treatment until disease progression or until they
           experience serious side effects.
