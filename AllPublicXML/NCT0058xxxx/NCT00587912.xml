  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain clinical specimens from pathologists and physicians
      involved in the diagnosis and care of patients with AIDS and non-AIDS associated
      malignancies.

      The National Cancer Institute has set up a Bank for tissues and biological fluids from
      HIVpositive and HIV-negative individuals in order to have specimens available for scientists
      studying malignancies associated with HIV disease.

      The overall goal of the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Bank is to obtain clinical specimens from
      pathologists and physicians involved in the diagnosis and care of patients with AIDS and non-
      AIDS associated malignancies. These specimens will be banked and linked to a clinical data
      set so that experimental results obtained by analysis of specific specimens can be linked to
      relevant clinical data. Contents of the ACSB will be made available to researchers through an
      application to the National Cancer Institute. Strict patient confidentiality protection
      guidelines are in place for all specimens in the ACSB. The objective of this protocol is to
      obtain clinical specimens from potential participants in clinical trials conducted by the
      AIDS Malignancies Consortium, and from other patients with and without HIV infection, who
      have AIDS-Associated malignancies.

        and cancer who are not eligible for participation in AMC trials, and patients without HIV
        who have malignancies associated with HIV or with immunosuppression.
