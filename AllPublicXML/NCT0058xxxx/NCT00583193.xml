  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Duloxetine (Cymbalta®) is an effective
      treatment in reducing the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duloxetine has established efficacy for treatment of major depression, generalized anxiety
      disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. Chronic PTSD is often treated with
      antidepressants, in fact there are only two FDA-approved treatments for PTSD. Yet many
      chronic PTSD patients, especially male combat veterans, have a limited response to
      antidepressant treatment (Baker et al, 1995; Cañive et al, 1998; Hertzsberg et al 2000) and
      new pharmacotherapies should be investigated.
