    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility study to determine if a combined breast PET/CT scanner can image
      malignant functional activity while determining anatomical structure in the same clinical
      setting for patients with breast cancer. End-points of this study are whether women will
      accept the imaging position and timing, and whether functional properties of breast cancer
      can be imaged with this device. The secondary purpose of this study is to explore protocol
      parameters with a view to optimizing imaging performance whilst minimizing patient
      discomfort. Imaging results will be compared to histological samples to determine ground
      truth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET is literally a molecular imaging modality. In monitoring the patient's response to a
      specific chemotherapeutic regime, baseline and subsequent PET/CT scans can be used to
      quantitatively determine the therapeutic effect of the regime, using the standard uptake
      value (SUV), a common metric in PET imaging. The breast PET/CT system will facilitate
      molecular imaging of breast cancer using a number of radiolabeled molecules, available both
      commercially (18-FDG) and from the research environment.
