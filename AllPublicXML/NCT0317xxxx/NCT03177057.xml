      This pilot clinical trial studies how well Self Monitoring And Readiness Texting (SMART)
      project works in sun exposure and protection behaviors. Measuring how behavior tracking and
      individually tailored messages affect risk behaviors in patients with skin cancer may help
      doctors plan the best prevention plan and decrease national melanoma incidence and mortality.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the effects of a behavior tracking and individually-tailored daily text message
      intervention on sun protection and exposure behaviors and to see if these techniques will be
      most effective in conjunction or separately.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine mediators in the effects of the intervention on safe sun behaviors, based on
      Fishbein?s Integrative Model.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 study arms.

      ARM I (SELF-MONITORING): Patients complete tanning and sun protection usage entries daily for
      14 days.

      ARM II (TEXT MESSAGES): Patients receive individualized text messages based on baseline
      assessment of tanning motives (appearance, enjoyment, social) daily for 14 days.

      ARM III (COMBINED GROUP): Patients complete tanning and sun protection usage entries and also
      receive individualized text messages daily for 14 days.

      ARM IV (CONTROL GROUP): Patients complete study assessments.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple variable regression models will be performed to examine the effect of the intervention on the outcomes. All post-baseline outcomes will be used as dependent variables. The baseline scores, intervention group, and time of the assessment will be included. To account for the within subject correlation of the responses, we will fit the model using Generalized Estimating Equations assuming an autoregressive working correlation matrix for each subject. Any p-value from the pairwise comparison that is less than 0.05 will be considered worthy of further study.</description>

    <measure>Mediators and moderators of the intervention on behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mediation will be assessed by examining indirect effects, with bootstrapped confidence intervals to be calculated around the mediated effects. For participants who use the self-monitoring app, hierarchical linear modeling will be used to examine associations between tanning and sun protection as they occur daily, and motives for doing so. Using lagged multi-level models, the within-person model allows for assessment of individual change in behavior over the two-week time period, as well as the effect of each day?s behavior on behavior occurring on subsequent days. The between-person model allo</description>
