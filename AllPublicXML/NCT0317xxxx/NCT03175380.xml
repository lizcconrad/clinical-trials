  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will use leukapheresis to collect lymphocytes to study immune responses
      following vaccination with BCG in BCG-naïve participants. These studies will include, but not
      necessarily be limited to: anti-T-cell and anti-Natural Killer (NK) T-cell responses,
      anti-lipid responses, and antibody responses to BCG following re-vaccination. These responses
      will provide a detailed framework characterizing the immune responses that are induced and
      responses that are not induced in humans by BCG, a partially protective TB vaccine. This
      framework will allow new hypotheses to be formulated and tested regarding what new and more
      effective TB vaccines should target for optimal protective immunity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label protocol in up to 15 healthy adults who are BCG-naïve. All participants
      will receive a total of two doses of BCG, by intradermal injection, approximately 6 months
      apart. Participants will be followed by a combination of visits and telephone contacts
      through Study Day 264. Participants will undergo TST testing 3 months after the second BCG
      vaccination and QuantiFERON TB Gold in-Tube (QTBGT), or the equivalent, if necessary. Two BCG
      vaccinations given 6 months apart were chosen for this study to give optimal T cell and
      antibody responses for future study. Leukapheresis will be conducted prior to the first BCG
      vaccination and at 56 days after the second BCG vaccination (Hoft, 2002; Brown, 2003; de
      Valliere, 2005). The final leukapheresis timing was selected based on results from functional
      biological assays, which suggest analysis of samples at this time point may provide insight
      into the protective immune responses elicited by BCG, and on results of prior clinical trials
      describing the peak immune responses to BCG (Hoft, 2002; Brown, 2003; de Valliere, 2005). The
      study will be conducted at a single site in the US (Saint Louis University [SLU]).
