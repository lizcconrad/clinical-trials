  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco-related diseases account for a significant portion of all VA healthcare costs and are
      a detriment to the health and quality of life of our Veterans. Despite progress in
      instituting tobacco screenings and treatment referral, most Veterans still do not receive the
      most effective strategy to help them quit smoking - pharmacotherapy combined with behavioral
      coaching. This study builds on findings from population health and mobile interventions to
      help more Veterans receive evidence-based tobacco treatment. The investigators propose to
      test the effect of two types of text messaging in combination with telephone cessation
      counseling: 1) pre-counseling text messages to increase enrollment in counseling, and 2)
      ongoing texts for those who start counseling that provide appointment reminders and support
      between sessions to increase adherence to counseling. This study supports multiple goals of
      the VA's Blueprint for Excellence. Results will directly inform decision-making and
      population-based care models for tobacco treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use remains the number one cause of premature death and morbidity in the United
      States, and tobacco-related diseases account for 24% of all VA healthcare costs. The VA has
      been a leader in addressing tobacco use, having implemented annual tobacco screening and made
      pharmacotherapy readily available. However, one of the most cost-effective services -
      telephone quit lines - remain highly underused. Few Veterans enroll in telephone counseling
      to help them quit smoking, and among Veterans who begin telephone counseling, few complete a
      full course. The advent of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled new strategies for
      ensuring that patients receive preventive services. These methods can reduce provider burden
      and close gaps in systems of care. The investigators' research team has conducted numerous
      studies using EHRs to identify smokers and proactively reach out to coordinate telephone
      tobacco treatment. While the investigators have successfully implemented this approach, the
      overall enrollment rates for counseling remain low and the majority of smokers complete only
      one counseling session. Therefore, the investigators propose to test novel mHealth strategies
      for promoting enrollment in and adherence to telephone counseling. The Specific Aims are to:
      1) Conduct a sequentially randomized trail to estimate the effectiveness of text messaging
      for increasing enrollment in and adherence to telephone tobacco treatment, 2) Compare rates
      of tobacco cessation between patients who received and did not receive text messaging during
      treatment, and 3) Evaluate patient experiences with these interventions. Using the VA EHR,
      the investigators will identify N=3,600 smokers at three VA sites. All identified smokers
      will be mailed an introductory packet with information about the study. Patients who mail
      back a consent will be randomized to standard telephone outreach for counseling or to receive
      8 educational texts to counter barriers of participating in counseling prior to telephone
      outreach. Patients who enroll in tobacco treatment will then be randomized to receive
      standard telephone counseling or to also receive appointment reminders and supportive texts
      throughout the 8-week counseling period. The investigators hypothesize that these approaches
      will increase the rate of enrollment in telephone tobacco cessation and 12-month
      biochemically validated abstinence (primary outcomes) over standard telephone counseling
      approaches. The investigators will also assess patient experiences with each texting
      protocol. The investigators' overarching goal is to investigative innovative mHealth
      strategies for increasing Veteran use of telephone-based tobacco cessation counseling and to
      improve quit rates. This research, exploring both population-based outreach and text
      messaging, advances multiple goals set forth by the VA's Blueprint for Excellence. Results
      will have direct implications to inform decision-making and population-based care models for
      tobacco treatment.
