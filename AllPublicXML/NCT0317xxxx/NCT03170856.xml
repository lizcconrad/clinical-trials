  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who sustain a concussion will undergo a sub-maximal exercise protocol throughout
      their recovery. Cerebrovascular function, heart rate, and symptom duration will be monitored
      throughout.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been recent change to the management of concussion, including the addition of
      exercise while a patient may still be experiencing symptoms. Some patients will be given a
      dose-dependent exercise prescription based on their own sub-maximal output. They will
      aerobically exercise at this given threshold for 8 weeks, while heart rate and symptom
      duration is tracked. Some patients will only follow physician prescribed exercise, while
      undergoing the same heart rate and symptom monitoring for 8 weeks.

    <description>Subjects will participate in aerobic exercise 5 days a week. This includes walking, biking, jogging and running. While participating in these activities, they will be wearing their Polar Wrist Unit and Heart Rate Monitor to help subjects track their exercise intensity. They will exercise for 60 minutes 5times a week at 60% of their maximum heart rate or 80% of their symptom limited heart rate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Experienced a concussion within the last 2 weeks. Concussion will be diagnosed by
             board-certified sports medicine physicians, and defined as a direct or indirect blow
             to the head, face, neck, or elsewhere that manifests with the presence of symptoms and
             neurological impairment

          -  Low or moderate cardiac risk according to American College of Sports Medicine

          -  Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) score greater than 9

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of neurological surgery

          -  Seizure disorder

          -  Use of medication or medical device that would alter heart rate, blood pressure or
             autonomic function

          -  Any current, serious, chronic medical or psychiatric disease that, in the Principal
             Investigator's judgment, may interfere with study participation or data integrity
