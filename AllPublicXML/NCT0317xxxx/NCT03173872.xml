  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the past few years, the military has been looking for an innovative way to decrease the
      use of opioids for chronic pain. This has prompted military treatment facilities to begin
      integrating complementary and/or alternative medicine modalities into their conventional
      plans of care. Reiki, a bio-field energy therapy, is one such modality. The purpose of this
      prospective repeated measure study is to: 1) introduce the concept Reiki therapy to military
      healthcare beneficiaries experiencing chronic pain, 2) assess pain outcome after receiving
      six treatments of Reiki therapy, and 3) assess participant's impression of Reiki therapy as a
      possible complementary and/or alternative option for the management of chronic pain.

      Thirty military healthcare beneficiaries with the complaint of chronic pain will receive a
      brief introduction to Reiki therapy followed by six 30-minute Reiki sessions provided by
      trained Reiki Level 1 Practitioner. Participant's knowledge of Reiki will be assessed using
      pre and post questionnaires; pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory, Defense
      Veterans Pain Rating Scale, DoD (Department of Defense) VA (Veteran's Administration) Pain
      Supplementary Questionnaire, McGill Pain Questionnaire and pain medication diaries; and
      participant's impression will be assessed using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement
      Scale and along with a post study questionnaire. If it is found that Reiki therapy helped in
      decreasing chronic pain outcomes, this treatment modality may be added to Landstuhl Regional
      Medical (LRMC) Pain Clinic's pool of complementary and alternative medicine options.

    <measure>Pain Description, Relief and Interference with Daily Life (via Brief Pain Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline measure to up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument assesses the time relation sensory component of pain intensity (average over the last week, worst and least, and present pain) using a numeric rating scale (0 [No pain] to 10 [Pain as bad as you can imagine]), percentage of pain relief (0 [No relief] to 100% [Complete relief]), and 7 pain interferences concerning work, activity, mood, enjoyment, sleep, walk and relationships are assessed using 0-10 numeric scales (0 [No interference] to 10 [Complete interference]).</description>

    <measure>Sensory and Affective Pain Perception (via McGill Pain Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline measure to up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This instrument is a brief screening tool for pain and has 3 subscales: Sensory (11 word items), Affective (4 word items), and a composite Evaluative score. Fifteen words represent acute, intermittent and chronic pains, and are scored on a four-point Likert-type scale from 0 = none to 3 = severe. A total score of 45 is possible by summing the Sensory and Affective subscales and scoring them separately.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline measure to up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Likert Scale graphic tool to describe one's &quot;current&quot; level of pain. The score ranges from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;as bad as it could be nothing else matter&quot;. The scale is also colored coated depicting Mild 1-3 (Green), Moderate 4-7 (Yellow) and Severe 8-10 (Red).</description>
