      Background:

      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American men. Few options
      exist to create images of this type of cancer. Researchers think an experimental radiotracer
      called 18F-DCFPyL could find sites of cancer in the body.

      Objective:

      To see if 18F-DCFPyL can identify sites of prostate cancer in people with the disease.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older who have metastatic prostate cancer

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Blood tests

        -  Physical exam

        -  Medical history

      Participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on their PSA.

      Participants will have 18F-DCFPyL injected into a vein. About 2 hours later they will have a
      whole-body Positron Emission

      Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT). For the scan, they will lie on their back on the
      scanner table while it takes pictures of the body. This lasts about 50 minutes.

      On another day, participants will have 18F -NaF injected into a vein. About 1 hour later,
      they will have a whole-body PET/CT.

      Participants will be contacted 1 3 days later for follow-up. They may undergo PET/Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) either after having a 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT, or in place of PET/CT
      imaging. A tube may be placed in the rectum. More coils may be wrapped around the outside of
      the pelvis.

      If the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT is positive participants will be encouraged to undergo a biopsy of
      one of the tumors. The biopsy will be taken through a needle put through the skin into the
      tumor.

      Participants will be followed for 1 year. During this time researchers will collect
      information about their prostate cancer, such as PSA levels and biopsy results.

      About 4-6 months after scanning is completed, participants may have a tumor biopsy. The
      biopsy will be taken through a needle put through the skin into the tumor.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule
           inhibitor of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), [18F] DCFPyL (DCFPyL) PET/CT (or
           PET/MRI imaging if available) for detection of metastatic prostate cancer

        -  PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness
           and metastatic potential

        -  Our preliminary first-in-human studies demonstrate high specific uptake of a first
           generation less avid compound, DCFBC, in metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrated
           feasibility for prostate cancer metastatic detection.

        -  We propose to assess the ability of DCFPyL PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by
           visual qualitative and quantitative SUV analysis. Correlation will be made to sites of
           suspected metastatic disease detected by ultra-sensitive but less specific [18F] Sodium

      Fluoride (NaF)-PET/CT imaging for prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      - To compare the diagnostic sensitivity of DCFPyL-PET/CT (or PET/MRI imaging if available) to
      NaF-PET/CT for detection of prostate cancer bone metastasis based on comparison to reference
      standard of care conventional imaging modalities (CIM); such as CT

      and whole body bone scintigraphy incorporating prior and follow-up scans and histopathology
      when available.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Histological confirmation of prostate cancer

        -  Radiologic evidence of metastatic bone disease demonstrated on anatomical imaging (CT,
           MRI, or ultrasound), bone scintigraphy, [^18F] Sodium Fluoride (NaF)-PET, and/or [^18F]
           FDG PET

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2.

        -  Confirmation of prostate cancer with identifiable metastatic disease on at least 1
           clinically indicated imaging modality. If there is only soft tissue metastasis, one
           lesion must measure at least 6 mm or greater.

      DESIGN:

        -  Two Cohort study

             -  Cohort 1: Stable Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA): PSA must be within 0.5 value of
                the last PSA obtained (at least one month apart).

             -  Cohort 2: Rising PSA: PSA must be greater than 0.5 above the last PSA value
                obtained on at least two occasions within 1 year

        -  Patients will undergo DCFPyL PET/CT (or PET/MRI) and NaF-PET/CT within 21 days of each
           other. The order obtained does not matter.

        -  The DCFPyL PET/CT (or PET/MRI) will be compared with the NaF-PET/CT and standard
           chest/abdomen/pelvis CT

        -  DCFPyL PET/CT (or PET/MRI) detection of metastatic disease will be assessed by visual
           qualitative assessment as positive, equivocal, or negative. Sites of equivocal or
           positive metastatic disease will have a quantitative PET assessment (SUVmax, SUVmean).

        -  A mandatory research biopsy will be performed under image guidance on a suspicious
           lesion, if feasible.

        -  The patients will be followed by chart review, phone-call, and/or email follow-up for
           PSA relapse and radiologic evidence of metastatic disease over a one-year period from
           the time of imaging.
