  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we intend to apply a treatment protocol for hamstrings that can be beneficial
      for a good recovery.

      Initially, a sample of athletes with hamstring shortening was chosen. Once the sample is
      chosen, it will be divided into three groups: group 1 (G.1) who will receive a massage
      protocol, group 2 (G.2) that receives the muscular chain approach, and last group 3 (G.3)
      soft massage.

      To finalize the study comparing the results of the three groups to observe the experimental
      protocol obtains better results.

      Material and methods The sample of an athletic club. Recruiting subjects between 18 and 45
      years old without other injuries of the lower limb. Subjects with shortening of the hamstring
      muscles are available through the specific shortening test.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to three intervention
      groups (2 treatment and 1 placebo control). The intervention consists of 4 sessions for 1
      month. The sessions have a duration of 45 minutes. Evaluations are performed at the beginning
      of treatment, at the end of treatment and one follow-up per month. Participants also perform
      strengthening exercises three days a week, a total of 3 sets with 15 repetitions each.

      Group 1 receives a moderate intensity massage based on petrissage treatment of the quadriceps
      and hamstrings.

      Group 2 receives a moderate-high intensity massage based on friction of the quadriceps and
      hamstrings.

      Group 3 received low intensity massage treatment. Receives a soft massage treatment of the
      quadriceps and hamstrings.

      In addition, all groups work on strengthening the muscles of the lower limbs with eccentric
      work 3 times a week.

      The assessments consist of knee and hip goniometry, lumbar and hamstring flexibility by
      finger-to-floor testing, pain measurement on the visual analogue scale (EVA), and complete
      the questionnaire Mood Status Profile (POMS) , Which evaluates the states of mind

    <measure>Popliteal test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a specific test that is performed in supine position. The subject flexes the hip until it reaches 90º, while keeping the knee flexed. Subsequently, he takes the ankle and takes the knee to an extension position passively. In this position, one takes measure of the degrees that are lacking until the complete extension. During the test, it should be ensured that there are no compensations.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip flexion test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is performed with a knee and assesses the shortening of the hamstring muscles. The test is performed in supine position, and consists of flexing the hip in a slow and passive way until it reaches a flexion that the tightness or pain that the participant feels does not let go more. It should be noted that there is no knee flexion or any other type of compensation such as tilting of the pelvis. For the quantification we use a universal goniometer.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both legs (hip flexion, knee flexion and knee flexion) are measured by a universal goniometer, which has proven to be a valid and reliable instrument.</description>

    <measure>Lumbar flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>By the Fingertip-to-Floor Test (FFT). The restraints placed barefoot on a platform 25 cm high, with feet together and flat and toes on the edge pointing forward. They are then asked to lean forward and try to reach the floor with their fingertips as much as possible without discomfort, keeping the knees and arms fully extended. The bending is maintained for 3 seconds and the vertical distance between the tip of the middle finger and the platform is measured. The best of 3 trials is used for analysis.</description>
