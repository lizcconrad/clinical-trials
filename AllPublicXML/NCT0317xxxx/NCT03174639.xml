    <textblock>
      From July 2015 to December 2015, clinical record of 8 consecutive cases of macular hole with
      retinal detachment in high myopia treated with combined inverted and free ILM flap insertion
      into the hole were retrospectively reviewed. The anatomical and function outcomes were
      assessed.

      From July 2015 to December 2015, clinical record of 8 consecutive cases of macular hole with
      retinal detachment in high myopia treated with combined inverted and free ILM flap insertion
      into the hole were retrospectively reviewed. The anatomical and function outcomes were
      assessed. Patients with a history of trauma or concurrent peripheral breaks were excluded.
      The anatomical and function outcomes, including the status of the macular hole and retina
      were assessed.The study was approved by the ethnic committee and research board.
