      This study determines whether an educational intervention with a 90 g/day LCD is safe,
      effective and has good compliance for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poorly controlled type 2 diabetic men and women, aged between 20 and 80 years, with HbA1c≧
      7.5% (58mmol/mol) in the previous 3 months participated in this randomized controlled
      18-month trial at a medical center. Patients were randomly assigned to the interventional
      group and given a 90g/day low carbohydrate diet (LCD) or the controlled group, which
      maintained a standard calorie-restricted diet (CRD). All patients received periodic
      educational intervention and were monitored for weight, body composition, waist girth, hip
      girth, thigh girth, pre- and post-prandial serum glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, renal
      function, medication effect score and major cardiovascular events.

    <description>For the LCD group, the daily carbohydrate intake was limited to less than 90g, without any restriction to total energy. The concept of a LCD was introduced and an educational 15 g equivalent carbohydrate food list was provided. The easy conversion method is that 15 g equivalent carbohydrate =1/4 bowel of rice= 1/2 bowel of noodle = 1 slice of toast = 3 soup-spoon of oats = one bowl of fruit =1/2 regular size banana= one glass of milk = 3 dumplings. Less than two equivalent 15g-carbohydrate intakes per meal were advised.</description>

    <description>For the calori restricted diet group, the target total calorie intake was calculated by multiplying the ideal body weight by 25 kcal/kg for those with a BMI in the range 18.5 to 24, 20 kcal/kg for obese subjects with a BMI &gt; 24 and 30 kcal/day for underweight subjects with a BMI &lt;18.5. The macronutrient percentage was 50-60% for carbohydrate, 1.0-1.2 g/kg for protein and fat ≦30%.</description>
