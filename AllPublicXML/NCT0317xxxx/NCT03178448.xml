      The objective of this study is to characterize the prevalence of clinical or subclinical
      polyvascular lesions and 4-year progression rate of plaque in intracranial and carotidal
      arteries in a Chinese community population using vascular imaging techniques; to investigate
      the both traditional and emerging genetic, metabolomic, and environmental risk factors of
      presence and progression of intracranial and carotidal plaque; and to investigate the
      association between polyvascular lesions and future risk of cognitive impairment,
      cardio-/cerebrovascular events and death.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is the most common cardiovascular disease and accounts for the greatest
      number of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and death. Polyvascular lesions with
      coexistent lesions (especially atherosclerosis) in multiple arterial territories (at least 2
      of coronary, cerebral, lower extremity arteries), could be associated with higher risk of
      future cardio-/cerebrovascular diseases. However, previous studies either roughly defined
      polyvascular diseases according to established clinically recognized arterial diseases in
      multiple arterial territories, or tested multiterritorial subclinical atherosclerosis without
      tests of intracranial and peripheral arteries. Furthermore, recent research also showed that
      cardiometabolic diseases and cardiovascular risk factors are associated with worse cognitive
      abilities. A thorough evaluation of multiterritorial lesions in whole body used advanced
      vascular imaging techniques is required to precisely assess the association of polyvascular
      lesions with future cardio-/cerebrovascular events and cognitive impairment.

      Additionally, Asian population might have higher prevalence of intracranial atherosclerosis
      than the Caucasian, and intracranial atherosclerosis is the most common cause of ischemic
      stroke in Asia population. However, there are limited data about the prevalence and
      progression of intracranial atherosclerosis in Chinese population. More and more studies have
      shown that presence and progression of atherosclerotic plaque is not only related to the
      degree of stenosis, but also with plaque characteristics such as rich lipid core, plaque
      hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration. High-resolution magnetic resonance (HR-MRI)
      can not only show the degree of arterial stenosis, the size of atherosclerotic plaque, but
      also can analyze the composition of the plaque to assess the stability of the plaque. HR-MRI
      techniques enable early detection of atherosclerosis, characterization of the atherosclerotic
      composition and burden. It is important to estimate the prevalence and progression rate of
      intracranial atherosclerotic plaque based on HR-MRI and to estimate its traditional and
      emerging determinants in Chinese population.

      In this study, a total of 2000 subjects aged 50 to 75 years from 2 villages and 1 community
      in Lishui city, Zhejiang province, China, will be enrolled. All the eligible subjects in the
      selected villages/community will be enrolled based on non-probability cluster sampling.

      All the participants will be interviewed at baseline and follow up for 4 years. Data
      collection at baseline will be performed through face-to-face interviews by trained
      interviewers (neurologists from participating hospitals) with a standardized protocol.
      Baseline data include demographics, medical history, cardiovascular risk factors, dietary
      habits, physical activity, lifestyle, medication use, electrocardiogram, vascular imaging
      tests and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Blood and urine samples will also be
      collected at baseline to test genetic and metabolomic markers. Cardio-/cerebrovascular
      events, death and medicine use will be collected each year after enrollment. A further
      face-to-face interview will be performed after 4 years to collect plaque progression in
      intracranial and carotidal arteries using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
      (HR-MRI), and cognitive impairment using MoCA.

      Baseline vascular imaging tests include high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI)
      sequences in intracranial and carotidal arteries, computed tomographic angiography (CTA) in
      coronary, aorta, renal, hepatic, pancreatic and iliofemoral arteries, and fundus fluorescein
      photography (retinal photography) in retinal vessel. All MRI scans were performed on 3.0 T
      Philips scanners. CTA scans were performed on third-generation dual-source Siemens system
      (SOMATOM Force). HR-MRI sequences were performed both at baseline and after 4 years to
      identify intracranial and carotidal atherosclerotic stenosis and plaque and measure the
      intracranial and carotidal vessel wall, lumen area, and plaque when present. Additionally,
      heart function will be tested using color Doppler echocardiography, and ankle-brachial index
      will be tested using Doppler ultrasound. These imaging techniques enable early detection of
      intracranial and extracranial vascular lesions, characterization of the atherosclerotic
      composition and burden, and monitoring of plaque progression in intracranial and carotidal
      arteries.

      The protocol of this study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital
      and Lishui Hospital of Zhejiang University. All participants provided written informed
      consents before entering the study.
