    <textblock>
      Sepsis continues to be a major global cause of both mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, the
      development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in sepsis increases the risk of unfavorable
      outcomes. Besides source control, fluid resuscitation and the use of antibiotics, application
      of extracorporeal renal replacement therapies (RRT) is the predominant treatment for
      sepsis-associated AKI (SAKI). However, the timing of initiation of RRT remains controversial.
      It is reported that a correlation was observed between the concentrations of circulating
      inflammatory cytokines and mortality in patients with septic shock. Therefore, it is
      hypothesis that adequate removal of inflammatory mediators from the circulation may provide a
      potential therapy for this devastating condition. Indeed, data from meta-analyses,
      observational studies and randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggests that initiating RRT in
      critical ill patients (including patients with sepsis and non-sepsis) at early stage may be
      beneficial. But in some studies, initiating RRT at early stage do not shown to improve
      survival compared with initiating RRT at late stage. At present, large-scale prospective RCT
      about the timing for initiating RRT in SAKI was still lack.The decision when to start RRT is
      not merely academic but may impact on outcomes. Therefore, in our study, 600 patients with
      SAKI at KDIGO 2 from multicenter in China will be recruited. And then the patients will be
      divided into early group and delayed group randomly. In the early group, continuous RRT
      (CRRT) was started immediately after randomization. In the delay group, CRRT was initiated if
      at least one of the following criteria was met: KDIGO 3, severe hyperkalemia, metabolic
      acidosis, pulmonary edema, blood urea nitrogen level higher than 112 mg per deciliter, or
      oliguria for more than 72 hours after randomization. Overall survival at day 90 will be
      observed in order to understand whether different CRRT strategy would affect the outcomes of
      SAKI. This clinical study will be a large-scale, multi center, prospective, randomized trial
      about SAKI. It will help clinician choose appropriate timing to initiate CRRT and improve
      outcomes of SAKI.
