  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the surgical procedure of scoliosis correction, large surgery extent and long-lasting
      strong nociceptive stimulation lead to postoperative pain formation of greater intensity
      compared with other orthopedic interventions. In these patients, duration of postoperative
      symptoms is longer, and may lead to persistent pain formation due to developing neuroplastic
      changes in the central nervous system.

      Instrumentation in correction operations for spinal deformities as vertebral fusion,
      congenital and traumatic scoliosis, carries a 0.5-5% risk of injuring the spinal cord during
      spinal surgery.

      These complications are generally results of complex factors such as direct effects of
      compression on the spinal cord, distraction, the effects of spinal ischemia or arterial
      hypotension.

      The purpose of the wake-up test is to monitor voluntary motor function of the lower limbs
      once the vertebrae have been instrumented and distracted. The depth of anesthesia is
      gradually lightened up to the point where patients are able to respond to verbal commands. As
      the voluntary movement of lower extremities is demonstrated, the depth of anesthesia is
      increased to complete the surgery.
