    <textblock>
      PEP (positive expiratory pressure) is routinely given to patients after surgery in order to
      improve lung function. There is, however, no evidence of effect on lung function,
      postoperative pneumonia or any other outcome (Guimarães MMF, Tyson AF). The investigators aim
      to test the immediate effects on oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide. 65 patients will be
      investigated in RCT design with deep inspirations and expiration using PEP or only deep
      inspiration with expiration a placebo tube without resistance air. At the end of the study we
      will also measure the effect of 10x3 very deep inspirations and no expiratory no expiratory
      resistance. Primary outcome: continuous oxygen saturation from pulse oximetry and
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide.

      Background Patients who have undergone thoracic and abdominal surgery receive lung
      atelectases after surgery. This in turn leads to poorer oxygenation, longer healing time and
      can contribute to increased risk of complications. In order to counteract atelectasis,
      patients are instructed by a physiotherapist to take deep inspiratory breaths and expire in a
      PEP-device (positive expiratory pressure) or incentive spirometry. The method is used
      routinely at our hospital and the patient breathes against 10-15 cm water resistance. This is
      repeated 10x3 ie 10 deep breaths and exhalation towards PEP then rest, breath, rest and
      another 10 breaths. This procedure should be done once an hour after surgery. The idea is
      that this will widen alveoli and fill atelectases with air, thus increasing the oxygen
      uptake, lowering the carbon dioxide level, and reducing the risk of postoperative
      complications.

      In a systematic Cochrane review and in an overview of JAMA surgery, it was found that there
      is no evidence that postoperative PEP use or incentive spirometry (same method) prevents
      postoperative pulmonary complications (1, 2). Nevertheless, the PEP method is used in Sweden
      and internationally. There are no studies that investigate the effect on continuous oxygen
      and carbon dioxide levels below and directly after the actual PEP use. If oxygenation is
      improved, and the carbon dioxide content decreases with PEP, the method is likely to be safe.
      If oxygenation instead drops and the carbon dioxide level rises when breathing out a
      resistance, the use of postoperative PEP should be questioned

      Aims

      What effect does PEP have on the oxygenation and carbon dioxide concentration? What is the
      effect of very deep breathing on oxygenation and carbon dioxide?

      Method

      Inclusion: 65 adult patients over 18 years of age who have undergone open or laparoscopic
      abdominal surgery. Patients receiving postoperative PEP are asked after surgery to
      participate in the study.

      Exclusion: Patients who cannot participate in using PEP or who do not agree to participate in
      the study.

      Power calculation: The outcome is unclear because no similar study has been done before. If
      tcPCO2 becomes in medium (SD) 5 (1) kPa in a group and 5.5 (1) kPa in the second group, 63
      patients are required before obtaining a significance of p &lt;0.05 and a power of 0.80. As the
      outcome is uncertain, the investigators intend to include 65 patients.

      Design / Randomization: RCT study with cross-over design. Patients are randomized using
      computer programs, handled by a person outside the study, to either start with PEP breathing
      10x3 or deep breathing 10x3.

      Method: Starting with lung function assessment to determine PEF (Mini Wright Clement Clarke).
      Then, application of continuous transcutaneous PCO2 / SaO2 (SenTec Digital Monitoring System,
      ResMed) and a respiratory belt around the chest detecting the respiratory rate. Data is
      recorded with computer equipment (Noxturnal T3, ResMed).

      The patient is randomized to initiate the measurements with either the deep breath and PEP or
      deep breathing alone. After a rest period, patients switch to the second treatment
      (cross-over) ie only deep breathing or deep breathing and PEP. Deep breathing is then defined
      as 10x3 deep breaths. PEP breathing is performed 10 x 3 resistance breaths.

      At the start of the study, baseline level for SaO2 and TcPCO2 is recorded, and an arterial
      blood gas is recorded to calibrate the transcutaneous PCO2 measurement. Thereafter, the
      registration continues during breathing / blowing until the patient returns to its baseline
      values. New PEF examination is made after each study arm. At the end of the study we will
      also measure the effect of 10x3 very deep inspirations and no expiratory no expiratory
      resistance.
