  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN) is a debilitating disease primarily affecting poorly controlled
      diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy. The consequences of CN include ulcerations of
      the foot and ankle, osteomyelitis, and severe musculoskeletal deformity. These consequences
      frequently lead to below-knee amputation of the affected limb.

      Currently treatment options are limited, and no pharmaceutical treatment has been efficacious
      in the medical literature. The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the potential of
      the medication denosumab for acute stage Charcot neuroarthropathy.
