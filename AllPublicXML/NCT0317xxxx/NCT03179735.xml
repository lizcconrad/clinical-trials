  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of orthodontic treatment provided to Brazilian population has been increased.
      Unfortunately, some negative effects such as gum bleeding and bad breath are commonly
      observed. It partially happens because tooth brushing and flossing become more difficult in
      the presence of braces. Therefore, there is a need for clinical protocols able to maintain
      the mouth healthy during orthodontic treatment.

      Considering that proper use of mouthwashes by in individuals without braces is accompanied by
      decrease in plaque and gum inflammation levels, it was hypothesized that, during orthodontic
      treatment their anti-gingivitis and anti-plaque properties would positively affect oral
      health. Objectives: The present study will compare the effects of two commercially available
      mouthwashes with a placebo mouthwash in orthodontic patients wearing fixed appliances.

      Whole-mouth clinical examinations will be performed in periodontally healthy patients 15 days
      before, at the day of bonding and also 3 and 6 months after braces bonding. Hard and soft
      tissues status, presence of gingivitis and amount of dental plaque will be monitored to
      determine mouthwashes efficacy. At these same time-points plaque samples will be collected
      from dental sites and braces surfaces aiming at determining total levels of bacteria and
      levels of specific bacteria related to gum disease. After a full-mouth ultrasonic debridement
      to remove dental plaque, stains and tartar, patients will be randomly assigned to an
      Essential oils, Cetylpyridinium chloride or a placebo mouthwash for 6 months (40 ml/day).
      Further, samples of orthodontic wires will be analyzed under microscopy to check whether
      regular use of mouthwashes increases the risk of corrosion or not.
