  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune liver diseases (AILD), which include Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) and
      Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) are a common etiological factors for chronic liver disease among
      adolescents. In all these conditions, autoimmune lymphocyte responses are thought to
      orchestrate inflammatory injury against hepatocytes (primarily in AIH) or cholangiocytes (in
      PSC). In this proposal we aim to evaluate the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities; MR
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and MR elastography (MREL), as non-invasive biomarkers to
      assess two primary pathophysiological processes of AILD: bile duct damage and liver fibrosis.
      In this cross-sectional study MRI based findings of bile duct injury and liver fibrosis will
      be correlated with both liver histology and circulating biomarkers of these disease
      processes.
