  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This evaluates the affect of protein quantity on indices of sleep. Half the participants will
      be prescribed protein in the amount consistent with the USDA healthy style eating pattern,
      while the other half will be prescribed a diet containing 12.5 oz eq of protein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Sleep Foundation, 13% of U.S. adults were reported to sleep 6 hours
      or less per weeknight in 2001. Eight years later, the number increased to 20%. Also, the
      proportion of people experiencing a sleep problem (e.g. difficulties in initiating or
      maintaining sleep) several nights per week has increased dramatically (from 51% to 64% in
      2001 to 2009). Getting enough and good quality sleep is essential to health. Indices of
      sleep, including duration, quality, and patterning are related to obesity, type 2 diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension, worsen lipid-lipoprotein status, and premature death.
      All of these morbidities and mortality are also impacted by diet .

      The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recognized &quot;an insufficient body of evidence&quot;
      in the &quot;emerging area&quot; of &quot;associations between sleep patterns, dietary intakes, and obesity
      risk&quot; and that &quot;a paucity of research exists on the potential impact of diet on sleep-related
      outcomes&quot;. Currently the majority of research has assessed the influence of sleep on energy
      balance or dietary choices. The reversed relation, how diet influence sleep, received much
      less attention. In general, diet-induced weight loss is considered to improve sleep quality
      and increase sleep duration. However, emerging research brings into question the impact of
      the macronutrient distribution during dietary energy restriction (ER) on indices of sleep.
      Dietary protein, due to its ability to provide tryptophan and tyrosine (precursors of
      neurotransmitters melatonin and dopamine), may influence sleep. Despite the fact that both
      diet and sleep predict obesity and chronic diseases, limited research exists on the effects
      of dietary energy and macronutrients, especially high-quality protein intake, on indices of
      sleep.

      The primary aim is to assess the effects of the USDA Healthy U.S.-Style Eating Pattern with
      higher amounts of animal-based protein-rich foods (lean meats and eggs) on health outcomes
      including sleep and blood pressure.

      This is a 16-week randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, single-blind study. During
      baseline, participant's diet, general health, and sleep quality will be assessed.
      Participants will then be randomized and assigned to either the normal protein or high
      protein (5 vs. 12.5 oz-eq of protein foods daily) for the 12-week weight loss intervention
      with the energy-restriction (750 kcal/day dietary energy deficits).

    <description>All participants will be given saliva collection tubes and instruction on how to collect will be in the kit given. This for our lab to measure saliva melatonin concentrations during the 7 days they are wearing the Actiwatch. Subjects will collect saliva hourly from 5 hours before to 2 hours before usual sleep time, then every 30 minutes until 1 hour before usual sleep time. Subjects will be given collections tubes and detailed collection instructions prior to the testing period. After sample collection, you will place the saliva filled tubes in there protective container and place the container in your refrigerator. You will keep collected samples until testing for that period is complete and you return them to the study coordinator (≤ 7 days).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire on a single testing day. The PSQI questionnaire is a clinical sleep behavior questionnaire validated for use in patients with insomnia, cancer, Parkinson's disease, and the general population. It is designed to assess indices of sleep during the preceding one-month interval and contains 19 questions using Likert scales from 0-3. All questions are categorized into seven sub-parameters (duration of sleep, sleep disturbance, sleep latency, day dysfunction due to sleepiness, sleep efficiency, subjective sleep quality, and use of sleeping medication). Each of these seven parameters is scored between 0 and 3 arbitrary units (au), which generates a summed total score of 0 to 21 au. This total score (GSS) of &gt;5 au indicates poor sleep condition. Thus, a lower GSS score indicates better sleep condition. The PSQI also has questions that generate routine sleep duration in hours.</description>
