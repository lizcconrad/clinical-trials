  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high level of unsatisfactory outcome observed in patients treated for LUTS associated
      with BPH with respect to the different existing therapeutic options strongly emphasizes the
      need for treatment optimisation in daily practice by a careful LUTS monitoring and treatment
      adjustment when needed. The poorer outcome observed in patients for whom treatment has been
      initiated recently suggests that the duration of the disease itself may influence the patient
      satisfaction.To achieve this goal, we propose to systematically assess LUTS associated with
      BPH in patients treated for at least 6 months and to assess whether an alpha-blocker therapy
      initiation/modification may improve the outcome in case of persisting symptoms. We also
      investigate the influence of the symptom duration on the frequency of unsatisfactory outcome.

        The frequency of patients with IPSS score &lt;8 after three months of treatment with
        alpha-blockers is about 40%. The sample size required to detect a proportion of 40% with a
        precision of 0.04 is 550 patients. Based on a literature review of Lacoin et al, the
        frequency of treated patients with LUTS associated with BPH with an IPSS â‰¥ 8 is
        approximately 60%. Thus, 917 patients will be needed to obtain a sample of 550 patients
        with treatment of alpha-blockers (550/0.6 = 917).

        Considering 10% of patients lost for follow-up or refusing treatment change, the total
        number required is estimated at about 1,000 patients.
