  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well contrast enhanced spectral mammography works with
      digital breast tomosynthesis in imaging patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Contrast
      enhanced spectral mammography uses a special dye that is injected into the veins before
      mammogram images are taken. Digital breast tomosynthesis uses multiple x-ray pictures to
      produce a 3-dimensional rendering of the entire breast. Contrast enhanced spectral
      mammography with digital breast tomosynthesis may highlight areas of concern within the
      breast in more detail than a standard mammogram and improve the accuracy of tumor size.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the index lesion size (the largest diameter) from each of the four readings
      (standard of care 2 dimensional [D], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], contrast enhanced
      spectral mammography [CESM], 3D) to gold standard index lesion size from surgical pathology
      (the largest diameter).

      II. To document the additional ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer lesions detected
      by the MRI, CESM, and 3D readings listed above.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo a clinical breast examination and a diagnostic mammogram with or without
      targeted breast ultrasound to the index cancer as part of their standard of care preoperative
      work-up. As part of the research study, patients receive contrast agent intravenously (IV)
      and then undergo a CESM with digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) over 30 minutes. Patients
      also receive a contrast agent, gadolinium, IV and undergo bilateral breast contrast enhanced
      (CE)-MRI over 10 minutes.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up within 24-96 hours.
