  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), scabies and soil transmitted helminths (STH) are common neglected
      tropical diseases affecting the people of Fiji. There is a dedicated LF eradication program
      supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), however scabies and STH are currently
      managed on an individual level with symptomatic treatment as required.

      In an attempt to reduce the prevalence of LF globally, research is being undertaken into
      alternative, more effective treatment options. A recent study in Papua New Guinea
      demonstrated a new triple drug therapy (ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole) is
      superior to the currently recommended two drug therapy (diethylcarbamazine and albendazole)
      used by WHO LF programs in the Pacific. However, adverse events were more frequent. Despite
      no serious adverse events being observed, it is necessary to conduct further studies to
      review the safety of this new triple therapy before it can be endorsed as an effective mass
      drug administration (MDA) regimen for LF in endemic countries. Fiji's burden of LF, that has
      been recalcitrant to previous MDA with diethylcarbamazine and albendazole, make it an ideal
      site to obtain further efficacy and safety data of the triple therapy.

      Ivermectin given to communities as MDA has been proven to be effective in reducing the
      community prevalence of scabies. What is not known is the effects of one dose versus two
      doses of ivermectin as MDA. This question will be reviewed within the design of the community
      randomized study. The prevalence of impetigo in a community is linked to scabies and this
      will also be reviewed. Ivermectin and albendazole are both effective individually against
      STH. The effectiveness of this combination of treatment as MDA in Fiji for STH has not been
      studied. The effectiveness for the individual in the short-term and the community in the
      longer-term will be reviewed.

      In addition, the acceptability and feasibility of the new therapy in communities at risk of
      these three diseases will be reviewed.

    <time_frame>within 7 days of drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be interviewed and asked to report their general health status at baseline before receiving treatment and daily for the 2 days following treatment (Active Adverse Event Monitoring phase). For 3 to 7 days following treatment, anyone unwell the preceding day will be actively followed, other participants will be interviewed only if they feel unwell and present to the study team (Passive Adverse Event Monitoring phase).
At any stage if they describe being unwell, further questions to determine type and severity of symptom(s) experienced will be asked and recorded according to pre-defined adverse event table. If participants report moderate to severe symptoms they will have further medical assessments as required.
LF infection status will be determined by Filiarial Test Strip (FTS) and microfilariae (mf) smears.</description>
