      To compare the total amount of propofol used by the manually-control infusion (MCI) and
      Target-control infusion (TCI) using standard monitoring without BIS or standard monitoring
      with BIS during advanced endoscopic procedure.

      Anesthesia requirements for advanced endoscopic procedures are approaching those of
      specialized surgical interventions. Although many other sedative agents are used prior to and
      during endoscopy, none approach propofol in terms of desirable properties. The risk of
      propofol sedation for interventional procedures such as endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and therapeutic endoscopy are
      among the highest for any sedated endoscopic procedure. The reasons are many: the intensity
      of stimulation encountered during these procedures is similar to many minor surgeries; the
      airway management is complex and requires constant attention; the incidence of hypoxemia is
      high, and the time available for recognition and management is limited. In order to reap the
      benefits of advanced endoscopic procedures, anesthesiologists must rise to the challenge.
      This requires a dedicated anesthetic team practicing safe, efficient, and effective sedation
      techniques for advanced endoscopic procedures. Ongoing research into novel infusion methods
      can add safety to the existing sedation techniques and address some of the concerns related
      to sedative quality. This is a randomized controlled and prospective study. The first stage
      is to compare the differences between manually-controlled infusion of propofol (MCI) and
      target-controlled infusion of propofol (TCI) in patients undergoing advanced endoscopic
      procedure. The secondary stage is to evaluate the benefit of bispectral index (BIS)
      monitoring between MCI and TCI. The primary outcome is the total amount of propofol. The
      secondary outcomes are patients' and endoscopists' satisfaction, sedative-related adverse
      events, recovery time, and procedure time.

    <description>The satisfaction of the endoscopist with the sedation is evaluated by a case-by-case questionnaire. Four classes of response: excellent, good, acceptable and poor, were defined for the overall evaluation with the safety of endoscopy procedure, patient cooperation and fluency of the procedure in the opinion of the endoscopist. Patients' satisfaction includes their immediate evaluation of side effects such as post procedure dizziness, nausea/vomiting, or pain recall evaluation in the recovery room. Telephone interviews are performed to ascertain the patients' overall satisfaction evaluation and of the procedure with four classes of responses: excellent, good, acceptable and poor.</description>
