  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess if it is possible, at the end of endocardial
      voltage mapping, to accurately collect intact cardiomyocytes and to isolate high quality DNA
      allowing molecular testing of selected genes involved in arrhythmogenic right ventricular
      cardiomyopathy/dysplasia .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia is associated with mutations in
      genes encoding proteins from desmosomes and is characterized by a large expression
      variability. The classical molecular diagnosis from blood cells fails to identify mutations
      in around 30% of patients. Probes used for endocardial voltage mapping allow to collect some
      cardiomyocytes which could be used for DNA analysis.

      The aim of this project is to investigate if cardiomyocytes can efficiently be collected
      during endocardial voltage mapping in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular
      cardiomyopathy/dysplasia. Thirty patients suffering from arrhythmogenic right ventricular
      cardiomyopathy/dysplasia cardiac and needing endocardial voltage mapping for disease
      diagnosis and/or prognosis assessment will be included. The main outcome will be the
      percentage of patients in whom mapping will allow to collect intact cardiomyocytes from which
      high quality DNA extraction will be achieved. Other outcomes include the identification of
      new mutational mechanisms as somatic mosaicism in selected genes (PKP2, DSCG2 DSP) and the
      feasibility of epigenetic analysis of these genes.
