  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this intervention study, 75 Belgian community pharmacies each recruit 12 patients for an
      intermediate medication review. For each patient, the identified drug-related problems and
      subsequent interventions are registered using the PharmDisc classification. In a subset of
      Dutch speaking patients, a pretest-posttest single group design is used to measure the impact
      of this review on patient related outcomes using questionnaires. The primary outcome is the
      medication related quality of life, measured via the living with medicines questionnaire.
      Other patient reported outcomes include adherence, self-management, patient satisfaction,
      fall incidents and use of emergency healthcare services. Medication records are also
      collected to objectively measure adherence before and after the intervention.
