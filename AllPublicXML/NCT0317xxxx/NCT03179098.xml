  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elbow contracture is a secondary injury that can occur after direct trauma, causing the
      patient to have limitations in their range of motion. Objective evaluation protocols that
      help in decision making for the indication of these therapeutic resources have great value in
      rehabilitation, as they reduce unnecessary expenses and improve the assertiveness in the
      indication of this resource.

      Objective: To verify the immediate effects of superficial heat associated with sustained
      stretching through muscle activity and range of motion in the posttraumatic contractures of
      the elbow seeking the best indication of orthosis.

      Methods: Characterized as a randomized crossover type clinical trial. Sample of 20 adult
      subjects, of both sexes, over 18 years old, with elbow stiffness due to fractures and / or
      dislocations with indication of orthosis use. Patients will be divided into 2 randomly
      assigned intervention groups: the control group (CG) who will perform the 10 'sustained
      stretching drawn by a defined load through maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and
      the modified Weeks Group (GWM) will perform 20 'of surface heat through the swirl and soon
      after the stretching sustained by 10' with already defined load. All patients will undergo an
      initial assessment and will participate in all 2 interventions while respecting a 7 day
      washout period. Goniometry and the visual analogue scale will be applied at the beginning and
      end of the interventions. The Delsys® brand equipment will be used to collect the
      electromyographic data. Placement and positioning of the electrodes will follow the
      determinations of the Seniam protocol. The activation of the brachial, brachioradial and
      triceps brachii muscles during the MVIC will be analyzed and also during the respective
      intervention protocols.

    <description>The modified Weeks group (GWM) will apply the protocol suggested by Flowers (2002), the positioning will be maintained and at rest will be done electromyographic registers, active goniometry and EVA. Soon afterwards the patients will be submitted to the whirlwind for 20 minutes at a temperature of 41 ° C performing active flexion and elbow extension movements. After the swirl the patients will be submitted to a stretching maintained for 10 minutes with load proportional to the force captured during MVIC according to the pain of the patient. The load will be positioned through a leather device 20 cm from the lateral epicondyle of the elbow.</description>
