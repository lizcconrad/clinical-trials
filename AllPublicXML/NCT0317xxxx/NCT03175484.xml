  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-fidelity simulation (HFS) is a learning method extensively used for training of surgical
      specialty (including anesthesia) and nurses. It has a beneficial effect on knowledge of
      algorithms, team working, early warning scores, and communication. Various skills can be
      learned using a standardized simulation programs.

      The complexity of instructional design may produce cognitive overload, high stress level and
      anxiety. This may increase fatigue, facilitate errors, and is associated with inferior task
      performance which may impede memorization of learned skills resulting in inefficient
      learning/simulation failure. Subjectively reported scales can accurately identify the level
      of perceived workload and mental demand in individuals during simulation tasks. One example
      is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-TLX - the most accepted
      subjective measure of human workload in various industries including medicine.

      Surgical specialty (including anesthesia) and nurses training curriculum in Lyon, France,
      includes several HFS scenarios with a large panel of critical events. The investigators aim
      to evaluate the effect of burden of workload and stress perceived by surgical specialty
      (including anesthesia) residents and nurses during HFS on the learning performance, and to
      grade different learning scenarios by their difficulty.

      In this observational study investigators aim to measure anesthesiology, surgeon residents
      and nurses' workload, stress level, and performance on high-fidelity simulation scenarios
      used routinely in the current anesthesiology, nurse and surgical training curriculum. A NASA
      TLX scale, 100 points numeric scale for anxiety (0 - no anxiety; 100 - maximal anxiety),
      automated quantitative pupillometry, Team Emergency Assessment Measure scale will be used to
      evaluate a workload, anxiety, stress, and performance. Age, sex, previous experience of HFS
      will be noted. All data will be anonymized. The participation in this study is voluntary and
      one can withdraw from this study at any time prior to or after the completion of any
      interview without any penalty.

      Two investigators will independently evaluate the performance of HFS by direct observation
      and video record if necessary. NASA TLX questionnaire will be administrated immediately after
      HFS scenario and before the debriefing. Anxiety scale and pupillometry will be administrated
      before the beginning of HFS scenario and upon its completion.
