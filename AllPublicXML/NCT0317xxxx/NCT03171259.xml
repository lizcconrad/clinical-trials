  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the importance of understanding CLI patients' outcomes and existing gaps in knowledge,
      there is a pressing need to collect observational data on treatment patterns, adherence to
      performance measures, and outcomes that are relevant to patients and clinicians. To address
      this need, the current study will pilot test the research infrastructure and data elements
      needed to build a larger, national study collecting of the CLI population. It will also
      provide much-needed preliminary information to identify areas of action that can be targeted
      in quality improvement programs for this population. Most importantly, it will provide data
      on health status outcomes in patients with CLI, as a function of individual patient
      characteristics (demographics, socio-economic and clinical background) and the treatments
      that patients have undergone. The PORTRAIT-CLI study will also be well equipped to identify
      potential disparities in the provision of care and patients' outcomes as a function of
      patient's characteristics.

        Project coordinators at each recruitment site will have direct access to the PAD clinic
        schedules and will be prospectively screening from that list. A screening form with limited
        demographic information will be completed for all patients with a diagnosis of CLI
        supported by any of the following hemodynamic parameters (assessed pre-procedurally): Ankle
        pressure lower than 70 mmHg; Toe pressure lower than 50 mmHg or evidence of ischemia by
        transcutaneous oxygen measurement (tcpO2) &lt;40 or a skin perfusion pressure (SPP) &lt;40 or
        angiographic evidence of significant vascular disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All race/ethnicity categories, English or Spanish speaking, men and women

          -  Age â‰¥18 years

          -  Patients presenting with Rutherford Classification 4 (ischemic rest pain), or
             Rutherford Classification 5 (minor tissue loss: non-healing ulcer, focal gangrene with
             diffuse pedal ischemia), or Rutherford Classification 6 (major tissue loss: extending
             above transmetatarsal level, functional foot no longer salvageable) at specialty
             clinics will prospectively be screened, regardless of whether the patient undergoes
             endovascular, bypass, amputation, and/or medical therapy.

          -  Diagnosis is supported by any of the following hemodynamic parameters (assessed pre-
             procedurally): Ankle pressure lower than 70 mmHg; Toe pressure lower than 50 mmHg or
             evidence of ischemia by transcutaneous oxygen measurement (tcpO2) &lt;40 or a skin
             perfusion pressure (SPP) &lt;40 or angiographic evidence of significant vascular disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No other prior surgical or vascular interventions within 2 weeks before and/or planned
             30 days after the enrollment

          -  Acute limb ischemia

          -  Unable to provide written informed consent
