  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of extra pulmonary tuberculosis remains especially challenging since the number of
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli present in tissues at sites of disease is often low and
      clinical specimens from deep-seated organs may be difficult to obtain. Histology is
      time-consuming to undertake and establishing a diagnosis of tuberculosis with high
      specificity remains difficult. Tissue microscopy after special staining is often negative and
      when mycobacteria are seen, it is impossible to distinguish Mycobacterium tuberculosis from
      non tuberculous mycobacterial disease. Reliance on culture, the mainstay of diagnosis, often
      leads to considerable delays, compromising patient care and outcomes.

      Evidence from 138 studies published before 2008 suggested that nucleic acid amplification
      technologies could not replace conventional mycobacterial tests (microscopy, culture) for
      diagnosing pulmonary and, especially, extra pulmonary tuberculosis

      Only a few years later, GeneXpert technology has changed this paradigm, with a recent
      systematic review showing pooled sensitivity of 88% and pooled specificity of 98% for
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, but evidence (as of March 2012) for using Xpert MTB/RIF
      for diagnosing extra pulmonary tuberculosis is still comparatively weak Globally, there is
      still a dearth of studies involving the use of Xpert MTB/RIF in extra pulmonary tuberculosis
      specimens, and few provide definitive answers. This is due mostly to the studies having small
      sample sizes across a range of various specimen types and differences in pre-processing
      methodologies and in input volumes and to studies having been conducted in different
      populations (adults, children, Human immunodeficiency virus infected).
