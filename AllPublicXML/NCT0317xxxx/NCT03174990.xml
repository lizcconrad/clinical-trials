      This study evaluates the effects of Aspirin and thienopyridine resistance in relation to
      clinical cardiovascular outcomes as the genetic predictors of, and outcomes associated with
      aspirin and thienopyridine resistance in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      currently remain unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although anti-platelet therapy is a cornerstone of PAD treatment, the investigators know very
      little about the prevalence, genetic determinants and clinical relevance of aspirin and
      thienopyridine resistance in PAD patients. The investigators expect to report on the
      prevalence of, and impact on outcomes from aspirin and/or thienopyridine (eg. clopidogrel)
      resistance, in patients who undergo peripheral arterial angiography/interventions (including
      carotid angiography/interventions) and operations. This study will provide important
      information on the utility of testing for aspirin and thienopyridine resistance and improve
      understanding of the genetic and pathophysiologic basis of anti-platelet therapy resistance
      in patients with cardiovascular disease, including PAD. Most importantly, this study will
      serve as the basis for a subsequent randomized prospective trial of different treatment
      options in PAD patients with aspirin/thienopyridine resistance.
