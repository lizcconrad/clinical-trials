  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant hemangioma(IH) is the most common benign vascular tumor of infancy with the estimated
      incidence varies 1% to 12%.However, in China, the incidence of infant hemangioma and related
      epidemiological data remains unclear. So, the investigators designed the study for the
      following purposes: 1, to aware the incidence of infantile hemangioma and understand the
      related risk factorsin China; 2, to understand the clinical characteristics of infantile
      hemangioma and the risk factors for complications; 3, to investigate the level of knowledge,
      treatment options in infant hemangioma in Chinese doctors; 3, to improve the awareness of
      infantile hemangioma in parents and provide more advice for pregnancy counseling and
      eugenics.
