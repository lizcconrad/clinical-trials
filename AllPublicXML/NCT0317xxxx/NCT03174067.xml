    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized control trial randomizing patients presenting in opioid withdrawal
      to the emergency department to receive either one of clonidine (usual standard of care) or
      buprenorphine for their opioid withdrawal. Primary treatment outcome is attendance at a rapid
      access addiction medicine clinic within a few days of emergency room presentation. Secondary
      treatment outcome is treatment status with respect to opioid agonist treatment at one month
      post emergency room visit.
