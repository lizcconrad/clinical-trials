  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study leverages a modernized digital version of a well-known cognitive screening tool to
      examine pre and post operative cognitive function after surgery in adults age 65 years or
      more. Machine learning algorithms will be applied to the hospital wide standard of care
      cognitive metric to identify risk for post-operative cognitive complications.

      This proposal innovatively leverages a brief but informative digital test with machine
      learning to examine the subtlety of pre-surgery cognition within an extremely large number of
      older individuals screened preoperatively within an academic tertiary medical center. It also
      incorporates a unique group of well characterized non-surgery peers for demographic matching
      to assist with normal versus abnormal machine learning analyses.
