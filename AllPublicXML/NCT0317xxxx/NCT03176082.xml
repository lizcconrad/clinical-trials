      Purpose: The investigators propose to test the effectiveness, feasibility, and
      cost-effectiveness of a mailed reminder with and without FIT kits in a population of Medicaid
      enrollees in Mecklenburg County.

      Participants: Medicaid beneficiaries who are enrolled in Community Care of North Carolina,
      ages 52-64, currently living in Mecklenburg County, at average risk for colorectal cancer
      (CRC), with no record of recent CRC screening (FOBT within 12 months, colonoscopy within 10
      years).

      Procedures (methods): Participants will be identified through the state Medicaid database and
      randomized to receive either: 1) a mailed reminder to complete CRC screening including a FIT
      kit, instructions for completion, and a return mailer, OR 2) a mailed reminder to complete
      CRC screening ONLY.

      Any recipients testing positive will be guided by care managers from Community Care of North
      Carolina to ensure a follow-up colonoscopy is completed.
