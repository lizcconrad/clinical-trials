      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of adalimumab produced by
      CinnaGen company and AbbVie adalimumab in subjects with active Rheumatoid Arthritis. Patients
      with diagnosis of active Rheumatoid arthritis according to EULAR criteria (European League
      Against Rheumatism) aged between 18 to 75 years are included. This is a Phase III,
      randomized, two arms, double blind (patient and assessor blinded), parallel active non
      inferiority controlled clinical trial. The eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive CinnoRA® or Humira®. Every 2 weeks, 40 mg of either of the drugs is administered to
      each patient subcutaneously along with methotrexate (15 mg/week), folic acid (1 mg/day), and
      prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) over a six-month period.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess equivalence of test- adalimumab (CinnoRA®)
      to the reference adalimumab (Humira®) in terms of efficacy in patients with moderate to
      severe active rheumatoid arthritis.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To further compare efficacy of test- adalimumab to reference adalimumab

        -  To assess safety of test- adalimumab compared to reference adalimumab

      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of adalimumab produced by
      CinnaGen company and AbbVie adalimumab in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients
      with diagnosis of active rheumatoid arthritis according to EULAR criteria (European League
      Against Rheumatism) aged between 18 to 75 years are included. This is a Phase III,
      randomized, two arms, double blind (patient and assessor blinded), parallel active non
      inferiority controlled clinical trial. The eligible patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive CinnoRA® or Humira®. Every 2 weeks, 40 mg of either of the drugs is administered to
      each patient subcutaneously along with methotrexate (15 mg/week), folic acid (1 mg/day), and
      prednisolone (7.5 mg/day) over a six-month period.

      Physical examinations, vital signs, disease activity and laboratory parameters are evaluated
      for patients at baseline and at 3 and 6-month visits. The incidence of adverse events at each
      visit was recorded based on patients' reports, vital signs, physical examinations, and
      laboratory tests.

      Before initiation, the trial is reviewed by food and drug administration of Iran. The
      protocol, case report form (CRF), information for patients and informed consent form are
      submitted to the ethics committees responsible for review and approval purposes, according to
      national regulatory guidelines.

      In this study, no patient is recruited without an informed consent. All the informed consent
      forms which are signed by the patients have two copies so that patients could receive a copy
      of it.

      Determination of sample size:

      The outcome is changes in composite scores defined by the European League against Rheumatism
      (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology criterions [16]. EULAR response was seen at
      least once during the 4 week period after drug injection in 89% in the Humira group. The
      CinnoRATM group proportion is assumed to be 0.7100 under the null hypothesis of
      inferiority[16]. If the CinnoRATM response rate is not 18% (δ = −0.18; non-inferiority
      margin) worse than Humira treatment, it will be implied to be non-inferior. Sample size 64 in
      both Humira and CinnoRATM groups yields 90% power to detect non-inferiority margin. The
      significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0250. The significance level actually
      achieved by this design is 0.0284.

      DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE:

      CinnaGen Company conducts clinical trials according to procedures that incorporate the
      ethical principles of GCP. Accurate and reliable data collection is assured by verification
      and cross-check of the CRFs against the patient's records by clinical monitors, and the
      maintenance of a drug-dispensing log by the center.

      Principle and coordinating investigators, CRO (contract research organization) coordinators
      and sponsor personnel attend the investigator meetings and at the end they receive a GCP
      certificate.

      CRO coordinators and one sponsor attend the SIV (Site Initiation Visit) meetings. Protocol
      and GCP principles are reviewed by coordinating investigator of each site and also, the
      needed information for completing CRF and Trial Master File (TMF) forms are explained.

      Monitoring by CRO is performed in 30% and 70% of study progress and at the end of the study.
      In the monitoring sessions some sponsor personnel audit the process. During monitoring
      process, CRO coordinator checks all CRFs and confirms them to the source documents and for
      required cases the query form was filled out.

      The temperature of the refrigerator which containing the medicines is checked and recorded by
      data logger which is checked repeatedly by auditor.

      TMF is checked by CRO coordinator and it is rechecked by auditor. Drug accountability data
      and information about the proper time for patients' injections are checked by CRO coordinator
      and rechecked by sponsor personnel.

      After monitoring, problems are reported by monitor and auditor to the trial centers.

      Blinding:

      The study is double blind. The Subjects and those who conduct the study are unaware of the
      state of the patient with regard to receiving CinnoRA® or Humira®. For this to happen,
      Subjects are blinded by using a masked prefilled syringe content biologically inert substance
      drug, Adalimumab (CinnoRA® or Humira®). The injection method, injection syringes and
      cartridges are totally the same in both groups. During the study, patients are completely
      unaware of the types of medications and groups of therapy.

      To blind those who conduct the study, the person who delivers or checks the study drug is
      different from those who examine the patients and all drugs packages are identified by unique
      numbers (manufacture code).

      It should be noted that CRO personnel who enter data into CRF and database and also the
      sponsor personnel who monitor data entry are blinded. The study is double blind and
      situations that might warrant breaking the code are defined in the protocol and include
      serious adverse events.

      Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data:

      Since the number of patients who participated in this clinical trial is limited and small,
      the investigator can't perform missing imputation analysis and do statistical analysis on
      those patients who are completed the entire study. However, analyses on the adverse events
      are performed on patients who entered the study.

      In this study, patients with at least one adverse event are included in the report. For each
      adverse event, data is summarized using frequencies and percentages and then classifies
      according to body system. They are reported in the form of incidence rate. In other words,
      patients with any number of Adverse Events are counted only once in this calculation.

    <description>Quality of life is assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The HAQ is a self-reported scale used in studies of rheumatoid arthritis to assess areas such as dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, reach, grip, maintaining hygiene, and daily activities. There are 20 questions in the mentioned 8 sections. In each section, the highest score is considered as the main answer. Scores should be between 1 and 4 and the final answer is the average of scores relating to all sections. An increased score indicates a worsening of the disability. The disability index of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) at week 24 is reported.</description>
