  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have postural control problems due to the lack of motor and
      sensory development. Trunk control which has an important role in ensuring postural control,
      is the basis for sitting, mobility, development of the upper extremity, pulmonary function
      and activities of daily living. Poor postural control restricts upper extremity functions
      which also affects the quality of movements. For this reason, it is important to assess the
      relationship between trunk control and upper extremity functions. This study is planned to
      investigate the effect of balance and trunk control on upper extremity functions in children
      with CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 hemiparetic and 32 diparetic CP, in total 62 children, aged between 5-12 years, were
      included in this study. Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS) was used to assess trunk
      control, Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) was used to assess balance, and Quality of Upper
      Extremity Skills Test was used to assess upper extremity functions (QUEST).

    <description>QUEST is a reliable tool for children with CP aged 2-12 years.The QUEST groups upper limb movement into four domains. Each domain focuses on areas of difficulty typically seen in children with spastic cerebral palsy: (a) Dissociated Movements, (ability to voluntarily isolate movement at the shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers); (b) Grasps (which also rates sitting postures during grasps of 1 inch cube, cereal, pencil or crayon); (c) Weight Bearing (ability to lean on the arms in prone or 4-point kneeling, sitting and while reaching); and (d) Protective Extension (using the arms to stop oneself from falling forward, backward and to the side). In addition to the four domains of movement the QUEST also has three scales: Hand Function, Spasticity and Co-operativeness.</description>

    <measure>Trunk Control Measurement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 15 items measuring two main components of trunk control: (a) a stable base of support (static sitting balance), and (b) an actively moving body segment (dynamic sitting balance). The subscale static sitting balance (items 1-5) evaluates the ability of the child to maintain a stable trunk posture during movements of upper and lower limbs. The section dynamic sitting balance is further divided into two subscales: selective movement control and dynamic reaching. The subscale selective movement control (items 6-12) measures selective trunk movements in the sagittal (flexion/extension), frontal (lateral flexion) and transverse (rotation) plane within the base of support. The subscale dynamic reaching (items 13-15) evaluates the performance of three reaching tasks, requiring active trunk movements beyond the base of support</description>

        Cerebral palsy (CP) describes a group of permanent disorders in movement and posture that
        limit activity and participation and are attributed to non-progressive disturbances in the
