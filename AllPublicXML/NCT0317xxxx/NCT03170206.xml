  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted as a possible treatment for lung cancer with a specific change
      in the KRAS gene.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Palbociclib

        -  Binimetinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I/II clinical trial. Participants are being asked to
      participate in the Phase I portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of
      an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      intervention is being studied.

      Palbociclib is an oral drug which has been shown to stop the cell cycle, which is the way a
      cell initiates growth. Binimetinib is also an oral drug which stops a signal that a cell
      receives, instructing it to grow. By putting these two drugs together the investigators hope
      that it will have a greater affect on cancer growth than either drug alone. The FDA (the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration) has not approved binimetinib as a treatment for any disease.
      The FDA has not approved palbociclib for use in lung cancer but it has been approved for
      other cancer types.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test the combination of these two drugs, Palbociclib and Binimetinib, in order to
           determine a safe and tolerable dose of the combination

        -  Determine the response rate of the combination

        -  Further evaluate the safety and side effect profile for the combination of palbociclib
           and binimetinib.

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC (with a confirmed KRAS
             mutation via any CLIA-certified method) for which curable treatment modalities are not

             spiral CT scan. See section 10 for the evaluation of measureable disease.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available in

             known. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (combination hormonal and barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90
             days after discontinuation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant

          -  MTD Expansion: Patients must be willing to undergo pre- and on-treatment tumor
             biopsies. Patients are exempt from this requirement if, in the opinion of the

             imaging.

          -  MTD Expansion: Patients currently taking anticoagulants and who cannot safely hold the
             medication to facilitate pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies are excluded from
             participation.

          -  Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers is prohibited due to drug-drug
             interactions with palbociclib. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers should be used with
             caution (see Appendix C).

          -  Part I Dose Escalation: Concurrent use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) is prohibited.

               -  cardiac arrhythmia

               -  myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary
                  angioplasty, or stenting &lt; 6 months prior to screening

          -  History of QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, known history of QTc prolongation, or
             Torsades de Pointes.

          -  History of Gilbert's syndrome.

          -  History of neuromuscular disorders that are associated with elevated CK (e.g.
             inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal
             muscular atrophy).

          -  History of other malignancy which could affect compliance with the protocol or
             interpretation of results. History of curatively treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are allowed. Subjects with a
             malignancy that has been treated with curative intent will also be allowed if the
             malignancy has been in remission without treatment for ≥ 2 years prior to Cycle 1, Day
             1. Subjects with localized prostate cancer that has been treated with curative intent
             will be allowed

          -  Patients planning to embark on a new strenuous exercise regimen after the first dose
             of study treatment.

             investigator.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents have the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. As there is an unknown but
             potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with the study agents, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is
             treated.

          -  Part II: Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except
             for the following circumstances:

               -  They have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the
                  investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.

               -  Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and curatively
                  treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal or squamous
                  cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Known HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. Appropriate studies will be
             undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          -  Patients with known active hepatitis B and/or active hepatitis C infection.

          -  Evidence of visible retinal pathology on screening ophthalmologic examination that
             places the participant at an unacceptable risk for retinal vein occlusion (e.g.
             uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity, etc.).

          -  History of retinal degenerative disease.

          -  Presence of neurosensory retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or
             neovascular macular degeneration on screening ophthalmologic exam.
