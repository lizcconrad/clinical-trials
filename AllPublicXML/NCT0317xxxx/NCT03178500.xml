      This study is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted in Ain Shams University
      maternity hospital at infertility clinic within a period of 6-8 months.

      All patient are previously diagnosed as PCOs according to the Rotterdam conference of 2003.

      All patients will be devided according to computer based program into two groups First group:
      Patients with traditional protocol

      Traditional protocol:

      Clomiphene citrate (clomid) (50mg) will be given for 5 days (days 3-7). Transvaginal
      ultrasound from 9th-20th every other day if ovulation occur the patient will be excluded if
      no ovulation, we will wait for the next menses and increase the dose to (100mg). if no
      ovulation occurred increase the dose to (150mg) in the next cycle if no ovulation increase
      the dose to (200mg) TVUS from 9th-20th ovary other day. If no ovulation we will wait for next
      cycle and increase the dose to (250mg) and so till 6 cycles .

      Second group: Patient with stair step protocol Follicular development will be monitored using
      transvaginal ultrasound at 11-14 day after (50mg) clomiphene for 5 days if there is no
      response (no follicle &gt;10mm), so, (100mg) clomiphene will be initiated immediately for 5 days
      and ultrasound will be repeated 1 week after the first ultrasound. If there is no response,
      (150mg) clomiphene will be initiated immediately for another 5 days and TV/US will be
      performed 1 week after the second TV/US .
