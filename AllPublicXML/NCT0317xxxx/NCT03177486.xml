    <textblock>
      Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled. CAD was diagnosed by coronary
      angiography which also resulted Syntax score. Images of left and right ears were captured by
      a digital camera. Frank score of each patients was calculated based on characteristics and
      numbers of wrinkles of the earlobes. Statistic analysis were carried out to analyze the
      correlation between Frank Score and Syntax Score.
