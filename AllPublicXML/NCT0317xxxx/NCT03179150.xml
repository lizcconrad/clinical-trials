  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the diagnostic performance and time efficiency of Computer-Aided Detection (CAD)
      assisted reading for the identification of pulmonary nodules in chest Computed Tomography
      (CT) from oncological patients with that of unassisted reading.

      The main aim of this study is to compare the diagnostic performance of CAD assisted
      interpretation with that of unassisted reading in the detection of lung metastases in
      consecutive patients staged for extrathoracic malignancies. This study also aims at
      validating a new Web/Cloud based workflow for the use of CAD systems in clinical practice,
      not requiring installation of additional software or hardware and potentially representing a
      cost-effective CAD solution for clinical facilities.

        Between September 2015 and March 2016, 237 consecutive patients (123 men, 52%) with an
        average age of 62 (range 21-90 years), were enrolled in this retrospective observational
        single centre study. Patients enrolled into the study performed CT either for staging,
