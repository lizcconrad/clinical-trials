  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) remains a common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in
      adults. There are few randomized clinical trials regarding the therapeutic effect of
      mycophenolate mofetil in patients with Idiopathic membranous nephropathy. This study aims to
      evaluate whether treatment with mycophenolate mofetil is non-inferior to cyclosporins in
      inducing long-term remission (complete or partial) of proteinuria in patients with idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults.
      In recent year, IMN remains one of the most common glomerular diseases. Long-term remission
      and stable renal function can prevent idiopathic membranous nephropathy from progressing to
      end-stage renal disease. Cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide are recommended to be first-line
      treatment regimen. Corticosteroid is the basic combined drug in the treatment of idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy. Mycophenolate mofetil is a recently developed immunosuppressive agent
      with fewer renal toxicity than cyclosporin.Besides, high dose prednisone may be effective for
      patients in Asia according to literatures from Asia. In our study, patients with idiopathic
      membranous nephropathy would be treated with mycophenolate mofetil and high dose
      prednisone,whose outcome will be compared with cyclosporin and low dose prednisone. We aims
      to evaluate whether treatment with mycophenolate mofetil is non-inferior to cyclosporins in
      inducing long-term remission of proteinuria in patients with idiopathic membranous
      nephropathy.
