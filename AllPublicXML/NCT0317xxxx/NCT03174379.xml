  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two-center study is to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture
      treatments in addressing mobility deficits, sensorimotor impairment, and quality of life
      (QOL) limitations in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). It is hypothesized that
      acupuncture will result in an improvement in these limitations.
