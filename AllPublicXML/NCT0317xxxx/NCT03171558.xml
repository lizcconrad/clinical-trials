  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the gastric pull up (GPU) with the free flap [(specifically,
      anterolateral thigh (ALT) and radial forearm free flap (RFFF)] techniques used in the
      reconstruction of alimentary tracts in patients who require laryngectomy and circumferential
      pharyngectomy for carcinoma resection. These two interventions will be compared by block
      randomizing 20 patients based on history of failed chemoradiation to undergo either ALT or
      RFFF. The primary outcome will be the type and number of postoperative complications. The
      secondary outcomes will include swallowing function, speech, and quality of life measures
      along with cancer specific endpoints.
