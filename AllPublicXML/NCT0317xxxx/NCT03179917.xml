  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the safety and effectiveness of pembrolizumab followed by
      radiation therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma.

      The purpose of this study is to determine how effective combining the research drug,
      pembrolizumab, with a targeted form of radiation therapy known as involved site radiotherapy
      can be in patients with relapsed or refractory early stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The
      goal is to see whether this treatment strategy can cure a significant number of patients with
      relapsed or refractory early stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma while avoiding the toxicity of
      either a large radiation field or further chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.

    <description>Following a PET/CT simulation to evaluate the extent of disease, pembrolizumab 200mg IV will be given over 30 minutes on day 1 of each 21 day cycle for a total of 4 cycles. Fourteen to 21 days after the completion of therapy, a PET/CT simulation will be repeated. Patients with complete response will proceed to 20 Gy of ISRT. Patients without a PET CR, but improvement on CT scan will have a repeat biopsy. If the biopsy is negative for Hodgkin Lymphoma, these patients will receive 30 Gy of ISRT. If the biopsy is positive for Hodgkin Lymphoma, they will receive 36-40 Gy ISRT.</description>
