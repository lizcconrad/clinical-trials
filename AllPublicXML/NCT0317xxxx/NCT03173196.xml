      The patients of the group &quot;sepsis&quot; are measured several times with the non-invasive
      multi-spectral sonography (Sonovum &quot;ACG-Diagnosesystem&quot;) (days 1, 3, 7 and 14). The patients
      of the group &quot;control&quot; are measured on days 1 and 3 with the system. A measurement takes 3
      minutes. For this purpose two ultrasound heads are placed above the patient's ears and fixed
      with an all-head harness. The device is certified for CE application. There are no known
      health risks of ultrasound in humans.

    <textblock>
      Sepsis with multiorgan failure is one of the most common diseases in intensive care units and
      is at the top of the world of causes of death. In addition to increasingly serious sepsis by
      multidrug-resistant pathogens, neurological symptoms are frequently recorded in the systemic
      manifestation of the disease pattern. Septic encephalopathy (SE) is usually an early cerebral
      sign of the developing sepsis, often before other clinically as well as diagnostically
      detectable findings such as fever ascent, hypotonia or laboratory chemical infections.
      Therefore, the SE is a clinically important parameter, also because after the sepsis,
      cerebral functional restrictions such as cognitive disorders can persist in the long term.

      Therefore, on day 1, 3, 7 and 14 the patients are measured with the ACG-system as well as
      determined different scores of the patients: CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method - Intensive
      Care Unit) and ICDSC (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist) for the neurological
      outcome; Apache (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation) II for mortality and SOFA
      (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment Score) for organ failure.
