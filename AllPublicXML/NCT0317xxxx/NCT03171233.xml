  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic knee valgus is an inadequate biomechanical movement of multifactorial cause that may
      expose the individual to various injuries. The range of motion of ankle dorsiflexion is one
      of the possible influencing factors. This study intends to compare the immediate effect of
      two techniques on ankle mobility and dynamic knee valgus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the immediate effects of ankle mobilization on dynamic knee valgus
      and to compare two techniques of ankle mobility. It will include 102 lower limbs that present
      deficit of ankle dorsiflexion and dynamic knee valgus in the same lower limb.

      Participants will be divided into two groups, one for ankle mobilization with movement aided
      by the therapist and another for self mobilization of the ankle. The two intervention groups
      will do the same protocol, same number of sets, repetitions and rest time.There will be
      randomisation allocation of individuals in the groups and because of the nature of the
      interventions only the evaluator may be blind.

      The Kolmogorov - Smirnov test is used to verify the data distribution normality. The
      characterization of the participants is performed by means of descriptive statistical
      analysis. Parametric or non-parametric tests will be used according to the data distribution
      normality for comparison between groups at baseline. The evaluator blinding will be tested
      using the chi -square test by comparing the randomization code with the evaluator opinion.
      The difference between the groups and their respective confidence intervals will be
      calculated by linear mixed models using interaction term of &quot;time versus group.&quot;

    <description>Participants Mobilization Group with Movement are positioned knee facing the physiotherapist, are not elastic passages above the participant's malleolus and are from the physiotherapist's pelvis. The therapist applies a posterolateral slip sustained to a tibia through the belt, leaning backward, while the talus and forefoot are secured with the space between the thumb and the second finger of the hand of both hands. The participant will be instructed to perform a slow dorsiflexion movement for their maximum amplitude.</description>

    <description>In the Auto Mobilization with Movement group, participants will self-mobilize the ankle on top of a box (15 centimeters with a 10 ° incline), a non-elastic band will pass below the malleoli and the back of the band will be placed in the middle of the other Lower limb, thus mobilizing the talus in the posteroinferior direction, the participant should maintain the force in that direction while making the dorsiflexion movement in closed kinetic chain until returning to the initial position again. Using the same group protocol as the therapist will help.</description>
