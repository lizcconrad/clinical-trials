  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selektive dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) has been used as treatment option in children suffering from
      cerebral palsy (CP) for several decades and multiple studies demonstrated its benefits.
      Nevertheless, there are still no proven strategies for patient selection, optimal point of
      time for the operation or pre- and postoperative therapies. The evaluation of the impact of
      selective motor control, cognition and cerebral imaging findings on the motor outcome and
      life quality in children with CP who underwent SDR at the Charité University clinics will
      clarify these critical points in daily care for patients with CP.
