  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the benefits of Mirror Therapy (MT) and motivation in patients with different
      levels of post-stroke motor impairment with two different therapy protocols. This is a
      randomized uncontrolled blinded study, with 27 individuals in the chronic phase of stroke.
      Participants were randomized into two intervention groups: MT group with motor patterns of
      movement (MP, n=13) and MT group with specific functional activities (SA, n=14). Motor
      impairment assessments (Fugl-Meyer Assessment - FMA), motivation (Intrinsic Motivation
      Inventory) and functionality (Functional Independence Measure - FIM) were performed before
      and after treatment, and 3 months after the end of sessions (follow-up). In each intervention
      group,there were patients classified with mild, moderate or severe motor impairment,
      according to FMA. All participants performed 15 MT sessions, 3 times a week for 50 minutes
      each session.

    <description>For the mirror therapy protocol applied to the Motor Standard, each patient was treated with 15 mirror therapy sessions, 3 times a week for a total duration of 50 minutes. There were 4 exercises of voluntary range of motion involving the extension and mass flexion of the fingers, adduction and abduction of the fingers, pronation and supination of the forearm and elbow extension with associated shoulder elevation.</description>
