  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an observational, open-label, cohort-study conducted in accordance with the
      principles of the Helsinki Declaration. We prospectively and systematically recorded data
      from the patients and analyzed them retrospectively. During a first phase, called adaptation
      period, the injector (DR) used a follow-the-pain approach in order to determine the optimal
      injection scheme for each individual. The possible injection sites were the corrugator,
      temporalis, and trapezius muscles. Patients were systematically asked about the usual
      topography and time course of migraine attacks, and the existence of pain or stiffness of the
      cervical muscles. If the pain was predominantly located in the frontotemporal area, the
      corrugator and temporalis muscles were injected bilaterally. When the patients had
      predominant pain in the back of the head, or when their headache pain frequently started
      and/or ended in the trapezius muscles, both trapezius muscles were injected. These muscle
      groups were injected together if pain was both frontotemporal and cervico-occipital. When
      this first set of injections was efficacious, patients were re-injected in the same manner at
      the time when the frequency of headache days definitely increased. In the absence of
      efficacy, the paradigm was modified using the same follow-the-pain approach. Once the best
      procedure was determined for each patient, it was reproduced at each subsequent injection
      session. This adaptation phase could necessitate up to three sessions. The observation period
      started 8 weeks before the first efficacious injection and ended 2 months after the second
      consecutive efficacious injection, or in case of inefficacy. Throughout the adaptation and
      the observation phases, patients kept a headache diary where they were asked to note the days
      with headache and the use of rescue medication.
