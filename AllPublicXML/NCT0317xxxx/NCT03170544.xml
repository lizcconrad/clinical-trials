  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an active- and placebo-controlled, single-site, four-part trial of MK-1092 in healthy
      adult participants, in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and in participants
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary hypothesis for this study is that at a dose
      with sufficient safety, the mean maximal glucose infusion rate (GIRmax) after single
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of MK-1092 in adult participants with T1DM is within an
      acceptable range. (Part 3)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 4 parts in this study. In Part 1, healthy adult participants will be randomized
      to receive blinded MK-1092 subcutaneously (SC) or glargine SC, as a single dose under the
      euglycemic clamp. Once a safe and tolerated dose that achieves GIRmax is identified in Part
      1, Part 2 will start. In Part 2, 4 different healthy adult participants will be enrolled in a
      single panel and receive open-label MK-1092 SC as a single dose under the euglycemic clamp
      and also receive an intravenous infusion of Humalog®. In Part 3, adult participants with T1DM
      will be randomized to receive blinded MK-1092 SC or glargine SC, as a single dose under the
      euglycemic clamp. Part 4 includes a 3-period design that will explore up to 3 single
      subcutaneous doses of MK-1092 or glargine in participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
