    <textblock>
      Through the literature screening of MyomiRX 7, the detection of mechanical ventilation group,
      difficult withdrawal unit and healthy adult plasma levels of MyomiRX in the evaluation of
      function and skeletal muscle thickness of the diaphragm, the correlation analysis of 7 kinds
      of MyomiRX and diaphragmatic dysfunction. The research value of this project is to explore
      the predictive value of plasma MyomiRX level on diaphragmatic dysfunction in patients with
      mechanical ventilation, and to lay the foundation for finding the target of VIDD diagnosis
      and treatment

      1. research content (1) screening MyomiR through literature review (2) selection of
           mechanical ventilation group, difficult withdrawal units and three healthy adult groups,
           method for the detection of plasma MyomiRX level and clinical assessment of
           diaphragmatic function, observation of the relationship between MyomiRX level and
           diaphragmatic dysfunction, prediction of plasma MyomiRX levels in patients with
           mechanical ventilation for diaphragmatic dysfunction in value.

        2. research objectives Objective to investigate the predictive value of specific minute RNA
           in plasma muscle tissue on diaphragmatic dysfunction in mechanical ventilation patients
           Experimental grouping (1) the control group of mechanical ventilation (time of
           examination, preoperative, admission to ICU and before extubation); (2) difficulty in
           withdrawal of units (first days, third days and seventh days after the failure of the
           test time for the first withdrawal); (3) the healthy control group (after the test time
           was selected)
