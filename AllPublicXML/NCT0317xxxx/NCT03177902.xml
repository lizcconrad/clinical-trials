  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in China. Even though advances in the field
      of breast cancer therapeutics, chemotherapy remains the mainstay therapeutic modality. The
      cytotoxic therapies are generally associated with some immediate or otherwise delayed side
      effects, such as adverse effects on gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal and hematological
      systems. The effect of chemotherapy on endocrine system, however, is comparatively less
      envisaged. Several epidemiological studies show a positive association between plasma thyroid
      hormones levels and breast cancer risk. Thyroid dysfunction is emerging as a variably common
      endocrine toxicity of several anticancer drugs. Due to the scarcity of data on the
      functioning of thyroid gland during chemotherapy in a large scale group, the present study
      was aimed to investigate the incidence of thyroid abnormity in Chinese women with newly
      diagnosed breast cancer, and also the effects of chemotherapy on thyroid gland functions or
      structure in these breast cancer patients undergoing at least four cycles of chemotherapy.
