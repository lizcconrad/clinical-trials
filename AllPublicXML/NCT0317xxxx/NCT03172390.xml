  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascending aorta aneurysmal disease is common and can be complicated by dissection or rupture.
      There is substantial variation in individual aneurysm progression: established risk factors
      for an accelerated aneurysm growth rate include initial size or localization, the presence of
      aortic valve disease, congenital bicuspid aortic valve or connective tissue disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there is an increased lifetime risk when the aortic diameter exceeds 6 cm,
      predicting aneurysm progression is nearly impossible and dissection and rupture also occur at
      diameters under 6 cm. The assessment of aortic hemodynamics and the presence of altered flow
      patterns, as well as distribution and changes in wall shear stress (WSS) and the oscillatory
      shear index (OSI), using 4D phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) may
      provide further insights in how aneurysms develop and in assessing the risk of dissection.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate in patients with dilated ascending aorta the
      flow patterns and vessel wall parameters in order to correlate these hemodynamics factors
      with changes in aorta size.
