      This is a phase 1 randomized,double-blind,placebo-controlled study with single oral dose of
      globalagliatin hydrochloride (SY-004) administered to chinese healthy subjects to evaluated
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of globalagliatin
      hydrochloride (SY-004).

      Glucokinase is a characteristic hexokinase isoenzyme in hepatocytes that catalyzes the first
      step in glucose metabolism. In addition to its role in glucose metabolism, glucokinase is
      expressed in pancreatic islet beta cells where it acts as a &quot;glucose sensor&quot; for insulin
      release. Activation of glucokinase increases the glucose sensitivity of insulin secretion,
      effectively lowering the glucose threshold for insulin secretion. Because of its potential to
      enhance insulin secretion and affect hepatic glucose metabolism, is being investigated for
      use as a treatment for hyperglycaemia,glubalagliatin( the active ingredient in SY-004
      capsule) is being investigated for use as a treatment for T2DM patients. This is a phase 1
      randomized,double-blind,placebo-controlled study with single oral dose of SY-004 administered
      to chinese healthy subjects to evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of SY-004.
