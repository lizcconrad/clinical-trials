      This study compares the efficacy of five oral analgesics: 5 mg oxycodone + 325 mg
      acetaminophen, 5 mg hydrocodone + 300 mg acetaminophen, 30 mg codeine + 300 mg acetaminophen,
      400 mg ibuprofen + 1000 mg acetaminophen, and 800 mg ibuprofen + 1000 mg acetaminophen for
      the treatment of patients with acute musculoskeletal pain who present to the Emergency
      Department (ED).

      The optimal treatment of musculoskeletal extremity pain in the ED not known. The study is a
      randomized controlled trial designed to compare the efficacy of five oral analgesics: 5 mg
      oxycodone + 325 mg acetaminophen, 5 mg hydrocodone + 300 mg acetaminophen, 30 mg codeine +
      300 mg acetaminophen, 400 mg ibuprofen + 1000 mg acetaminophen, and 800 mg ibuprofen + 1000
      mg acetaminophen for the treatment of patients with acute musculoskeletal pain. The primary
      outcome is the between treatment group difference in change in patients' rating of pain
      intensity one hour after ingestion of the study medication. Secondary outcomes include: 1)
      the between treatment group difference in change in patients' rating of pain intensity two
      hours after ingestion of the study medication; 2) difference in proportion of patients who
      receive rescue medication; 3) difference in proportion of patients who would choose to take
      the study medication again if they returned to the ED with similar pain; 4) difference in
      proportion of patients who experience side effects.

    <masking_description>A pharmacist working in an area inaccessible to ED staff will ensure blinding of the study by masking the medication and inserting it into indentical unmarked gel capsules, filling any void with small amounts of lactose. Randomization will be performed in blocks of 10 determined by a sequence generated at http://www.randomization.com. The pharmacist will make up numbered research packets based on the random allocation list, each with 5 tablets containing the masked investigational medication. Research packets will be removed sequentially by the nurse from the Pyxis automated medical dispensing system and administered to the study patients in the ED.</masking_description>
