  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study aims to (i) asses intensive care doctors trigger for and
      the expected physiological response to a fluid bolus and (ii) evaluate the patient's actual
      physiological response to a single fluid bolus at one hour post-bolus for 100 adult patients
      admitted to the intensive care unit will be included in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit patients often receive a fluid bolus during their ICU-stay. ICU doctors
      use a variety of clinical triggers when deciding whether or not to give a fluid bolus.
      However, the type of physiological triggers used and their correlation to the anticipated
      physiological response of the patient to an administered fluid bolus is not entirely clear.

      The investigators will perform a prospective observational study to evaluate the triggers
      for, expected physiological and actual physiological response to fluid bolus therapy in the
      intensive care unit. Specifically, the investigators will assess which of the the
      physiological trigger(s) intensive care doctors use when deciding to give a fluid bolus; the
      expected physiological response to the fluid bolus by intensive care doctors; and, to what
      degree the patients actual physiological response 1 hour after a fluid bolus correlate with
      expectations.

      This study will involve a survey of ICU physicians to determine the physiological trigger and
      expectations and a medical audit to ascertain the physiological response to a fluid bolus.
      The investigators will evaluate a single fluid bolus in 100 separate intensive care unit
      patients.
