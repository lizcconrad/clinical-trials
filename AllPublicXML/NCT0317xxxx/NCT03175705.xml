  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study enrolls patients who have relapsed/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, BCLC
      stage C). The HCC tumor relapsed or metastasized through the body after standard treatment or
      the patients cannot receive standard treatment under current conditions. This research study
      uses specific HCC antigens CD8+ T cells, a new experimental treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance as well as the potential
      clinical efficacy of an adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells, sorted with human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA)-peptide multimers and specific for Glypican (GPC)-3 /New York Esophageal
      Squamous-1 (NY-ESO-1) /alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) antigens and cultured in vitro, to patients
      suffering from relapsed/advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
