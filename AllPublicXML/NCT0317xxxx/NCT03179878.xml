      A Phase 1, First-in-human, Oral Single and Multiple Dose-Escalation, Randomized,
      Double-blinded, Placebo-controlled Study of SYNB1020 in Healthy Adult Volunteers to Evaluate
      Safety, Tolerability, Dosing, and Pharmacodynamics
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, dose-escalating, randomized, double-blinded study will evaluate SYNB1020 in
      placebo-controlled cohorts within the following 2 study parts:

      Part 1: A single-ascending dose (SAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting over 6 days in
      healthy volunteer male and female subjects evaluated in up to 7 dose cohorts to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) within the single dose range studied; and Part 2: A
      multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study conducted in an inpatient setting over 22 days in healthy
      volunteer male and female subjects evaluated in up to 4 dose cohorts that were proven
      tolerable in the SAD part of the study to identify the MTD of SYNB1020 within the
      multiple-dose range studied. Up to 48 subjects may be enrolled in this part of the study.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 30 days prior to enrollment, with
      evaluations of exercise habits, gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms, fecal patterns
      (frequency, consistency), recent or current antibiotic exposure, and laboratory measurements.
      Eligible patients will be admitted to an inpatient facility for investigational product (IP)
      administration, safety monitoring, and collection of blood, urine, and fecal samples for
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations.
