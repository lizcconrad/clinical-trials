    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the bioavailability and safety of one oral preparation containing fixed dose 18
      mg ivermectin (IVM 18 MG TABLETS, LICONSA S.A., Spain) or two oral preparations containing
      fixed dose 18 mg ivermectin (IVM 36 MG TABLETS, LICONSA S.A., Spain) vs. reference dosing
      (weight based) of reference drug containing 6 mg ivermectin (REVECTINA®, Abbott Laboratórios
      do Brasil Ltda, Brazil) in fasting conditions. A monocentric, open, randomized, single dose,
      three-period crossover trial in healthy volunteers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Caucasian subjects of either gender (male or female) with an age between 18 and 45
             years (both inclusive).

          2. Medical history and physical examination with no relevant abnormal findings.

          3. No evidence of significant disease (organic or psychiatric) based on medical history,
             physical examination and complementary tests.

          4. Laboratory tests (complete hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis).

          5. Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and temperature) and
             electrocardiogram (ECG) record within normal range at screening.

          6. Participating female volunteers must use a reliable contraception method not
             containing hormones. List of accepted contraception method includes barrier methods
             (i.e. female/male condoms, diaphragms, spermicides), voluntary sterilization (female
             tubal occlusion) or non-medicated intrauterine devices (IUD) (i.e. inert or
             copper-releasing). Abstention is not considered a reliable contraception method.

          7. For female volunteers only: they must declare that they did not intend to become
             pregnant in the last month prior to screening and they do not intend to become
             pregnant during one month following the last study drug administration.

          8. Voluntary participation in the study, with written informed consent from the
             volunteer.

          9. The subject agrees to abstain from beverages or food containing methylxanthines
             (coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, chocolate etc.), St John's Wort, vitamins, herbal
             remedies and chewing-gum for 48 hours prior to study drug administration and during
             each study period.

         10. The subject agrees to abstain from beverages or food containing grapefruit for 14 days
             prior to the first study drug administration and during the study (until last sample
             from the last period).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Background of alcoholism or drug dependence in the last one year or daily consumption
             of alcohol &gt; 40 gr/day for men or &gt; 24 gr/day for women.

          4. Use of any medication within 15 days prior to taking the study treatment, including

          8. Pregnancy or lactation status for female subjects.

          9. Participation in another clinical trial during the 3 months before starting the
             current trial.

         10. Donate blood in the 8 weeks prior to starting the study.

         11. Undergone major surgery during the previous 6 months.

         12. Clinically significant abnormal ECG with clinical significance in accordance with the
             CIM's clinical criterion

         13. Restrictive vegetarian diet

         14. Positive results to the breath alcohol test at screening or at Day -1

         15. Positive results to the drug abuse checks (urine test for: amphetamines, cannabinoids,
             opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine) at screening or at admission on Day -1
