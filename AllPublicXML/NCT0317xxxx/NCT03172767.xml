      A convenience of preterm and term preschoolers recruiting from Gazi University, Faculty of
      Health Science, Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. Each group contains 30
      children. First, sociodemographic information and histories of children are obtaining. Ages
      and contact information of the parents are recording. Prenatal and natal risk factors of the
      mothers are querying. Gestational ages and height, weight, and head circumferences of babies
      at birth are recording. Number of pregnancies, live births and abortions, type of delivery,
      multiple pregnancies for mothers as well as consanguinity between parents are asking. Marmara
      Primary School Readiness Scale is using to evaluate mental-language development,
      socio-emotional development, physical development, self-care skills,math skills, science
      skills, voice exercises, line exercises and labyrinths. Sensory profile caregiver
      questionnaire screen for the senses (sensory processing), adjustment (modulation), behavioral
      and emotional responses. . All examination wiil be finished in the same day.

    <description>The profile reveals the child's sensory appearance in terms of sensory search, emotional response formation, low endurance, oral tenderness, distractibility, weak perception, sensory sensitivity, activity level and fine motor / perceptual differences. In addition, the child evaluates the senses (sensory processing), adjustment (modulation), behavioral and emotional responses.</description>
