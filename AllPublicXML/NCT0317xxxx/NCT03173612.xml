    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate that whether the AML (acute myeloid leukemia)-CAMS
      (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences)-2016 regimen, includes risk-stratified therapy and the
      use of Dasatinib in CBF (Core binding factor)-AML, can improve the outcome in childhood AML.

    <textblock>
      Primary AML includes CBF(Core binding factor)-AML and non-CBF-AML. After the second course of
      therapy, CBF-AML are stratified into two risk groups: low-risk children are defined as those
      with CR after MAE or CAG, high-risk children are those with CR after consolidation course 1
      or IAE. Non-CBF-AML patients in remission are stratified into three risk groups: low-risk
      children are defined as those with t(1；11)(q21；q23) , GATA1, NPM1/IDH1/IDH2 without
      FLT3/ITD,or an age younger than 2 years without high-risk factors; high-risk children are
      those with CR after consolidation course 1 or IAE or with abnormalities of monosomy 7, 5q- ,
      t(16;21), t(9;22) (Philadelphia chromosome [Ph1]), FLT3/ITD,-17/TP53, RPN1-MECOM, RUNX1-EVI1,
      MLF1-NPM1, PRDM16-RPN1, DEK-NUP214, ETV6(TEL)-HLXB9(MNX1), NUP98-NSD1; intermediate-risk
      children are those who were not in either a low-risk or high-risk group.Low-risk children
      were treated only with chemotherapy, regardless the availability of a suitable HSCT donor.
      All high-risk children were allocated to Allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
      in the first remission, including unrelated bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Auto-HSCT is
      recommended for intermediate-risk children. No prophylactic cranial irradiation is included
      in the protocol. Patients are treated on an inpatient basis during each treatment phase.

    <description>AML-CAMS-2016 regimen includes risk-stratified therapy and the use of Dasatinib in CBF-AML.The induction regimen includes MAE (etoposide 150mg/㎡/d d1-5, cytarabine 200mg/㎡/d d6-12 , mitoxantrone 5 mg/㎡/d d6-10), CAG (aclacinomycin 6mg/㎡/d d1-8, Ara-C 10mg/㎡ q12h d1-14 , G-CSF 200ug/㎡/d d1-14),IAE (idarubicin 8 mg/㎡/d d1-3, Ara-C 500mg/㎡/d d1-3 d8-10, VP-16 200mg/㎡/d d8-10).Consolidation regimen includes IA (Ara-C 1g/㎡ q12h d1-4, IDA 10mg/㎡/d d1), MA (Ara-C 1g/㎡ q12h d1-4, MTZ 5mg/㎡/d d1-3), IAE (IDA 10mg/㎡/d d1, Ara-C 3g/㎡ q12h d1-3, VP-16 100mg/㎡/d d1-5), MAE (Ara-C 200mg/㎡ d4-8, VP-16 150mg/㎡/d d1-3, MTZ 5mg/㎡/d d4-6),EA (Ara-C 2g/㎡ q12h d1-5, VP-16 100mg/㎡/d d1-5),IAE (IDA 10mg/㎡/d d1, Ara-C 3g/㎡ q12h d1-3, VP-16 100mg/㎡/d d1-5),EA (Ara-C 2g/㎡ q12h d1-5, VP-16 100mg/㎡/d d1-5),MAE (Ara-C 200mg/㎡ d4-8, VP-16 150mg/㎡/d d1-3, MTZ 5mg/㎡/d d4-6).

    <description>Primary AML includes CBF-AML and non-CBF-AML. Children with a WBC (white blood cell) lower than 4,000/μL and low proliferative bone marrow at diagnosis are treated with CAG. Other children are treated with MAE. The rescue regimen for children who showed M3 marrow after MAE or CAG is IAE. Consolidation therapy consisted of four (for CBF-AML) or five (for non-CBF-AML) courses, and triplein trathecal therapy is given as a part of each course. After the second course of therapy, CBF-AML are stratified into two risk groups, while non-CBF-AML patients in remission are stratified into three risk groups.Consolidation regimen for CBF-AML includes IA, MA, IA, MA. Dasatinib is used in CBF-AML as a part of consolidation therapy. Consolidation regimen for non-CBF-AML includes IAE, MAE, EA, IAE, EA or MAE.</description>
