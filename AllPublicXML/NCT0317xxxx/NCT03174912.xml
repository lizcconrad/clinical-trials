      Investigators aimed to evaluate the performance of The European Organization for Research and
      Treatment of Cancer(EORTC) and the Spanish Urology Association for Oncological
      Treatment(CUETO) risk tables on all non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients(NMIBC), and
      those not treated with BCG and treated with BCG separately.

    <textblock>
      Risk tables can be used for the prediction of recurrence and especially progression of
      nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer .The European Organization for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer(EORTC) developed a risk table,which provides a scoring system for recurrence and
      progression risk.The EORTC risk table includes these factors: number of tumors,tumor
      size,prior recurrence rate,T stage,presence of carcinoma in situ(CIS),and grade for NMIBC
      patients not treated by maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin(BCG) instillation therapy.The
      Spanish Urology Association for Oncological Treatment(CUETO)later proposed a modified model
      to be used for patients only treated with BCG instillation.This risk table includes these
      factors:age,gender,recurrent tumor,number of tumors,T stage,CIS,and grade.

      There is no risk table that can be used for NMIBC patients treated or not treated with
      BCG.Should we use the EORTC risk table for patients not treated with BCG and the CUETO table
      only for those treated with BCG or is one of them sufficient to predict recurrence and
      progression in all patients?The main aim of this study was to compare the utility of the
      EORTC and CUETO risk tables in all patients, and separately in patients not treated with BCG
      and treated with BCG.
