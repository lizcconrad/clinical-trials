      Approval for access is solely at CSL Behring's discretion and the following criteria must be
      met for CSL Behring to consider access to experimental or unlicensed product:

        -  The patient has an unmet medical need that is life-threatening, chronic or seriously
           disabling, as defined by local regulations and applicable to the particular patient. All
           treatment options available to the patient should have been explored and exhausted by
           the physician, including participation in clinical trials.

        -  The patient and caregiver must be informed of potential risks and benefits of receiving
           the experimental therapy. The overall potential benefit should outweigh the combined
           potential risks of the experimental medicine and the outcome of the illness or disease
           itself. If approved, CSL Behring will provide treating physicians with risk information
           wording for inclusion in the physician's informed consent form, which will outline the
           risks of the experimental medicine. Treating physicians must share this information with
           the patient through the informed consent process. Treating physicians must also agree to
           participate in CSL Behring's safety monitoring and reporting requirements and follow FDA
           safety reporting regulations.

        -  Only medicines under active clinical development in the USA by CSL Behring will be
           considered for early access. There must be sufficient clinical trial data on efficacy
           and safety indicating a potential benefit greater than risks for the intended use and
           dose.

        -  Granting early access should not negatively impact or delay the ongoing development
           program with the experimental medicine to support approval by FDA and other regulatory
           authorities.

        -  Adequate supply of the experimental medicine must exist to support both ongoing clinical
           trials and approved expanded access until, and if, the product becomes commercially
           available.

      Only requests received from the licensed physician on behalf of the patient will be
      considered. CSL Behring will assess the request against the above criteria. If these criteria
      are met and the IRB/Ethics Committee and FDA approve access to the experimental therapy,
      early access may be granted. US medicine importation requirements must also be met. The
      patient's physician is responsible for the patient's ongoing care as well as all relevant US
      federal and state legislations while the patient is receiving the experimental medicine
      through early access. If approved the patient/caregiver must provide informed consent and the
      treating physician must follow safety and monitoring requirements as defined by CSL Behring.

      CSL Behring cannot provide a guarantee that expanded access will be available for every
      experimental medicine. Even if such a program is offered CSL Behring cannot guarantee that an
      experimental medicine will be available to a particular patient. The early access will cease
      if clinical trials or regulatory assessment determines the product does not demonstrate a
      positive risk benefit for patients. Once the experimental medicine is approved and
      commercially available in the US, early access will no longer be available.
