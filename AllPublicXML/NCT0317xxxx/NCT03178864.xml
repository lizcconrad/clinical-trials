      SECRET examines the safety of rivaroxaban versus standard-of-care for treatment of
      symptomatic cerebral venous thrombosis, initiated within 14 days of diagnosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SECRET is an open-label, randomized, controlled, phase II study that will assess the safety
      of rivaroxaban, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), compared with
      standard-of-care (unfractionated or low-molecular weight heparin with transition to warfarin
      [INR 2.0-3.0], or continued low molecular-weight heparin) for cerebral venous thrombosis.
      Recruitment will occur at 15 high-volume stroke research centres across Canada over 3 years.
      Three hundred and forty-eight adult patients within 14 days of diagnosis of symptomatic
      cerebral venous thrombosis will be randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg daily versus
      standard-of-care (regimen at the discretion of the local investigator in keeping with AHA/ASA
      guidelines). Patients will be followed for 1 year. The feasibility of recruitment will also
      be tested.

    <description>Symptomatic intracranial bleeding is defined as a new symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage OR worsening existing intracranial hemorrhage with a &gt;33% change in hematoma volume, AND either an NIHSS score increase of 4 or more points, or a change in level of consciousness as per NIHSS item 1a, AND the clinical change is thought to be attributable to the hemorrhage.
Major extracranial bleeding is defined as bleeding in a critical area or organ, including intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or bleeding causing a drop in hemoglobin by 20 g/L or more, leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red cells.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is anticipated to require invasive procedure (e.g. lumbar puncture,
             thrombectomy, hemicraniectomy) prior to initiation of oral anticoagulation

          -  Patient is unable to swallow due to depressed level of consciousness

          -  Impaired renal function (CrCl &lt; 30 mL/min using Cockroft-Gault equation).

          -  Pregnancy; if a woman is of childbearing potential a urine or serum beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test is positive.

          -  Breastfeeding at the time of randomization.

          -  Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (eg. ongoing use of dilantin, carbamazepine,
             HIV protease inhibitors, systemic ketoconazole) or CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg. diltiazem,
             efavirenz).

          -  Patient has a severe or fatal comorbid illness that will prevent improvement, or
             cannot complete follow-up due to the same, or cannot complete follow-up due to

    <ipd_description>Upon completion of the SECRET Trial, a public use database will be prepared by stripping any and all personal identifiers. The public use database, consisting of several data files, should contain: (1) baseline and demographic characteristics; (2) outcomes assessments; (3) CT/MRI data; (4) concomitant medications and procedures; and (5) adverse events. Each data file is made available as a formatted SAS dataset or other electronic format. The data files are distributed along with the data dictionary and a brief instruction (&quot;Readme&quot;) file. These data files will be made available to the public only after all major manuscripts (including secondary analysis papers) of the Trial are accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.</ipd_description>
