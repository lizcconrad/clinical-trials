  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to better understand what benefits visual art has on
      reducing problematic symptoms in dementia patients, including those with Alzheimer's disease.

      Participants:

      Participants will be residents, attendees and/or members of assisted living locations and/or
      dementia (or related) day programs. There will be two groups: an art training group and a
      waitlist control group.

      Data Analysis:

        1. For primary measures, t-tests on pre-post difference scores comparing art training and
           waitlist groups.

        2. For secondary measures, ANOVA using observation time points as the within-subject factor
           and group (visual arts, control) as the between-subject factor.

        3. For possible confounding effects, tests for confounds related to background factors
           (socioeconomic status, education level, gender, activity participation).

        4. For the possible effect of mood on cognition and behaviour, mediation analyses.

      Procedure:

      A randomized controlled trial design will be utilized to assess two groups of dementia
      patients: an art training experimental group and a structured usual-activity waitlist control
      group. The experimental group will participate in a visual art training program and the
      waitlist control group will participate in their usual structured group activities. The
      waitlist control group will receive the art training program once post-testing is complete.
      Before, during and after the art programs and/or control activities, participants will be
      observed and complete assessments.

    <description>The art training program has been designed as a drawing program and focuses on basic visual art concepts (the elements [e.g., colour and line] and principles [e.g., proportion and balance] of design). Each week has a different activity and a different focus (one activity per week focusing on one element and principle of design). Each art training program will occur one hour per day, two days per week, for eight weeks. The art training program will take place at the participants' respective dementia care location in an area separate from waitlist control participants and uninvolved clients. All art programs are free for participants.</description>
