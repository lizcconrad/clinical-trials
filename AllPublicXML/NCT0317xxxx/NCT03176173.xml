  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well radical-dose image guided radiation therapy works in
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body
      who are undergoing immunotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor
      cells and shrink tumors. Giving radical-dose image guided radiation therapy to patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer may help to improve response to immunotherapy anti-cancer
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if progression-free survival at 24 weeks with this treatment combination is
      improved compared to historical controls who received immunotherapy without radiation
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess acute (0-6 months) and late (&gt; 6 months) grade 3-5 toxicity. II. Assess overall
      survival. III. Correlate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ratio of
      post-radiation therapy [RT] to pre-RT level) with radiographic response.

      IV. Correlate immune markers in peripheral blood with radiographic response.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Analyze progression-free survival with immune-related response criteria. II. Measure time
      to discontinuation of study immunotherapy agent. III. Assess patterns of progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo radical-dose image guided radiation therapy daily for up to 10 days
      (within 2 weeks) while undergoing standard of care immunotherapy.

      Arm II: Patients who decline to undergo radiation therapy receive standard of care
      immunotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 6 months
      thereafter.

Plasma biomarkers (e.g. cell free deoxyribonucleic acid level) will be summarized using medians and interquartile ranges; changes in biomarkers will be assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Correlation of biomarkers with radiographic response will be evaluated using a Wilcoxon rank sum test on patients with and without the event of interest. If feasible, these analyses will be supplemented by more formal analyses with the Cox model.</description>
