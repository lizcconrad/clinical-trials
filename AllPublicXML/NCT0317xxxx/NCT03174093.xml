  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the benefits of using a mobile health application designed for shared
      decision aid in anticoagulation therapy in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF). The aim is
      to improve their treatment adherence and time in therapeutic International Normalized Ratio
      (INR) range. The results of this study have the potential to lead to a sustainable and
      resource-efficient strategy for better prevent thromboembolic events in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation is a common disease, with important burden on morbidity and mortality and
      a challenging management. Its incidence and healthcare costs have increased over the decades.
      One of the most important features of this arrhythmia is its stroke risk, which can be
      reduced with the use of anticoagulants. Deciding about anticoagulation therapy is complicated
      due to frequent competing comorbidities and potential harms of the therapy itself. To achieve
      better outcomes in preventing stroke, it is paramount that decisions about atrial
      fibrillation treatment be shared between providers and patients.

      Mobile health is empowering individuals to assume a more active role in monitoring and
      managing their chronic conditions and therapeutic regimens. Also, health professionals are
      being provided with fast and point-of-care information, which can facilitate decision-making.

      Therefore, this study will investigate the effects of an mHealth application idealized to aid
      shared decision and improve anticoagulation care in atrial fibrillation.

      Adults with atrial fibrillation will be recruited from anticoagulation outpatient clinics and
      Basic Health Units and randomized to either (1) an intervention group in which the mHealth
      application will be used during the consultations or (2) a control group receiving the usual
      care with anticoagulation.

      It is hypothesized that the intervention group will achieve better anticoagulation outcomes.

    <intervention_name>MATCh AFib application</intervention_name>
    <description>The application comprehends five steps: (1) An educational video about how AF can cause stroke; (2) A calculator of risk scores (CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED and SAMe-TT2R2); (3) A screen with pictograms to allow better understanding of the scores by patients and to demonstrate how much each anticoagulant can decrease stroke risk or increase bleeding risk; (4) A summary about types of medications available, and (5) An output formulary in which the physician can register patient's contact to continue receiving information about atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation through SMS. Physicians can save patient's history of INR tests and previous doses of anticoagulation prescribed and also use a calculator to adjust the dose.</description>
