  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Its main purpose is to
      investigate the effects and neural mechanism of Naoan dripping pills on migraine patients by
      utilizing fMRI and DTI method, as well as headache evaluation measures such as responder
      rate, headache duration, PRO scale, etc.

    <textblock>
      Naoan dripping pills, which is a Chinese patent medicine proved effectively in treating
      migraine on clinic, but its neural mechanism remains unknown. This study is expected to
      validate the effectiveness and explore its neural mechanism by fMRI and DTI so as to provide
      evidence for physicians to promote the appropriate use of Naoan dripping pills treatment for
      migraine patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Naoan dripping pills group or
      placebo group, they will receive Naoan dripping pills/Placebo treatment for 12 weeks.
      Clinical evaluation will be performed at baseline, every 4 weeks during treatment and the
      follow-up week(16 weeks) . MRI scans are performed at baseline, and 12 weeks later. Responder
      rate (defined as the percentage of subjects in a treatment group with 50 % or greater
      reduction in attack frequency during treatment compared with the baseline period) and fMRI
      and DTI imaging changes after treatment are defined as primary outcome. In addition, 10
      healthy controls will also undergo MRI scanning at baseline to determine abnormal brain
      activity and structure in migraine patients.
