  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this common multicenter protocol is to test the hypothesis that algorithmic
      tools using clinical Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) cardiorespiratory monitoring data
      can detect ventilatory control instability and predict chronic and acute respiratory
      consequences of ventilatory control instability and autonomic dysregulation.

        All races and ethnicities will be recruited and distribution is expected to be similar to
        the populations represented in the NICU at each site.

        Age of all infants will be less than 29 weeks Gestational Age and less than 1 week
        Chronological Age, at the time of enrollment.

        The study population will be drawn from inpatients in NICUs at participating hospital sites
        with cardiorespiratory monitoring.

        The subjects will be in variable states of health since they are premature and in the
        intensive care unit.

        There will be no pre-screening of infants. Data will be collected on all infants placed in
        a bed for which monitoring and data collection capabilities are set up. Therefore all such
        infants will technically be enrolled in the study, regardless of meeting the
        inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        Each enrolled infant will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine whether
        the site will collect further data from the medical record.
