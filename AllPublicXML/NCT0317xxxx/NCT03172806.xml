  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the ability of clinical scores (P-SAP, OSA50, DES-OSA,
      STOP-Bang with former algorithm, and STOP-Bang with new algorithm).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) patients are at higher risk of postoperative
      complications.

      STOP-Bang has been proposed to detect OSA patients. It has been validated. New algorithm of
      STOP-Bang was proposed by the end of 2016. This aim of this study was to evaluate the ability
      of this new algorithm to detect severe OSA patients (patients with more than 30 events per
      hour). The new algorithm was also compared in this same ability with three others clinical
      score (P-SAP, OSA50 and DES-OSA).
