      Accurate measurements from a non-invasive test like myocardial perfusion positron emission
      tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) may decrease the need for invasive procedures such
      as cardiac catheterization.The investigators wish to see if the measurements from cardiac
      catheterization can be predicted using a non-invasive 13N-NH3 digital PET/CT scan.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac imaging using standard-of-care Nuclear Medicine techniques assess the relative
      radiopharmaceutical distribution from coronary arteries to cardiac tissue. This standard
      interpretation however, lacks the clinical utility of modern quantitative techniques that are
      now routinely obtained during cardiac catheterization, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR).
      Cardiologists routinely base critical management decisions, including the choice for
      revascularization, stenting, or angioplasty, on these measurements.

      Non-invasive measurements of MBF (Myocardial Blood Flow), CFR (Coronary Flow Reserve) and RFR
      (Relative Flow Reserve) using PET/CT have been investigated, but have yet to reach clinicl
      use. Given the inherent gains in sensitivity and resolution, digital PET/CT, may allow for a
      more robust and accurate platform to obtain quantitative measurements of MBF, CFR and RFR
      which may greatly enhance the clinical utility of cardiac PET/CT for management of coronary
      artery disease.

    <description>Non-invasive measurements of myocardial blood flow (MBF) in milliliter/minute/gram using PET/CT scanner will be compared to invasive cardiac angiography values (current gold standard). MBF values are obtained using image-derived time activity curves from the left ventricular blood and myocardial tissue regions. These values represent radiotracer exchange between the blood and the tissue over time. The rate of radiotracer uptake into the myocardial tissue provides an estimate of MBF. Processing software will then use the time-activity curves to calculate MBF at rest and at stress.</description>

    <description>Non-invasive measurements of coronary flow reserve (CFR) using digital PET/CT scanner will be compared to the gold standard evaluation from invasive cardiac angiography. Discrepancy between PET measurements and cardiac angiography results will be reported. CFR is the ratio of MBF at peak blood flow to resting MBF.</description>

Discrepancy between PET measurements and cardiac angiography results will be reported. RFR is the ratio of MBF during stress in an affected region of the left ventricle (LV) to MBF during stress in a normal region of the LV.</description>
