  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After enrollment, participants will be randomized to either receive the intervention
      (treatment) from trained health educators or undergo observation as usual (control group).
      Randomization will be stratified by HIV serostatus. A control group is appropriate because
      participants will still receive services offered through probation and will be offered the
      intervention after completion of the trial. Subjects will be paid, not for participating in
      the intervention, but for providing research assessments. The newly adapted intervention will
      be delivered over no more than a 3-month period (it will be shorter if the adaptation process
      is supportive). Baseline assessments will assess the pre-intervention period. The 3-month
      assessment will be the end-of-intervention effects and the post-intervention assessments will
      be at 6, 9 and 12 months. HIV prevention knowledge will be assessed based on quizzes used
      previously for HHRP+; though final quiz content will depend on final selected materials for
      the intervention. Subjects will be followed for 12 months with assessments by trained
      research assistants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to adapt and pilot test the Holistic Health Recovery Program for
      women with and at risk for HIV (HHRP+), a CDC evidence-based secondary HIV prevention
      intervention, that will serve as a framework to optimize HIV treatment outcomes and reduce
      HIV-associated risk for women under correctional community supervision.

      Hypotheses

        1. It will be feasible to recruit and retain HIV+ and at-risk women under community
           correctional supervision in the pilot study.

        2. Using the ADAPT-ITT methods, we will be able to adequately adapt HHRP+ for HIV-infected
           and at-risk women under community supervision.

        3. The adapted intervention will be feasible to implement and acceptable to participants.

        4. The adapted intervention will produce higher measureable preliminary effects on
           HIV-focused treatment outcomes in the intervention group compared with the control
           group.

    <description>Holistic Health Recovery Program for HIV+ (HHRP+) is a CDC-recommended, evidence based behavioral (psychoeducational) group intervention focused on harm reduction principles. The investigators systematically adapted HHRP+ using findings from qualitative interviews with the target population of adult women living with and at-risk for HIV who are justice-involved (on probation, parole, or recently released from prison or jail).</description>
