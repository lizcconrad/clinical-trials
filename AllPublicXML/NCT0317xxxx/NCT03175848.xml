      This is a prospective, single arm, phase II trail to assess the effect of primary lesion
      radiotherapy in the treatment of stage IVB cervical cancer on the basis of systemic
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the apparent heterogeneity of stage IVB cervical cancer, at present there is no
      standard treatment.

      This is a Phase II, single-center, single-arm, study of systemic chemotherapy plus lesion
      radiotherapy for primary stage IVB cervical cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that primary lesion radiotherapy
      leads to an improvement in progression-free survival time (PFS)for stage IVB cervical cancer.

      For those patients under the clinical management of the recruiting investigator, the
      investigator will review the patient's medical records and determine if they would be a
      candidate for the study.

      Upon confirmation of all eligibility criteria, the subject will be enrolled.Patients with
      beyond abdominal pelvic lymph node metastasis will first undergo 2 cycle systemic
      chemotherapy（TP/TC），then to evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy, and for patients with
      chemotherapy effective（CR+PR+SD) followed by the primary lesion of regional radiotherapy
      (external irradiation plus brachytherapy)，concurrent chemotherapy （TP/TC） may be given
      according to the patients tolerant，finally, the patient will complete a total of 6 cycles of
      chemotherapy（TP/TC）.Distant metastasis of lymph node areas (e.g., supraclavicular, axillary,
      mediastinum, etc.) will be radiation after radiotherapy at the primary site according to
      patients tolerant.Patients with stage IVB cervical cancer with hematogenous metastasiswill
      first undergo 4 cycle systemic chemotherapy（TP/TC），then to evaluate the efficacy of
      chemotherapy, and for patients with chemotherapy effective（CR+PR+SD) followed by the primary
      lesion of regional radiotherapy (external irradiation plus brachytherapy)，concurrent
      chemotherapy （TP/TC） may be given according to the patients tolerant，finally, the patient
      will complete a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy（TP/TC），after the primary radiotherapy, the
      treatment regimen for distant metastasis will be determined by MDT discuss or
      consultation.Quality of life will be evaluated before and after treatment. During therapy,
      the patient will have a weekly physical exam, vital signs collected, evaluation for pain, and
      review any side effects.

      Subjects will undergo a post treatment follow-up period after completion of their radiation
      therapy. During this follow-up period, subjects will return for a medical and history review
      with a complete physical examination, review of any side effects, evaluation for outcomes and
      toxicity, and QoL.
