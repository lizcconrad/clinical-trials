  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 placebo-controlled biomarker study of NP001 in individuals with Alzheimer's
      Disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, systemically and locally in the central nervous
      system (CNS), are implicated in the neuro-inflammatory process seen in Alzheimer's disease.
      NP001 is a novel immune regulator of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages.

      Given the key role inflammatory monocytes/macrophages may play in the pathogenesis of AD,
      this study will assess the changes in inflammatory monocyte-associated biomarkers, including
      CD16 and HLA-DR, pre- and post- NP001.

      This is a Phase 1 single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot biomarker
      study of a single dose of NP001 in individuals with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
      Fourteen individuals will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to NP001 and placebo. Drug or
      placebo will be given intravenously. Biomarkers will be measured at baseline and 1 and 7 days
      following infusion.
