    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have a type of brain cancer called Glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM). This study will combine two different ways to fight cancer: antibodies and CAR-T
      cells. Several immune checkpoint antibodies have been examined on various tumors with good
      outcomes. GBM is known to express increased levels of surface antigens that can be targeted
      by CAR-T cells. Thus, in this study, the 4SCAR-IgT cells targeting GBM surface antigens will
      be infused in dose escalation cohorts.

      Background:

      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most dangerous and aggressive form of brain cancer.
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can mediate long-term durable remissions in
      recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell malignancies, and are a promising therapy to treat GBM.
      Epidermal growth factor receptor variant III, EGFRvIII is one of the GBM tumor antigens
      expressed in about 30% of glioblastomas. EGFRviii is a mutated form of EGFR protein, a
      neo-antigen, and is not expressed in normal tissues.

      Tumor microenvironment has been known to inhibit immune responses. Many immune checkpoint
      inhibitors are now being tested for targeting various cancers. Instead of infusing antibody,
      we plan to infuse antibody-producing T cells (IgT) based on tumor surface antigen guided
      CAR-Tcells. EGFRvIII is an attractive target for GBM CAR-T therapy. Combination of EGFRviii
      or other GBM-specific CAR-T and IgT strategy, the CAR-IgT cells could target both the tumor
      cells and the tumor microenvironment.
