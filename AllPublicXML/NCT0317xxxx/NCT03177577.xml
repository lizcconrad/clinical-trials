      To determine the effect of first dorsal interosseus (FDI) strengthening in patients with
      thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thumb CMC osteoarthritis is a normal part of aging. Most patients are able to adapt to
      symptoms of pain and disability, other patients might benefit from non-operative
      interventions; e.g. splinting, corticosteroid injections, pain medication, and multiple hand
      exercises.

      The dorsal ligament complex is one of the components for stability of the thumb CMC joint.
      These ligaments specifically create stability for pinch and grip during the final phase of
      opposition. Both, the opponens pollicis (OP) and the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) play a
      key role in centralizing the metacarpal on the trapezium. A retrospective study showed that a
      dynamic stability modeled approach, including targeting the FDI, reduced pain and improved
      function in patients with thumb CMC osteoarthritis. Recently, another study demonstrated that
      reduction of radial subluxation - the thumb metacarpal versus the trapezium CMC joint - was
      achieved by contraction of the dynamic stabilizers of the healthy hand, specifically with the
      focus on the FDI.

      More clinical research is needed to determine if there are efficacious (effective and
      low-cost) evidence-based exercise programs for pain reduction and functional improvement in
      patients with thumb CMC osteoarthritis. The investigators are interested in the effect of FDI
      strengthening in patients with thumb CMC osteoarthritis. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesized that there is no difference in the change of lateral pinch strength at 12 weeks
      between patients treated with a splint versus patients treated with a splint and FDI
      strengthening for thumb CMC osteoarthritis. We also tested the same hypothesis for 3-point
      chuck strength, VAS for pain, and PROMIS Upper Extremity CAT.

    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Upper Extremity Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) at 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At Enrollment and 12 week follow up</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized assessment of depression measured at enrollment. The average T score of the U.S. population is 50, so the T score reported compares the study population to the U.S. population, where a T score greater than 50 is worse than the average and a T score less than 50 is better than the average. The investigators will compare the change in PROMIS Upper Extremity between the two cohorts after 12 weeks of treatment.</description>
