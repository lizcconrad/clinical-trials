  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexuality is considered one of the pillars of quality of life, an integral part of the
      personality of each individual. Being a basic human being need, it cannot be separated from
      other aspects of life. For several centuries and until recently, sexuality was considered the
      &quot;lower instincts&quot; expression related only to the sexual act. Sex is associated with
      &quot;reproduction&quot; of the sexual energy. On the other hand, the exercise of sexuality includes
      various factors such as the building of the sensitivity between individuals like touch,
      dance, fantasy, look, etc. For a long time feminine sexuality was predominantly focused on
      procreation and has only recently been considered as an integral part of sexual and
      reproductive rights of women. Vaginismus is a female sexual dysfunction that affects the
      quality of sexual and psychosocial lives of women, influencing the quality of the couple's
      relationship. The scientific literature emphasizes the importance of the examination,
      diagnosis and physical therapy for this dysfunction, but until now there is no quantification
      or evaluation of the pelvic floor muscles for this group of women, which justifies the
      realization of this project.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial, cultural and relational factors, frequently influenced by a rigid education,
      have been related to the etiology of sexual difficulties. Women with stable partners who
      maintain an no consummated pattern of sexual intercourse (vaginismus) reveal a history of
      sexual life affected by these factors.

      Vaginismus is a female sexual dysfunction that affects the quality of sexual and psychosocial
      lives of women. It may influence both the quality of the couple's relationship and the
      overall emotional and motivational state of people in their daily activities.

      There is a concordance in the scientific literature that physiotherapy is of high importance
      in the treatment of vaginismus. The scientific literature presents some studies confirming
      its importance and highlighting the satisfactory results obtained at posttreatment of these
      dysfunctions.

      Considering the impact of vaginismus in the sexual life of couples, as well as the relevance
      of the development of wide-ranging intervention models in the treatment of this disorder, it
      is appropriate to conduct this study in order to identify and recognize parameters of muscle
      tonus of women with and without a diagnosis of vaginismus and also to study the effectiveness
      of physiotherapy resources applied in the treatment of vaginismus.

      Objectives

        1. Evaluate and compare the pelvic floor musculature of women with and without a diagnosis
           of vaginismus, by ultrasonographic image and perineal electromyographic biofeedback;

        2. Evaluate and compare the parameters of muscle tonus of the pelvic floor by perineal
           electromyographic biofeedback in women with and without a diagnosis of vaginismus;

        3. Evaluate the pelvic floor musculature of women diagnosed with vaginismus, through
           sonographic imaging and electromyographic biofeedback, after the physiotherapeutic
           treatment;

        4. Evaluate the quality of sexual life and sexual function of women with and without a
           diagnosis of vaginismus;

        5. Evaluate the quality of sexual life and sexual function of women diagnosed with
           vaginismus, after physiotherapeutic treatment.

The ultrasound imaging requested at the ambulatorial routine will be performed by a skilled physician and accompanied by the project author. All images will be recorded and digitally stored and will later be measured and treated statistically. The patient will be lying in a supine position (belly up), with the pelvis in a neutral position, back at 45º and feet supported in stirrups, for the verification of the musculature shape and mobility.
