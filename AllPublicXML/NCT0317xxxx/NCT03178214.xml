  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, randomised, single dose, three-period, crossover study
      to evaluate the bioavailability of Infacort® administered as 'sprinkles' with soft food and
      yoghurt compared with direct administration to the back of the tongue in
      dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male subjects.

      The study will comprise of a pre-study screen, followed by 3 treatment periods and a
      post-study follow-up.

             (NB. the three month washout period between trials is defined as the period of time
             elapsed between the last dose of the previous study and the first dose of the next
             study).

         12. Subjects who have consumed more than two units of alcohol per day within seven days
             prior to the first dose or have consumed any alcohol within the 48-hour period prior
