      This study intends to compare the patients with pain with those who underwent same procedure
      without developing pain. The patients with pain and without pain will be further analyzed in
      respect to clinical differences, biomarkers and genetical differences.

    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a well-known complication after surgery, but the prevalence of persistent
      pain after upper extremity surgery or other trauma affecting the radial, ulnar or the medial
      nerve, or branches of these nerves such as digital nerves is unknown. The reason that some
      patients develop persistent neuropathic pain after surgery, while others, who have been
      through the exact same procedure or trauma, are pain free is still unknown. The underlying
      mechanisms are still largely unknown. This can lead to different responses to treatment.
      Whenever possible, it is important to identify and address the underlying pain mechanisms in
      the individual patient in order to design an optimal treatment.

      The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the factors implicated in the
      development of persistent pain after nerve suture surgery investigating Clinical symptoms,
      standardized clinical examination for neuropathic pain, 92 biomarkers special developed for
      neuropathic pain, genetics.

      Conditioned pain modulation and Cold pressor test is intend to be performed in all the
      patients.

    <description>Patients with trauma and nerve suture surgery operated between 2006 and 2014 on Hand Surgery will receive a postal questionnaire (Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Pain ). The patients with pain and without pain will be recruited to the study by using this postal follow up questionnaire. Patients who judge their pain at least moderate and/or affecting daily life by will be eligible and asked to participate.</description>

Patients will be recruited to the study by using a postal follow up questionnaire. Patients who judge their pain at least moderate and/or affecting daily life by will be eligible and asked to participate. Patients will visit the Pain Clinic once. Oral and written information about the study will be provided, informed consent obtained. The affected nerve will be identified and the anatomy verified by ultrasound when needed.</description>

Patients with no pain will be asked to participate. Patients will visit the Pain Clinic once. Oral and written information about the study will be provided, informed consent obtained.
