  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to determine the role of chronic kidney disease and the
      activation of the kallikrein-kinin system during hemodialysis on the development of
      mitochondrial dysfunction; the investigators will measure mitochondrial function using the
      gold standard method, 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

      The investigators will test the hypothesis that endogenous bradykinin promotes mitochondrial
      dysfunction in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The investigators will first perform a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study measuring the effect of
      Icatibant (HOE-140), a bradykinin B2 receptor blocker, on mitochondrial function.

    <description>Mitochondria function will be evaluated using 31P-MRS, which evaluates the concentration of phospho-creatine (PCr) and other phosphate-energy carrier molecules. After basal measurements, subjects will be asked to perform 90 seconds of knee extension followed by 4 minutes of rest. The exercise/rest cycle will be repeated 3 times. Magnetic resonance spectra will be used to calculate concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi), PCr, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The half-time of PCr recovery (time to achieve half of maximal concentration during recovery) will be used to determine mitochondrial function.</description>
