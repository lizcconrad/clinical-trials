      This is a cross-sectional study aimed to investigate microvascular reactivity in prepubertal
      children according to adiposity status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to investigate microvascular reactivity in prepubertal and to compare
      these data in different groups according to adiposity status. Firstly, The investigators
      recruited only children from 5 to 10 years at prepubertal status. After excluding those with
      exclusion criteria and the acceptance (from their parents) to participate in the study, a
      blood sample was collected and an appointment at BioVasc lab was programmed. At this day,
      participants were subject to nail fold videocapillaroscopy. A method used to investigate
      microvascular reactivity by a non-invasive mean. After this, participants children were
      followed to the outpatient's care unit to continue follow-up.

    <measure>Microvascular reactivity by nail fold videocapillaroscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months from the beginning of the recruitment period until the ending of the manuscript.</time_frame>
    <description>Nailfold videocapillaroscopy is performed using the fourth finger of the left hand in a temperature-controlled environment (22ºC). The following microvascular parameters are determined at resting state: (a) functional capillary density (FCD), the number of capillaries/mm2 with red blood cell flux, evaluated with 250x magnification in a 3-mm area of the distal row of capillaries in three different areas (lateral, central and medial); (b) red blood cell velocity at rest (RBCV) and during post occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH); c) the peak RBCV after 1-min arterial occlusion (RBCVmax); and (d) the time taken to reach RBCVmax (TRBCVmax). Firstly, a pressure cuff (1-cm wide) is placed around the proximal phalanx and connected to a mercury manometer.</description>

    <measure>Multivariate analysis using Canonical Discriminant analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months from the beginning of the recruitment period until the ending of the manuscript.</time_frame>
    <description>Univariate intergroup comparisons are performed by ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests according to whether the tested variables followed a normal or non-normal distribution, respectively. Post hoc Bonferroni and Dunn tests were then performed.
Biological systems, as many processes in nature, are inherently multivariate, therefore, a multivariate approach to determine which variables discriminate between the groups is taken and then the investigators applies Canonical Discriminant Function Analysis. This analysis determines how well it is possible to distinguish groups from a multivariate data set. The variation of a specific physiological parameter may influence other parameters and their synergistic action can generate results not easily detectable through a univariate analysis. The level of significance adopted was 0.05.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory and biochemical biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months from the beginning of the recruitment period until the ending of the manuscript.</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory testing includes fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels. Biochemical analysis is performed using the following methods: for FPG, the GOD-PAP enzymatic (oxidase); for cholesterol, the CHOP-POD enzymatic (esterase-oxidase); for triglycerides, the GPO/PAP enzymatic (oxidase); and for HDL-cholesterol, the colorimetric without precipitation. Insulin, leptin and adiponectin levels are measured using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. Interleukin-6 level is measured by the electrochemiluminescence method and Hs-CRP level is measured by the turbidimetric method.</description>
