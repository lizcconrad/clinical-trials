  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A myriad of sexual problems affect men and women with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including
      decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Menstrual
      abnormalities are common in CKD and many women are an-ovulatory .

      Causes of sexual dysfunction in CKD include hormonal alterations along with vascular,
      neurologic, psychogenic, and other factors, such as medications, contribute to the
      development of sexual dysfunction . Sexual dysfunction in females is mainly due to hormonal
      factors and manifests mainly as menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, lack of vaginal
      lubrication, and failure to conceive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal changes in chronic kidney disease are seen in prolactine, gonadotropins, and gonadal
      hormones. In women with CKD, elevated levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
      luteinizing hormone (LH) are common. These hormonal changes are detected in the early stages
      of kidney disease and progressively worsen as kidney disease progresse .

      . Women with chronic renal failure commonly have elevated circulating prolactin levels. As in
      men with chronic renal failure, the hypersecretion of prolactin in this setting appears to be
      autonomous, as it is resistant to maneuvers designed to stimulate or inhibit its release.

      It has been suggested that the elevated prolactin levels may impair hypothalamic-pituitary
      function and contribute to sexual dysfunction and galactorrhea in these patients. However,
      uremic women treated with bromocryptine rarely resume normal menses and continue to complain
      of galactorrhea (if present), despite normalization of the plasma prolactin concentration.
      Thus, factors other than hyperprolactinemia must be important in this setting .

        The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) will be used to assess sexual function .This index
        includes 19 questions related to 6 parameters: sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication,
        orgasm, sexual satisfaction and dyspareunia. A face-to-face inter-view with each
        participant in which the FSFI questions will be verbally asked and answered and compare
        between them in effect of renal failure on sexuality.

        Duration of chronic renal failure duration of dialysis ,number of sessions of dialysis per
        week,medical treatment, haemoglobin and creatinine level will be fullfilled.
