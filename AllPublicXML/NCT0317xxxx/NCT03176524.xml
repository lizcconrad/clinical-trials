  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, randomised, three-period crossover phase 1 trial in
      subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Each subject will be randomly allocated to a
      sequence of three treatments, i.e. two single subcutaneous doses of BioChaperone® Glucagon
      (BC Glucagon) formulation 1, BioChaperone® Glucagon formulation 2 and GlucaGen® HypoKit®,
      each at the fixed doses of 50 µg and 1 mg on 3 separate dosing visits.

      Following trial drug administration, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      assessments will be carried until 4 hours. Safety will be assessed during all the trial
      period.

      The total trial maximum duration for the individual subject will be up to 10 weeks.
