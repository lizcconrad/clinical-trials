      This is a prospective comparative randomized controlled study investigating the effect of
      Myo-Inositol-based co-treatment on oocyte quality measures in women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome is the most common cause of chronic anovulation in women. Women
      with PCOS undergoing IVF are at an increased risk for developing both multiple gestation and
      ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Since insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia have
      been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder, the administration of metformin
      before or during an IVF cycle has been practiced for years in an attempt to improve
      follicular parameters necessary for reproductive success. Recently, a growing body of
      evidence has implicated alternative insulin sensitizing drugs, namely Myo-Inositol, in
      improving various manifestations of the disorder in this women population. Little has been
      done to evaluate the effect of Myo-Inositol co-treatment on the reproductive performance of
      PCOS women undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). In this prospective
      comparative randomized controlled study, women will be randomized into two groups: Women in
      the control group will receive folic acid daily. Women in the study group will receive
      Myo-Inositol, in combination with alpha- lipoic acid and cysteine, per day plus folic acid
      supplemented daily along with ovarian stimulation.
