  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pyelonephritis (APN) corresponds to infections of the renal parenchyma. The annual
      incidence of these infections is estimated at 4-6 million cases in France, with 60 to 90% of
      patients managed in general city medicine. The ceftriaxone, parenteral third-generation
      cephalosporin (C3G), occupies an important place in the antibiotic treatment of these
      infections: this is the recommended probabilistic treatment, and in some situations the
      treatment can be continued in its entirety via a Ceftriaxone monotherapy.

      The aim of the last antibiotic plan is to avoid the use of antibiotic therapies with a high
      selection capacity (cephalosporins, penicillins, fluoroquinolones, etc.) and thus reduce the
      incidence and prolongation over time of the digestive carriage of multi-resistant bacteria .

      To date, there have been few studies evaluating the impact of ceftriaxone on the emergence of
      multi-resistant bacteria on an individual scale, with rather heterogeneous results (13-86%
      C3G resistance).

      Thus, before considering randomized studies comparing the ecological impact of different
      molecules or therapeutic regimens in the treatment of ANP, it is necessary to have a precise
      and rigorous evaluation of the ecological impact of the molecule reference in this
      indication.

      The investigators propose a study to evaluate the impact on the digestive flora at 1 month of
      a ceftriaxone antibiotic therapy (7 days) in the management of acute pyelonephritis in women.
