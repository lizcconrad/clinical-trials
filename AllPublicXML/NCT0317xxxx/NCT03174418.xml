    <textblock>
      Investigator-initiated, international, multicentre, observational study with two cohorts.

      The two study cohorts will be:

      Cohort A: to understand if the local blood flow patterns (associated with low WSS), as
      evaluated by computational fluid dynamic tools from combined angiographic and OCT invasive
      images, may better predict the clinical outcome of patients with bifurcated coronary lesions
      treated by PCI.

      Cohort B: to understand if the local blood flow patterns (associated with low WSS), as
      evaluated by computational fluid dynamic tools from combined angiographic and OCT invasive
      images, may better predict the clinical outcome of patients with sub-critical bifurcated
      lesions managed conservatively.

      Coronary angiography and OCT images will be combined to obtain a three-dimensional model of
      the diseased coronary vessels that will be used to calculate the local blood flow patterns
      and the time-averaged WSS at the bifurcated lesion level by using computational fluid
      dynamics software.

      Baseline (in patients both managed conservatively and treated by PCI) and post-PCI (in
      patients treated by PCI) images will be processed.
