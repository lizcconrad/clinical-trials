  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post acne scarring is a common complication of acne. Cosmetic appearance of the post acne
      facial scarring can be improved by various methods. Among the procedural methods
      microneedling (1) is a novel and a promising option. It is a minimally invasive day care
      procedure for the management of atrophic acne scars. Topical tazarotene 0.1% gel is an
      effective medical method in the management of acne vulgaris and macular acne scars (2, 3).
      Based on its mechanism of action and role in collagen synthesis, topical tazarotene is a
      logical choice to investigate for the management of atrophic post acne scars. This is a pilot
      study comparing microneedling and topical tazarotene for the treatment of atrophic post acne
      scarring in regard to extent and rapidity of improvement, patient satisfaction and any
      adverse events if any.

      Thirty six subjects with grade 2 to grade 4 atrophic post acne scars, classified on the basis
      of Goodman's Qualitative classification (4) criteria will be recruited. Goodman's qualitative
      and quantitative acne scarring grading system scoring will be performed for the assessment of
      severity of acne scarring at baseline. The face of each patient will be randomized for
      monthly microneedling on one side and topical tazarotene 0.1 % gel once a day local
      application on opposite side, using computer generated random number table. Follow ups will
      be done at every month until treatment completion (3 months) and 3 months after the last
      treatment session. Goodman's qualitative and quantitative acne scarring grading system
      scoring will be performed at 3rd and 6th month follow up visits. An improvement by two grades
      will be considered as excellent, one grade will be rated as good and no up gradation will be
      labelled as poor response. Patients will be also assessed by a blinded observer for clinical
      improvement and scored on a scale of 0 (no improvement) to 10 (maximum) at 3rd and 6th month
      follow up visits with the help of serial photographs taken under consistent background,
      position and lighting. All patients will be instructed to assess themselves using Patients'
      Global Assessment Score 0 (no response) to 10 (maximum) at 3rd and 6th month follow up
      visits.

      The investigators hope the outcome of the present study may propose a newer medical modality
      for acne scarring, i.e topical tazarotene 0.1% gel, which can be used at home, obviating the
      need for physician dependant microneedling procedure.
