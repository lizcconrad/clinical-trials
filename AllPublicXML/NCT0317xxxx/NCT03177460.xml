  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and tolerability of
      giving Darzalex (daratumumab) or JNJ-527 (JNJ-40346527) to patients who have prostate cancer
      before having an already-scheduled prostatectomy (surgical removal of the prostate).

      Researchers also want to learn if daratumumab or JNJ-527 can help to control the disease
      before the prostatectomy.

      This is an investigational study. Daratumumab is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat multiple myeloma. It is considered investigational to use daratumumab in patients with
      prostate cancer. JNJ-527 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being
      used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study arms (groups) based on how many participants are enrolled in each arm.

        -  If you are assigned to Arm A, you will receive daratumumab.

        -  If you are assigned to Arm B, you will receive JNJ-527.

      The study doctor will tell you which arm you have been assigned.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are in Arm A, you will receive daratumumab by vein 1 time each week for 4 weeks before
      your prostatectomy. During Week 1, your dose of daratumumab will be given over 8 hours. After
      that, each dose will be given over about 4 hours.

      In this study, the following will be done to lower the chance of a daratumumab infusion
      related reaction:

        -  You will get medications, including steroids, acetaminophen, and/or antihistamine before
           the infusion. If you are considered high risk, you may also get medications, including
           inhaled steroids, after the infusion.

        -  The infusion may be slowed down or stopped if you have a reaction.

        -  You may stay overnight in the hospital after the infusion so the study staff can check
           your health.

      You may ask the study staff for more information about the types of medications you will
      receive to lower your chance of an infusion-related reaction, including how they are
      administered and their risks.

      If you are in Arm B, you will receive JNJ-527 by mouth 2 times each day for up to 4 weeks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 4 doses of daratumumab or up to 4 weeks of JNJ-527. You will no longer
      be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,
      or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the Week 18 visit (described below).

      Study Visits:

      During Weeks 1-4:

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and blood type testing (if you are
           in Group A). Daratumumab treatment will interfere with blood type testing which is
           needed before blood transfusions can be given. For this reason, a test to find out your
           blood type will be performed before you receive daratumumab. You should carry the blood
           type card with you while you are on this study.

        -  During Week 3 only, blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your PSA levels.

      During Week 5 or 6 (the week of your surgery based on your study drug):

        -  You will have a physical exam

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including measurements of
           your PSA and testosterone levels. Part of this sample will also be used for blood type
           testing.

        -  You will have surgery to remove your prostate. You will sign a separate consent form
           explaining the procedure and its risks in more detail.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      During Week 18, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including
      measurements of your PSA and testosterone levels.

      If you withdrew from the study before Week 18, the study staff may call you to ask how you
      are doing. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.
