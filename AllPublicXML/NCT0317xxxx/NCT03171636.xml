  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of the type and frequency of EGFR and KRAS mutations in lung cancer patients,
      as well as clinical-prognostic correlation, are crucial in the era of targeted therapies.
      EGFR-activating mutations predict responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and KRAS analysis will be useful in a near future
      for newest target drugs. In Brazil, we have few data about the prevalence of EGFR and KRAS
      mutations and their knowledge would allow us to optimize personalized medicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of the types and frequency of EGFR and KRAS mutations in NSCLC, as well
      clinical-prognostic correlations has been extensively studied in many populations. Few
      Brazilian studies evaluating mutational status in NSCLC has been done so far, none of then
      explored the regional background nor have considered the quantitative analysis of mutant cell
      in each sample. Quantitative analysis of the tumor maybe relevant for treatment design for
      positive samples, p.e a tumor with 90% of mutant clones versus a 15% of mutant clones, which
      can be obtained currently by the method of pyrosequencing. In this study, we will assess EGFR
      and KRAS status through the pyrosequencing quantitative technique, and we will also correlate
      these with clinical-pathological variables among both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
      histological subtypes. So far, we have no study that have made this correlation in our
      review.

        From 237 patients with NSCLC treated at Erasto Gaertner Cancer Hospital, the largest
        reference cancer hospital in the Southern Brazil, from January 2005 to January 2017, we
        could select 130 FFPE specimens stored at the Pathology Department.
