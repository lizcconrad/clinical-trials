  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to compare the performance of available oligomeric and
      phosphorylated a-synuclein assay in cerebrospinal fluid and blood.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific aims to accomplish this objective are:

        1. Assess the reliability of oligomeric and phosphorylated a-synuclein concentration
           between two different oligomeric and three phosphorylated asynuclein assays.

        2. Assess the reliability of the oligomeric and phosphorylated a-synuclein concentrations
           between laboratories

        3. Assess the correlation of oligomeric and phosphorylated a-synuclein concentrations
           between cerebrospinal fluid and blood.

      1.2. Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess the ability of the network of pilot sites to efficiently conduct a study
           involving biosample collection for PD research. Efficiency will be assessed using
           measures of the time taken to meet specific milestones within the study.

        2. To assess the ability of the network to collect high quality biospecimens adhering to
           agreed-upon protocols.

        3. To gauge the willingness of participants to participate in subsequent Fox BioNet studies
