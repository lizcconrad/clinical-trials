  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deformity and foot pain is nearly omnipresent (90%) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), due to the
      interaction between inflammation and abnormal biomechanical. These cause instability in the
      hindfoot, which cause deformity of the forefoot, and they cause more pressure on the plantar
      forefoot and more pain during daily activities. Non-pharmacological interventions (insole,
      footwear) have an important role, reducing pain and disability, increasing the effectiveness
      and improving daily activities.

      Randomized double-blind clinical trial. Two samples of patients will be taken: the control
      group, which will consist of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and standardized insoles, and
      other group, which will consist of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and insoles made with
      direct adaptation technique (TAD) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and insoles made
      with an scanner (CAD-CAM). The variables that the investigators will measure are: age, sex,
      study level, current occupation, rheumatoid arthritis evolution time, quality of life and
      physical function, pain and health level and general function of the foot. The investigators
      will use: an accelerometer, and questionnaires: Foot and Ankle Ability Measures (FAAM),
      Manchester foot pain and disability index (MFPDI), Medical outcomes study short form-36
      (SF-36) y Foot Function Index (FFI). This study will analyze patients in the Universities of
      Malaga and Salford for 6 months.

    <description>Custom insoles will make with CAD-CAM using a laser scanning and casting for its construction. All this needs the assistance of a computer. From the digital image of a positive of the limb in foam the insole will be obtained.
Custom insoles make with direct adaptation technique (TAD) being of pvc resin. Once the resins are cut and with a temperature of 90ยบ, they will be adapted to the foot (which will be protected with a sock) of the patient with the help of a vacuum. To this technique subtalar joint will be in a neutral position and metatarsal joints will be aligned.</description>
