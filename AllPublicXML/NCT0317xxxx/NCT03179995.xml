    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, double blind trial enrolling patients who will
      undergo major liver resection. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      octreotide or placebo in the postoperative period. The patients will receive octreotide
      intravenously continuously for five days after operation. During this period the patients'
      health will be monitored by performing blood tests including complete metabolic profile,
      Complete Blood Count (CBC) with/diff., INR and PTT. The functioning of heart will also be
      monitored post-operatively by EKG. Up to 80 participants will be accrued over a 2 year
      period. Volumetric CT scans will be performed prior to hepatectomy, 1 week after hepatectomy
      and 3 months after hepatectomy to evaluate liver regeneration.
