        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Medically healthy, with no clinically significant medical history, physical
             examination findings, vital signs or ECG findings

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products

          -  Has received radio-labeled substances or has been exposed to radiation sources within
             12 months of dosing or is likely to receive radiation exposure or radioisotopes within
             12 months of dosing such that participation in this study would increase their total
             exposure beyond the recommended levels considered safe

          -  History of hearing loss or a family history of hearing loss, or a prior diagnosis of
             sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease

          -  History in the past 90 days of prior trauma to the outer or internal structures of the
             ear or tinnitus

          -  History or family history of vestibular disorder, chronic vertigo (sensation of
             spinning), chronic dizziness
