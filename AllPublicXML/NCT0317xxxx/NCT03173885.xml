    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial at the Department of
      Reproductive Medicine at Ghent University Hospital. Women &gt;=18 and &lt;37 years of age
      undergoing their first or second IVF/ICSI treatment, with at least 2 good quality blastocysts
      remaining after fresh embryo transfer will be randomized to either transfer of a
      cryopreserved blastocyst selected based on morphology (standard treatment arm) or transfer of
      a cryopreserved blastocyst selected based on PGS and morphology (intervention treatment arm).
