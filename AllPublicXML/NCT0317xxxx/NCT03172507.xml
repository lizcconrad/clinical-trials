    <textblock>
      An observational pilot proof-of-principle study. 15 patients with significant coronary artery
      disease and 15 matched controls. To investigate whether long-term activation of the innate
      immune system, named 'trained innate immunity', occurs at the level of the bone marrow
      progenitor cells in patients with significant coronary artery disease and whether this
      correlates with the proinflammatory phenotype of monocytes.

        This study will include 15 patients with significant coronary artery disease and 15
        patients without significant coronary artery disease. Patients who have been presented to
        the cardiology departments of the CWZ hospital or Radboud University Medical Centre and
        have undergone CCTA in the past two years are eligible to participate if they meet the in-
        and exclusion criteria.
