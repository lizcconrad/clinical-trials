      TEMA-HF 1 Long-Term Follow-up study is a follow-up study of TEMA-HF 1. It assessed the
      long-term impact of a 6-months telemonitoring program in chronic heart failure patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The telemonitoring (TM) group patients received a 6-months TM program, followed by standard
      heart failure care until the long-term follow-up evaluation.

      The usual care (UC) patients received ususal care during the first six months, followed by
      standard heart failure care until the long-term follow-up evaluation.
