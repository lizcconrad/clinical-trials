    <textblock>
      This is an assessor blind (dermatologist and ophthalmologist) clinical in use study to
      determine the local cutaneous and ocular tolerance of two cosmetic facial cleanser products
      when used as per the intended instructions for use in a population of healthy female
      participants with clinically assessed sensitive skin.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatologist Visual assessment of cutaneous irritation</measure>
    <time_frame>After 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of any visual signs of irritation will be recorded according to Dermal response score: 0=No evidence of irritation, 1=Minimal erythema; barely perceptible, 2=Definite erythema, readily visible; or minimal edema; or minimal popular response, 3=Erythema and papules, 4=Definite edema, 5=Erythema, edema, and papules, 6=Vesicular eruption, and 7=Strong reaction spreading beyond test site. Dermatologist will also provide a superficial irritation score if the dermal response score &gt;0. Superficial irritation score are as follow: grade A/score 0=Slight glazed appearance, grade B/score 1=Marked glazing, grade C/score 2=Glazing with peeling and cracking, grade F/score 3=Glazing with fissures, grade G/score 3=Film of dried serous exudate covering all or portion of the patch, and grade H/score 3=Small petechial erosions and/or scabs. The combined score will equal the sum of the dermal response score plus the numerical equivalent of the superficial irritation score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ophthalmologist Visual assessment of ocular irritation</measure>
    <time_frame>After 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular irritation will be assessed through the observation of the presence of two factors: Lacrimation Intensity and Conjunctiva Involvement. Conjunctiva involvement score are as follow: 0= None - No involvement, 1= Mild - Conjunctivae (palpebral and bulbar) injected above normal with possible chemosis (swelling); no discharge, 2= Moderate - Conjunctivae injected above normal; obvious swelling; possible discharge, and 3= Severe - Conjunctivae more diffuse, deeper crimson red, individual vessels not easily discernible; excessive swelling and/or discharge. Lacrimal intensity score are as follow: 0= None - No lacrimation observed, 1= Mild-Excessive wetness (no distinct tears), 2= Moderate - A few formed tears (contained in orbit), and 3= Severe - Intense tearing (leaving orbit).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant self-assessment question responses with regards to product use experience on face</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked Subject Self-Assessment questions at Baseline (Visit 2), prior to test product use, 1 hour (± 20 minutes) following first supervised product use, and following 21 (+2) days of product use. Participants will score each symptom asked in the question (Are you experiencing any redness, dryness, burning, itching or stinging of your face?) by using following score: 0= None, 1=Mild, 2= Moderate, and 3= Severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant self-assessment question responses with regards to product use experience around the eyes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 21 (+2) days of test product use</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked Subject Self-Assessment questions at Baseline (Visit 2), prior to test product use, 1 hour (± 20 minutes) following first supervised product use, and following 21 (+2) days of product use. Participants will score each symptom asked in the question (Are you experiencing any redness, dryness, burning, itching or stinging of your eyes?) by using following score: 0= None, 1=Mild, 2= Moderate, and 3= Severe.</description>
