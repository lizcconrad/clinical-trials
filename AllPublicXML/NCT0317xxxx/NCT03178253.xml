  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is the most common disorder seen. The impact of this disease on the quality
      of life, and on morbidity and mortality through the complications that affect the small and
      large vessels resulting in retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and ischemic heart disease
      has been emphasized by the findings of the national commission (USA) on diabetes .

      So, there was curiosity to understand and learn the association of this disorder with another
      common endocrine gland function that is thyroid gland . The association between these two
      disorders has long been recognized although the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic
      population varies widely between studies. With insulin and thyroid hormone being intimately
      involved in cellular metabolism and thus excess or deficit of these hormones result in
      functional derangement of the other.

      Diabetic patients have higher prevalence of thyroid disorder when compared with the normal
      population. Diabetic women are more frequently affected than men and hypothyroidism is more
      common than thyrotoxicosis .

      Sub-clinical hypothyroidism is an independent risk factor for development of diabetic
      nephropathy. Severe hypothyroidism (biochemically) may be completely asymptomatic. Though our
      patient had throid stimulating hormone level more than 100 mIU/L, he did not have any
      symptoms of hypothyroidism.so diagnosis of hypothyroidism depends on laboratory parameters
      rather than clinical findings Recognition and treatment of hypothyroidism in diabetic
      patients will benefit glycemic control and improve general well-being ). Diabetic
      nephropathy, a major micro-vascular complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus, is an important
      cause of chronic kidney disease. It results from interactions between hemodynamic and
      metabolic factors .
