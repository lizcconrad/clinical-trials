  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Diabetes is common among American Indian people and diabetic kidney disease is a common
      complication. Kidney disease caused by diabetes can lead to the need for kidney replacement,
      by dialysis or kidney transplant, and is also associated with higher risk of early death. A
      new diabetes medicine called empagliflozin may slow kidney disease from type 2 diabetes.
      Researchers want to learn if it protects the kidneys when used in very early stages of
      diabetic kidney disease.

      Objectives:

      To see if empaglifozin delays kidney disease development.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18-64 years old who are at least half American Indian and have had type 2 diabetes at
      least 5 years

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with health questions, blood pressure, and blood and urine
      tests.

      Participants will have:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, and stool samples taken

        -  Scan of the kidneys and liver. Participants will lie on a table that slides into an MRI
           machine. They will hold their breath for up to 20 seconds and the MRI machine will take
           images of their kidneys and liver. They will then repeat this with a small device that
           vibrates on their side.

        -  Kidney tests. A needle will be placed in a vein in each arm for 4 hours. Blood pressure
           will be taken. Participants will drink several quarts of water and urinate every 20
           minutes. Urine and blood samples will be collected. Two liquids will be injected into
           their veins to measure kidney function.

        -  Photos of the back of the eyes

        -  Kidney biopsy. Participants will have a scan and get drugs to make them sleepy. Up to
           four very small pieces of kidney will be removed by needle. After the biopsy
           participants will be monitored for at least 4 hours.

        -  Nerve tests

      Participants will take the study drug or placebo pill once a day. Participants will attend
      for tests every twelve weeks and have more extensive kidney function tests once a year. After
      3 years, participants will have another kidney biopsy and then stop taking the study drug.
      They will have a final kidney function test 2 months later.

      The purpose of this protocol is to examine the effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2
      (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin on kidney disease progression in American Indians with type 2
      diabetes and early diabetic kidney disease (DKD) via a double-blinded placebo-controlled
      clinical trial. This trial will enroll 100 participants who will be randomly assigned to
      receive either 10 mg of empagliflozin or placebo daily for three years in addition to
      standard of care. Participants will be followed quarterly to monitor their health, identify
      any adverse effects of treatment, and to assess their adherence to therapy. The primary
      objective of this study is to determine whether empagliflozin affects structural and
      functional progression of DKD in American Indians with type 2 diabetes and early DKD to a
      greater extent than standard diabetes care alone, which may include treatment with
      renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. The primary outcome measure will be a change in
      cortical interstitial fractional volume [Vv(Int/cortex)] as assessed by morphometric
      examination of kidney biopsy specimens obtained at study entry and after the three years of
      study drug treatment. Secondary outcomes include an effect of empagliflozin on kidney
      function including measures of glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, and effects
      on other kidney biopsy morphometric measurements. Biopsy tissue will also be used for gene
      expression studies and for epigenetic profiling. Magnetic resonance imaging of the kidneys
      will be performed prior to each biopsy to correlate the structural damage seen at kidney
      biopsy with the level of fibrosis detected by imaging. In addition to annual renal clearance
      studies we will conduct a series of other tests at each renal clearance visit. These will
      include tests of cognitive function and of the peripheral and autonomic nervous system to
      determine the frequency, severity, and rate of progression of diabetic neuropathy in this
      cohort and identify linkages between DKD and diabetic neuropathy, and retinal photographs to
      assess diabetic retinopathy status and its linkage with DKD. The effect of treatment with
      empagliflozin on the development and progression of neuropathy and retinopathy will also be
      assessed. To assess acute effects of empagliflozin on renal function at the commencement and
      cessation of the drug we will undertake additional renal clearance studies two weeks after
      enrollment and two months after discontinuation of the drug. A small punch skin biopsy may be
      performed for assessment of intraepidermal nerve fiber density or for fibroblast culture. The
      skin biopsy for fibroblast culture will be done only once unless the culture fails, in which
      case the patient may be invited to undergo another biopsy. We may invite participants to
      undergo skin biopsy on several occassions for assessment of changes in nerve fiber density.
      We may also perform magnetic resonance imaging of the kidneys or the brain in some
      participants. Imaging of the kidneys will be done as near to the time of each kidney biopsy
      as possible. We may invite participants to undergo the brain imaging at the beginning and end
      of the study. Participants will be followed annually after completion of the clinical trial
      until death or development of end-stage renal disease.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        To be eligible for participation in the study, participants must meet the following
        criteria:

          -  American Indian heritage participants must be at least half American Indian (i.e. 2
             out of 4 grand-parents)

          -  Aged 18-64 years. The lower age limit was set so renal function test results would not
             reflect changes associated with growth and the upper limit was set to avoid the
             bladder emptying problems often encountered in older people, since complete bladder
             emptying is crucial to the accuracy of the renal function measurements done in this
             study.

          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for greater than or equal to 5 years.

          -  Estimated GFR &gt;60/ml/min as determined from the CKD-EPI equation using serum
             creatinine (Levey et al., 2009) or serum creatinine concentration &lt;1.4 mg/dl in women
             and &lt;1.5 mg/dl in men.

          -  Serum potassium concentration less than or equal to 5.5 mEq/L.

          -  A screening urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio &lt;300 mg/g.

          -  Willingness to participate after receiving a thorough explanation of the study.

          -  Participants receiving a RAS blocker must have been receiving the drug for at least 3
             months prior to the study baseline examination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Volunteers will be excluded prior to enrollment for the following reasons:

          -  Clinically significant disorders of the liver [cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
             hepatitis, increased bilirubin (greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl), cardiovascular
             disease (angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction, heart failure,
             cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary diseases (asthma and
             restrictive or obstructive lung disease requiring therapy), renal-urinary disorders
             (calculi, urinary tract obstruction, glomerulonephritis, chronic infection),
             gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or anorexia sufficient to cause
             weight loss or wasting), or hematocrit levels less than or equal to 30 percent or &gt;55
             percent in women or greater than or equal to 35 percent or &gt;60 percent in men.

          -  Prior treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.

          -  Renovascular or malignant hypertension; uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood
             pressure greater than or equal to 160 or diastolic greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg)
             despite treatment with three antihypertensive drugs.

          -  Hematuria of unknown etiology. Prior to entry into the study, any participant with
             hematuria should be evaluated, the etiology established and documented, and treatment
             rendered as appropriate.

          -  Chronic debilitating disorders with or without treatment (e.g., systemic lupus
             erythematosus (SLE), cancer, amyloidosis, and chronic infection) that would interfere
             with the assessment of kidney function or that might reduce the chances of survival
             for a sufficient length of time to evaluate the efficacy of treatment.

          -  Currently receiving a drug regimen that includes: steroids, immunosuppressants, or
             investigational new drugs.

          -  Pregnancy. Boerhinger Ingelheim, the manufacturer of empagliflozin, do not recommend
             its use during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, we do not wish to
             expose pregnant women to conscious sedation that is used during the kidney biopsies or
             to the intravenous filtration markers iothalamate and para-aminohippurate needed for
             the renal clearance studies. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to entry and every 3 months during the study, and agree to using
             an effective form of contraception throughout the study, such as the oral
             contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. Women who are planning a pregnancy in
             the next three years will be excluded.

          -  Symptoms of inability to empty the bladder. The urinary clearance method is only
             accurate if complete bladder emptying is possible.

          -  Hypersensitivity to empagliflozin or iodine.

          -  Bleeding disorders or requirements for anticoagulation or platelet inhibitors which
             cannot be safely interrupted, since kidney biopsies cannot be performed safely in
             these individuals.

          -  Massive obesity with body mass index greater than or equal to 45 kg/m(2). Kidney
             biopsies are more difficult and present greater hazards to people with massive
             obesity.

          -  Allergy to iodine-containing contrast material.

          -  Non-diabetic kidney disease based on clinical history or kidney biopsy examination.

          -  History of severe recurrent kidney infections.

          -  History of osteoporotic fracture.

          -  Conditions likely to interfere with informed consent or compliance with the protocol.
