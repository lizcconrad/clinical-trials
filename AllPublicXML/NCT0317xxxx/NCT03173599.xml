    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending single oral doses of metacavir
      enteric-coated capsules using a placebo-controlled design conducted in Chinese healthy adult
      volunteers, and to provide references for the clinical trial of the next phase Ⅰ and Ⅱ.

      48 eligible healthy subjects are involved. According to the set ascending-doses groups,
      subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 proportion to orally take a single dose of Metacavir
      enteric-coated capsule or placebo on the condition of fasting. Each group has 8 people,
      evenly composed of men and women. The beginning dose of the study is 40mg/d.According to the
      dose escalation method, subjects who have successfully completed tests of the previous dose
      group and passed the safety assessment will enter the next dose group with the same method.
      All subjects check in the phaseⅠresearch center one day early before taking the test drug.
      Vital signs and ECG will be observed before and 0.5,1,2,4,8,12,18,24,48,72 hours after
      administration and at the follow-up day which is the 7th day since administration. Laboratory
      tests will be conducted before and 6,24,48,72 hours after administration and at the follow-up
      day , and the adverse drug events are observed throughout the test.
