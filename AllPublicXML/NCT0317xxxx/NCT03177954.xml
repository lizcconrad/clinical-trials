  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to improve the discharge process for patients with stroke, which has been
      reported to be a particularly stressful time for patients. A Patient Oriented Discharge
      Summary (PODS) meeting has been shown to be an effective approach for minimizing
      discharge-related stress and fostering self-management skills in other patients being
      discharged from rehabilitation into the community. The purpose of this study is to develop
      and evaluate whether a PODS meeting can minimize stress around the discharge process and
      improve patient satisfaction with this process. There are two main hypotheses regarding the
      PODS program: 1) it will help in-patients with stroke understand key issues related to
      knowledge required once discharged and 2) it will increase levels of self-efficacy in
      in-patients with stroke. Potential subjects are encouraged to participate if they are a
      Sunnybrook - St. John's Rehab admitted in-patient with a stroke diagnosis who are 18 years or
      older and meet the following criteria: (a) fluent in English; (b) cognitively intact; and (c)
      have minimal or no aphasia.The participant will be asked to answer some surveys 8-10 days
      prior to discharge about their knowledge and confidence in managing their stroke.

      The participant will then be asked to meet with a clinical staff member who will hold a
      one-hour PODS meeting. In the meeting, a discharge plan will be created and given to the
      patient that covers a number of topics that will be useful following their return to the
      community. One day following the PODS meeting, the participant will be asked to answer the
      same survey they completed prior to the PODS and again 3-5 days following discharge. If the
      participant is interested they will be asked to undergo a brief interview to get their
      feedback on the PODS Program. It is anticipated that about 20 people will participate in the
      program with all 20 patients completing the surveys with 6 being asked to complete the brief
      interview.

      To the best of the investigators knowledge, there is little risk associated with this study.
      Participants may become uncomfortable during the interview while discussing their
      experiences. By participating in this study, patients will be provided with a chance to
      gather information and learn problem solving and self-management skills prior to discharge.
      It is the hope of this project that it can lead to a more effective approach in supporting
      the transition from the hospital to the community for patients with stroke

    <description>Participants will undergo a Patient Oriented Discharge Summary (PODS). The PODS is a personalized summary of the discharge plan presented in an easy to understand worksheet that covers (1) medication instructions; (2) follow-up appointments with phone numbers; (3) normal expected symptoms, warning signs, and what to do if they experience a problem; (4) lifestyle changes and when to resume activities; and (5) information and resources to have handy. The meeting will take place one week prior to discharge.</description>
