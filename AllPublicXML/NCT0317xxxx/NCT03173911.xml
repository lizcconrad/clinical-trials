  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastic Bandaging Therapy (BET) is a technique that consists of the application of elastic
      adhesive tape directed on a skin, and is used for pain reduction, improvement of flexibility,
      postural alignment. It is believed that it can help proprioception by increasing or reducing
      muscle tension by acting on motor coordination and balance. The present study aims to
      evaluate the effect of the application of different BET strategies on the postural balance of
      healthy young women through measures obtained through a proper instrument for a balance
      assessment, a force platform.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized clinical trial where participants will be allocated into four intervention groups: G1 (n = 12) will receive therapeutic elastic bandage by the Therapy Taping® method (BET) in the ankles; G2 (n = 12) will receive the application of the BET in the lumbar region and G4 (n = 12) will receive the application for all the strategies. The individuals' balance will be evaluated in four moments: pre-intervention (Pre), immediately (Ime), 24 and 48 hours after intervention (24h and 48h). The main equilibrium parameters analyzed will be: ellipse area (95%) of COP in square centimeters (A-COP in cm2), average speed in centimeters per second (VM in cm / s) and average frequency in Hertz (FM in Hz) Of COP oscillations in the anterior-posterior (A / P) and mid-lateral (M / L) directions, during three postural control tasks: open-eye semitandem (STOA) and right and left unipodal support (UNPD And UNPE).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>composed by 12 participants who will receive the application of the bandage for the ankle strategy in both lower limbs, being determined the application of the technique in I without fixed point, from medial malleolus to lateral malleolus passing under the hindfoot, finally a cleavage technique passing over the malleoli and ending in the anterior region of the ankle joint. The balance of each individual will be evaluated in the force platform at four different times, before, immediately after, after 24 and 48 hours after the application of the bandage, in three different tasks of postural control in the force platform, being: unipedal right, unipedal left and task Of bipedal support in the semi-tandem position. Will be performed three evaluations of 30s each, with 30s of interval between each evaluation.</description>

The balance of each individual will be evaluated in the force platform at four different times, before, immediately after, after 24 and 48 hours after the application of the bandage, in three different tasks of postural control in the force platform, being: unipedal right, unipedal left and task Of bipedal support in the semi-tandem position.
