      To explore the meaning and outcomes of a four-month building capacity process designed to

      school-based practice.The study involved a one-group (n=19) mixed methods design using using
      pretest-posttest surveys and qualitative analysis of written reflections was used to explore
      the meaning and outcomes of participation in the building capacity process.The building
      capacity process expanded student knowledge of a public health approach to mental health
