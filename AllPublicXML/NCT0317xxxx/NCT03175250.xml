  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized trial was conducted at drug diversion educational programs with a sample of 343
      adult drug offenders who volunteered for the study. The trial tested three different
      interventions on HIV testing and condom use, with a 3 month follow-up. The study translated
      consistent basic research showing strong effects of memory practice on memory for new
      material. One of the conditions involved extensive memory practice of action plans involving
      HIV testing and condom use. Other conditions varied two active control interventions. Results
      showed that the memory practice condition led to a substantially larger odds of HIV testing
      than did the two control conditions. Condom use was also significantly more frequent in the
      memory practice condition than in one of the control conditions but was not significantly
      different from the second control condition.

      This study translated basic research from several areas of cognitive science to a new
      intervention procedure designed to reduce HIV risk and increase screening for HIV and other
      infections. A randomized trial was conducted (N = 343) to test effects on testing for
      infection (HIV and hepatitis B/C) and condom use frequency in a sample of drug offenders at
      risk for infection. Many populations of drug offenders are not currently receiving
      evidence-based prevention for HIV or hepatitis and are in need of effective interventions
      that can be used in existing drug programs. At three-month follow-up, the results revealed
      that the condition translating basic research on memory practice and integrative processing
      significantly increased the odds of infection testing as compared to two alternative
      conditions. This condition also significantly improved the extent of condom use, compared to
      a traditional health education condition. The results show promise for increased translation
      of basic research on memory to behavioral interventions on health and prevention science.
      Such procedures can be effectively applied in a complex field setting in existing drug
      diversion programs.

    <masking>Quadruple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants were randomly assigned by computer algorithm to three different conditions, and the intervention took place over individually assigned computers with screens that were not observable by the care provider, investigator, or outcome assessor. The two control groups were designed to be &quot;active,&quot; that is, designed to have some effects. Thus, there was no indication of which intervention might be more effective.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Past 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>HIV testing was measured with items from the National Sexual Health Survey (Catania et al., 1992). Hepatitis testing items were assessed in an identical structure. Testing for other sexually transmitted diseases was measured with items from the AIDS Risk Behavior Assessment (Donenberg et al., 2001). These items were tabulated to form a binary variable of whether participants reported testing for HIV, hepatitis, or other sexually transmitted diseases within the past 3 months (3 months following intervention).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Condom use</measure>
    <time_frame>Past 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Condom use was assessed with three condom use frequency items from the HIV Risk-taking Behavior Scale (Darke et al., 1991; Î± =.70; test-retest, r = .86). Response agreement between participants and their sex partners ranged from 88% to 100% in previous research. The questions asked how often participants used condoms in the past 3 months (following the intervention) when having vaginal, oral, or anal sex on a 5-point scale: never, some of the time, about half of the time, most of the time, always.</description>
