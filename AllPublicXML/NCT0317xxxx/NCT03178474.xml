    <textblock>
      Objective：The present trial aimed to assess efficacy and safety of Jin Ling Guan and Tofer
      infant formula on body growth, intestinal tolerance, gut microbiota and fecal residual
      nutrients as compared to breast-milk in term Chinese infants.

      Participants：189 healthy termed-infants with ages of 5-14 days at the enrollment.

      Study Design: A multiple-center, quasi-randomized,open labeled, controlled trial. Random
      allocation between the two infant formula.

      Arms, Groups, and Intervention: (1) Breast milk-fed group: fed with human breast milk; (2)
      JINLINGGUAN Formula Group：fed with JINLINGGUAN infant formula (PRO-KIDO™ I-PROTECH®, Phase
      I); (3) TOFER Formula Group: feeding TOFER infant formula (TOFER®, Phase I). Random
      allocation performed between the two formula groups.

      Intervention Duration: 12 weeks.

      Visits: 1 week(baseline), 7 and 13 weeks of age

      Outcome measures: (1) General information, general health and wellbeing, regular body
      check;(2) Anthropometric parameters: body length, body weight, and head circumferences; (3)
      Stool characteristics (color , volume, stool consistency, and frequency;(4)Behavior and
      habits; (5) Gut microbiota; (6) Residual nutrients in feces (nitrogen,total fat, fatty acids,
      minerals); (7) adverse events and concomitant medications; (8) compliance. Slopes of changes
      from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks post intervention in anthropometric parameters, stool
      characteristic index, fecal residual nutrients, pattern score of gut microbiota, behavior and
      habit index were be calculated.
