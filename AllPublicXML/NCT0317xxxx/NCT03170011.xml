  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cardiac disease have been shown to have deficits in activities such as standing
      up from a chair. The Biodex Sit2Stand Trainer is a new device meant to improve sit to stand
      performance by providing a lifting force through the seat to help the individual stand. The
      amount of lift can be graded to help improve leg strength, endurance, and function over time.
      The device has the potential to be a form of training for those in cardiac rehabilitation who
      have limitations in standing from a chair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are diagnosed with cardiovascular disease and enter cardiac rehabilitation
      present with limitations in activity and restrictions in their abilities to participate in
      society. Even after a standard course of cardiac rehabilitation, some individuals will still
      present with deficits. One area this is seen is the ability to stand up from a chair. A new
      device, the Biodex Sit2Stand Trainer, has been designed to help improve the standing movement
      in those with lower extremity weakness. The trainer provides a graded lift or push through
      the seat to help the participant reach a standing posture. This study will whether a six week
      training program using the trainer will lead to improvements in strength, function and
      quality of life for those individuals who have recently completed a cardiac rehabilitation
      program. This study is a pilot study to help determine the ideal dosage of training and
      identify any limitations in using the device with this population. Based on the results of
      this pilot work, a larger intervention study will be conducted to examine the effectiveness
      of the trainer in a cardiac rehabilitation program.
