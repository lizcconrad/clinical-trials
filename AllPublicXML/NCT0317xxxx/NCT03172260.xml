  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study, to test the hypothesis that E Balance Pro Therapy
      micro-current treatments, delivered with precision in amplitude, waveform and pulsing
      pattern, adapted by other aspects of this device's technology could affect ion flow across
      cells and tissues in a fashion that modifies or transforms a crucial pathophysiologic deficit
      present in patients with diabetes. E Balance Pro Therapy can supplement standard treatment,
      as an adjunct, and help patients better manage their diabetes. HbA1C is the primary endpoint
      of this study. However, we expect to see changes in other symptoms (if present) associated
      with diabetes such as: blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, neuropathic pain retinopathy and
      wound healing.
