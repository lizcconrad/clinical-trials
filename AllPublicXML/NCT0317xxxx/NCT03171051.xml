  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the ability of a light emitting diode (LED) study
      device's ability to raise the temperatures on flank tissue to a similar level compared to an
      approved laser device (SculpSure by Cynosure). Laser treatments have been shown to reduce fat
      in the flanks by heating the fat cells and causing them to burst. The contents of the cells
      are then cleared naturally by the body.

      This is an open-label, feasibility study comparing the tissue temperature profile of a 950 nm
      LED device and a 1060 nm diode laser for non-invasive lipolysis of the flanks. The study will
      enroll up to 10 subjects requesting non-invasive lipolysis of the flanks. Each subject will
      receive a single treatment with each device on opposite flanks. Tissue temperatures in the
      treated areas will be recorded at various tissue depths and compared. Subjects will be asked
      to assess their discomfort and pain of the study treatment using a 10 cm visual analog scale
      (VAS). In addition, the safety (number of treatment related adverse events) of the LED device
      will be compared to the reference device at the time of treatment and one week later.
