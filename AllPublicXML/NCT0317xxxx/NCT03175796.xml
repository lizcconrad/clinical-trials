  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the Infant Mental Health
      Home Visiting (IMH-HV) model on maternal and child outcomes according to legislative
      standards via a randomized controlled trial. The research team will recruit caregivers and
      their children (0-24 months) or pregnant women (n=72) from locations across Washtenaw County
      to participate in the IMH-HV RCT. Half of the women will be randomly assigned to a treatment
      as usual (TAU) control group (with access to all available community resources), and half of
      the women will be randomly assigned to the treatment group (i.e., IMH-HV). Women assigned to
      the control group will not receive IMH-HV treatment through the study team, but will not be
      prohibited from seeking or accessing IMH-HV treatment or any other services through community
      resources. Women assigned to the treatment group will receive IMH-HV treatment for 12 months
      through the study team with rigorous monitoring of fidelity to the IMH-HV model. All study
      participants will undergo assessments across the 12-month period of the treatment trial
      (i.e., baseline (randomization will occur after baseline), mid-points (3, 6 and 9 months) and
      follow-up (12 months) after randomization).

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of the Infant Mental Health Home-Visiting
      (IMH-HV) model on parental and child outcomes according to legislative standards and
      consistent with the State of Michigan's benchmarks. If this study confirms the efficacy of
      the IMH-HV model, this will support the sustainability of IMH-HV in the state of Michigan as
      evidence from a randomized controlled trial is necessary in order to access certain state and
      federal dollars. Access to evidence-based and sustainable parenting support can ultimately
      improve outcomes for this vulnerable population. Specifically this study aims to:

        1. Conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of IMH-HV treatment
           utilizing rigorous outcomes monitoring and evaluation methodology to establish that the
           families served achieve the intended positive benefit. Eligible caregivers and children
           or pregnant women will be assigned to the control group or the treatment group and both
           groups will receive research assessments at regular intervals measuring key impacts of
           the IMH-HV model.

        2. Determine IMH-HV efficacy via analysis of treatment impact on key caregiver, child, and
           family indicators. The hypothesis is that there will be positive impacts of IMH-HV, with
           caregiver, child, and family-level improvements from baseline to post assessment on key
           indicators, including:

             1. Improved child outcomes as reflected in strengthened child physical and behavioral
                health, development and school readiness, and reduced risk for child maltreatment.

             2. Improved parental outcomes including improved parent mental health, decreased child
                abuse potential, and enhanced positive parenting.

             3. Improved family environment including decrease in crime and family violence,
                enhance linkage to referrals and improve family economics and self-sufficiency.

        3. Identify factors associated with family improvement, including dosage and fidelity of
           treatment. It is the hypothesis that a dose-response association between the number of
           home visiting sessions and treatment impact, and a positive association between fidelity
           of treatment delivered and positive child and family outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>IMH-HV is a relationship-focused mental health intervention that aims to improve caregiver and child outcomes, including: improved caregiver mental health; enhanced positive parenting; decreased risk for physical/emotional neglect and/or abuse; and reduced risk for negative child outcomes including impaired development, cognitive delay and behavioral problems. In addition, IMH-HV services aim to reduce the probability of intergenerational transmission of the effects of unresolved loss and trauma in parents.
The IMH-HV Model uses a range of strategies for intervention, such as:
attending to the health and basic material needs of the infant/toddler, parent(s), and family members;
providing developmental guidance for positive parenting behavior;
providing counseling/emotional support for the parents;
developing parents' life coping skills and social support; and
providing infant/parent psychotherapy.</intervention_model_description>
