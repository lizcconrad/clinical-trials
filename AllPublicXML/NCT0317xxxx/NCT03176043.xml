    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether participants who are dictating their own
      administration of IV fluid boluses in response to thirst, receive better protection from
      hypovolaemia and volume overload than those who undergo routine fluid management.

      Thirst is prominent in critically ill patients and is related to dehydration. In a recent
      study of the symptoms experience in ITU patients at high risk of dying, the sensation of
      thirst was reported in 70.8% of assessments made and was considered to be one of the most
      intense stressors. Thirst and dehydration can be combated in an ITU setting by consuming oral
      fluids and through administration of intravenous fluids. However, in older adults, frailty
      and dysphagia reduces patients' capability to access fluid and results in thirst. In
      addition, the administration of IV fluids is determined by the attending physician and is
      often only re-evaluated on a daily or twice-daily basis.

      The Quench machine has been designed to allow the patient to have more control over their
      oral and IV fluid administration protocol. This may help reduce the sensation of thirst and
      dehydration in patients. The machinery is an automated fluid delivery system that will
      administer a given bolus of IV fluid in response to a trigger provided by the patient.

      The purpose of the current study is to examine the physiological basis for the functional
      benefit of this Quench system by investigating the effectiveness of the thirst response in
      healthy humans as a guide for administration of intravenous fluid boluses.

      To explore this, the investigators have designed a randomised, cross-over study. On one visit
      IV fluid boluses will be administered as per the participants' request in response to thirst.
      In the second arm of the study participants will be administered routine IV fluid maintenance
      as per NICE guidelines. Body mass at the end of a 4 hour fluid administration intervention
      will be our primary research outcome and will be compared between the two arms of the study.

      From this comparison the investigators hope to show that a patient would be able to
      accurately manage their level of hydration, both in terms of correcting dehydration and
      avoiding fluid overload. It is thought that avoiding states of fluid imbalance can reduce
      post surgical recovery times, reduce the incidence of post operative complications and avoid
      critical complications of fluid imbalance, such as acute kidney injury.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether participant dictated fluid bolus
      administration in response to their symptom of experienced thirst is a viable basis to guide
      a clinical practice of fluid maintenance and correction of hydration status. To this end the
      experiment will compare the implementation of this fluid maintenance mechanism on volume
      depleted healthy participants to a program of routine fluid maintenance.

      The null hypothesis is that the hydration state of the participants, as measured by change in
      body weight and plasma osmolality, will be no better corrected and managed by a thirst
      dictated management system than by routine maintenance.

      The study has a cross-over design, used to ensure differences in hydration status, or lack
      there of, can be attributed to the methods of fluid administration in question, without
      differences between individuals confounding the results.

      The participants will be required to attend the laboratory on two occasions for approximately
      5 hours each visit, for arm A and B of the study. The two visits will be separated by 7 to 14
      days. On each visit standard IV fluids will be administered The evening before each visit
      participants will be required to take 40mg of the water tablet called furosemide and refrain
      from drinking fluids. This is used in order to dehydrate the participant and reduce body mass
      by between 2 - 4%. The participant needs to be dehydrated in order to promote a thirst
      response so that the interventions can be studied in a cohort of participants representative
      of hypovolemic patients post surgery

      On both visits an indwelling cannula will be placed into a vein in the participants' arm, to
      administer IV fluid on the participants' non dominant side. Before fluid administration this
      will be used to draw a blood sample for plasma osmolality measurements. A second blood sample
      with be drawn from a vein on the opposite arm following the fluid infusion.

      For arm A: the participant will request the administration of 200ml boluses of IV fluid at
      any point that they experience thirst. This administration will be limited to one bolus every
      15 minutes.

      For arm B: participants will receive routine fluid maintenance as dictated by the NICE
      guidelines.

      During both trials, low intensity exercise will be permitted (walking, standing, sitting)
      although high intensity exercise is not allowed. Entertainment in the form of a computer with
      internet access and DVDs will be provided.

      The arm of the study the patient will undergo in the first week will be determined according
      to a randomised list. However, due to the nature of the investigation the arm of the study be
      undergone by the patient can not be blinded from the researchers or participant. All
      measurements, except the perception of thirst questioning, are objective measures, such as
      weight, plasma osmolality, haematocrit and blood sodium levels. This will minimise any
      researcher bias.

    <description>Subjects who are self administering fluid will be instructed when (at any point in the experiment) they are experiencing thirst to request a fluid bolus with an electronic trigger. In response to this trigger the researcher will then deliver a 200ml bolus of IV fluid. After delivery of the fluid bolus, a lockout period is set for 15mins within which the researcher will not deliver another bolus in response to the trigger.</description>
