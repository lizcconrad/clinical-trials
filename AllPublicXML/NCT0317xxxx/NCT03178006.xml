    <textblock>
      This project aims to establish the correlation between intestinal microbiota with
      inflammatory biomarkers, intestinal morphology, vascular reactivity and degree of hepatic
      fibrosis in patients with different degrees of glucose tolerance and body adiposity.

      Obese patients with dysglycemia or not, from the Obesity Outpatient Clinic, and individuals
      with normal or overweight weight with dysglycemia or not, preferably from the same social
      class and type of diet of the obese will be invited to participate in the study. Dysglycemia
      will be defined by the criteria of the Brazilian Society of Diabetes. These individuals will
      be divided into four groups: obese with dysglycemia (OBD), obese with normoglycemia (OB),
      lean / overweight with dysglycemia (MD) and lean with normoglycemia (M). After the selection
      and signing of the informed consent, the patient will be referred for an anthropometric
      evaluation, with the measurement of body mass and height, waist circumference and
      determination of body fat by the bioimpedance method Biodynamic 450 (BioDynamics , Seattle,
      USA). Finally, the 24-hour reminder (R24h) will be applied as a food survey method. And the
      dietary calculation will be performed through the AVANUTRIÂ® diet calculation program (Rio de
      Janeiro, Brazil). Clinical parameters will include: age, sex, BMI, presence of comorbidities,
      use of medications, gastrointestinal complaints, previous surgeries and smoking (absent,
      present, prior). Only after approval by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the Pedro
      Ernesto University Hospital (HUPE-UERJ), will this recruitment begin.
