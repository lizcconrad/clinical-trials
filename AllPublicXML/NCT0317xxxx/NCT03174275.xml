  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study have a type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma of the head
      and neck (SCCHN). Their SCCHN has spread around the area where the cancer first started. This
      is called locally-advanced SCCHN. These participants are eligible for surgery.

      Previous research with a similar therapy regimen resulted in high rates of cancer shrinkage,
      high rates of avoiding radiation and its side effects, high cure rate and good quality of
      life. Radiation can be very toxic. The purpose on this study is to try to avoid radiation. If
      the participants are not on this study they would be receiving radiation as it is standard
      treatment of their cancer. In the last study with a similar regimen, about a third of cancers
      had a pathologic complete response with the first part of the study. This means that the
      chemotherapy had killed the cancer. The investigators are trying to improve the regimen
      further with a goal of increasing this rate of complete response to the first part of
      therapy. The investigators also hope that by improving results in the first part, that more
      people will be cured and that long term quality of life (especially speech and swallowing)
      will be improved, both compared to standard therapies and to the last study. Doctors do not
      know how this therapy will effect the participants. There is no guarantee that this study
      will benefit the participants.

      The prior study used a combination of chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin, paclitaxel and
      a third targeted anti-cancer drug. In this study the investigators are testing the
      combination of carboplatin, nano-albumin bound paclitaxel and durvalumab. Nano-albumin bound
      paclitaxel has been shown to be more active against other types of squamous cancers than
      regular paclitaxel. It is FDA approved for squamous lung cancer, but experimental for head
      and neck cancer. Durvalumab is an experimental drug that uses the body's own immune system to
      fight the cancer. Doctors hope that combining Durvalumab with 2 chemotherapy drugs will be
      effective in treating SCCHN. Durvalumab on its own has been studied in patients with SCCHN
      and initial results have shown that some subjects' cancer has responded to it.

      The purpose of this study is to test a combination of chemotherapy to hopefully both increase
      the number of subjects that respond to therapy while also decreasing the number of side
      effects that subjects experience.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

      Estimate the pathologic complete response rate (pCRR) after induction chemotherapy with
      carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and durvalumab in previously untreated stage III and IV SCCHN
      amenable to surgical resection

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Report the clinical complete response rate (cCRR) and clinical response rate (cRR)
           following induction chemotherapy

        -  Estimate the percent of patients who have a change in estimated risk level. Prior to
           induction, this will be assessed clinically (by imagining and physical exam). Post
           induction, this will be assessed by surgical pathology report

        -  Estimate the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) associated with 3
           part therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy, surgery and risk-adapted use of
           chemoradiation

        -  Characterize the toxicity profile associated with both induction therapy and total 3
           part therapy consisting of induction chemotherapy, surgery and risk-adapted use of
           chemoradiation

      Translational/Exploratory Objectives:

        -  Correlative studies will evaluate cellular correlates of response and changes in the
           tumor microenvironment across therapy

        -  Explore correlation between measures of clinical response to induction chemotherapy and
           long term outcomes (PFS and OS) and compare them to pathologic measures of response
           (pCRR)

      PROCEDURES This is a single-arm, nonrandomized phase II trial consisting of 3 parts. After
      informed consent and screening, pre-induction, risk levels will be assessed clinically, by a
      combination of physical exam and imaging.

      Part 1: All patients will then receive 6 weeks of induction chemotherapy in Part 1 comprised
      of weekly cycles of carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel for 6 cycles in combination with
      durvalumab administered once every two weeks for 5 cycles (Day 1 of the weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and
      9).

      Part 2: Within a 1-4 the week window post induction, tumor imaging will be followed by
      surgical resection.

      Part 3: After surgery, patients will be stratified into one of 3 risk categories based on
      their disease pathology, assigned a treatment group based on their risk. Low risk patients
      with receive durvalumab once every two weeks for 3 cycles, while medium risk or high risks
      groups will receive concurrent chemoradiation therapy followed by durvalumab once every two
      weeks for 3 cycles.

      Follow up After completion of study therapy (which will vary by study arm) patients will be
      evaluated every three months during follow up for progression over a period of 18 months.
      Each follow up visit will include physical examination, CT or MRI imaging of the neck. Chest
      imaging will be obtained (or not) as indicated by standard of care. After the first 18
      months, patients will be followed-up per standard of care, with documentation in the case
      report form (CRF) limited to progression and survival noted at their standard of care visits.
      If a patient should move away or otherwise be lost to in-person follow up but is amenable to
      telephone follow up, this will be permitted during the standard of care follow up period.

             physiologic doses not to exceed 10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.[Note: If
             systemic corticosteroids are part of the treatment regimen for the indication under
             study, the systemic corticosteroid is permitted].

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or evidence of
             active hepatitis B virus (HBV).

          -  History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab or any excipient.

          -  Receipt of live attenuated vaccination within 30 days prior the first dose of
             durvalumab [Note: If a vaccine is part of the treatment regimen for the indication
             under study, the vaccine is permitted].

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or female patients of reproductive
             potential who are not employing an effective method of birth control from starting
             dose of study medications (Cycle 1 Day 1), including dosing interruptions through 90
             days after receipt of the last dose of durvalumab. Refrain from egg cell donation
             while taking durvalumab and for at least 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab.

          -  Male subjects who are not employing an effective method of birth control from starting
             dose of study medications (Cycle 1 Day 1), including dosing interruptions through 6
             months after receipt of study treatment. Male subjects should agree to refrain from
             sperm donation while taking study treatment and for at least 6 months after the last
             dose of nab-paclitaxel and at least 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab. Should
             a female partner of a male patient become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in the study, he should inform his treating physician and the female
             partner should call her physician immediately.

          -  History of organ transplant.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study results
             (eg, uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or
             gastritis, active bleeding diatheses or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements or compromise the ability of the
             subject to give written informed consent).

          -  Patients with known contraindications to radiotherapy including inherited syndromes
             associated with hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia,
