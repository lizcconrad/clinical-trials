  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, both oral and written health education make certain assumptions about the health
      literacy of patients and their parents. The prevalence of health literacy issues is unknown
      in the adult congenital heart disease (CHD) population. Having a better understanding of a
      patient's and/or their parents' health literacy will help us develop appropriate education
      and teaching tools to meet the patient's and their parents' needs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When providers speak with patients regarding their congenital heart disease, they currently
      have no assessment of the patient's basic health literacy. If providers are aware of the
      level of their patients' health literacy, they will be better equipped to provide care on the
      level the patient best understands.
