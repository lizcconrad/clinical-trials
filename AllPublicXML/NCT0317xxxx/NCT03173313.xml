    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic
      hypothermia, using the ZOLL Proteus IVTM System, as an adjunctive therapy for patients
      presenting with acute anterior myocardial infarction (AMI) and undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI).

    <textblock>
      A multicenter, prospective, interventional, randomized-controlled trial. Randomization will
      be in a 1:1 ratio, Test Arm (PCI + Cooling) or Control Arm (PCI alone) in up to 468
      randomized subjects (234 subjects in each arm). Endpoint: Relative reduction of 20% in mean
      anterior myocardial infarct size as determined by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (cMR) imaging at
      4-6 days post infarct in the Test Arm (cooling + PCI) relative to the Control Arm (PCI only).

                  leads.

               2. Randomized subjects: Evidence of Acute Anterior MI only with ST-segment elevation
                  of &gt;= 0.2 mV in two or more anterior contiguous precordial leads.

          4. The patient is eligible for PCI.

          5. The patient is willing to provide written informed consent to participate in this
             clinical trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has had a previous Myocardial Infarction.

          2. The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;80 mmHg
             and non-responsive to fluids, or SBP &lt;100 mmHg with vasopressors, or requirement for
             an intra-aortic balloon pump [IABP]).

          4. The patient has an aortic dissection or requires an immediate surgical or procedural
             intervention other than PCI.

          5. The patient has known history of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), hepatic failure,
