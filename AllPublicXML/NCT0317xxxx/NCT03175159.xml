  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks primarily to test, in a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT), the
      efficacy of Project IMPACT, an intervention that integrates Behavioral Activation (BA) with
      HIV risk reduction (RR) counseling for HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM) with
      stimulant use disorder at risk for HIV via sexual behavior. HIV-uninfected MSM with a
      diagnosis of stimulant use disorder will be randomized 2:2:1 to three arms: (1) the Project
      IMPACT intervention, BA-RR counseling, which lasts ten sessions; (2) the time- and
      intensity-matched control condition, including ten sessions of relaxation therapy with
      educational support; and (3) the standard of care (SOC) comparison condition, including two
      equivalent sexual risk-reduction counseling sessions. Participants will be followed for one
      year post-randomization, with assessments at months four, eight, and 12.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project IMPACT targets both stimulant use and sexual risk reduction in effort to help
      individuals relearn how to enjoy safe but pleasurable activities. The intervention integrates
      BA, an evidence-based cognitive behavior therapy for improving mood and increasing activity,
      incorporated with RR counseling aimed to reduce risky sexual practices, and potential HIV
      acquisition. This RCT is a three-arm efficacy trial, comparing the Project IMPACT
      Intervention with a time and intensity matched control arm and a SOC arm. Comparing Project
      IMPACT intervention against a credible time- and intensity-matched control will determine if
      the intervention is efficacious above general counseling with the same intensity and duration
      (e.g., attention spent with the therapist vs. the content). Relaxation therapy and
      educational support will be utilized for the time- and intensity- matched intervention. All
      participants will receive HIV testing, pre-/post-test risk reduction counseling, oral swab
      toxicology test at baseline and 12 months, assessment of interest/indication for Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) per Center for Disease Control guidelines, and active referral to local
      PrEP services as standard-of-care. Finally, the RCT will integrate resource utilization and
      cost-effectiveness analyses to examine cost efficiency of the Project IMPACT Intervention as
      a component of data analysis.

    <ipd_description>Raw data for additional analysis will be available to outside individuals through contacting the Multiple Principal Investigators (MPI) at two different times. The first will be after all of the baseline data is collected. We will institute a concept plan process where internal study staff first have the availability to write papers or give presentations on particular topics. After this, if outside individuals wish to analyze data, we will welcome this collaboration. A similar process will happen for outcome data; however, this will not be possible until the publication and release of the outcome paper(s). The MPIs (Mimiaga and Safren) will store the data indefinitely and allow access for pooled data analysis projects, or projects for outside individuals. Information regarding the availability of data for analysis will be listed on the MPIs' program's web page. Contact information for the MPIs will be listed in all manuscripts and publications as another means to access data.</ipd_description>
