  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a model of patient navigation that
      investigators hope will address the unique needs of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer
      patients and their families by minimizing barriers in their care and potentially improving
      the outcomes of their treatment while reducing distress and enhancing quality of life.
      Investigators plan to achieve this by increasing access to, and use of, the resources
      available at Moffitt Cancer Center for AYA patients and their families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 80 participants may be recruited to this study at Moffitt Cancer Center to obtain a
      final sample size of 60 completed participants.

      Participants will be identified in consultation with the patient's primary oncologist and
      program social worker. A research assistant (RA) will verify eligibility and consent eligible
      patients.

      After completing a baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly placed into one of
      two groups. Both groups will receive their normal care, but one group will also meet with a
      patient navigator. Participants in both groups will be asked to complete a follow-up
      questionnaire approximately 8 to 10 weeks from when they complete the baseline questionnaire.
      The follow-up questionnaire will take about 15 to 20 minutes to complete.

      Participation in the study will last about 10 weeks.

    <description>Patient navigation (PN) is an intervention model designed to assist vulnerable patients in overcoming health system, personal and/or logistical barriers to care throughout the cancer care continuum. The strategic aims of PN are to reduce barriers and improve disease outcomes while also reducing distress and enhancing quality of life for the patient and family. Participants in the PN group will meet with a patient navigator.</description>
