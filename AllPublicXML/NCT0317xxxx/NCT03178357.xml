  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common hereditary disease characterized by left
      ventricular hypertrophy and consequently left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Its
      prevalence is estimated at around 0.2% in the general population. HCM is the most common
      cause of sudden cardiac death due to cardiovascular disease in young athletes, accounting for
      one third of deaths. HCM patients often have symptoms of heart failure. The ESC
      recommendations for heart failure (HF) from 2016 recommend exercise training regardless of
      ejection fraction to improve exercise capacity, quality of life, and reduction in
      hospitalizations due to HF. Meanwhile, for many years, HCM was equivalent to exercise
      training limitation. According to the 2014 ESC guidelines, it is recommended for patients
      with HCM to avoid sports practice. However the results of Edelmann et al. research, suggest
      that physical training leads to a significant clinical improvement in patients with diastolic
      dysfunction and thus may be beneficial in patients with HCM. In 2015 results of a first study
      were published (Klempfner et al.), which showed that the majority of HCM patients with
      moderate risk undergoing supervised physical training had improved physical performance and
      no significant adverse events were recorded. The study was limited by the small number of
      admitted patients (twenty), lack of control group and failure to perform cardio-pulmonary
      exercise test.

      The main goal of the study will be to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of comprehensive
      cardiological rehabilitation and telerehabilitation in patients with hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction with preserved systolic
      function. The study is planned to include 30 patients with HCM subjected to physical training
      and 30 patients with HCM in the control group treated as standard according to current
      guidelines, not subjected to physical training.
