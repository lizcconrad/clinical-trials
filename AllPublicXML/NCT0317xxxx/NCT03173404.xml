    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized open-label trial. Women scheduled for their first or second
      in-vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmatic Sperm Injection (IVF/ICSI) cycle and with no
      abnormality detected in transvaginal ultrasound examination, were randomized to two groups.
      In the first group (group I) 31 patients underwent hysteroscopy examination before IVF cycle
      while in the second group (group II) 37 patients underwent direct cycle without previous
      hysteroscopy

      This is a prospective randomized open-label trial. Women scheduled for their first or second
      IVF/ICSI cycle and with no abnormality detected in transvaginal ultrasound examination, were
      randomized to two groups. In the first group (group I) 31 patients underwent hysteroscopy
      examination before IVF cycle while in the second group (group II) 37 patients underwent
      direct cycle without previous hysteroscopy. Then IVF cycle was performed with habitual
      protocol. Beta Corionic Gonatropic hormone (BhCG) test two weeks after embryo transfer was
      done. If test was positive, patients were followed up for detection pregnancy by transvaginal
      ultrasound two weeks later. Another transvaginal ultrasound at 12 weeks of gestation was done
      to confirm ongoing pregnancy. Biochemical pregnancy, implantation, on-going pregnancy and
      livebirth rates were compared in both groups.

      Miscarriage, complications rate and hysteroscopy tolerability were also analyzed.
