  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study of PDR001 in combination with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 as first line
      therapy in patients with metastatic microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer. The study
      will assess primarily the safety and tolerability and then the efficacy of PDR001 in
      combination with bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6. Particular attention will be paid to the level of
      activity of study drug combinations in CMS4 patients (retrospective analysis).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with metastatic MSS colorectal adenocarcinoma.Note: MSI status will be
             performed locally by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) or PCR based test for eligibility.

          2. Patients must provide a newly obtained or an archival tumor sample corresponding to
             CRC diagnosis (primary tumor) with sufficient tissue quality (qualified) for analysis
             (mandatory)

          3. Patients must provide a newly obtained tumor tissue sample from a metastatic site
             (mandatory)

          4. Patients who are na√Øve to systemic treatment in metastatic setting. Patients with
             previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy (that may have included oxaliplatin or
             investigational VEGF inhibitors) are eligible if the treatment was completed &gt; 12
             months before inclusion.

          5. Patients with the presence of at least one lesion with measurable disease as per
             RECIST 1.1 guidelines. Lesions in previously irradiated areas should not be considered
             measurable unless they have clearly progressed since the radiotherapy.

        9. Patients have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1

        Key exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with MSI-H colorectal adenocarcinoma as defined per local assessment using
             standard of care testing

          2. Patients with metastatic disease amenable to be resected with potentially curative
             surgery

          3. Patients who have received any systemic treatment for metastatic disease.

          4. Patients with a history of prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PDL2,
             anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, other checkpoint inhibitors

          5. Patients who had received radiation within 14 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
