  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty may be conducted either under general anesthesia or spinal block.
      previous studies have shown that spinal block leads to less complications. The investigators
      aim to find whether post-operative pain is also diminished under spinal block compared to
      general anesthesia

      Patients who will be registered for a total knee replacement in Meir Medical Center and that
      will agree to participate in the study will be enrolled into one of two groups: the first,
      which will be the default choice for all patients, will be operated under a spinal block.
      Patients who will ask specifically for general anesthesia, or those in which the
      anesthesiologist will prefer general anesthesia due to medical reasons will be enrolled into
      the second group. For both groups the surgeon will add intraoperative peri-articular
      infiltration of local Marcaine injections, which was previously shown to diminish
      postoperative pain. The postoperative pain will be evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale
      at different point during the first 48 hours following operation. Physiotherapy achievements
      will also be recorded. The investigators will try to find whether one of the two groups
      suffered less pain or had achieved better results in physical therapy.
