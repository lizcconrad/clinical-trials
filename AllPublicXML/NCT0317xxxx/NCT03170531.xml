    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the image quality improvement provided by a custom MR
      spine coil in comparison with the FDA approved coil when used for radiotherapy treatment
      planning.

    <description>Optimize performance of custom-designed spine coil in RT configuration on participants. This objective focuses on the technology of the custom designed spine coil and does not require any statistical analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the signal-to-noise ratio of a custom spine coil with the existing FDA approved posterior coil array used for spine imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Day of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To quantify image quality obtained from the custom spine coil and the existing coil, SNR will be calculated (see Section 4.1 for details) for both coils. If, for a volunteer, the SNR from the custom coil is larger than 105% of that from the existing coil (we insist a 5% improvement margin due to anticipated uncertainty and variability), then we will classify this sample point as a &quot;success&quot;. We will combine the 15 volunteers from the three cohorts (cervical-spine, thoracic-spine and lumbar-spine) and impose the following decision rule: If at least 12 out of the total 15 volunteers are success, then we declare the custom designed spine coil promising and worthy of further investigation.</description>

        Enrollment in this study will be open to all MSKCC employees to act as healthy volunteers
        provided they meet the eligibility criteria for the protocol. Employees who provide consent
        willfully and voluntarily may participate as a healthy volunteer once. Employees who are
        under direct supervision of any investigators on the study will not be eligible to
        participate. An IRB approved flyer with pertinent contact information will be distributed
        throughout the institution to inform all MSKCC employees of the possibility of
        participating in this study. No preferences will be given by race or gender for the
        selection of participants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone who would be normally excluded from undergoing an MRI examination as per
             Memorial Hospital for Cancer and Allied Diseases Screening Questionnaire

          -  Volunteers with a pacemaker, aneurysm clip or any other condition that would warrant
             avoidance of a strong magnetic field

          -  Female volunteers who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Volunteers who are unable to comply or complete the MRI exam due to claustrophobia or
             high levels of anxiety
