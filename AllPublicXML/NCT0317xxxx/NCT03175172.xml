  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether CRS-207 with pembrolizumab is safe and
      effective in adults with MPM who have failed prior anti-cancer therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population for this study will consist of approximately 35 adults with
      histologically-confirmed MPM (epithelial or biphasic) whose disease has progressed after 1-2
      prior anti-cancer therapies.

    <description>CRS-207 and pembrolizumab will be administered in 3-week cycles. For Cycle 1, pembrolizumab (200 mg) will be administered by intravenous infusion (IV) over 30 minutes on Day 1 and CRS-207 (starting dose 1 × 10^9 colony-forming units [CFU]) will be administered IV over 1 hour on Day 2. If the infusions are well tolerated, pembrolizumab and CRS-207 may be administered on the same day (Day 1) for subsequent cycles. After 4 cycles, pembrolizumab will continue to be administered on Day 1 at each treatment cycle (every 3 weeks); CRS-207 will be administered once every 6 weeks. Treatment cycles will continue for up to 24 months as long as there is adequate safety and potential for clinical benefit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically-confirmed epithelial or biphasic MPM; biphasic tumors must have a
             predominantly (≥50%) epithelial component

          2. No more than 2 prior lines of anti-cancer therapy, one of which must have included
             pemetrexed and a platinum.

          3. Measurable disease as defined by modified RECIST for MPM (Byrne and Nowak, 2004)

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 or 1

          5. Adequate organ and marrow function

          6. Adequate lung function; forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1
             second (FEV1) ≥ 45% of predicted value as measured by spirometry; and oxygen
             saturation ≥ 90% on room air

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Pleurodesis within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug

          2. Receiving TNF pathway inhibitors, PI3 kinase inhibitors, systemic steroid therapy or
             any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug

          3. Active secondary malignancy

          4. Prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study
             drug, or not recovered from adverse effects due to agents administered more than 4
             weeks earlier

          5. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2
             weeks prior to first dose of study drug

          6. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis

          7. Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 agent, or agents targeting
             other checkpoint pathways (e.g. CTLA-4)

          8. Prior immunotherapy with CRS-207 or any other Listeria-based agent, therapeutic cancer
             vaccine, or adoptive T cell immunotherapy

          9. Implanted medical devices that pose high risks for colonization and cannot be easily
             removed (e.g., artificial heart valves, pacemakers, prosthetic joints, orthopedic
             screw(s), metal plate(s)) if infection occurs. Other common devices such as venous
             access devices (e.g., Port-a-Cath or Mediport) may be permitted as well as arterial
             and venous stents and dental and breast implants that were placed more than 3 months
             prior to first dose of study drug.
