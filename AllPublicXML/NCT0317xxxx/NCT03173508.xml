  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial evaluating the effect
      of acetazolamide (375 mg per day) vs. placebo on right ventricular function at rest in
      lowlanders with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travelling to altitude. Participants
      living in the Bishkek area, Kyrgyzstan (760m), will be transferred by car within 4h to the
      Tuja Ashu high altitude clinic (3200 m), and stay there for 2 days. Acetazolamide 375mg/day
      (or placebo) will be administered 24 hours before departure at 760 m and during the stay at
      altitude. Outcomes will be assessed during the stay at 3200 m.

      Right ventricular function will be assessed by transthoracic echocardiography.
