      Setting up a Prospective Belgian National Registry of patients undergoing minimally invasive
      liver resections will allow the constitution of a national network able to get updated
      information on indication and results. Data will be of great importance for additional
      scientific projects aimed to clarify the role of minimally invasive approach in surgical
      liver pathology, especially malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During recent years we saw over the world a consistent growth of laparoscopic liver surgery
      (LLS), essentially due to progress of the surgical techniques, technology and diagnostic
      imaging. During the Louisville conference on LLS (2008) the technique was thoroughly
      described and defined. One of the most important statements was the promotion of national
      registries, taking into account the logistics and feasibility problems of randomized trials
      in this setting. The main purpose to hold a Belgian national registry is to define the role
      of LLS in our country, looking for short and long-term outcomes, especially in case of liver
      tumors.

      In Belgium approximately 1000 liver resections are performed each year, however, the rate and
      results of LLS are unknown. The prospective data collection will highlight the role and
      incidence of LLS. Eventually, the registry will serve as support for scientific projects on
      different topics.

      The evolution of the national practice will be measured by looking to the ratio between
      laparoscopic and open procedures registered in the electronic CRF (eCRF) in a single center
      during a time period.

      The registration of additional parameters (as per below) will be necessary for comparing
      outcomes between conventional and laparoscopic techniques.

      The registered cases will be recorded prospectively and consecutively.

        Patients will be observed from the time of recruitment and throughout the hospital stay and
        will be collected information on vital status until discharge and planned follow-up.

        There is a minimum of 1-year follow-up required. Upon the evolution of patients inclusion
        and the available resources, we will consider to extend the FU time especially for
        oncological issues.
