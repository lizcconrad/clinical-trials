  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to emerging resistance, new antibiotic options are needed to treat CF acute pulmonary
      exacerbations caused by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is
      established evidence that adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) may have altered
      antibiotic pharmacokinetics compared with non-CF patients. Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide
      antibiotic that has activity against gram-positive bacteria including MRSA. This study will
      determine the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of telavancin in 18 adult CF patients
      admitted for a pulmonary exacerbation at 1 of 4 participating hospitals in the US.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participant will receive 3 doses of intravenous telavancin administered every 24 hours.
      Up to three different doses of telavancin will be studied (n=6 per group). Blood samples will
      be collected throughout the study to determine the pharmacokinetics of telavancin. Each group
      will proceed after measurement of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the lower
      dose group before it.

    <intervention_model_description>This pharmacokinetic study uses a sequential, adaptive design to determine the pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of increasing weight based doses of telavancin. During Arm 1, participants will receive 7.5 mg/kg daily. Upon completion of data collection and assessment of safety/tolerability, Arm 2 participants will receiving 10 mg/kg daily. After completion of Arms 1 and 2, a preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis will be conducted. These results, combined with the safety/tolerability of the 10mg/kg dose, will provide decision support to select a PK/PD optimized dose for Arm 3.</intervention_model_description>

             receiving a telavancin dose (Note. Although telavancin does not interfere with
             coagulation, it may interfere with some assays used to monitor coagulation)

          -  Requirement of concomitant administration of agents containing a cyclodextrin
             solubilizer such as intravenous voriconazole or itraconazole
