  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to better understand how the average consumer
      differentiates between bitter and astringent sensations, both of which are typically
      unpleasant sensations characteristic of some healthy foods. Astringency is the dry/rough
      sensation elicited by foods such as green bananas and some wines. Although trained scientists
      can differentiate between these stimuli, untrained participants rate them similarly, despite
      their differences. This confusion has created additional barriers in understanding the
      mechanism of astringent perception, which is currently debated. Understanding how to design
      experiments where untrained participants can clearly evaluate both sensations will lay the
      foundation to better understand astringency.

      One mechanism that is believed to contribute to astringency is the interaction of astringent
      stimuli with salivary proteins. Interestingly, the salivary protein profile may be influenced
      by consumption of fruits and vegetables. Therefore, the investigators will evaluate how
      bitter and astringent perceptions differ among high and low consumers of fruits and
      vegetables by collecting saliva following exposure to the stimuli. This knowledge will inform
      approaches to increase the appeal of healthy food.
