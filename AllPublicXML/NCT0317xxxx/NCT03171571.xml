      Unhealthy lifestyles are major factors contributing to chronic conditions that impose a huge
      financial burden in EU healthcare systems. Unfortunately, the communication of Public Health
      failed to influence consumer to change their habits. In this study, the aim is to evaluate
      the impact of a regular monitoring during 1 year on wellbeing and dietary habits in healthy
      volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Today, medicine mainly curative and reactive is primarily interested in sick people. Now,
      with our aging Western populations, we face a strong increase in chronic diseases incidence /
      prevalence that have a financial cost that becomes unbearable. Society's resources are being
      drained by the rising costs of disease management and of incremental improvements to our
      existing health care system. Immediate action is required to reverse these trends. The
      paradigm shift would be to move from a reactive to a proactive medicine that promote healthy
      life style to decrease incidence of chronic conditions through P4 Medicine that is
      Preventive, Participative, Predictive and Personnalized. However, unhealthy lifestyles are
      major factors contributing to chronic conditions that impose a huge financial burden in EU
      healthcare systems. Insufficient physical activity, poor diet and obesity are significant
      risk factors for cancers, cardiovascular, chest, metabolic disorders and leading causes of
      morbidity and premature mortality. Clinically studies indicate that different conditions can
      be prevented and sometimes reversed through adaptation of healthy habits. But the
      communication of Public Health failed to influence consumer to change their habits. Hence, it
      is recognized as a gold standard that better nutrition and better health will reduce the risk
      of chronic diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases, which impact heavily on
      health spending.

      A report by the French National Assembly estimated the cost of obesity for the health
      insurance, if we add the daily allowances of sick care costs, between 2 and 6 € billion /
      year (until 4.6% of current health expenditure). As recently summarized by Caroline K. Kramer
      I 2015 moderate weight loss is related to favorable clinical outcomes. A weight loss of 7%
      (modification of lifestyle) reduced diabetes progression (-58%). The data collected addressed
      to health professionals will also enable better guide diagnostics and more efficient care
      strategies. Unfortunately free-living individuals are often poor at judging the healthiness
      of their own diet (choice of meal constituents, cooking methods, and portion sizes pattern of
      eating). Moreover, there is a lack of awareness of the contextual features influencing eating
      behavior and even where there is motivation to change, people have difficulty translating
      good intentions into healthy behaviors. Hence, their day-to-day constraints (lack of time,
      lack of knowledge, constraining family and cultural habits, personal tastes) make it
      difficult for them to comply and adopt the nationally recommended healthy lifestyles. In this
      study, the volunteers will be followed during one year.

      The wellbeing will be followed with :

        -  survey like FFQ, SF36, dietary habits.

        -  actimetry measurement

        -  one year follow-up of weight, waist measurement

        -  nutritional biomarkers
