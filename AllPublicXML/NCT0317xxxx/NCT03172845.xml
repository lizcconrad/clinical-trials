      To determine the clinical relevance of vulnerable plaque using OCT in patients with coronary
      bifurcation lesion.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective registry study in which patient with true bifurcation lesion undergoing
      percutaneous coronary intervention will be studied. Before procedure Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT) will be assessed for documentation of prevalence of vulnerable plaque, its
      characteristics and its clinical relevance.

      Group A: presence of vulnerable plaque at the bifurcation Group B: absence of vulnerable
      plaque at the bifurcation Documentation of immediate post stent OCT and 12 months follow up
      angiography with OCT will be performed. Immediate post stent OCT to assess successful stent
      implantation and after 12 months follow up OCT to document later stent thrombosis.
