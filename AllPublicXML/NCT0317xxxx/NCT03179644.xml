    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the correlation between mean pleural
      pressure and oesophageal pressure in the immediate aftermath of bi-pulmonary transplantation.

      In this research, oesophageal pressure will be measured by a nasogastric tube with an
      esophageal balloon (also suitable for feeding the patient) usually installed at the time of
      transplantation, pleural pressure will be measured by several Pleurocath-type catheters
      (Prodimed Inc, France) which the thoracic surgeon will have positioned at the end of the
      surgery without additional skin intrusion.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary transplantation is a model of acute lung injury due to ischemia-reperfusion
      phenomena responsible in 1 in 4 patients for the occurrence of primary graft dysfunction
      (DPG), which penalizes graft prognosis in the short to medium term. The survival of
      transplant patients. Furthermore, the post-operative period is a complex period in which
      multiple hemorrhagic, immunological, infectious, and neuromuscular complications may arise
      that may require prolonged mechanical ventilation. At present, there are no data on the
      measurement of pressure in pleural space after pulmonary transplantation. Achieving this
      measurement would make it possible to adapt the settings of the ventilator to both the acute
      phase in the case of DPG and to a later phase in case of mechanical weaning. In the case of
      bi-pulmonary transplantation, before the thorax is closed, each patient benefits from the
      systematic placement of bilateral anterior and posterior thoracic drains to prevent the
      formation of fluid effusions (hemothorax, pleurisy) and / or gases (pneumothorax ) Which
      would impede ventilation and compromise gas exchange. These drains are gradually withdrawn
      during resuscitation usually after weaning mechanical ventilation
