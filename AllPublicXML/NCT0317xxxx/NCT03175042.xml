  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant patients in the UT Medical Branch outpatient obstetric clinic are screened for
      anemia via blood draw at first prenatal visit. Those who meet Center for Disease Control
      (CDC) criteria for anemia during pregnancy (hemoglobin less than 11g/dL in first and third
      trimesters and hemoglobin less than 10.5g/dL during the second trimester), will be approached
      for participation in this study. It is the protocol of the UT Medical Branch outpatient
      obstetric clinic to repeat a blood draw every 4 weeks in patients with anemia. At the time of
      their blood draw, patients who participate in our study will have the Masimo Spot
      Non-invasive Hemoglobin monitor placed on our finger. The primary aim of the study is to see
      how accurate the non-invasive monitor is compared with blood draw. With the potential benefit
      being earlier diagnosis of anemia and easier method to ensure improvement in the hemoglobin.

      Pregnant women who are patients in the UT Medical Branch outpatient obstetric clinic will be
      screened for anemia using blood draw for CBC during the first prenatal visit. Those who are
      found to have anemia will be prospectively enrolled in this proof-of-concept study. Anemia
      will be defined according to the CDC guidelines (first and third trimesters hemoglobin level
      less than 11g/dL, and less than 10.5g/dL in the second trimester). Patients meeting these
      criteria will be approached for inclusion. If patients consent to participate, they will have
      their hemoglobin checked via the non-invasive monitor at the same time as their clinically
      indicated CBC testing. At the UT Medical Branch outpatient obstetric clinic, this is usually
      every 3-4 weeks and determined by the health care provider. The hemoglobin measured by the
      non-invasive monitor will be compared with the hemoglobin obtained via the complete blood
      count. Other data collected from the patient's medical record will include general
      characteristics such as demographics, medical history and hemoglobin levels obtained from
      blood draw.

    <description>Pregnant patients meeting Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines for anemia during pregnancy will be screened for participation in the study. In the outpatient setting at our institution it is standard of care that these women have complete blood counts (CBCs) drawn every 4-6 weeks. At the time of the routine blood draw, we will place the non invasive monitor on their finger to record the hemoglobin value. We will be comparing the hemoglobin values obtained from the CBC to that obtained from the non-invasive monitor.</description>
