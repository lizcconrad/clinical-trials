    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
      obtained from umbilical cords for the treatment of adults with active systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE).

      This open label trial will evaluate the safety of allogeneic MSCs for the treatment of adults
      with moderate to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MSCs will be derived
      from healthy donor umbilical cord cells and 1 dose of MSCs will be tested. MUSC has a good
      manufacturing practice (GMP) quality Clean Cell Facility to ensure the quality and safety of
      the MSCs prior to infusing into study participants. The goal of this study is to determine
      the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.

      The MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy
      donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they
      are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and
      processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in
      this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually
      located in the arm or hand. All participants will receive standard of care and their safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are cells that can be derived from umbilical cords, bone marrow, adipose tissue, and dental pulp, among other sites. MSCs have the ability to mediate a range of immuno-modulatory actions for both the innate and adaptive immune systems.</description>
