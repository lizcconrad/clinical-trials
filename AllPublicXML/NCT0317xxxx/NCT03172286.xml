  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study in the postpartum period reveals that among women who delivered vaginally and having
      perineal lesions, between 95 and 100% of them suffer from perineal pain (episiotomy, tears
      from 1st to 4th degree) to 24 hours of vaginal delivery; and between 60 and 91% 7 days after
      delivery.

      Severe pain that is not taken into account can become chronic pain. It has physical and
      psychological consequences. It is therefore essential to prevent these risks in young
      mothers.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of radiofrequency treatment on
      perineal pain postpartum, after a vaginal delivery, instrumented or not, in patients with
      perineal lesions.

      A double-blind randomized prospective single-center study will be conducted on patients
      delivering at Marseille's north hospital.

      Women who gave birth to the North hospital site, with perineal lesions (tears, episiotomy)
      will be invited to enroll in the study.

      Patients will be then randomized into two groups, one with radiofrequency treatment, the
      other without treatment with radiofrequency.

      The duration of inclusion is provided over 6 months. Each topic will be followed over a
      period of 1 month. The total study duration is 7 months.

      The expected results are a significant reduction in pain scores during the first days
      postpartum in women with perineal alteration caused by a vaginal delivery instrumented or
      not. Also an improvement in the quality of life of patients during the first days.
