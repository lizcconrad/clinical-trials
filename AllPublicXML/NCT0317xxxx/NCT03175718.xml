      Project Summary - Aggressive soft tissue cancers are commonly treated with radiation followed
      by surgery. These wounds have a very high rate of wound complications and infection (30%),
      resulting in more surgeries, longer hospital stays and complex nursing care. Previous
      research shows that negative pressure (vacuum) dressings applied to the incision at the end
      of surgery can reduce these complications. The Investigator and his team across Canada will
      perform a clinical trial comparing standard dressings to these vacuum dressings. The results
      of this study have the potential to immediately improve the quality of life of soft tissue
      cancer patients. It can also decrease the amount of time required in hospital and reduce the
      cost to the Canadian healthcare system.

      This is a Canadian multi-center randomized clinical trial lead by the Investigator from the
      Ottawa Hospital and six other orthopedic cancer centres across Canada. The Investigator and
      the team will be recruiting 248 patients diagnosed with soft tissue cancer who will be
      treated with radiation therapy followed by surgery. Each of these patients will be randomly
      assigned to receiving either 14 days of vacuum dressing (Incisional Negative Pressure Wound
      Therapy) or a standard dressing. Besides this, patients will receive as identical care as
      possible. The team will then closely follow these patients over a 4 month period to examine
      for differences in wound complications, length of hospital stay, patient quality of life,
      patient satisfaction and function. Statistical analysis will be completed by The Ottawa
      Methods Center and ethical approval will be obtained at each participating site.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Canadian multicenter superiority randomized clinical trial in patients who are scheduled to undergo surgical resection of a soft tissue sarcoma treated with either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy and a primary closure. The participants are randomized to two weeks of Incisional Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (Acelity) or conventional gauze dressing; the current standard of care.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The operative team will remain blinded to the dressing until the time of application. This trial will not be blinded to any clinical staff involved due to logistical difficulties in blinding postoperative wound dressings involving a NPWT device. The Research Coordinator/Outcomes Assessor conducting the QoL and Functional Assessment components will be blinded to which arm the participant was in.</masking_description>
