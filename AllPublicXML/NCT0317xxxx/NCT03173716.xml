  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if and how much the use of RTMPE improves a provider's
      confidence in the diagnosis they assign. This is important because the use of RTMPE may
      decrease the need for any additional invasive testing.

    <textblock>
      The finding of elevated troponins and regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography
      in the absence of other signs of acute coronary syndrome among the intensive care population
      creates a diagnostic challenge for evaluation. Sometimes these ill patients undergo invasive
      coronary angiography to rule out acute thrombosis. Real-Time Myocardial Perfusion
      Echocardiography (RTMPE) is a safe and accurate imaging modality to assess perfusion and can
      be performed in the resting state at the bedside in the intensive care unit (ICU) to help
      stratify the likelihood intracoronary thrombosis as the etiology for abnormal troponins
      and/or echocardiography. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of RTMPE on
      providers' diagnostic confidence using a 5-point Likert scale for patients that receive a
      standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) compared to patients that receive RTMPE. The
      RTMPE to assess perfusion will be added to the standard transthoracic echocardiogram in
      approximately 24 patients undergoing evaluation of myocardial ischemia in medical or surgical
      ICUs. The caring provider will complete a web-based survey regarding their confidence in the
      diagnosis prior to and after the study in both groups. The images will be interpreted by an
      experienced cardiologist and results will be made available in the medical record. The
      difference in diagnostic confidence scores will be analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
      test. The secondary aims are to assess the management and outcomes in both groups.
