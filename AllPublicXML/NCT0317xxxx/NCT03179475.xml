  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be investigating the effectiveness of oxycodone-naloxone (brand name Targin®)
      at treating chronic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury. The goal of the study is to
      compare the effectiveness of Targin® at treating chronic pain in individuals with sub-acute
      and chronic spinal cord injury compared to opioid medication that is not compounded with
      naloxone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, open-label prospective cohort study investigating Targin® for treating
      chronic pain in individuals with sub-acute and chronic spinal cord injuries. Targin® is
      currently approved for use by Health Canada for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic
      pain and will be investigated here for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain
      following spinal cord injury. The effectiveness and safety of opioid use for individuals with
      spinal cord injury has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Additionally, individuals with
      spinal cord injury using opioids may have the superimposed effect of neurogenic bowel and
      opioid induced constipation, which may cause increased frequency and severity of autonomic
      dysreflexia episodes, reduced quality of life, depressive symptoms, and discontinuation of
      opioid medication. Targin® has the potential to ameliorate these symptoms and improve
      treatment adherence in individuals with spinal cord injury.

    <description>Evaluation and assessment of pain is the primary objective. The evaluation tool &quot;Revised McGill Short Form Pain&quot; Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) is one of the most frequently used measures in clinical and research contexts to evaluate pain.
The primary outcome measure is a change from baseline in SF-MPQ-2 score at 8 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of changes in neurogenic bowel and opioid-induced constipation is a secondary objective. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction, including constipation will be assessed with the evaluation tool &quot;Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction (NBD) score&quot;.
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in NBD score at 8 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of autonomic function.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of changes in autonomic function is a secondary objective. Global autonomic function will be assessed with the neurological classification of spinal cord injury autonomic assessment form evaluation tool &quot;International Standards on documentation of remaining Autonomic Function after Spinal Cord Injury (ISAFSCI)&quot;.
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in ISAFSCI score at 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline of quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of changes in quality of life is a secondary objective. Quality of life will be assessed with the evaluation tool &quot;Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)&quot;.
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in SF-36 QOL score at 8 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in depressive symptoms.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of depressive symptoms is a secondary objective. Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the evaluation tool &quot;Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)&quot;.
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in PHQ-9 score at 8 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of opioid side effects.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of opioid side effects is a secondary objective. The measure will be incidence of side effect in those treated with the study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline of opioid side effect cognitive function.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation and assessment of opioid side effects is a secondary objective. Cognitive function is of special interest to us; we will evaluate cognitive function using the evaluation tool &quot;Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale&quot;.
The secondary outcome measure is a change from baseline in MoCA score at 8 weeks.</description>
