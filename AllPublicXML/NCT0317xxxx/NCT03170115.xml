  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefit of aspirin in cancer of the colon and rectum is already known. Recently, it was
      described its potential activity during chemoradiotherapy, with higher rate of tumor
      downstaging. Furthermore, induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation represents an
      attractive approach, with more favorable compliance and toxicity profiles. The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the efficacy of total neoadjuvant treatment and assess the efficacy and
      feasibility of aspirin use during chemoradiotherapy for high-risk rectal cancer.

      Methods: This is a randomized trial to evaluate induction treatment with XELOX and
      Capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy with or without aspirin in a high-risk population
      selected by MRI. High-risk will be defined by presence of at least one of the following
      criteria on high-resolution thin-slice MRI (3 mm): tumors extending to within 1 mm of, or
      beyond the mesorectal fascia; tumor extending 5 mm or more into perirectal fat; resectable
      cT4 tumors; lower third; nodal involvement; extramural vascular invasion. Random assignment
      of treatment will be stratified by MRI tumour regression grade. All the patients enrolled in
      the study will receive XELOX every 21 days for four cycles, unless unacceptable toxicity or
      progression is detected. After this treatment, patients will be randomized to receive
      Capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy with aspirin or placebo (Capecitabine 850 mg/mÂ² 5 days
      per week combined with radiotherapy with total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 days). After 8-10 weeks,
      they will be evaluate by MRI. Patients with incomplete clinical response will be referred to
      immediate surgery and patients with complete clinical response will be managed with &quot;watch
      and wait&quot; approach. Patients with progression disease during the treatment phase will be
      withdrawn from the study and will receive their treatment according to the investigator's
      judgment.

      The sample size was calculated according to Simon's optimal two-stage design. Accordingly, 11
      patients must be included in each group during the first stage and 20 during the second
      stage. A treatment regimen will be considered effective if more than 18 patients of the total
      31 show downstaging (final analysis), reaching 80% power with an alpha of 0.05 level of
      significance.
