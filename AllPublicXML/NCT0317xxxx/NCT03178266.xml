    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single center, study to evaluate Zip Closure Device
      in subjects undergoing knee arthroplasty. Patients identified as candidates for knee
      arthroplasty and meet the study selection criteria will be approached and considered for the
      study. Knee Arthroplasty of 40 subjects will be enrolled where 20 subjects will receive
      ZipLine and 20 subjects will receive Staples.

      Sutures and metal staples are considered standard of care methods for surgical skin closure.
      The Zip® Surgical Skin Closure device from ZipLine Medical, Inc. (Campbell, CA USA) is a more
      recent method of skin closure that utilizes skin adhesive and adjustable ratcheting straps to
      achieve and maintain tension necessary for wound closure and healing. The Zip device was
      designated Class I, 510(k) Exempt by the US FDA in 2010, and the CE Mark was affixed in 2014.

      Limited patient-reported satisfaction data exists for the Zip device as compared to staples
      and sutures, so this study will attempt to address this need.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate patient satisfaction of closure method used after
      knee joint arthroplasty. Metal staples and the Zip® Surgical Skin Closure device are approved
      methods in regular use. Selection of method is generally based on physician preference. This
      study is to determine what, if any, differences exist in patient satisfaction amongst the two
      methods
