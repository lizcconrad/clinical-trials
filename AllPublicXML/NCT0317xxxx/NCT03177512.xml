  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing the acceptability and feasibility of a highly interactive mobile
      application (app) to promote accurate risk perception and increase HIV and sexually
      transmitted infection (STI) testing and linkage to care among young men who have sex with men
      (YMSM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The app being studied, LYNX, will use an existing platform called Sex Pro, which is tool that
      provides a personalized HIV risk score, based on data from several large studies in MSM. The
      score is on a scale of 1-20, with a higher score representing a higher level of protection,
      which was highly predictive of HIV risk in a previous study in Black MSM. Sex Pro has been
      developed into a mobile app with additional features, such as a sex diary to facilitate
      accurate data collection, HIV/STI testing information and reminders, and access to home
      HIV/STI testing options and geospatial-based testing site and linkage to HIV care
      information. The app is being refined to to maximize acceptability among YMSM.

      This study is part of the iTech NIH U19, which has an overall goal to develop innovative
      technology-focused interventions addressing the HIV prevention and care continuum for youth.
