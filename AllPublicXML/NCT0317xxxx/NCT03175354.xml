      The main objectives of this study are to:

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALX-101 Gel 1.5% and 5% when applied topically
           in subjects with moderate atopic dermatitis compared with a matching ALX-101 Gel Vehicle

        -  Evaluate the dose-response relationship of ALX-101 Gel 1.5% and 5% when applied
           topically twice daily in subjects with moderate atopic dermatitis compared with a
           matching ALX-101 Gel Vehicle.
