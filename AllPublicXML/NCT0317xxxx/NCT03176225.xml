    <description>The heart defects should be totally closed by the patch. Any residual flow or leakage, measured by ultrasound, will be recorded. The percentage of the patients that show leakage post-procedure is the failure rate. The study is considered achieved its primary endpoint if the failure rate of the test device is non-inferior to the rate of the comparator device.</description>
