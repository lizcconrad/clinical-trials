  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Majority of patients with hypertension have primary hypertension (without an underlying
      cause). Secondary hypertension (due to an underlying disease) is important to recognize, as
      treatment can lead to cure of hypertension. Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common
      cause of secondary hypertension, and can be found in 5-10% of patients locally.

      PA is caused by excessive release of a hormone (aldosterone) from the adrenal glands, which
      can be unilateral (one gland) or bilateral (both glands). Distinction between two is crucial
      as unilateral disease is treated with the aim of cure by surgery, and bilateral disease is
      treated by medication.

      It has been shown that excess aldosterone has other harmful effects in addition to
      hypertension, such as directly affecting the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, diabetes and
      quality of life. This is supported by studies showing reversal of these effects after
      treatment for PA. In addition, improvements after surgery appears to be superior to medical
      treatment, although studies have found variable results.

      Hence, the investigators aim to accurately subtype patients with PA into unilateral or
      bilateral disease and study the post-treatment response after both surgery and medicine with
      regards to the effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and quality of
      life.
