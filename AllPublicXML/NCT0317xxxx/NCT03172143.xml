      The purpose of this study is to determine if taking an increased sampling of mesentery (fatty
      tissue next to the intestine) and lymph nodes at the time of the subject's ileocolic
      resection prevents a 4-6 month recurrence of Crohn's disease at the site of the new
      connection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract with an
      unknown etiology and an unknown cure. The characteristic transmural inflammation can progress
      to refractory inflammatory disease, stricturing disease, and fistulizing disease - all
      potential indications for surgery when medical management has been exhausted. An important
      tenant to remember is that surgery is not curative but is rather an adjunct to maximal
      medical therapy.

      One third of patients with CD will require a major abdominal resection within 5 years of
      their diagnosis, and two-thirds will ultimately require operative management at least once
      during the course of their disease. Unfortunately, surgery for CD is not curative and disease
      recurrence is common with 62% having endoscopic recurrence at six months, and 80% and 30% of
      patients having endoscopic and clinical recurrence, respectively, at one year. A third of
      these patients will require a re-operation at 10 years and up to 80% will require an
      additional operation by 15 years. This undoubtedly leads to an increased probability of
      malabsorption syndrome and decreased quality of life.

      A significant volume of research has been conducted in attempt to determine how to prevent
      postoperative recurrence of CD following an ileocolic resection. Some studies have focused on
      the timing of resuming postoperative medical therapy. Others have looked at surgical
      technique at the time of ileocolic resection including anatomic configuration of the
      anastomosis and performing a stapled versus handsewn anastomosis.

      There is recent evidence to suggest that the mesentery is actively involved in the ongoing
      disease process. The investigators plan to investigate if taking additional mesentery affects
      postoperative recurrence to support these findings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Residents of the United States

          2. Isolated ileocolic Crohn's disease without evidence of perforation

          3. Concurrent therapies with corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs,
             thiopurines, methotrexate (MTX), antibiotics, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
             therapy are permitted

          4. All patients should have undergone a colonoscopy and CT enterography in last 3 months
             to assess severity of disease

          5. Have no contraindications to magnetic resonance (MR) evaluations: e.g. pacemaker or
             magnetically active metal fragments, claustrophobia
