  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, non-randomized, controlled, single-center study, to evaluate the efficacy of
      applied nominal electrical stimulation parameters given to premature ejaculation (PE)
      patients in order to prolong the ejaculatory latency time which will eventually increase the
      quality of their sexual life.
