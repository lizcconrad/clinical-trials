  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacogenetic (PG) observation
      study, including the PK/PD/PG relationship, in fentanyl and clonidine administered for
      analgesia and sedation to term newborn asphyxiated infants receiving hypothermic treatment in
      the NICU.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients that are admitted to the study neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) for
      hypothermic treatment due to perinatal asphyxia are potential study patients, and their
      parents will be asked for consent.

      The patient will be treated according to clinical guidelines and will be included in the
      study if in need for fentanyl and clonidine according to clinical judgment (HIE and pain
      scores) and as decided by the responsible clinical doctor. The dosing and administration of
      the drugs will be implemented according to an algorithm based on pain scoring results.

      Apart from extra blood sampling, the bedside monitoring, investigations
      (electroencephalography (EEG), echocardiography (ECG), ultrasound of the brain and magnetic
      resonance imaging, (MRI)) and follow-up (neurologic examination) are the same as for all
      infants receiving hypothermia according to national and international guidelines. A brief
      standardised pain stimulation will be performed as part of the pain and stress assessment.

      In total 50 infants will be included.
