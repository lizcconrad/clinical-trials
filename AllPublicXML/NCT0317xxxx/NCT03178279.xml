  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People suffering from psychotic illnesses (e.g. schizophrenia) have poorer physical health
      than the general population. The reasons include a lack of service user motivation to attend
      physical health checks and the tendency of health professionals to focus mainly on the mental
      disorder thus delaying the detection of physical health conditions.

      Identifying people who have physical health needs is increasingly recognised as a priority.
      The investigators have developed a Physical Health Plan (PHP) which is completed by service
      users and identifies areas of physical health need. An action plan is then completed by the
      service user and care co-ordinator to address these issues.

      The PHP is designed to be very simple to use and there will be 3 versions, 1. paper version,
      2. 1 version implemented via the 'IMPARTS' computerised 'tablet' based system that has been
      separately evaluated (REC Ref 12/SC/0422) and 3. 1 version on an iPad via the MHL2 system via
      Mindwaves.

      The investigators wish to pilot the use of this PHP in two community teams in the South
      London and Maudsley (SLaM) Trust. The pilot will be done in three stages.

      Stage One: The investigators will undertake an initial qualitative study to refine the
      process of using the PHP using focus group consultations with staff and service users.

      Stage Two: The investigators will then undertake a six month study to evaluate the uptake and
      use of the PHP. This will involve collecting data on how many people complete the PHP and
      what actions are taken following the completion of the PHP.

      Stage Three: At the end of this six month period the investigators will undertake qualitative
      interviews with a selection of service users and staff to understand their experience of
      using the PHP.

      The investigators hope to be able to use the results of this pilot study to introduce the use
      of the PHP into routine care.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will take place in 2 community mental health teams and have 3 main stages. Stage 1: The investigators will undertake focus groups with service users and staff to test out the assumptions in the Theory of Change. Stage 2: The PHP will be available as a paper version and on iPad and smartphone. Each team will be asked to work with all of the people on their caseload to complete the PHP. Service users will be encouraged to complete the PHP whilst waiting for their appointment with their care co-ordinator. The completed PHP will then be emailed to the service user and to their care co-ordinator and they will then be asked to develop an action plan to address any gaps in the completed PHP. Each action plan and the progress made with the action plan will be recorded. This exploratory trial will last six months. Stage 3 The investigators will evaluate the experience of using the PHP using interviews with a random selection of service users and clinical staff.</intervention_model_description>
