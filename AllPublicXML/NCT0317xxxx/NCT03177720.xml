  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will determine the difference of pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and
      imipenem between healthy volunteers and intensive care patients suffering from pneumonia in
      plasma and at the target site - lung - using bronchoalveolar lavage. As additional aspect the
      feasibility of combining microdosing of C14 ciprofloxacin with microdialysis, saliva sampling
      and bronchoalveolar lavage is studied by comparing pharmacokinetics of microdose and
      macrodose.

             childhood

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs within 7 days or 10 times the

             reactions including psychological or neurological symptoms or signs, or anaphylactic
             shock following administration of any medicine.

          -  Allergy to or any contraindication against the active or inactive ingredients in the

          -  Smoker

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Participation in a trial with any drug within 30 days or five half-lives (whichever is
             longer) before the start of the study.
