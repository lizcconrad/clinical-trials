  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will determine the difference of pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and
      imipenem between healthy volunteers and intensive care patients suffering from pneumonia in
      plasma and at the target site - lung - using bronchoalveolar lavage. As additional aspect the
      feasibility of combining microdosing of C14 ciprofloxacin with microdialysis, saliva sampling
      and bronchoalveolar lavage is studied by comparing pharmacokinetics of microdose and
      macrodose.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs within 7 days or 10 times the

             shock following administration of any medicine.
