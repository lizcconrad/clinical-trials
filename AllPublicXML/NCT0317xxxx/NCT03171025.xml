    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured only in subjects who do not have local recurrence requiring radical cystectomy. The endpoint of FFSIB will be determined based on disease recurrence date defined as the time between the start date of study treatment (nivolumab) and the date of first recurrence or non-cancer related death.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the rate of distant failure free survival at two years in subjects with intact bladder and those who discontinue study to undergo salvage cystectomy. This will be measured in subjects who do and do not have local recurrence requiring radical cystectomy during study treatment.

             or T1 with N+), who are not candidates for radical cystectomy.

               -  Patients may have undergone partial cystectomy for removal of bladder tumor prior
                  to chemoradiation. Patients who have down-staged from M1 disease to M0 with prior
                  platinum-based chemotherapy will be eligible.

               -  Staging is determined prior to chemoradiation

          -  Patients must have histologically proven primary carcinoma of the bladder or urethra
             or lower ureter (adenocarcinoma or transitional or squamous-cell carcinoma)

          -  Tumor tissue from the most recently resected site of disease (preferable) or from the
             transurethral resection that yielded the initial muscle invasive diagnosis must be
             provided for biomarker correlative analyses. Enrollment is permitted if adequate
             archived tissue is unavailable.

          -  Patients must have received systemic radiosensitizing chemotherapy with definitive
             pelvic radiation therapy. Patients may have received partial amount of chemotherapy
             and radiation (both) to be eligible.
