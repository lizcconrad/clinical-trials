  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We explored the meaning and outcomes of a 4-month program designed to build capacity of
      school personnel in implementing evidence-based strategies for reducing stress and promoting
      mental well-being among students in school settings. A one-group (N 93) mixed-methods design
      using a pretest-posttest survey and qualitative analysis of their written reactions was used
      to explore the meaning and outcomes of the Calm Moments Cards program.

      In order to explore the effectiveness of the Calm Moments Cards program on school personnel's
      ability to recognize signs of stress and the implementation of embedded strategies to reduce
      stress and enhance emotional well-being, we conduct a mixed-methods research study using
      pretest-posttest surveys (assessing knowledge, beliefs, and actions) and qualitative analysis
      of written reflections about the meaning and use of the Calm Moments Cards. The focus of the
      intervention is on prevention of stress and anxiety based on situational stressors (e.g.
      taking a test, completing an assignment) so that students can focus on and succeed in doing
      their schoolwork. Occupational therapy practitioners oriented school personnel to the signs
      of stress and the use of the 17 Calm Moments Cards using a 1 hour inservice. This was
      followed by informal coaching to foster implementation.
