  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of conducting a pilot randomized
      controlled trial comparing mindfulness-based stress reduction with the health enhancement
      program on symptoms of urinary urge incontinence in older adult women, and to establish
      preliminary efficacy of these two approaches on symptoms of urinary urge incontinence.

      The overarching goal of this research is to evaluate potential treatment options for older
      women with symptoms of urinary urge incontinence, with a specific focus on Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction, a promising therapeutic approach in preliminary studies and one
      increasingly used to treat symptoms associated with brain-visceral interactions. Feasibility
      and preliminary efficacy will be tested in two randomized study arms: a Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction intervention group and a Health Enhancement Program intervention comparison
      group.

      This research study will explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of treating urinary
      urge incontinence in older adult women with mindfulness-based stress reduction in comparison
      to the health enhancement program through a randomized controlled pilot study. Feasibility
      determinants will include both research feasibility (recruitment, retention, treatment
      fidelity) and intervention feasibility (acceptability, tolerability, treatment adherence).
      Clinical outcomes to evaluate preliminary intervention efficacy will include severity of
      urinary urge incontinence symptoms, bother of urinary urge incontinence symptoms, perceived
      stress, and perceived level of self-efficacy of self-management of urinary urge incontinence
      symptoms. Preliminary efficacy of the intervention will also be evaluated with the Patient
      Global Impression of Improvement, a process measure that rates the patient's &quot;response of a
      condition to a therapy&quot; (Ryan, n.d., p. 1).

      This combined pilot feasibility study and randomized controlled trial will evaluate specific
      factors crucial to the success of a large trial to evaluate the effect of Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction on urinary urge incontinence in older adult women. Moore (2011) recommended
      that the pilot study design parallel the future larger study, particularly when evaluating
      feasibility in the pilot study. The capacity for hypothesis testing, or establishing causal
      inference is limited in a pilot study due to insufficient power; however, the information
      from efficacy testing is vital in informing future larger scale clinical trials. This study
      will serve as a necessary step for the development of effectiveness trials of
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction in treatment of urinary urge incontinence in older adult
      women by informing and guiding evaluation, implementation, and dissemination.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following eligibility criteria must be met for the potential participant to be
        considered for enrollment.

          -  The study is enrolling older adult women, with urinary urge incontinence.

          -  They cannot be currently treating their urinary urge incontinence with medication as
             this will confound results.

          -  Women who have attempted more extreme treatments and are still experiencing urinary
             urge incontinence will not be considered as potential participants, as it is unlikely
             that mindfulness-based stress reduction would treat urinary urge incontinence that is
             refractory to that degree.

          -  Participants must be English speaking, as the interventions and homework will be
             delivered in English.

          -  postmenopausal women

          -  Urge predominant urinary incontinence, defined as score of ≥ 3 (moderate to severe
             urinary incontinence) on the Incontinence Severity Index

          -  Urge predominant urinary incontinence as determined by question 3 on the 3
             Incontinence Questions. The 3 Incontinence Questions has been shown to be a quick and
             accurate way of diagnosing stress, urge or mixed incontinence in most cases

          -  Has experienced urinary urge incontinence symptoms for at least three months

          -  Committed to attend 8 weekly sessions and one half day retreat between weeks 6 and 7

          -  No pharmacologic therapy for urinary urge incontinence within three weeks of
             enrollment and no plan to initiate such medications during the 8 week active treatment

          -  If on hormone therapy or vaginal estrogen, plan to remain on it for the duration of
             the study; if not on it, no plan to initiate

          -  No previous intradetrusor Botox injection for urinary urge incontinence and no plan to
             receive it during the intervention

          -  No previous neurostimulation for urinary urge incontinence and no plan to receive it
             during the intervention English speaking

          -  A score of &gt;24 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following exclusions are applied, as they could seriously limit participation or
        confound participant response to the intervention:

          -  Predominantly stress, mixed, or other type of incontinence as determined by question 3
             on the 3 Incontinence Questions

          -  Currently taking medications for Alzheimer's disease or other dementias; these
             medications could interfere with their participation

          -  Known neurologic disease acknowledged to impact bladder function including Parkinson's
             disease, spinal cord injury, or stroke affecting urinary control; these diseases
             provide cause for urinary urge incontinence and as such the participant would be
             unlikely to benefit from the intervention

          -  Current symptomatic urinary tract infection that has not resolved prior to the start
             of intervention

          -  Current bladder infection that has not resolved prior to the start of intervention

          -  Use of an assistive device for ambulation (such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair) and
             feels that difficulties with bladder management are related to the slowed time in
             visiting the restroom (&quot;Was urinary urge incontinence a problem before you began using
             the assistive device?&quot;)

          -  Functionally incontinent, in other words, having a mental or physical condition that
             prevents a person from visiting the restroom in time

          -  Ever diagnosed with interstitial cystitis

          -  Self-report of vaginal bulge protruding outside of the vagina

          -  Past participation in a formal program of mindfulness-based stress reduction

          -  Substantial, uncorrected hearing loss

          -  Substantial, uncorrected vision loss

          -  Limitations that preclude completing study questionnaires or surveys, such as
             difficulties with reading and writing or a cognitive impairment
