  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few patients recover full hand dexterity after an acquired brain injury such as stroke.
      Repetitive somatosensory electrical stimulation (SES) is a promising method to promote
      recovery of hand function. However, studies using SES have largely focused on gross motor
      function; it remains unclear if it can modulate distal hand functions such as finger
      individuation. The specific goal of this study was to monitor the effects of SES on
      individuation as well as on cortical oscillations measured using EEG, with the additional
      goal of identifying neurophysiological biomarkers.

      Participants with a history of acquired brain injury and distal upper limb motor impairments
      will receive a single two-hour session of SES using transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation. Pre- and post-intervention assessments consist of the Action Research Arm Test
      (ARAT), finger fractionation, pinch force, and the modified Ashworth scale (MAS), along with
      resting-state EEG monitoring. We will assess for any association between SES and changes in
      motor outcome as measured using the ARAT, MAS and finger fractionation. In addition, EEG
      power analyses will be performed to determine if there are any differences between SES
      responders vs. non-responders.

    <description>TENS is performed using a commercially available device (ProStim, Alimed Inc, Dedham, Massachusetts, USA). One pair of 2 x 3.5 inches rectangular electrodes (Vermed ChroniCare TENS Electrodes, Vermed, Buffalo, NY, USA) are placed to simultaneously stimulate both median and ulnar nerves at the wrist, while a second pair of round 2 inch diameter electrodes are used to stimulate the radial nerve on the forearm. Bursts of electrical stimulation at 10 Hz (100 microsecond pulse width duration) are delivered to all nerves simultaneously for 2 hours.</description>
