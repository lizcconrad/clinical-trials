      Obesity is measured by Body Mass Index.it is calculated by dividing a person's weight in
      kilograms by the square of height in meters. For children and adolescent. Overweight is
      defined as Body Mass Index is &lt;85th percentile &lt;95th percentile but obesity is defined as
      body mass index at or above the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and
      sex the increasing in body mass index mass may affect auditory function Directly as adipose
      tissue secretes hormones and cytokines, proinflammatory cytokines lead to release of
      obesity-induced inflammation which may directly contribute to end-organ damage Also,
      Adiponectin, which is thought to have anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects, and
      associated with favorable lipoprotein profile, independent of BMI and insulin resistance, low
      plasma concentrations of adiponectin have been associated with obesity in children. In
      adults, low level of adiponectin has been associated with elevated high-frequency thresholds.

      Indirectly, by obesity comorbidities including Hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      Dyslipidemia , Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiovascular Diseases
