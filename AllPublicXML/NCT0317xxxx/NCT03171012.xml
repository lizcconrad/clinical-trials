  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke hemiparesis causes sequelae in the limbs and also in the trunk and abdomen
      structures. The level of physical activity decreases and cardiorespiratory training(CRT) is
      indicated to this population to improve the functions of several systems (respiratory,
      cardiovascular, muscular). The application of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facility(PNF)
      would imply in the awareness and greater harmony of the functions performed by the trunk of
      this individual. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of respiratory and
      trunk characteristics of the PNF associated with Cardiorespiratory training in quality of
      life, gait, distance traveled, peak oxygen consumption, respiratory muscle strength, thoracic
      cavity volumes, mobility and diaphragmatic thickness of individuals with post stroke.

      Clinical, randomized, blind and allocation. Forty individuals post-stroke will be randomized
      into four groups: Experimental Lower Limbs(submitted to LL's CRT associated with PNF); Group
      control Lower Limbs (submitted LL's CRT associated with respiration). Experimental Upper
      Limbs (submitted to UP's CRT associated with PNF) and Group control Upper Limbs (submitted to
      UP's CRT associated with respiration). Individuals will be assessed before and immediately
      after 20 program sessions and one month after the end of treatment. Outcome measures shall be
      measured by: Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale; Inertial gear sensor; Maximum volume of
      oxygen; Spirometry and manovacuometry; Ultrasound of mobility and thickness diaphragmatic;
      compartmental volumes of the rib cage with opto plethysmography electronics.

      For the four groups, the treatment program will have the total duration of one hour
      including: ten minutes of stretching (five minutes before and five minutes after the
      therapeutic intervention), ten minutes of rest and 40 minutes of aerobic treatment associated
      to PNF or to respiration, being performed in 20 Sessions three times a week. The order of
      application of the techniques will be random, being held until the end of the intervention
      period. For therapy with the CRT used the cycle ergometer for lower or upper limbs, Based on
      the criteria of the American College of Sports Medicine and monitoring constant blood
      pressure, oxygen saturation and perceived exertion. The PNF patterns will be performed in
      seated, dorsal, ventral and side. The breathing exercises will be performed at the same time
      and in the positions of the PNF. To analyze the data and to achieve the objectives
      appropriate statistical tests shall be used, according to the normality of and
      characteristics of the variables.
