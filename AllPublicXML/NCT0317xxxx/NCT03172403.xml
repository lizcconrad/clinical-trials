  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia is responsible for the death of approximately 20% of patients. Myostatin is a
      master negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. If the role of myostatin in cancer
      cachexia is now well established in murine models, no study has focused on muscle expression
      of Myostatin in relation to the degree of cachexia. the hypothesize is that muscle Myostatin
      a biological marker of cachexia in patients with colon cancer. The main objective is to
      compare skeletal muscle Myostatin messenger RiboNucleic Acid (mRNA) level as a function of
      cachexia in colon cancer patients. Myostatin messenger RiboNucleic Acid (mRNA) level will be
      determined in a muscle sample taken during the resection under general anaesthesia. Skeletal
      muscle index will be determined before surgery, 3 and 6 months after surgery. Muscle strength
      of the lower and upper limbs will be determined before resection, at 1 month, 3 months and 6
      months postoperatively. Blood sampling will also be performed on these 4 occasions.
