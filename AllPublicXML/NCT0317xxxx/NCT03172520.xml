  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the safety of the Medtronic automatic periodic
      stimulating (APS) Electrode Stimulator during a parotidectomy and potentially prevent
      post-operative facial nerve weakness, which is a relatively common outcome after parotid
      surgery.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase the investigators will use the
      same monitoring system currently used during parotidectomy and requires placement of the APS
      electrode as the only additional piece of equipment. During this phase, the investigators
      will record intraoperative EMG data generated by the monitoring system as well as document
      intra-operative maneuvers that precede adverse EMG events.

      In the second phase of the study the investigators aim to allow the surgeon to alter his or
      her techniques, with the information provided by the APS electrode, to reverse adverse EMG
      changes.
