  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and/or bad) Pirfenidone combined
      with standard first-line chemotherapy will have on you and non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). The investigational drug Pirfenidone is being combined with standard chemotherapy in
      participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Pirfenidone is approved to treat
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) but it isn't currently approved to treat non-small cell
      lung cancer.

      This study will be conducted in two phases: 1) a Phase I dose escalation study with a
      Standard 3+3 design to determine the recommended Phase II dose and 2) a Phase Ib expansion
      study to evaluate early signs of efficacy and obtain more toxicity data. The Phase I trial
      will be a single center, dose-escalation study of pirfenidone combined with standard
      chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC, followed by a Phase Ib trial to
      determine early clinical efficacy [objective tumor response rate (ORR)] and toxicity data.

    <measure>Phase 1: Recommended Phase 1b Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post final enrollment in phase 1 - up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recommended Phase 1b dose of Pirfenidone in combination with standard first-line chemotherapy, based on Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) from phase 1. Dose-limiting Toxicity: The occurrence of any of the following toxicities will be considered a DLT, if judged by the Investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug administration, referring to grade 3-5 adverse events as listed in the protocol document.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 1b: Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post final enrollment in phase 1b - up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1: Complete Response (CR) plus Partial Response (PR). Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm (&lt;1 cm). Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS according to RECIST 1.1: defined as the time from study registration to progression or death, whichever comes first. PFS for patients last known to be alive and progression free will be censored at the date of last disease assessment. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm).
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from study registration or death due to any cause. OS for patients last known to be alive will be censored at the date of last contact.</description>
