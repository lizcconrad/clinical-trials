  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that DBSF will be safe whether it is given when subjects are
      not experiencing seizures (Interictal Period A) or experiencing active seizures
      (ictal/peri-ictal Period B), and that Pharmacokinetic (PK) is not different during or in
      between the seizures.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the comparative pharmacokinetics of DBSF in
      subjects with epilepsy under conditions where (a) they are not experiencing seizures
      (interictal Period A), and (b) when they are experiencing active seizures (ictal/peri-ictal
      Period B).

      Secondary objectives include (a) evaluate the safety/tolerability of DBSF following single
      dose administration in subjects with epilepsy, (b) Evaluate the usability of DBSF in Period A
      and Period B.

      This is a multi-center, open label, single-dose study that consists of 4 periods: Screening
      Period, Treatment Period A (interictal pharmacokinetic evaluation), Treatment Period B
      (ictal/peri-ictal pharmacokinetic evaluation), and Follow-up Period.

      For the purposes of this study, the peri-ictal state is defined as the subject's immediate
      post-ictal state following a generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizure or focal seizure with
      impaired awareness up to 5 minutes following the last clonic jerk. This may also be defined
      as less than 5 minutes after cessation of the seizure (GTC or focal seizure with impaired
      awareness) as verified via EEG.

      Subjects will have blood PK samples drawn at various time points and sent to the Central
      laboratory for Pharmacokinetic Assessments
