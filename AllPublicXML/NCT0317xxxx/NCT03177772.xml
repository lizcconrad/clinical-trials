  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are adapting Complicated Grief Group Therapy (CGGT) for soon-to-be bereaved
      dementia caregivers at risk for complicated grief—Pre-Loss Group Therapy (PLGT) to facilitate
      healthy death preparedness and eventual bereavement. This will be the first known application
      of proven therapeutic strategies to address complicated grief applied to high-risk dementia
      caregivers prior to care recipient death to mitigate complicated grief. If proven to be
      effective in attenuating poor bereavement outcomes, PLGT could be translated into
      comprehensive caregiver support programs and delivered to active caregivers of living persons
      with dementia at risk for complicated grief through community-based caregiver support groups.

      In the investigators previous evaluation of Complicated Grief Group Therapy (CGGT) in
      bereaved dementia caregivers (2014-NIRG-305569), CGGT was administered to participants in a
      prospective, randomized-controlled trial. Participants in 5 treatment groups confirmed
      clinically significant reduction in complicated grief on the Inventory of Complicated Grief.
      In that study, intervention elements suitable for adaption in a preventative care approach
      were identified. The investigators are adapting these elements of CGGT for soon-to-be
      bereaved dementia caregivers at risk for complicated grief—Pre-Loss Group Therapy (PLGT) to
      facilitate healthy death preparedness and eventual bereavement.

      Specific Aims: 1) Assess preparedness for death and grief of bereaved and soon-to-be bereaved
      caregivers. 2) Adapt CGGT treatment elements into a manualized pre-loss preparedness group
      psychotherapy—(PLGT)—for dementia caregivers at risk for complicated grief. 3) Implement and
      evaluate three PLGT cohorts (NTotal = 40) in three long-term care facilities with family
      caregivers at-risk for complicated grief whose care recipient has a life expectancy of 6
      months or less and resides in a long-term care facility.

These activities include elements of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy and prolonged exposure therapy.</description>
