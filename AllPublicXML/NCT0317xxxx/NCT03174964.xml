  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility and miscarriage ordinary events in reproductive failure in humans, as are
      affected one couple in every six couples of reproductive age and abortion is including in
      approximately 15-20% of all pregnancies. Over the decades since the beginning of Assisted
      Reproductive Technology (ART) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy rate still remains
      below 30% and Recurrent Implantation Failure in one of the most important limiting factor is
      the assisted reproductive techniques. According to studies conducted in recent years one of
      the most important mechanisms of implantation failure is maternal immune system because the
      fetus as an allograft toxic (Semi allograft) to the mother. Studies have demonstrated that
      ratio of Th1 to Th2 cells increase in maternal peripheral blood cells can be directly
      associated with implantation failure. It also increases the number of natural killer (NK)
      cells and Th17 cells and their cytokines in peripheral blood of mother and is also associated
      with an increased risk of infertility. Several studies have also shown that the fertile
      persons in compare to infertile have increased amount of Treg cells and inhibitory cytokines
      associated with it. The studies have shown that if patients are properly selected RIF and
      placed under appropriate immunotherapy approaches it will be seen a significant increase in
      fertility. In previous years, followed by the production of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
      and determine its effect on immune suppression, IVIg uses for the treatment of various
      diseases such as thrombocytopenic purpura, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Kawasaki disease and
      Myasthenia gravis. It is also valuable drug for the treatment of patients with infertility
      problems have also been used but still remains how well the drug and its mechanism of action
      are unknown. Probably one of the mechanisms of IVIg is its effect in suppressing the activity
      of NK cells. Likely IVIg cause to increase Cluster of Differentiation 94 (CD94) molecule as
      an inhibitor molecule on the NK cells and reduced the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. So
      because of reduce the cytotoxic activity of NK cells by IVIg in patients with RIF injection
      increases the likelihood of successful implantation. Previous studies have shown that the
      incidence of genetic abnormalities in children who have received immunosuppressive drugs such
      as IVIg like normal people and normal society. In this study we used IVIg before IVF to
      suppress the immune system in patients with immunological causes of RIF and the results will
      be compared with a control group that did not receive any type of drug.
