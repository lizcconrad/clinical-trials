  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is an important clinical problem in primary care and sub-specialty practice.
      Besides the distress experienced by patients with chronic cough, significant healthcare
      resources are expended to understand the role of gastroesophageal reflux, asthma and
      post-nasal drip in understanding their contribution to cough.

      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in patients with chronic cough. More importantly,
      treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has led to improvement in
      cough for chronic cough patients. Mechanisms by which OSA therapy with CPAP can improve cough
      includes beneficial effects on reflux and airway inflammation.

      The aim of this study is to definitively establish that CPAP therapy for treatment of OSA in
      chronic cough patients improves cough. While these patients with chronic cough are not
      routinely screened and treated for OSA, this study aims to evaluate these chronic cough
      patients with screening questionnaires for OSA and if necessary with polysomnography and
      randomize them to either CPAP or sham CPAP for 6 weeks.

    <measure>Change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will complete the Leicester Cough Questionnaire at the baseline and 6-week visits. The Leicester Cough Questionnaire comprises 19 items, which assess symptoms, or the impact of symptoms, over the last 2 weeks on a seven-point Likert scale. Scores in three domains (physical, psychological and social) are calculated as a mean for each domain (range 1 to 7). A total score (range 3 to 21) is also calculated by adding the domain scores together. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. The change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire score will be compared between the Straight CPAP and Sham CPAP groups</description>

    <measure>Change in Cough Frequency</measure>

    <description>Subjects will complete the GERD-QoL questionnaire at the baseline and 6-week visits. The GERD-QoL comprises 15 items on a five-point Likert scale; lowest possible score (0) = no symptoms, greatest possible score (75) = worst symptoms. The change in GERD-QoL score will be compared between the Straight CPAP and Sham CPAP groups</description>
