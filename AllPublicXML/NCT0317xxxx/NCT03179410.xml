  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of avelumab in patients with
      metastatic neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer. Eligible men will be started on avelumab
      every 2 weeks and will stay on therapy until progression or intolerable side effects. The
      central hypothesis is that PD-L1 inhibition with avelumab will be efficacious based on
      radiographic responses in a subset of men with metastatic neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer
      and be reasonably well tolerated, meeting criteria for further study in larger phase 2 and 3
      trials based on meeting pre-specified efficacy rates and prolonged PFS in some men.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer, based on histology OR based on clinical
             presentation as defined by meeting one of the two below criteria. All subjects must
             submit their primary tumor or metastatic biopsy pathology specimens to the Duke Cancer
             Institute where they will be centrally reviewed by Duke Pathology. Central Duke
             pathologic review is not required for screening but rather for confirmation of
             histologic subtype. Local pathologic review is sufficient for eligibility
             determination.

               1. Criterion 1: Presence of 1 of 3 histologically proven diagnoses: 1) Primary small
                  cell carcinoma of the prostate, defined by classic histologic features such as
                  small tumor cells with scanty cytoplasm, darkly stained nuclei with homogeneous
                  chromatin pattern. The tumor cells do not form glandular structure but grow as
                  solid sheets with frequent mitotic figures and necrosis; 2) Intermediate atypical
                  carcinoma of the prostate, which has histologic features distinct from small cell
                  carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. The tumor grows as solid sheets or vague glandular
                  structures. The tumor cells have moderate amounts of cytoplasm and centrally
                  located, round and regular nuclei with fine, granular and homogeneous chromatin.
                  Mitosis and necrosis are absent; 3) mixed histology tumors of the prostate,
                  containing both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine or small cell components.

               2. Criterion 2: Presence of histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate
                  without any sign of neuroendocrine or small cell histology that is
                  radiographically progressing despite castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/mL)
                  with the following poor risk features:

             i. Prior progression despite therapy with either abiraterone acetate and/or
             enzalutamide ii. At least one of the following: 1) Liver metastases; 2) Bulky
             radiographic progression (≥2 cm short axis lymph nodes or ≥1 cm long axis visceral
             metastases) combined with low serum PSA (&lt;10ng/mL); 3) High serum LDH (&gt;1X upper limit
             of normal).

          2. Measurable disease as defined by modified PCWG3 using iRECIST criteria

          3. Available tumor tissue for pathologic review and correlative studies. Tumor tissue
             (localized or metastatic) does not need to be received but rather identified and
             available (slides and/or blocks) to be sent to Duke.

          4. Documented progressive metastatic CRPC based on at least one of the following
             criteria:

               1. PSA progression defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in
                  the absolute value of at least 2.0 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level
                  with a minimum of a 1 week interval and a minimum PSA of 2.0 ng/mL. Note: If
                  confirmed rise is the only indication of progression, a minimal starting value of
                  1.0 ng/mL is acceptable, unless pure small-cell carcinoma.

               2. Soft-tissue progression based on new lesions or growth of existing soft tissue
                  metastases.

               3. Progression of bone disease (evaluable disease) or (new bone lesion(s)) by bone
                  scan.

          5. Castrate levels of serum total testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl) OR ongoing documented ADT
             unless pure small cell prostate cancer is present.

          6. Previous use of radiation to metastatic site(s) at any time prior to enrollment is
             allowed, provided that this site is not the only measurable disease present or unless
             that solitary site is progressing following radiation.

          7. Patients should have received at least one line of approved chemotherapy and/or
             hormonal therapy

          8. Previous cytotoxic chemotherapy including cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin,
             etoposide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and gemcitabine is allowed, up to 3 prior regimens.

          9. Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher.

         10. Acceptable initial laboratory values within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 according to the
             below table:

             ANC ≥ 1500/µl Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL(prior transfusion permitted) Platelet count ≥
             100,000/µl Creatinine ≤ 2.0 x the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) OR
             creatinine clearance &gt;30 ml/min Potassium ≥ 3.5 mmol/L (within institutional normal
             range) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (unless documented Gilbert's disease) SGOT (AST) ≤ 2.5x
             ULN, or &lt;5x ULN in patients with documented liver metastases SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5x ULN or
             &lt;5x ULN in patients with documented liver metastases

         11. Age &gt;18

         12. Highly effective contraception for male subjects with childbearing potential
             throughout the study and for at least 60 days after last avelumab treatment
             administration if the risk of conception exists.

         13. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the
             release of personal health information.

         14. Life expectancy of over 3 months as determined by treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior usage of PD-1 inhibitors, programed-death ligand 1 and/or 2 inhibitors, CTLA-4
             inhibitors including but not limited to ipilimumab, nivolumab, avelumab, durvalumab,
             tremelimumab, and pembrolizumab.

          3. Previous malignancy within 3 years other than non-melanomatous skin cancers or cancers
             of low malignant potential such as non-invasive urothelial carcinoma.

          4. Any other on-going chemotherapeutic, biologic, radiopharmaceutical, or investigational
             agent currently or within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1.

          5. Prior use of abiraterone and other hormonal agents used to treat prostate cancer are

             initiation.

          6. Current usage of immunosuppressant medication except for a) intranasal, inhaled, and
             topical corticosteroids and b) systemic corticosteroids equivalent to ≤ 10 mg/day of
             prednisone, c) steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. CT scan
             premedication).

          7. Prior organ transplantation including allogeneic stem-cell transplants.

          8. Active bacterial or viral infections requiring systemic therapy.

         11. Known prior hypersensitivity to the investigational product or any component
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
             antibodies.

             disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including recent
             (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.
