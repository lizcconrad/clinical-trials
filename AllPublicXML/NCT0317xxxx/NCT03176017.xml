    <textblock>
      In this study, Investigators planned to compare Holmium Laser ejaculatory sparing and
      non-ejaculatory sparing (conventional) TUIP using both subjective and objective assessment
      tools for the degree of deobstruction.

      Furthermore, the impact of both techniques on ejaculation and its secondary effect on orgasm
      perception and different domains of sexual function will be thoroughly assessed.

      Benign prostatic enlargement is one of the most prevalent disorders in aging men and may
      develop into benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) causing a significant effect on the quality
      of life (QoL). Clinical manifestations of BPO include a variety of lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS) that can be classified into voiding symptoms or storage symptoms. Different
      modalities of treatment for BPO are available, including lifestyle modifications, medical
      treatment and surgical or minimally invasive surgical techniques that include transurethral
      incision of the prostate (TUIP), transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and laser
      prostatectomy.

      Ejaculation is one of the fundamental domains of male sexual functions. It is well
      established that ejaculation disturbances, either anejaculation or loss of antegrade
      ejaculation, are almost inevitable adverse effects of prostate surgery especially TURP. A
      problem which also associates prolonged use of α-adrenoreceptors blockers. Such adverse event
      can be the reason why patients may choose to avoid surgical treatment.

      This ejaculatory dysfunction can be attributed, according to current theory of ejaculation,
      to the loss of bladder neck function after resection. However, many recent studies
      demonstrated that bladder neck closure may not have such important role in maintaining
      antegrade ejaculation. Recent techniques had been developed to preserve ejaculation including
      ejaculatory hood sparing technique, prostatic urethral lift and the Rezum System (convective
      water vapor energy). Ejaculatory hood was defined as paracollicular and supracollicular
      tissue present 1 cm proximal to the verumontanum. Hermabessiere et al. used dynamic
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) findings after TURP to demonstrate that the ejaculate is
      directly expelled into the infra-montanal urethra with a direct closure mechanism of the
      paracollicular and supracollicular tissue without previous ballooning of the prostatic
      urethra.

      In 2016 European Urology Association guidelines, TUIP is recommended (level of evidence: 1a &amp;
      grade of recommendation: A) as the surgical therapy of choice for men with prostate sizes &lt;
      30 mL, without a middle lobe, and bothersome moderate-to-severe LUTS secondary to BPO. The
      drawback of classical bilateral bladder neck incision is the postoperative retrograde
      ejaculation that may occur in 27-100% of patients having the procedure.

      In younger patients who wanted to preserve ejaculation, Orandi who first describes the TUIP
      technique modified it by performing superficial incisions limited to the prostatic urethra
      without extension to the bladder neck. This amendment was subsequently embraced by other
      authors who performed short and shallow incisions at 5 and 7 o'clock, located exclusively at
      the level of the prostatic urethra and reaching the fibrous capsule. This provided a
      significant increase of the maximum urinary flow rate and an important reduction of symptoms,
      while maintaining normal ejaculation in most patients. By using a neodymium-doped yttrium
      aluminium garnet (Nd):YAG laser Yang et al., modify the Turner-Warwick technique by the
      incision starting near the ureteral orifice and carried it downward to about 0.5-1.0 cm
      proximal to the verumontanum. During the 2-year follow-up, mean International Prostate
      Symptom Score (I-PSS) decreased and mean Peak urinary flow rate (Q-max) increased
      significantly. Mean International index of erectile function (IIEF) scores did not change
      significantly with all patients reported antegrade ejaculation. Successful overall outcome
      was achieved in 84.6%.
