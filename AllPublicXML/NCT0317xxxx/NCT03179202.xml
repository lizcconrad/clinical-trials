  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of electrical
      stimulation (low levels of electricity) on low back pain. This study involves a Peripheral
      Nerve Stimulation (PNS) system. The System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the
      muscles in the low back. The System includes up to four small wires (called &quot;Leads&quot;) that are
      placed through the skin into the muscles in the low back. It also includes up to four devices
      worn on the body that deliver stimulation (called Stimulators).
