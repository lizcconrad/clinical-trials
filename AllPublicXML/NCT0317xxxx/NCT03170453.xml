      This study will investigate and confirm the efficacy of two psychological treatments for
      adults with autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a cognitive
      remediation intervention that aims to help adults with problems in thinking, planning, and
      socialization. Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) is an individual supportive therapy that
      aims to help adults learn about their condition, manage their emotions and stress, improve
      their social skills, and cope with everyday problems.

      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by marked impairments in social and
      non-social cognitive ability that persist well into adulthood and contribute to significant
      functional disability. The treatment of ASD has focused almost exclusively on children, and
      few empirically supported interventions are available to address the core cognitive and
      functional challenges individuals with ASD face as they transition to adulthood. This study
      will investigate and confirm the efficacy of two psychological treatments for adults with
      autism spectrum disorder. Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) is a cognitive remediation
      intervention that aims to help adults with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization.
      Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) is an individual supportive therapy that aims to help
      adults learn about their condition, manage their emotions and stress, improve their social
      skills, and cope with everyday problems.

      Participation in this study will last 30 months. Potential participants must be able to
      attend weekly treatment sessions in Pittsburgh, PA.

      The study design is a 30-month (2.5 years) randomized-controlled confirmatory efficacy trial,
      where eligible participants will be randomized to the CET or EST study treatments.
      Participants will be treated with the study interventions for 18 months, and then followed
      for 12 additional months to assess the lasting impact of the study interventions. All
      participants will complete cognitive, clinical, and neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging)
      assessments prior to starting the study treatments and then at specified intervals thereafter
      to evaluate the impact of the study treatments on cognition, adaptive function, and the
      brain.

    <description>This research treatment aims to help with problems in thinking, planning, and socialization. Participants begin with cognitive training using computer software programs. They also participate in a small social-cognitive group to learn about their condition and how to act wisely in social situations by developing the abilities needed to understand another person's perspective, evaluate social contexts, and be foresightful.
