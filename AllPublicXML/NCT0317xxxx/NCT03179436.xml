  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary
      efficacy of escalating doses of MK-1308 when used in combination with pembrolizumab in
      participants with advanced solid tumors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After screening, participants are assigned to either the dose escalation or dose confirmation
      phase. The dose escalation phase consists of 3 cohorts and will evaluate available PK and
      safety data from the first 6 participants of each cohort, including dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs). The purpose of the dose confirmation phase is to gather additional safety,
      tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy data of MK-1308 in combination with pembrolizumab.
      The 5 arms of the dose confirmation phase will include advanced/metastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) and second line advanced/metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In
      participants who have initial evidence of radiological progressive disease (PD) by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, it will be at the discretion of the
      investigator whether to continue a participant on study treatment until repeat imaging is
      obtained.

    <description>DLTs will be assessed during the first 6 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment for the Dose Escalation and the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment for the Dose Confirmation. DLT is defined as toxicity that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to study therapy and may result in a change in the given dose. DLTs include Grade (Gr)4 non-hematologic toxicity (not laboratory); Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days (except thrombocytopenia); most non-hematologic AEs ≥ Gr 3 in severity; any Gr 3 or Gr 4 non-hematologic laboratory value that requires clinically significant medical intervention, leads to hospitalization, persists for &gt;1 week, or results in a drug-induced liver injury; Gr 3 or Gr 4 febrile neutropenia; a prolonged delay in initiating Cycle 2 or 3 of Dose Escalation or Cycle 2 of Dose Confirmation due to treatment-related toxicity; any treatment-related toxicity that causes the participant to discontinue treatment during the DLT observation period, and Gr 5 toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by investigator based on RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population whose best overall response (BOR) is confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on imaging per RECIST 1.1. According to RECIST 1.1, CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR according to RECIST 1.1 is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions as assessed by the investigator, taking as reference the baseline SOD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ORR as assessed by investigator based on immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) in conjunction with RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants whose best response based on imaging is CR or PR per irRECIST. irRECIST is a modification to RECIST that takes into account unique patterns of atypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment beyond initial radiographic progression. The irRECIST modification to RECIST is used in conjunction with RECIST 1.1 to determine the BOR. At initial PD by RECIST 1.1, if participant is clinically stable the investigator may continue to treat and scan again ≥4 weeks later to see if PD confirmed. CR is disappearance of all lesions (target, non-target, and new lesions if any had appeared). PR is a decrease of ≥30% in the SOD of target lesions from baseline, with no indication of further progression by non-target or new lesions. BOR during irRECIST portion is the most favorable visit response observed, with no confirmation requirement. BOR for the participant overall is the more favorable of the RECIST 1.1 (pre-PD) and irRECIST (post-PD) BORs.</description>
