      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of low-volume
      contrast media (CM) injection protocols adapted to tube voltage in patients undergoing
      Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA).

    <description>This will be performed by two independent observers using a semi-quantitative rating scale of 1 - 5. Image quality will be graded on a five-point scoring system: 1 non-diagnostic; 2 limited diagnostic value; 3 adequate (presence of artifacts not limiting detection of luminal stenosis); 4 good; 5 excellent. Image quality assessments will be performed on both the investigative and control groups.</description>

             being performed.

          4. Subject must be willing to comply with all clinical study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a pregnant or nursing female. Exclude the possibility of pregnancy:

               -  By testing (serum or urine beta HCG) within 24 hours before study agent
                  administration, or

               -  Post-menopausal, with minimum one (1) year history without menses.

          2. Subject is chosen by the automated tube voltage selection algorithm (or adjusted by
             the technologist) to be scanned using a tube voltage that is not 70, 80, 90, 100, 110,
             120, or 130 kV.

          3. Subject is chosen by the automated tube voltage selection algorithm (or adjusted by

             maximum subject number (20 subjects per tube voltage).

          4. Subject has an acute psychiatric disorder.

          5. Subject is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.
