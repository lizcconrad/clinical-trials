    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the administration of single doses of 2-HOBA in
      humans, with an escalation of doses that begins with the calculated Maximum Recommended
      Starting Dose. This evaluation will assess tolerability to oral administration of 2-HOBA,
      obtain pharmacokinetic data, characterize the 2-HOBA metabolic pathways, and determine the
      relation of dose to prevention of formation of bi-functional electrophile adducts in blood.
      Characterization of the metabolic fate of 2-HOBA will be supported by investigations that
      evaluate metabolism in microsomes and cells.

    <textblock>
      Consenting volunteers of at least 18 years old with no morbidity, including males, and
      females who are not pregnant will be recruited for the study. A maximum of 28 volunteers may
      be enrolled with a reasonable sampling of ethnicities from the Nashville area, and an effort
      will be made to recruit equal numbers of males and females. Additionally, an effort will be
      made to study as old a population as possible and to recruit relatively similar age groups
      for males and females. All volunteers will be admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research
      Center (CRC) as inpatients.

      A complete health history and physical examination will be conducted by a physician.
      Volunteers will be asked to collect and bring their first morning voided urine for baseline
      urinalysis. An EKG, baseline blood analysis, vital signs, and questions about feelings and
      adverse events will be asked prior to supplement administration. All tests will be repeated
      at various intervals throughout the 24-hour study period. A physician will oversee all
      clinical aspects of the study and will be responsible for all trial-related medical
      decisions. Pharmacokinetics will be studied through the blood analyses at intervals
      throughout the study and 24-hour urine collection after administration of the supplement.

    <intervention_model_description>The 3+3 design will be employed for this trial. At least 3 volunteers will be studied at each dose level and evaluated for adverse effects. If 0 of 3 volunteers experiences adverse events (AE), the dose is escalated. If 1 of 3 volunteers experiences an AE, 3 additional volunteers are treated. If none of the additional volunteers develop an AE, the dose is escalated, otherwise escalation ceases. If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 volunteers experience an AE, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been exceeded.</intervention_model_description>
