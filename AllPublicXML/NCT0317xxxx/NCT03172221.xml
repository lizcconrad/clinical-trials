  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional and multicentre clinical trial to study the performance of the
      Histidine Rich Protein 2 (HRP2) highly sensitive rapid diagnostic test (HS-RDT) for the
      detection of malaria during pregnancy in low transmission settings from Colombia and
      Indonesia. The new HS-RDT will be compared with conventional good quality RDTs, microscopy,
      and NAATs [loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nested PCR (nPCR)], in peripheral
      blood samples with quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) as reference standard.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The activities proposed will be performed in the context of health centres receiving pregnant
      women for antenatal care visit. Finger-prick blood (300 µL) will be collected and used to
      test for malaria with the HS-RDT, as well as with conventional good quality RDTs, microscopy
      and local NAATs (LAMP and nPCR). Dried blood spots will also be collected for qRT-PCR
      testing. Patient information (demographics, obstetric history, malaria prevention measures,
      etc.) as well as laboratory results will be recorded and entered into a dedicated database.

        Consecutive pregnant women self-presenting at the selected health care facilities and
        meeting the eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in the study. After study
        staff provides full information about the study, pregnant women willing to participate will
        be asked to sign the informed consent form. They will consent to be interviewed and to
        provide finger-prick blood. For women younger than 18 years old, additional approval from
        the parent or legal guardian will be needed if required by local Institutional Review Board
        (IRB). Participants will be invited to participate at any visit at any trimester.
