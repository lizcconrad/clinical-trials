  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to evaluate the effect of therapeutic exercise program on blood glucose
      regulation in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) who are assigned to
      diet-and-exercise, compared to diet only (usual treatment). The primary outcome is the need
      for insulin treatment in the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In women with gestational diabetes, light to moderate daily physical activity may a useful
      therapeutic approach to improve the control of glycaemia and decrease the need for
      prescription of insulin. Increased physical activity in pregnant women with gestational
      diabetes is expected to decrease the mother and child morbidity associated with gestational
      diabetes, but also to improve the general health status of the mother and the child.

      The objectives of this randomized trial are:

        -  To evaluate the effect of therapeutic exercise program on blood glucose regulation in
           women with GDM who are assigned to diet-and-exercise protocol.

        -  To demonstrate the feasibility of the therapeutic exercise treatment and the possibility
           of using the exercise program as an optional therapeutic approach for women with GDM.

    <time_frame>From inclusion in the study (randomization usually between 24 and 30 weeks of gestation) until the end of pregnancy (delivery, usually 38 to 41 weeks of gestation). It is impossible in our context to give a specific time point.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will include any amount (dosage) of insulin and any frequency of injection. Prescription of insulin is considered when glycaemia is above 5.3 mmol/L fasting and/or above 8.0 at 1 hour after the meal.</description>

    <description>4 times per day, participants will check their blood sugar level. The investigators will record these blood sugar levels and consider as normal if below 5.3 mmol/L fasting and below 8.0 at 1 hour after the meal. Suboptimal glycemic control will be defined as 2 or more glycemia above these target values; good control will be defined as less than 2 values above the thresholds. The variable &quot;good glycemic control&quot; will be coded &quot;yes&quot; if the above criteria (&lt;2 abnormal values) are met, and &quot;no&quot; otherwise (&gt;=2 abnormal values)</description>

    <description>Satisfactory compliance will be defined as walking at least 5000 steps/day 5 days a week and attending at 50% or more of the weekly supervised exercise program. The variable &quot;compliance&quot; will be coded &quot;yes&quot; if both the above criteria are met, and &quot;no&quot; otherwise</description>

    <description>Exercise intervention:
During the first session a standardized exercise prescription will be discussed with the participant. The exercise program will be of a moderate intensity, at less than 140 heart beats/min (which corresponds to 60% of the calculated maximum heart rate (HRmax) or 50% maximum oxygen volume (VO2max) ). A session of 30 to 60 minutes/week will be organised.
Participants will be instructed to conduct a nonsedentary lifestyle. They will be encouraged to increase their number of steps on a daily basis and perform not more that 45 minutes of continuous exercise per day. Pedometers will be used to measure the compliance and as a positive feedback for motivation.
The participants will return to the exercise laboratory once per week for Actiheart data downloading, number of steps recording, exercise support and counselling, and to perform the supervised group exercise intervention.
This is in addition to the diet (see below, control group)</description>

    <description>Participants will receive diet counselling according to their characteristics. The usual recommendation is to have a fractioned normocaloric diet (unless the dietician identify a grossly hypercaloric diet), with low fat and increase in fibers content.</description>
