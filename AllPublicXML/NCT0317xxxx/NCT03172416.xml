  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PIPAC is a procedure that involves the administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy using
      an innovative concept that enhances the efficacy by taking advantage of the physical
      properties of gas and pressure. The chemotherapy drugs will be delivered in aerosolised form.
      This results in a superior distribution and depth of penetration of the drug. This research
      study serves to determine the safety profile and tolerability of PIPAC with oxaliplatin. It
      may offer a novel and effective option of treatment for patients with peritoneal
      carcinomatosis, who, at present have limited options involving the use of systemic
      chemotherapy and who suffer from poor life expectancy and poor quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The median survival of patients with unresectable gastric cancer treated with systemic
      chemotherapy is about 12 months. In patients with histologically proven unresectable or
      recurrent gastric cancer limited to the peritoneum and/or cancer cells in peritoneal
      cytology, the combination of i.p. paclitaxel with systemic chemotherapy reported a median
      survival time of 23.6 months. However, a phase III trial (PHOENIX-GC trial) comparing IP
      regimen with systemic chemotherapy versus systemic therapy alone in Japan recently reported
      preliminary data which did not show any superiority of the IP regimen.PIPAC is an innovative
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy concept that enhances the efficacy by taking advantage of the
      physical properties of gas and pressure. This results in a superior distribution and depth of
      penetration of the drug. To date, most phase II trials utilising PIPAC involve the use of
      cisplatin and doxorubicin4-6. Only two prior trials have utilised oxaliplatin in PIPAC for
      peritoneal carcinomatosis. Oxaliplatin is an approved drug for systemic chemotherapy, with
      well documented use intraperitoneally via hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)
      as well. This makes is a favourable agent for PIPAC in early phase studies. The dose of
      oxaliplatin utilised for PIPAC in the literature has thus far been arbitrarily set at 92
      mg/m2, which is approximately 80% of the drug concentration used in HIPEC. Furthermore, these
      studies were performed on patients with a recent or concurrent administration of systemic
      chemotherapy, which may make interpretation of the side effects and safety profile difficult
      to interpret. In this study, we intend to determine the safety profile and tolerability of
      PIPAC with oxaliplatin by assessment of dose limiting toxicities and the adverse event
      profile.

      The aim is to determine the safety profile and tolerability of PIPAC with oxaliplatin by
      assessment of dose limiting toxicities and the adverse event profile. The secondary objective
      is to evaluate the clinical and pathological response of PIPAC with oxaliplatin as well as to
      identify the pharmacokinetic profile of oxaliplatin administered via PIPAC.

    <description>This is a prospective, single arm phase I trial in a 3 + 3 dose escalation and cohort expansion design evaluating the safety and tolerability of PIPAC using oxaliplatin in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.
The pre-planned dose levels of oxaliplatin are 45mg/m2 (Cohort 1), 60mg/m2 (Cohort 2), 90mg/m2 (Cohort 3), 120mg/m2 (Cohort 4) and 150mg/m2 (Cohort 5) administered as PIPAC. Successive cohorts of patients (3 participants/cohort) will be enrolled and started on a fixed dose of oxaliplatin. The protocol specifies oxaliplatin 45mg/m2 once every 6 weeks for Cohort 1. Dose escalation continues until dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed in one-third of participants. If no DLT occurs, the next cohort will be enrolled at the next planned dose level. If 1 DLT occurs in a cohort, another 3 patients will be treated with the same dose level.</description>
