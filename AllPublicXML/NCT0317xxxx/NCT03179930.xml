  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of the study drugs called
      Pembrolizumab and Entinostat when used in combination to treat lymphoma. This combination
      could shrink the lymphoma but it could also cause side effects. Researchers also hope to
      learn whether adding entinostat to pembrolizumab can be more effective for patients with
      lymphoma than either drug alone.
