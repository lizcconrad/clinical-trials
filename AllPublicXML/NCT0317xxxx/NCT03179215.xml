  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Correction of arterial hypotension is essential for adequate cellular metabolism. maintaining
      MAP above a minimum level has been recommended in order to prevent further tissue
      hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.Functional assessment of arterial load by dynamic
      arterial elastance (Eadyn), has recently been shown to predict the arterial pressure response
      to volume expansion (VE) in hypotensive, preload-dependent septic patients.

      After approval from the ethics and research committee of Faculty of Medicine, Cairo
      University, an informed consent will be obtained from each patient's next of kin. Arteial
      cathter will be inserted in radial artery and connected through an arterial line to invasive
      arterial blood pressure monitor. Electrical Cardiometry will be attached to patient through
      the placement of four skin sensors on the neck and left side of the thorax12. A set of
      hemodynamic measurements will be obtained at baseline and after infusing a fluid challenge
      (FC) of 150-250 ml normal saline over 5-10 minutes.Fluid-responders are patients with a SV
      increase ≥10% after fluid challenge (FC).

        All adult patients with the diagnosis of sepsis who will be admitted to the Trauma and
        Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) of Kasralainy School of Medicine,Cairo University
        during a 6-month period (from March 2017 to September 2017) will be enrolled in the
        study.Sepsis is defined according to Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International Guidelines
        for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2016 as life-threatening organ
        dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.10 Septic shock is defined as
        a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic
        abnormalities substantially increase mortality.
