  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present study is to determine the clinical, biological and
      genetic determinants of the anticoagulant activity in patients treated with either anti-IIa
      or anti Xa oral anticoagulants.

      The secondary objective is to determine the clinical, biological or genetic determinants of
      hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications during a one year follow-up.

      Results will lead to a better prediction of both drug response and risk of complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Direct oral anticoagulants are changing clinical practices but a better knowledge of factors
      that may predict both drug response and risk of complications is need.

      Anticoagulant activity is influenced by different factors. Because the biological activity is
      not easy to measure everywhere, it is important to clearly determine factors that are
      involved.

      A cohort of 550 patients that receive either an anti-IIa or an anti-Xa will be recruited.

      The primary objective is to determine clinical, biological and genetic determinants of
      anticoagulant activity.

      This objective will be assessed through a multivariate logistic regression (separately for
      anti-IIa and anti-Xa) with anticoagulant activity as dependent variable.

      Variables that will be included in the statistical model are those known or measured at the
      entry in the cohort such as :

        -  Clinical factors : age, sex, weight, dosage and time of the last dose

        -  Biological factors : serum creatinine level, plasma concentration of the drug

        -  Genetic polymorphisms :

      Factor II and CES1 for anti-IIa drugs Factor X, CYP3, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and ABCG2 for anti-Xa
      drugs.

      By using the same statistical approach and the same variables, predictive factors of either
      hemorrhagic or thrombotic events will also be evaluated on the whole cohort. The occurence of
      hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications will then be assessed through a phone call every 3
      months during a one-year follow-up.
