      Purpose:To compare the efficacy and the safety of total neoadjuvant chemotherapy + TME with
      standard neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy + TME + adjuvant chemotherapy for locally
      advanced rectal cancer patients with high risk factors of recurrence.

      Evaluation indexes: (1) the primary evaluation index: disease-free survival (disease free
      survival, DFS); (2) the secondary evaluation indexes: pathological complete remission rate
      (pCR), the 3 year overall survival (overall survival, OS); R0 dissection rate; distant
      metastasis free survival (DMFS); local recurrence free survival rate (LRRFS); tumor
      regression grade (TRG, tumor regression grade) and the adverse reaction rate during the
      chemotherapy, the operation safety index; quality of life; psychological and cognitive
      effects, assessment of nutritional status.

      Safety evaluation indexes: including all adverse events observed during the experiment.

      Number of patients: 458 cases Study design: patients will be randomly assigned into the total
      neoadjuvant treatment group (experimental group, TNT) and neoadjuvant concurrent chemotherapy
      group (control group, CRT) in the ratio of 1: 1. The patients of experimental group will be
      given 1 cycle of induction CAPOX (Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2 d1, Capecitabine 1000mg/m2, bid,
      d1-14) prior to radiotherapy. Then pelvic IMRT/VMAT (50-50.4Gy/25-28f) and two cycles of
      concurrent chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, d 22, Capecitabine 825mg/m2, bid, 5d/w,
      25-28d) are performed. And three cycles of consolidation chemotherapy (CAPOX) are delivered
      after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Total mesorectal excision (TME) is performed after
      completion of the whole neoadjuvant treatment. The patients of control group will receive
      standard concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine (825mg/m2, bid, 5d/w)
      followed by TME 6-8 weeks after the end of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Then, patients are
      treated with another 6 cycles of CAPOX.

      Schedule: Investigators plan to finish the study in 4 years and write the related work within
      2 years after the completion of this study.
