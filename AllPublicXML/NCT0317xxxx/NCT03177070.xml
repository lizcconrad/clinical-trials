  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to assess whether intravenous methylene blue can help
      identify the ureters during open and laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. The ureters are small
      tubes that link the kidney to the bladder and, if not properly identified during surgery, may
      be damaged.

      Methylene blue has been safely given to patients for many years and it is fluorescent. It is
      removed by the kidney and will therefore travel through the ureters. Methylene blue shines
      brightly (becomes fluorescent) when viewed under red light.

      This study aims to compare the ability of methylene blue with white light to identify the
      location of the ureters during colorectal surgery. Recruitment will include 50 patients
      undergoing colorectal surgery (25 for keyhole/laparoscopic, 25 for open procedures). Each
      patient will act as their own control.

      To detect the fluorescence, a special fluorescent laparoscope for keyhole surgery will be
      utilised, and a wide-field camera will be used for open surgery.

      The potential benefits of this procedure are to identify the ureters during surgery and
      therefore prevent inadvertent damage to them

      It is hoped that near infra-red light emitting from the ureters will be detected. This will
      allow the surgeon to determine the anatomy of the ureters during the operation and avoid
      inadvertent injury.
