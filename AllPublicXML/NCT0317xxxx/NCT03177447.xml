  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Early palliative care (EPC) is recommended but rarely integrated with advanced
      heart failure (HF) care. This pilot study engaged patients and family caregivers to study the
      feasibility and site differences in a two-site EPC trial, ENABLE CHF-PC (Educate, Nurture,
      Advise, Before Life Ends Comprehensive Heartcare for Patients and Caregivers).

      An EPC feasibility study (4/1/14-8/31/15) was conducted for patients with New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) Functional Class III/IV HF and their caregivers in academic medical
      centers in the northeast and southeast U.S. The EPC intervention comprised: 1) an in-person
      palliative care consultation; and 2) telephonic nurse coach sessions and monthly calls.
      Patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes were collected for quality of life (QOL), symptom,
      health, anxiety, and depression outcomes at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. Linear mixed-models
      were used to assess baseline to week 24 longitudinal changes. The intervention was tailored
      to rural, older adults (ageâ‰¥65) with advanced HF in reducing HF morbidity and improving
      patient and caregiver QOL and quality of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High quality trials have demonstrated positive patient and family caregiver outcomes from
      early palliative care (EPC) in cancer However, given the difficulties in prognostication, the
      prevalence of sudden cardiac death, and an erratic illness trajectory, it is not clear when
      or how to integrate palliative care in HF. Furthermore, the high morbidity and mortality of
      HF in persons with low income, poor education, minority race, and residence in rural,
      medically-underserviced areas further complicates appropriate timing of integration.

      To address these challenges, patients and family members were actively engaged to aid in the
      development of ENABLE CHF-PC (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends Comprehensive
      Heartcare for Patients and Caregivers), a telephonic EPC intervention for rural-dwelling,
      underserved HF patients and their family caregivers. In a proof-of-concept, formative
      evaluation study, materials and protocols were translated from our successful EPC ENABLE
      oncology model to a HF population. This study demonstrated acceptability, feasibility, and a
      signal of potential efficacy in an educationally, socioeconomically, and racially homogeneous
      sample of 11 patient-caregiver dyads. Thus, the current ENABLE CHF-PC feasibility trial was
      conducted in a northeastern and a southeastern US academic center to capture the perspectives
      of a more demographically and culturally-diverse sample. The purpose of this study was to: 1)
      determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining patient-caregiver dyads for 24 weeks in
      a rural, racially-diverse sample and 2) explore longitudinal patient and caregiver outcomes
      including QOL, global health, anxiety, and depression to inform intervention and protocol
      modifications for a larger clinical efficacy trial.

      Study Design: In this feasibility study, conducted April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015,
      individuals with American College of Cardiology (ACC) /American Heart Association (AHA) Class
      C/D and/or NYHA Stage III/IV HF and their family caregivers received the ENABLE CHF-PC
      intervention and were followed for 24 weeks. The study protocol was approved by the
      institutional review boards of Dartmouth College (Lebanon, New Hampshire) and the University
      of Alabama at Birmingham (Birmingham, Alabama).

      Setting and Sample: Study participants were recruited from cardiology clinics at
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB).
      Study coordinators at both sites reviewed outpatient cardiology clinic schedules to identify
      eligible patients. Following physician approval, a study coordinator approached patients and
      their caregivers during a clinic appointment to explain the study and obtain consent.

      Data Collection and Measures: Study coordinators completed measures with patients and
      caregivers by phone at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks. Baseline demographics included age,
      gender, race/ethnicity, religion, marital and work status, educational level, and medical
      insurance. Clinical characteristics abstracted from electronic health records included NYHA
      class, ejection fraction, presence of an implanted heart device, medications, and laboratory
      data. These data were entered into the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) a web-based
      calculator to compute 1-, 2- and 5-year survival estimates
      https://depts.washington.edu/shfm/). Nurse coaches also informed patients and caregivers that
      the purpose of this pilot trial was to determine acceptability in a new population - patients
      with heart failure from 2 distinctly different regions/cultures. Nurses recorded sessions,
      and tracked patient and caregiver feedback on intervention components that were found to be
      helpful or in need of improvement.

      Statistical Analysis: The feasibility primary aim was determined by monitoring study status
      (enrolled, deceased, lost to follow-up) and calculating intervention and measurement
      completion (e.g. actual # completed/possible # per protocol). Patient and caregiver
      demographic characteristics were tabulated and compared between sites with bivariate tests of
      association and effect sizes (Cohen's d or d-equivalent or nominal variables). Associations
      were assessed between baseline characteristics and participant attrition using simple
      logistic regressions. Estimated odds ratios were used to determine associations between
      patient characteristics and attrition.

      Longitudinal, fitted, linear mixed methods, adjusted for covariates associated with attrition
      were used to estimate participant-reported outcomes' changes from baseline to follow-up
      (12-week and 24-week means combined). Change estimates were transformed to effect sizes
      (Cohen's d) using baseline estimates of pooled standard deviations. Change was estimated
      overall and by site. All analyses were conducted using SAS v9.4.

      Due to the exploratory nature of the study, the analysis relied on effect size estimation
      using Cohen's guidelines for magnitude of effect size d (i.e. small: 0.2, moderate: 0.5, and
      large: 0.8) rather than hypothesis testing to interpret results; however p-values are also
      provided for completeness.

    <description>Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a 23-item, self-administered HF-specific questionnaire that describes physical limitations (1 item), symptoms (frequency-4 items,severity-3 items, change over time-1 item) self-efficacy/ knowledge (2 items), social interference (1 item) and QOL (3 items). Individual domains show high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha's .62-.90). It is reported to take 6 minutes to complete. Two summary scores (functional and clinical) can be calculated. It is reported to be more sensitive to clinical change than other HF-specific measures. Scores range from 0-100 wherein higher scores indicate better health status.</description>

    <description>Single arm summative evaluation study was selected for several reasons: 1) to continue to determine recruitment feasibility; 2) retention- our prior work has demonstrated fairly equal dropouts in the intervention and control conditions, hence we believe we will be able to judge retention in a single arm design; 3) using a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) for power estimates runs a high risk of either overestimating or underestimating treatment effects; and 4) most importantly, the primary purpose of this study is to determine intervention efficacy. Therefore delivering the intervention to the maximum number of participants given the limitations of 2-year pilot funding allows the investigators to obtain the maximal input and experience with the intervention that is needed to achieve the study's Aim 1.</description>
