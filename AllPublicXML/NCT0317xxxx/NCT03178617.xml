  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well a high-intensity intervention parenting
      program works in improving learning and school functioning in Latino children with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or lymphoblastic lymphoma. A high-intensity
      intervention program may help doctors to see whether training parents or caregivers in
      specific parenting skills and &quot;pro-learning&quot; behaviors will result in better learning and
      school outcomes for Latino children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid
      leukemia, or lymphoblastic lymphoma. It is not yet known if a high-intensity intervention
      program is more beneficial than a standard of care lower intensity parenting intervention.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effectiveness of an enhanced parenting intervention, high-intensity
      intervention program (HIP), on pediatric cancer survivors' learning and school health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes up to 12 months post enrollment.

      II. Determine the effectiveness of HIP on the &quot;pro-learning&quot; efficacy of parents of pediatric
      cancer survivors up to 12 months post enrollment.

      III. Examine the extent to which the parent's increases in personal efficacy and use of
      &quot;pro-learning&quot; behaviors correlate with the child's school HRQOL and academic performance.

      OUTLINE: Parents or caregivers are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Parents or caregivers attend standard of care lower intensity intervention program
      (LIP) consisting of a meeting to review results of a neurocognitive evaluation and to discuss
      recommendations for optimal learning and school performance for 1 session.

      ARM II: Parents or caregivers attend HIP consisting of individual parental skill training
      sessions with a bilingual therapist over 60-90 minutes every 2 weeks for a total of 8
      sessions.

      After study enrollment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
