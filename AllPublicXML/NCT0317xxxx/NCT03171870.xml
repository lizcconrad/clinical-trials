  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing
      interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause, occurring primarily in older adults, limited to the
      lungs, and associated with the histopathologic and/or radiologic pattern of usual
      interstitial pneumonia.

      The definition of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis requires the exclusion of other forms of
      interstitial pneumonia including other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias and Interstitial
      lung disease associated with environmental exposure, medication, or systemic disease.

      Prevalence estimates for Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have varied from 2 to 29 cases per
      100,000 in the general population IPF should be considered in all adult patients with
      unexplained chronic exertional dyspnea, and commonly presents with cough, bibasilar
      inspiratory crackles, and finger clubbing.

    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should be considered in all adult patients with unexplained
      chronic exertional dyspnea, and commonly presents with cough, bibasilar inspiratory crackles,
      and finger clubbing.

      High resolution chest computed tomography is an essential component of the diagnostic pathway
      in Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. usual interstitial pneumonia is characterized on high
      resolution chest computed tomography by the presence of reticular opacities, often associated
      with traction bronchiectasis.

      Patients with interstitial lung disease have poor health-related quality of life. However,
      whether health-related quality of life differs among different subtypes of interstitial lung
      disease is unclear.

      There is limited research on the health-related quality of life of Idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis patients.

      Health-related quality of life deficits should be monitored in clinical practice with
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients and considered when investigating new therapies
