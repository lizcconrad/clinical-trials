  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is known as degenerative joint disease, which is the most common
      form of arthritis and the leading cause of disability, loss of function and pain worldwide.
      Effective therapy to manage RA is still lack at present. Fangji Huangqi pill (FHP) is a
      Chinese medicine which has been widely used in treating KOA in China for hundreds of years to
      relieve pain, reduce swelling and protect the affected joints from further degeneration.
      However, no certain evidence to show the effect of FHP for the management of active KOA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCT) will be conducted to
      explore whether the FHP could relieve pain and protect joints. 200 participants suffering
      from KOA will be enrolled and treated with FHP or placebo for 1 month. The primary outcome
      measures are the Visual analogue scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster university of
      orthopedic index (WOMAC), the Lequesne index, and MOS Sleep Scale would be measured from the
      baseline to 1 month. The second outcome measures would be the six minutes walking test, the
      Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF- 36), the X-ray of both knees, and the adverse events
      from the baseline to 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks' follow-up. In addition, the VAS score,
      the WOMAC score, the Lequesne index, and AIS Sleep Scale from the baseline to 2 weeks and 12
      weeks' follow-up are also the second outcome measures.
