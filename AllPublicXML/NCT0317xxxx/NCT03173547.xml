             retinoids, in the Treatment Area within 2 weeks prior to the initiation of treatment.
             Note: a bland emollient may be used in the Treatment Area up to 3 days prior to the
             initiation of treatment.

             5. Subject has used systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks or retinoids within 24
             weeks prior to the initiation of treatment.

             seborrheic or contact dermatitis, psoriasis, tinea infections, etc.) which, in the
             investigator's opinion, might impair evaluation of IV, or which exposes the subject to
             unacceptable risk by study participation.
