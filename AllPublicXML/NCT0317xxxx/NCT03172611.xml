  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of consuming a defined, plant-based diet on lipoprotein(a)
      and other atherogenic particles associated with cardiovascular disease risk.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lipoprotein(a) is a carrier of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and is a particularly
      atherogenic biomarker. Lp(a) has been previously documented to be resistant to dietary
      therapies and its concentration is thought to be determined by genes. A plant-based diet has
      not been previously used in an attempt to influence the concentration of Lp(a).

      Participants were instructed to follow a defined, plant-based dietary intervention for four
      weeks. All animal products were excluded. Cooked foods, free oils, soda, alcohol, and coffee
      were also to be excluded. All meals and snacks were provided to the participants for the full
      duration of the intervention. Emphasized were raw fruits and vegetables, while seeds,
      avocado, raw oats, raw buckwheat, and dehydrated foods were prepared as condiments. Vitamin,
      herbal, and mineral supplements were to be discontinued unless otherwise clinically
      indicated. Participants were not advised to alter their exercise habits.

      Serum biomarkers were obtained from participants at baseline and after 4-weeks.
