  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled project, the investigators would like to
      assess the effect of a specific light, as compared to placebo light, on wakefulness
      (circadian rhythms, homeostasy, sleep-wake cycle), awareness (perceptual and self
      consciousness), cognition (attention, memory) and underlying brain activity
      (electrophysiology and neuroimaging)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use behavioral (CRS-R, CAP, actimeter, brainstem reflexes),
      physiological (body core temperature, saliva, urine, heart rate, blood sample), neuroimaging
      and neurophysiological tools (PET, fMRI, TMS-EEG, resting-state and auditory paradigm EEG)
      before, during and after treatment.

    <description>All patients will be exposed to a real light (1500 lux, 470 nm) during the treatment phase, 3 times per day (morning, afternoon and evening) for 60 minutes each via goggles providing light at the eyes level. Meanwhile, different assessments will be performed in order evaluating the potential effects of provided light in comparison to placebo ligh. Patients will be given behavioral assessments (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, Nociception Coma Scale-Revised, brainstem reflexes,...), physiological (body core temperature, saliva, urine, heart rate, blood sample), neuroimaging and neurophysiological tools (PET, fMRI, TMS-EEG, resting-state and auditory paradigm EEG) before, during and after treatment.</description>
