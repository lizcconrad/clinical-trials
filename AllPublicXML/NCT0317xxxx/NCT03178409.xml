    <textblock>
      Combined hepatocellular and mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-MFCCC) is a rare tumor. The
      aim of this study was the analysis of the outcome comparing such tumor with classic
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma (MFCCC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The institutional prospectively maintained database was queried, and 20 patients with
      cHCC-MFCCC were identified. A 2:1 match was performed with 40 patients operated in the same
      period for HCC, and with 40 operated for MFCCC. Only T1 or T2 patients N0 M0 were considered.
      Primary endpoint was the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
