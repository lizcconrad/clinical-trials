        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 40 and 80 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

          -  Licensed, experienced driver who had driven at least 3 times a week for the past 3
             years and had visual acuity adequate for driving, as assessed by the investigator or
             designee.

          -  Able to complete a 1 hour simulated driving test and demonstrate satisfactory driving
             skills, as determined by the investigator or designee.

          -  Karolinska Sleep Scale (KSS) score of &lt;=5.

          -  Other criteria apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known history of allergic reaction, hypersensitivity or clinically significant
             intolerance to gabapentin, pregabalin or any pharmaceutical materials, or any of the
             ingredients in the protocol-specified meals.

          -  Pregnant or lactating or considered at risk of pregnancy.

          -  Any medical condition or any laboratory abnormality or ECG abnormality that would, in
             the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate study participation.

          -  Impaired liver function (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≥2 times the upper limit
             of normal [ULN] or bilirubin ≥2 times ULN), known active hepatic disease (e.g.,
             hepatitis), or evidence of clinically significant liver disease or other condition
             affecting the liver that may suggest the potential for an increased susceptibility to
             hepatic toxicity with oral gabapentin or pregabalin exposure.

          -  Any history of renal disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             contraindicate study participation; or subject had significantly impaired renal
             function as evidenced by an estimated GFR of ≤ 80 ml/min/1.73m2.

          -  History or evidence of a sleep disorder, including sleep apnea (obstructive, central
             or mixed), narcolepsy or primary insomnia.

          -  Other criteria apply.
