  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated the safety and efficacy of gene therapy approaches for
      Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI disease caused by the deficiency of arylsulfatase B (ARSB)
      enzyme. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI disease is involved in Lysosomal Storage Disorder. The MPS VI
      disease is characterized by growth retardation, corneal clouding, cardiac valve disease,
      organomegaly, skeletal dysplasia, without central nervous system involvement.

    <description>Adeno-associated viral vector serotype 8 with liver-specific thyroxinebinding globulin (TBG) promoter driving the expression of the human ARSB gene. Three dose levels are available:
Starting dose is 6x1011 gc of vector per kg of body weight.
High dose is 2x1012 gc of vector per kg of body weight and will be administered after at least two subjects at the starting dose have experienced no DLT
Low dose is 2x1011 gc of vector per kg of body weight. Intermediate doses are also possible. The administration of the IMP will be performed into a peripheral vein. The IMP final volume to be injected is calculated based on the patient's weight (determined on the day of hospital admission), as 3 mL/kg.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a documented biochemical and molecular diagnosis of MPS VI.

          2. Subjects must be 4 years old or older.

          3. Subjects should have received Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT) for at least 12 months
             before enrolment, and should continue to receive treatment until 7-14 days before IMP
             administration.

          4. Documented informed consent; willingness to adhere to protocol and required long-term
             follow-up as evidenced by written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects unable or unwilling to meet requirements of the study.

          2. Participation in a clinical study with an investigational drug in the 6 months prior
             to enrolment in this trial.

          3. Subjects who are unable to perform the 6MWT.

          4. History of severe anaphylactoid reaction to Naglazyme in subjects receiving ERT that
             could affect the safety (severe reaction is meant to be an event with respiratory
             impairment that is life-threatening).

          5. Presence of tracheostomy or need of ventilatory assistance.

          6. Subjects with evidence of progressive severe myelomalacia that is predicted to require
             neck surgery in the first six months after enrolment.

          7. Serum AST or ALT above the upper limit of normal range at the baseline evaluations
             (Baseline 2, -5 days).

          8. Co-existence of chronic diseases or clinically relevant abnormal baseline laboratory
             values; infections with hepatitis B, C, or HIV (Baseline 1).

          9. Systemic corticosteroid therapy or other immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs
             within 2 weeks prior to IMP administration.

         10. Female individuals of childbearing age who are pregnant or nursing or unwilling to use
             effective contraception for at least one year post- IMP administration.

         11. Fertile male individuals who are unwilling to use male barrier contraceptives such as
             condom.

         12. Any other condition that would not allow the subject to complete follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study and that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study.

         13. Detectable serum neutralizing antibodies (NAB) against AAV8 vector (Baseline 1).
