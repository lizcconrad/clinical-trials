  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of utilizing
      the insulin-like growth factor-1-methotrexate conjugate, 765IGF-MTX for the treatment of
      advanced, previously treated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
      (CMML) and oligoblastic acute myelogenous leukemia (oligoblastic AML or O-AML), including
      determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate use of IGF-Methotrexate conjugate (765IGF-MTX) in patients
      with advanced, previously treated MDS, CMML and O-AML. 765IGF-MTX at a dose of 0.20 to 2.5
      µequivalents per kg is administered as an IV infusion over 1.5 hours on days 1, 8 and 15 of a
      28 day cycle. Treatment continues until disease progression, as assessed after 2 cycles,
      unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. Assessment of response will be confirmed by bone
      marrow studies performed at the end of cycles 2, 4, and 6 (each +/- 3 days).

      Pharmacokinetics will be performed before and for up to 24 hours after drug administration on
      days 1 (for 24 hrs) and 15 (for 24 hrs) of cycle 1. Pharmacodynamic samples will be assessed
      pre-dosing on day 1 of cycle 1, pre-dosing on days 1 and 15 of cycle 2, and pre-dosing on day
      15 of cycles 4 and 6.

             uncontrolled diabetes) or psychiatric disorders that, in the opinion of the

             ability to complete the study.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.

          -  Any history of epilepsy or a seizure disorder or any known prior seizures.

          -  Abnormalities on 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) considered by the investigator to be
             clinical significant.
