      Device in prevention of stroke and bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)
      undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

      WATCH-TAVR is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Only centers with
      approval for commercial WATCHMAN implantation will be included in this trial. Subjects will
      be enrolled at up to 25 centers in the United States. There will be up to 312 subjects
      enrolled, with 156 patients randomized to TAVR + medical therapy and 156 patients randomized
      to simultaneous TAVR+WATCHMAN to accumulate the necessary 191 primary events. Enrollment is
      expected to occur over the course of 18 months. Patients will be followed for a total of 2
      years. Patients with non-valvular AF undergoing standard of care commercial TAVR will be
      enrolled in the trial.

      For patients who receive the WATCHMAN device, plan of care will follow WATCHMAN
      labeling.Patients randomized to receive the WATCHMAN device will receive anticoagulation with
      warfarin and aspirin for 6 weeks after the procedure. After 6 weeks, the plan of care will
      follow WATCHMAN labeling. Patients randomized to the TAVR + medical therapy arm will be
      treated in accordance with standard of care with either warfarin, other
      anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, or no anticoagulation at the discretion of the treating
      physician. All patients will continue to receive routine post-TAVR follow-up and
      care.Patients will be monitored for primary and secondary endpoints as outlined. Baseline
      information and laboratory data will be collected as described in the protocol.
