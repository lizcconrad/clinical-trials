  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AVETUX is a single arm multicentric phase II investigator initiated trial conducted by the
      Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie (AIO) in 11 German sites in patients with
      previously untreated RAS/BRAF wildtype mCRC independent of MSI status.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary clinical objective is to determine the efficacy of a standard 1st line regimen
      (FOLFOX and cetuximab) in patients with RAS/v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B
      (BRAF) wildtype, Microsatellite Instability (MSI) or icrosatellite Stability (MSS) MCRC with
      avelumab in terms of progression free survival rate after 12 months (acc. to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1).

      The main secondary objective is to determine safety and tolerability, according to NCI Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03) and to the obtained data on vital
      signs, clinical parameters (oxygen saturation) and feasibility of the regimen. Further
      secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of the experimental regimen in terms of
      objective response rate (acc. to RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST), and overall survival, to
      correlate clonal dynamics (RAS/EGFR subclones) with immune response signature to determine
      control of mutant subclones by the combination of anti-Epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) with anti-PD-L1and PD-L1 staining (and MSI status) with efficacy.
