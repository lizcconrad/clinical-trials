  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this application is on the impact of providing depressed Veterans and their
      providers with the results of pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for psychotropic medications. The
      project focuses on whether and how patients and providers use genetic test results given to
      them at the time an antidepressant is to be initiated to treat Major Depressive Disorder
      (MDD) and whether use of the test results improves patient outcomes. MDD is one of the most
      common conditions associated with military service and combat exposure, increases suicide
      risk, and worsens the course of common medical conditions, making it a leading cause of
      functional impairment and mortality. Validation of a PGx test to personalize the treatment of
      MDD represents an important opportunity to improve the healthcare of Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: In the last several years, commercial pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing for
      psychotropic medications has become widespread as a means of implementing &quot;precision
      medicine&quot;, with some insurers electing to cover the cost of testing. These developments have
      put increasing pressure on the Veterans Health Administration to implement a mental health
      focused PGxs program, especially for treating depression, but without sufficient scientific
      study to support the utility of clinical application.

      Objectives: The investigators propose a program of research to evaluate the utility of PGx
      testing in treating Major Depressive Disorder.

      Methods: The investigators plan a multi-site RCT (n=2000), patient/provider dyads will be
      randomly assigned to receive results of the PGx battery right after randomization (i.e.
      intervention group) or after 6 months of treatment as usual (i.e. delayed results group)The
      study will test the following hypotheses:

        1. Veterans with MDD whose care is guided by the results of the PGx battery (the
           intervention group) will have a higher rate of remission of depression than the delayed
           results group. (Primary Hypothesis)

        2. Provider/patient dyads in the intervention group will use fewer contraindicated
           medications based on established PGx criteria than the delayed results group. (Primary
           Hypothesis)

The investigators will require requests to include hypotheses and specify data variables requested. Requests will be reviewed by the Executive Committee for approval. If approved, the requestor will be given a user agreement specifying how the data may be used. Once the agreement is signed and returned, the investigators will provide the requester with an anonymized data set via secure transit method.
