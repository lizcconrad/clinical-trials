  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the high rate of delayed adoption of antenatal care (ANC), and high rates of unintended
      pregnancy and unsafe abortion in Uganda, research on the period of time before confirmation
      of pregnancy is critical to understand underlying beliefs that guide behaviors ultimately
      important for maternal and neonatal health (UDHS, 2011; Hussain, 2013).

      Home pregnancy tests - which now cost less than 10 cents each - have the potential to
      facilitate FP uptake and significantly improve reproductive, maternal and child health
      outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. These tests are easy to administer,
      disposable, inexpensive, and have a low false positive rate. Yet, for women living in rural
      areas in sub-Saharan countries, these tests are typically unavailable outside of health
      centers or they are prohibitively expensive.

      This study will investigate women's underlying beliefs about pregnancy status and examine how
      providing access to home-based pregnancy tests - thus facilitating earlier resolution of
      uncertainty of pregnancy status - influences such beliefs and decisions to take up family
      planning (FP) or seek appropriate pregnancy services.

      The results will inform the design of a larger study in the future.

Demand for pregnancy test kit is computed by Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) or/and Take it or leave it (TIOLI) method.

    <description>Among respondents who are randomly selected to receive a free home pregnancy test service, they will be offered the chance to take the test in the presence of the enumerator. Specifically, this would mean they would be given a cup to collect a sample of urine. The respondent would do so privately, then bring the cup back to the enumerator who would dip the home pregnancy tests and assist with interpreting the result. However, respondents can decline to take the test with the enumerator. Treatment assignment will be stratified by whether respondent use modern family planning at baseline.</description>
