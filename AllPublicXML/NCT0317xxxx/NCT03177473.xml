    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of adjunctive use of the CervicalStim bone growth stimulator
      on cervical fusion rate in high risk subjects who have undergone cervical fusion surgery. All
      participants will wear the bone growth stimulator every day for 4 hours/day for 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market prospective study is to examine the effect of the adjunctive
      use of the Orthofix CervicalStim device on cervical fusion rate in high risk subjects who
      have undergone cervical fusion surgery. High risk subjects are those who are having a
      multi-level (2 or more) cervical fusion, who are smokers, who are diabetic or those who are
      osteoporotic. Because this is a post market prospective study, subjects who are enrolled in
      this study will be identified by the Investigator as needing cervical fusion surgery and
      asked to participate in a study looking at the efficacy of cervical fusion with adjunctive
      use of the CervicalStim bone growth simulator. The type of cervical fusion surgery performed
      is up to the Investigator; the subjects in the study must be agreeable to using the bone
      growth stimulator for 6 months post-surgery. The subjects will be followed for 12 months.
