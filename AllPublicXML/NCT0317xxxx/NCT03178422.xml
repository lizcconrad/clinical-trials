  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transdermal nicotine delivery systems are a cigarette smoking cessation aid designed to
      deliver nicotine into the systemic circulation via the skin. They have been found to reduce
      craving, thereby enhancing a patient's success for quitting smoking. However, side effects
      such as sleep disturbances and skin irritation, as well as incomplete smoking cessation are
      commonly experienced by users of such systems. Chrono Therapeutics, Inc. has developed an
      innovative programmable transdermal drug delivery system called the Chrono Quit Smoking
      Solution (CQSS2) that provides &quot;off&quot; periods (periods in which little to no nicotine is
      delivered), which is an advantage over existing systems that currently provide continuous
      delivery. The most important features of the CQSS2 are the periodic automatic dosing, plus
      the reduced side effects of sleep disturbances and potentially, skin irritation. The period
      when less nicotine is being delivered through the skin allows the skin an opportunity to
      &quot;recover&quot;, thereby potentially reducing skin irritation. Another major benefit is the
      automatic dosing, which provides higher drug dosage at specific times of the day, leading to
      potentially greater success in quitting smoking. In this study, the CQSS2 will be used in
      conjunction with the Digital Coach application (app). The Digital Coach is a custom mobile
      app that provides behavioral support for the CQSS2. Together, the CQSS2 and the Digital Coach
      comprise the CQSS2 System.

      Study EF2016-003 is a Phase 2, randomized, two-arm, open-label, multicenter efficacy and
      safety study of the CQSS2 System for smoking cessation over a 6-week treatment period in
      healthy treatment-seeking subjects who are smokers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate quit rates (continuous abstinence from smoking during the last 4 weeks of
      treatment [Visit 3 through the end of study treatment]) in smokers (more than 10
      cigarettes/day) being treated with the CQSS2 System versus NicoDerm® CQ® patch

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      To assess the safety and tolerability of the CQSS2 System

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from this study if they do not fulfill the inclusion criteria, or
        if any of the following conditions are observed:

          1. Subjects with screening clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count [CBC] with
             differential and platelets, and chemistry profile) outside the normal range and

             or with a history or illness that may (in the opinion of the Investigator) confound
             the results of the study or pose additional risk. Because these disorders may occur
             either alone or in combination, this judgment is left to the discretion of the
             Investigator caring for the subject.

          3. Subjects who are immunocompromised; have an infection or suspected infection with
             tuberculosis (TB) or hepatitis C virus (HCV); or have a suspected infection with, or

          4. Subjects with positive screening urine test for drugs of abuse, including opiates,
             amphetamines, barbiturates, methadone, oxycodone, benzodiazepines, cocaine,
             phencyclidine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, or cannabinoids; or with a history of use of
             cocaine, heroin, recreational drugs (e.g., MDMA/&quot;ecstasy&quot;), methamphetamine, or
             hallucinogens at any time during the past 3 months; or use of marijuana on a weekly
             basis for the past 3 months.

          5. Subjects with recent history (past 3 months) of abuse of, or dependence on, a
             substance other than tobacco, including: heavy alcohol consumption (i.e., if male,
             drinking &gt;4 alcoholic beverages per day for the past month and, if female, drinking &gt;3
             alcoholic beverages per day for the past month).

          6. Subjects with physical examination (PE) abnormal findings considered to be clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          7. Subjects with tattoos that could interfere with skin assessments.

          8. Subjects with any sign of infection, dermatologic disease, or condition that would
             inhibit transdermal absorption or might interfere with the evaluation of a test site
             reaction in locations where the investigational product may be used; or infection or
             condition (e.g., respiratory infection, strep throat) that would prevent full
             participation in the study.

          9. Electrocardiogram (ECG) readings outside the normal range and considered to be
             clinically significant by the Investigator.

               -  moderately severe or severe depression, as defined by a Patient Health
                  Questionnaire (PHQ-9) total score of ≥10, or

               -  suicidal ideation, as defined by a PHQ-9 score ≥1 in response to question 9,
                  &quot;Thoughts that you would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself.&quot;

         11. Subjects with a history of psychosis, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt,
             schizophrenia, or any other significant psychiatric history that the Investigator
             believes may interfere with the subject's participation in the study.

         12. Subjects who have used an antipsychotic medication within the past 30 days. Subjects
             may be enrolled into the study if currently on a stable dose of antidepressant for the

             study.

         13. Subjects who require any medications that may interfere with the absorption,
             metabolism, or excretion of the study drug.

         14. Subjects who have had a known reaction to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products
             or components.

             e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco) throughout the duration of the clinical study.

         20. Subjects with a history of illness that may (in the opinion of the Investigator)
             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk.

         21. Subjects with another household member or known relative participating in the study.

         22. Subjects who have participated and been treated in any previous Chrono Therapeutics
             clinical study.

         23. Subjects who work third shift or who otherwise stay awake all night and sleep during
             daylight hours.

         24. Subjects who do not have access to the internet (access can be through a personal
             computer, smartphone, library computer, etc.).
