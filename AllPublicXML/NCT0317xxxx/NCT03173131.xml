  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study that will involve fellowship-trained board certified
      orthopaedic surgeons in four different subspecialties (hand surgery, sports surgery, shoulder
      and elbow surgery, and foot and ankle surgery) within our practice group. Consenting patients
      will be randomized to the treatment group (receiving preoperative counseling) or to the
      control group (no preoperative counseling). The control limb will provide us with information
      regarding average opioid consumption following common outpatient orthopedic procedures, and
      the study limb will allow us to evaluate the effect of the pre-operative opioid counseling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past two decades in the United States, the opioid epidemic has escalated at a
      startling rate and prescription opioids are a large contributor to this problem. Studies show
      that there is an excessive amount of opioids being prescribed for orthopedic procedures. An
      accurate understanding of opioid consumption following common outpatient orthopedic surgery
      is imperative in order to treat pain appropriately relative to the surgery being performed
      without leading to excess narcotic prescribing.

      The purpose of the study is threefold: to better understand typical opioid consumption
      following common outpatient orthopedic surgeries, to generate prescribing guidelines to
      optimize opioid prescribing, and to understand the effect of pre-operative opioid counseling
      on opioid consumption following these procedures.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled study that will involve eight fellowship-trained
      board certified orthopaedic surgeons in four different subspecialties (hand surgery, sports
      surgery, shoulder and elbow surgery, and foot and ankle surgery). Consenting patients will be
      randomized to the treatment group (receiving preoperative counseling) or to the control group
      (no preoperative counseling). The control limb will provide us with information regarding
      average opioid consumption following common outpatient orthopedic procedures, and the study
      limb will allow us to evaluate the effect of the pre-operative counseling.

      Basic demographic and surgical data will be collected. Primary outcomes will be assessed at
      the post-operative visit. These include the total number of opioid pills consumed, average
      daily pain scores, and adverse effects. Secondary outcomes include the number of days the
      medication was used, medication refill requests, and patient satisfaction.
