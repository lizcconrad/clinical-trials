    <textblock>
      Research has suggested that children with sufficient vitamin D levels undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) have improved outcomes, including lower incidences
      of infection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as well as overall improved survival.
      However, supplementation in children undergoing HSCT has shown to be a challenge using
      standard or aggressive supplementation strategies. The overall objective of our study is to
      determine the effectiveness of a single, high dose oral vitamin D at the start of transplant
      followed by maintenance supplementation in children undergoing HSCT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidities and complications including infection, organ system toxicity, graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) and disease recurrence are some of the biggest contributors to quality of life
      and mortality in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Research has
      suggested that patients with sufficient vitamin D levels during transplant have improved
      outcomes, including lower incidences of infection and acute GVHD, as well as overall improved
      survival. Prior research has shown that chronically ill children are at risk for vitamin D
      deficiency, including those undergoing HSCT. Data has shown populations with as many as 70%
      of HSCT patients have insufficient levels of vitamin D at time of transplant. While several
      studies have attempted methods of vitamin D supplementation in this subset of patients, there
      has not been success with either standard or aggressive supplementation strategies.

      Single high-dose oral vitamin D therapy, known as stoss therapy, has been used in other
      chronically ill children where adequate levels of vitamin D are difficult to attain. Stoss
      therapy suggests a single high-dose followed by maintenance dosing would be adequate to
      replete and maintain vitamin D levels in chronically ill children. While it has been shown to
      be effective with no evidence of toxicity in patients with rickets and cystic fibrosis, its
      safety and efficacy has not been studied in the transplant setting. However, there is an
      urgent need to identify a modifiable factor may reduce the occurrence and/or severity of HSCT
      associated complications. Our overall objective of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of a single, high dose oral vitamin D followed by maintenance supplementation
      in children undergoing HSCT. This change will result in a new and innovative approach to
      maintaining adequate vitamin D levels during pediatric HSCT, with the long term goal of
      reducing morbidity and mortality.

      Our primary hypotheses are based on previous data referred to above. Our primary hypothesis
      is that a single, high dose of vitamin D followed by maintenance supplementation in children
      undergoing HSCT is a safe and efficacious way to replete vitamin D stores during HSCT through
      Day +100 of transplant. Our secondary hypothesis is that adequate vitamin D levels in
      patients undergoing HSCT have positive effect on the overall outcomes, including graft versus
      host disease, immune recovery, rejection, relapse, and infection rates.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to either a control or intervention arm prior to the start of transplant using block randomization of blocks of 6. Those randomized to the intervention arm will receive the intervention (Stoss Therapy dosing of vitamin D) at the start of transplant followed by maintenance supplementation of vitamin D according to standard of care.

Patients will be monitored for hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with weekly complete metabolic panels and serum phosphorus during the first 100 days of transplant. Patients will have repeat measurements of serum 25(OH)D levels will be obtained at Day +30 to ensure they do not have hypervitaminosis D at that time.</description>

All patients will then undergo treatment based on their trial arm and baseline levels of vitamin D. Patients will have repeat measurements of serum 25(OH)D levels will be obtained at Day +100 of transplant. At this time they will again be classified as being sufficient (&gt;30ng/mL), insufficient (21- 29ng/mL), or deficient (&lt;20ng/mL) in serum vitamin D following therapy to assess if the therapy was efficacious in repleting and maintaining their serum vitamin D level.</description>
