  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates the addition of chiropractic treatment to conventional
      neurological care in the treatment of migraine headaches in adult women. Half of the
      participants will receive 10 chiropractic treatments in addition to their usual care over a
      14 week period, while the other half will continue their usual medical care alone, as
      prescribed by their physician during that time period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chiropractic care is a commonly used therapeutic intervention for the treatment of pain
      disorders, and some smaller studies have shown that it might be helpful for migraines. This
      pilot study will use a comprehensive model of chiropractic treatment which can include soft
      tissue mobilization, spinal manipulation, and postural and spinal stabilization and
      correctional exercises.

      Specific Aims:

      Aim #1 - Determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized control trial (RCT) of
      chiropractic care in adult women with migraine.

      Aim #2 - To provide preliminary data on the safety and effectiveness of chiropractic care on
      migraine frequency, severity, duration, and medication use in adult women with migraine.

      Aim #3 - To provide preliminary estimates of the effects of chiropractic on disability,
      health-related quality of life, and psychosocial well-being.
