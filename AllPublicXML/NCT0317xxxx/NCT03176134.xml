  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate
      (MK-1986) compared with comparator antibacterial agent in participants from birth to &lt;12
      years of age with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized (3:1) to receive MK-1986 ≤200 mg daily dose (~4 mg/kg to ~6
      mg/kg), IV and/or oral suspension for 6 or 10 days, or comparator IV and/or oral per local
      standard of care for 10 or 14 days. The switch from IV to oral administration can be made at
      any time based on 1) no worsening of the primary skin lesion, 2) last temperature &lt;37.7 °C,
      and 3) primary ABSSSI site has not worsened and at least 1 site has improved from Baseline.
      The potential 4-day treatment extension will be based on clinical need as judged by the
      investigator, considering the following criteria: 1) ≥40% reduction in primary lesion size,
      2) reduction in pain, and 3) no new signs and symptoms and no complications attributable to
      ABSSSI compared with Baseline.

    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event. The percentage of participants with one or more AEs will be reported.</description>

    <description>An AE is any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event.

    <measure>Clinical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 25</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's assessment of clinical response will be conducted at the Test of Cure (TOC) visit, approximately 25 days after the first infusion. Clinical success is defined as 1) resolution or near-resolution of most signs and symptoms, 2) absence or near-resolution of signs of infection, and 3) no new signs, symptoms, or complications attributable to the infections (no further antibiotic therapy required for the primary lesion). The percentage of participants with clinical success will be reported.</description>
