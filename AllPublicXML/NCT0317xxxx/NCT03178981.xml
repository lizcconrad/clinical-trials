             e-cigarettes. Subjects must be smoking ≥10 cigarettes per day and must have done so
             for at least one year. Smoking status will be confirmed with a urinary cotinine level
             of ≥200ng/ml (determined using NicAlert cotinine test kit) and an exhaled breath CO
             level of &gt;10ppm (determined using a Smokerlyzer breath CO monitor) at screening, as
             well as by tobacco use questionnaire.

          2. Subjects will be males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, and between 22 and 55
             years of age inclusive. Age verification will be performed by checking of Federal or

          3. Women of child-bearing potential should be using one of the following acceptable
             methods of contraception : combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) oral,
             intravaginal or transdermal hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of
             ovulation; progestogen-only hormonal contraception, either oral, injected or
             implanted, associated with inhibition of ovulation; progestogen-only oral hormonal
             contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action;
             intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS); bilateral
             tubal occlusion; male or female condom with or without spermicide; cap, diaphragm or
             sponge with spermicide.

          4. Women of non-childbearing potential may be included if they are either surgically
             sterile (hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy) or postmenopausal for more than 1 year and
             must have a negative urine pregnancy test result during screening. Women who are
             surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative report.

          5. Male subjects must use an approved method of birth control during the entire study.
             These subjects must not donate sperm during this time.

          6. Subjects must be in good health, as judged by the PI or the appropriately qualified
             designee based on medical history, ECG, vital signs, blood biochemistry, haematology,
             urinalysis and physical examination.

          7. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 inclusive. Male
             subjects must have a weight between 60 and 120kg and female subjects between 50 and
             100kg.

          8. No clinically significant abnormalities in blood pressure values.

          9. Subjects will have negative results for the urinary drug of abuse screening and
             alcohol test.

         10. Subjects will have given their written informed consent to participate in the study
             and to abide by the study restrictions.

        To be confirmed during each clinic visit:

        1. Abstinence from tobacco and nicotine products will be confirmed by an exhaled breath CO
        reading &lt;15ppm.

          1. Subjects who have a history of, or clinically active significant, neurological,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, respiratory, metabolic,
             endocrine, haematological disease or other major disorders.

          2. Subjects who have any clinically significant abnormal laboratory safety findings at
