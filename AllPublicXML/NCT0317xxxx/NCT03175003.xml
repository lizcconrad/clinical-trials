  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study conducted will lend toward the optimization of the development of a food
      product that will promote a shift towards improved metabolic health. Specifically, this trial
      will determine the optimal level of protein needed to elicit positive changes in markers of
      inflammation, metabolic and micronutrient status, hepatic lipid metabolism, vascular
      function, and the relationship of these changes to the metabolome in school aged children (9
      - 13 years of age).

      Each participant will be asked to participate in a screening and 2 study intervention visits.
      Each intervention visit will include anthropometric measures, complete the education
      component, vascular function tests, and a blood draw and spot urine. The screening visit will
      confirm the child's eligibility for study enrollment and will serve to acclimate the child to
      the vascular function, and physical activity measurements. The remaining 2 visits will be
      scheduled 4 weeks apart. The participants will also be provided and asked to wear a physical
      activity monitor, which in addition to tracking physical activity, will also be used to
      incorporate a nutrition education program. The parent/guardian will be asked to help with
      providing the child the daily food product and to help their child fill out the compliance
      log. Volunteers will also be sought for stool and saliva collection.
