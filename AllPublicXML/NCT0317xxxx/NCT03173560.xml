    <textblock>
      Study E7080-G000-218 is a Randomized, Double-blind, Phase 2 Trial conducted to assess whether
      a starting dose of lenvatinib 14 milligrams (mg) in combination with everolimus 5 mg once
      daily (QD) will provide comparable efficacy (based on objective response rate [ORR] at 24
      weeks [ORR24W]) with an improved safety profile compared to lenvatinib 18 mg in combination
      with everolimus 5 mg (based on treatment-emergent intolerable Grade 2, or any ≥ Grade 3
      adverse events (AEs) in the first 24 weeks after randomization).

    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR) at Week 24 (ORR24W) as assessed by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>ORR24W is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the Week 24 (after randomization) time point or earlier. To be considered a BOR, all responses must be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of response.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with intolerable Grade 2 or any ≥ Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 24 weeks after randomization (as of the Week-24 time point)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03. The CTCAE is a list of AE terms commonly encountered in oncology. Each AE term is defined and accompanied by a grading scale that indicates the severity of the AE. Intolerable toxicities will be judged as such by the participant and/or physician to be intolerable.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. For target lesions, progressive disease is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). For non-target lesions, progressive disease is defined as the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) and percentage of participants with any serious TEAE</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A serious TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug).</description>

    <description>OS will be measured from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause.

    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to first dose of study drug), on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, at time of early withdrawal, and at the Off-Treatment Visit (up to a maximum of 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The FKSI-DRS consists of 9 items that experts and participants have indicated are important targets for the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, and that clinical experts have indicated are primarily disease related, as opposed to treatment related. Symptoms assessed on the FKSI-DRS include pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, fevers, weight loss, coughing, and blood in urine. The total score can range from 0 (worst) to 36 (best).</description>

    <measure>HRQoL assessed by European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to first dose of study drug), on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, at time of early withdrawal, and at the Off-Treatment Visit (up to a maximum of 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 measure comprises 9 multiple-item scales and 6 single items. Multiple-item scales of QLQ-C30 consist of 6 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, social and global QoL) and 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain). Six single-item scales of QLQ-C30 involve dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact. All of the derived scales range in scores from 0 to 100. For the overall Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and functioning scales, a higher score is correlated with better HRQoL, whereas a higher score represents worse HRQoL for symptom scales.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HRQoL assessed by European Quality of Life (EuroQol) Five-Dimensional, 3-Level (EQ-5D-3L) questionnaire scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (prior to first dose of study drug), on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, at time of early withdrawal, and at the Off-Treatment Visit (up to a maximum of 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L generic QoL questionnaire is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has 3 levels:
(1) no problem, (2) some problem, or (3) extreme problem. Thus, the final scoring consists of 243 possible combinations or health states. The utility value for each state is assigned on the basis of a set of preference weights (tariffs) elicited from the general population.</description>

    <time_frame>the time from randomization to the date of disease progression after next line of therapy or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease is defined as the unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</description>
