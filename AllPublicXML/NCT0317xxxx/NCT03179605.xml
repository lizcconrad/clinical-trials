  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of DFD-06 to suppress the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis when applied twice daily for 15 days.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a 15-day, single arm, multicenter, multi-dose, open-label, two stage, sequential
      study. In the first stage, subjects who are at least 12 years of age and not more than 16.9
      years (16 years and 11 months) of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be
      treated with DFD-06 (at least 20 completed subjects). In the second stage subjects who are at
      least 6 years of age and not more than 11.9 years (11 years and 11 months) of age with
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be treated with DFD-06 (at least 20 completed
      subjects). An attempt will be made to enroll subjects throughout the age range of each cohort
      including the lower age range. DFD-06 will be applied twice daily to all affected areas on
      the body excluding face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas. Subjects must
      have ≥10% Body Surface Area (BSA) treated to achieve maximal use exposure.

             weight greater than or equal to 45 pounds at Screening.

          -  Subjects must present with a clinical diagnosis of stable (at least 3 months) plaque
             psoriasis.

          -  Subjects with psoriasis involving ≥10% Body Surface Area (BSA), not including the
             face, scalp, groin, axillae and other intertriginous areas at the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subjects must have an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) grade of at least 3
             (moderate) at the Baseline Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a current diagnosis of unstable forms of psoriasis including guttate,
             erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis.

          -  Subject has a history of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression, HIV, or other
             immunocompromised state.

          -  Subject has received treatment for any type of cancer within 5 years of the Baseline
             Visit except skin cancer and cervical cancer (in situ) are allowed if at least 1 year
             before the Baseline Visit.

          -  Subject has a history or presence of intracranial hypertension.

          -  Subject has had prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of ultraviolet
             radiation within 30 days prior to the initiation of treatment or is intending to have
