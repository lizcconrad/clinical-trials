  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to prospectively evaluate the outcomes of patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who undergo DEB-TACE (drug-eluting bead trans-arterial
      chemoembolization) with the Surefire Precision Infusion System for intentional effect of
      down-staging patients to OLT.

      Patients with HCC and who are considered candidates for liver transplantation but outside
      Milancriteria and meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the prospective single
      arm study.

      Results of the prospective cohort will be compared to matched historical control patients who
      were previously treated with DEB-TACE, delivered with standard endhole catheters. This
      includes all patients treated at the University of Colorado since 2009 treated with 100-300
      micron beads for whom follow-up is available.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution prospective clinical trial with historical matched controls.
      This protocol standardizes DEB-TACE delivery with the Surefire Precision Infusion System.
      This protocol does not change patient therapy. All patient safety monitoring, treatment
      procedures and follow-up procedures will be performed in accordance with standard clinical
      practice.

      Fifty (50) subjects will be enrolled in the prospective arm. Data from one hundred (100)
      historical randomly sampled control subjects (1:2 ratio) will be selected.

      Subjects will be followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, then every 3 months, following the
      initial DEB-TACE procedure until the subject receives a liver transplant or death. The study
      will be concluded upon completion of enrollment and follow-up of the 50 patients. It is
      estimated that the time to complete patient enrollment and follow-up is 24 months. The
      estimated date for study completion (complete primary analyses) is June 2018. This is based
      on the average survival vs. time to transplant at this center. If there are individual
      patients that extend beyond this period the time may be slightly extended.

    <description>The study duration for each patient is 24 months and includes a baseline visit, procedure visit and follow-up visits at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and every 3 months until liver transplant or death.
The following evaluations/activities will be performed at baseline: Informed consent, history, physical exam, data collection of CT/ MRI within 1 month of the visit date, data collection of lab values and quality of life questionnaire.
The treatment visit includes the DEB-TACE procedure with the Surefire Precision Infusion System. After the procedure, a Cone Beam CT of the liver will be performed to determine distribution and density of the beads in the tumor and adverse events monitoring.
The following evaluations / activities will be performed during the follow-up period: physical exam, data collection of contrast enhanced CT/MRI to evaluate tumor response, data collection of lab values, adverse event monitoring and quality of life questionnaire.</description>

    <description>All patients enrolled in this protocol will receive DEB-TACE, which is the standard of care prescribed by their physician. Standard 5 Fr and 3 Fr catheters will be used to perform diagnostic angiography to map the hepatic vasculature to the tumor. Using standard technique, the target vessel feeding the tumor will be catheterized and DEB-TACE administered using the Surefire Precision catheter. The Doxorubicin dosing used in the DEB-TACE will be based upon tumor volume. DEB-TACE will be administered until the first of the following endpoints are reached: Achievement of target dose with stasis, leeching of contrast through the expandable tip and development of distal intrahepatic collaterals.</description>
