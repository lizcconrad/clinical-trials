      This is a 5-part study. Part 1 is a double blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation,
      first-in-human study to assess the safety, tolerability and PK profiles following single oral
      administration of FDL176 to healthy male participants. Part 2 is a single dose, open-label
      study in healthy male participants to determine the effect of food on the PK profile of
      FDL176. Part 3 is a single dose, double blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy female
      participants to assess the PK, safety and tolerability profiles of FDL176. Part 4 is a
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and PK profiles following multiple oral administrations of FDL176 to healthy
      male and female participants. Part 5 is a single dose, open-label study in male and female
      participants with CF to determine the PK profile of FDL176.

             determined by the PI or delegate to be clinically relevant.

          -  Use of any prescription drugs within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             before the first dose of IMP, unless in the opinion of the Investigator (or delegate)
             and the Sponsor's Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise participant safety. Hormonal contraceptives are allowed.

          -  Use of any non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements
             within 14 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before the first dose of IMP,
             unless in the opinion of the Investigator (or delegate) and the Sponsor's Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise

          -  Current smoking or use of tobacco products or substitutes. Former smokers will be
             eligible, provided they have not smoked for at least 6 months before Day 1.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial involving receipt of an IMP within the past 90
             days or exposure to more than four new chemical entities with 12 months of the first
             dosing day.

        Exclusion Criteria (Part 5):

             Day 1.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a
