      This is a single center, randomized control. Sixty eligible subjects will be recruited into 3
      study treatment groups (n=20 per group) through computerized randomization. Subjects in group
      1 will be treated with 8% arginine containing paste(Colgate® Sensitive Pro-Relief™), group 2
      with 5% topical fluoride varnish (Acclean) and group 3 with self-adhesive resin (Seal and
      protect, Dentsply). The subjects in the study will be evaluated for tactile and air-blast
      hypersensitivity criteria at baseline, two and four weeks.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of three common professionally
      applied desensitizing agents in the reduction of dentine hypersensitivity over a period of 4
      weeks. Patients presenting to the dental clinic with Dentine hypersensitivity and fulfilling
      the inclusion criteria will be included in the study after taking informed consent.
      Participants will be divided into three groups. Sixty eligible subjects will be recruited
      into 3 study treatment groups (n=20 per group) through computerized randomization. Subjects
      in group 1 will be treated with 8% arginine containing paste(Colgate® Sensitive Pro-Relief™),
      group 2 with 5% topical fluoride varnish (Acclean) and group 3 with self-adhesive resin (Seal
      and protect, Dentsply). the subjects in the study will be evaluated for tactile and air-blast
      hypersensitivity criteria at baseline, two and at four weeks by another dentist who would be
      a blind assessor.

    <description>• Investigators are comparing the effectiveness of three professionally applied desensitizing agents, 8% arginine containing paste (Colgate® Sensitive Pro-Relief™), 5% fluoride varnish (Acclean) and self-adhesive resin (Seal and Protect, Dentsply) in reducing the dentine hypersensitivity immediately after application and at 2 and 4 weeks follow-up.The measurements of sensitivity will be determined by patient's response to air blast stimuli. Subjective responses will be recorded using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale which is scored as follows:
0 Subject does not respond to air stimulus,
Subject responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus
Subject responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus
Subject responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus</description>
