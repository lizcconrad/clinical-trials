  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in a non-antibiotic antimicrobial agent used in clinical medicine.
      Nevertheless, its antiplaque oral effect has not been evaluated. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is the
      gold standard as an antiplaque agent for its high substantivity in plaque and saliva. There
      are no published studies evaluating the substantivity of hypochlorous acid compared to CHX.
      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of mouthwashes of HOCl in substantivity evaluated by
      reduction of bacterial viability in saliva during 7 hours compared to CHX rinses and a
      placebo.

      Materials and Methods: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial with 75 participants was
      conducted. Participants were randomly assigned using block randomization in five groups: HOCl
      0.025% and 0.05%, CHX 0.12 and 0.2% and sterile water as placebo. Participants were
      instructed to use each rinse with 10 ml of each solution for 30 seconds after dental
      prophylaxis. Samples of saliva were taken at baseline and after 30 seconds, 1, 3.5 and 7
      hours to assess substantivity establishing the bacterial viability by the fluorescence method
      with the SYTO 9/propidium iodide dual staining. All participants were assessed with the
      Turesky visible plaque index at baseline and at 7 hours and adverse events were assessed. For
      the comparisons of the viability of the different rinses between times, the statistical test
      of generalized linear mixed model [GT1] adjusted to treatment, time and treatment-time
      interaction was used.

    <description>A survey was applied to each of the patients in order to record if any adverse effects occurred after the use of each of the interventions as burning and pain in the oral mucosa and was investigated by the taste of substances and sensation of dryness. An examiner evaluated the buccal, labial, lingual, pharyngeal and teeth tissues to establish changes and alterations visible to the clinical examination and the presence of candidiasis.</description>
