  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to predict cognitive decline using a performance endophenotype of
      neuro-feedback based on functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time in a population at
      risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research project, a longitudinal study in a healthy population that is under
      increased risk of developing AD will be performed. It is anticipated that some of the
      participating subjects will develop episodic memory decline within this longitudinal
      follow-up. The memory binding Test (MBT) and/or the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test
      (FCSRT), the most accurate and reliable available episodic memory tests, are going to be
      performed by the subjects at multiple longitudinal data collection points. The project
      proposes to develop a real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) task, and to
      test whether the subjects' performance on the task can predict the apparition of cognitive
      decline. The impact of other relevant biomarkers by adding them to the model: age, gender,
      number of APOE-e4 alleles, cognitive scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET), lifestyle habits and clinical background will be studied.
