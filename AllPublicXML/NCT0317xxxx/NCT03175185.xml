  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to carry out a psychological evaluation for the parents of children
      diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and parents of children
      without ADHD as control to detect any psychological problems in those of children with ADHD .
      These problems may be a precipitating factor to cause ADHD in their child or have a genetic
      predisposition to be passed to their children. On the other hand these psychological problems
      may be caused by the difficulties they encounter in raising their ADHD child. The exact
      relation needs more researches and to be more investigated.
