  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Before February 2018 the baseline survey is conducted in about 60 class in Brazilian
      secondary schools. These classes are randomized to control and intervention group in a 1/1
      manner. A few weeks thereafter medical students from the local medical school visit the
      schools and perform a smoking prevention intervention called &quot;photoaging mirroring
      intervention&quot; which takes about 45 minutes. One month and six months after the intervention
      the intervention group receives another anonymous questionnaire monitoring smoking status.
      The primary endpoint is the difference in the chance of smoking prevalence between the two
      groups.
