      Primary objective: To determine the changes in circadian activity rhythms and disease
      activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients from pre-treatment to one month after Enbrel
      initiation.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine if there is an association between changes in circadian rhythm and changes
           in disease activity in active RA after initiation of Enbrel

        -  To determine if the changes in circadian activity rhythms are associated with systemic
           inflammation in RA patients

        -  To determine changes in traditional sleep quality variables from pre-treatment to one
           month after Enbrel initiation in RA patients

    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and debilitating disease. However, the symptoms of RA
      show variation over the course of the day, with worsening symptoms in the morning. This
      worsening of symptoms in the morning is correlated with an increase in inflammation in the
      body.

      Biologic therapies, such as Enbrel (etanercept), appear to improve energy, pain and quality
      of life in patients with RA, and these changes may occur before a doctor is able to detect
      changes during the patient's physical examination. It is possible that a patient's response
      to biological agents can be rapidly determined by assessing circadian activity (also called
      &quot;rest-activity circadian rhythms&quot; or RAR).

      Currently, wrist actigraphy bands, which are worn for a period of time, can reliably provide
      information about RAR. Wrist actigraphy bands are small electronic devices worn on the wrist
      (similar to a watch) that records the subject's level of activity throughout the day. Studies
      in osteoarthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis have found subjects with joint pain to have
      significant differences in RAR, and disrupted RAR has been associated with disease activity.

      This study will provide information about 24-hour circadian activity rhythms before and after
      3-4 weeks of Enbrel treatment in study subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis. The study
      will assess patients who are starting on Enbrel that has been prescribed by their doctor.

      Serum specimens collected for this study will be immediately sent to the UC Davis clinical
      laboratory for analysis of RH and CRP. From each study visit, 0.5 ml serum will also be
      stored to potentially use for analyses of additional markers of inflammation such as
      interleukin-6 (IL-6). Serum samples will be de-identified; therefore only subject ID numbers
      will be labeled on the vials of serum.

        Investigators will utilized the UC Davis Cohort Discovery Tool to identify patients within
        the UC Davis healthcare system who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Investigators
        will then contact the patients' primary care provider and request permission to contact the
        patient about the study. Investigators will contact potential subjects to determine their
        interest and complete screenings by phone. Additionally, investigators plan to advertise
        the study on flyers posted in the hospital and community, as well as online notices on the
        Center for Musculoskeletal Health website.
