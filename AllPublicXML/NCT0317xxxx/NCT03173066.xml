      This proposal is based on findings from our previous work involving ferumoxytol-enhanced
      cardiac magnetic resonance angiography. The resolution of the pulmonary vasculature based on
      our previous imaging protocol was exceptional (PMID: 26786296). In the Partners Healthcare
      System between January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015 there were 541 patients evaluated in
      Partners Healthcare-affiliated hospitals with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and acute or
      chronic kidney disease at the same visit between 01/01/2014 and 01/01/2015. Ventilation
      perfusion scanning was performed in 201 patients during this same time interval. Up to 63% of
      these patients in one year did not receive the diagnostic test of choice.

    <textblock>
      Thromboembolic events in patients with chronic kidney disease are out of proportion to age
      matched controls occurring 2.34 times more frequently than in non-CKD patients (PMID
      19561505). At the same time, patients with kidney disease are not offered the gold standard
      for pulmonary embolus diagnosis, i.e. CT angiography, for concern of acute dialysis to treat
      contrast-induced nephropathy. Ventilation perfusion scintigraphy (V/Q) is the preferred
      diagnostic test for patients with advanced CKD (glomerular filtration rate &lt;30mL/min/m2) and
      suspicion of pulmonary embolus, but can not be utilized if pulmonary parenchyma contains
      interstitial edema or alveolar occlusion due to pneumonia. If diagnostic tools for pulmonary
      embolus are not available, patients are subject to the risk of empiric treatment to avoid
      life-threatening complications of untreated pulmonary embolus. For those patients with CKD
      that undergo CT angiography, they are placed at risk of initiating dialysis. If this occurs
      multiple financial costs are associated with dialysis catheter placement and acute
      hemodialysis. If a patient instead is evaluated with gadolinium-based contrast modalities,
      there is the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and the morbidity associated with this
      iatrogenic disease process.

      Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI could avoid the risk of iodinated contrast and gadolinium contrast
      and accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary embolus.
