  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with complications that may lead to multiorgan
      dysfunction and potentially to multi-organ failure after major surgery. Dexmedetomidine is a
      highly selective alpha(2)-adreno receptor agonist widely used during anesthesia. In animals,
      dexmedetomidine has shown protective effects in AKI after surgery. Dopamine (DA) is an
      organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that has been widely used
      to increased renal blood flow and urine output during surgery. However, the clinical effects
      of dexmedetomidine and dopamine on renal function are still controversial. The aim of this
      study is to investigate whether dexmedetomidine and dopamine have positive effects on renal
      function after selective major surgery.

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with complications that may lead to multiorgan
      dysfunction and potentially to multi-organ failure in critically ill patients. AKI accounts
      for 5-10% after general surgery to 45% after cardiac surgery during hospital stays and tends
      to be associated with increased length of hospital stay as well as increased morbidity and
      mortality. Even slight increases in postoperative serum creatinine concentrations have been
      associated with almost 5-fold increases in mortality. Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly
      selective alpha(2)-adreno receptor agonist that has analgesic, sedative, anxiolytic, and
      sympatholytic effects. In animals, dexmedetomidine has shown protective effects in several
      models of ischemia-reperfusion, which is thought to be the principal mechanism of AKI in the
      context of surgery. Dopamine (DA) is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and
      phenethylamine families that has been widely used to increased renal blood flow and urine
      output. However, the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine and dopamine on renal function are
      still controversial. The aim of this study is to investigate whether dexmedetomidine and
      dopamine have positive effects on renal function after selective major surgery.
