  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the reanimation neonatal department of the Nice's hospital, 34% of newborns admitted have
      an umbilical vein catheter (KTVO). Their parents are admitted 24h/24h by their side, where
      everything is done to set up the Attachment (participation in care, skin to skin, support of
      breastfeeding, ...).

      The benefits of skin to skin described in developmental care of the newborn in the neonatal
      health services are well established. Nevertheless, for supposed risks (infectious and
      displacement of the catheter), registered in the memory of the teams, this care is not
      currently carried out when the newborns are carrying an umbilical venous catheter.

      Sometimes, because of the presence of an umbilical venous catheter, parents and their
      newborns could not enjoy this moment of well-being in the first days of life. We therefore
      propose a study evaluating the current risks of skin to skin with an umbilical venous
      catheter by reflecting on a new protocol for laying and fixing this medical device.
