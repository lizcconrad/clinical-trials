  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cluster randomized effectiveness trial, pediatric primary care practices will be
      recruited from the American Academy of Pediatrics' national Pediatric Research in Office
      Settings (PROS) practice-based research network, as well as the client database of the
      Physician's Computer Company (PCC) - an Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendor. We will
      recruit 18 practices. 9 practices will be randomized to the Intervention arm and 9 practices
      to Usual Care. Intervention arm practices will select 1-2 pediatric clinicians to receive
      in-person training in Motivational Interviewing (MI), behavioral therapy, billing and coding,
      and study procedures. Usual Care practices will select 1-2 pediatric clinicians to receive
      billing / coding and study protocol training only, via telephone and webinar; they will be
      offered in-person MI training at the close of the trial. Around 316 parents of overweight or
      obese children (BMI &gt; 85th percentile for age and gender) between 3 and 8 years of age at
      baseline that are patients of participating Intervention arm clinicians will be enrolled.
      Over 24 months, these parents may receive up to 4 in-person, MI-based counseling sessions
      with a trained pediatric clinician and up to 6 telephone counseling sessions with an
      MI-trained Registered Dietician (RD). There will be no study-specific contact with parents or
      their children in Usual Care practices during the trial - they will continue to receive usual
      care. EHR and billing data for all 3-8 year old children within all participating practices
      will be extracted by PCC to permit determination of the effectiveness of the intervention
      versus usual care on change in BMI z-score among 3 groups: 1) all eligible children in the
      Intervention arm), 2) all eligible children whose parent actively participates in the trial ,
      and 3) all 3-8 year old children in all participating practices.

    <description>A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) will be the primary analytic approach where BMI z-score at 2 years amongst eligible youth is the primary outcome, and a 2 level primary independent variable &quot;TX&quot;: Usual Care=0, MI Intervention=1, along with baseline BMI z score as a covariate. Potential covariates include: days since baseline, sex, age, and ethnicity. The study employs a nested cohort design, with practices assigned to condition, as such, outcome variables at the individual level are correlated. To control for cluster randomization effects we will utilize SAS/PROC MIXED. For all mixed analyses, practice will be treated as a random effect with TX condition nested in practice. Various autocorrelation structures will be tested, although simple unstructured (un) or variance components (vc) will be used for the random practice effect. Key potential effect modifiers include age, race, and gender and on the provider level, pediatrician vs. family practitioner.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness among patients of study clinicians trained in MI and whose parent actively participates in the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Although the primary intention to treat analyses described analytically above for primary outcome will include all patients assigned to groups regardless of intervention exposure, as a secondary analysis, we will examine effects among the subsample of children who parents actively participated in the intervention. As indicated, active participation is defined as a parent receiving at least 1 MI counseling session from either a trained clinician or registered dietician. The same GLMM modeling approach discussed above will be employed to test this secondary aim.</description>

    <description>To assess the effect of the intervention at the population level, we will employ a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) approach, similar to the analytic plan for AIM I, where BMI z-score at 2 years is the DV, and a 2 level primary independent variable &quot;TX&quot;: Usual Care=0, MI Training=1, along with baseline BMI z score as a covariate. Data from all age-eligible children in all participating practices will be included in the analysis.</description>

    <ipd_description>Given the minimal risk associated with the intervention, we will utilize an internal DSMB with the addition of two outside members. Drs. Resnicow, Wasserman, and Fiks, will comprise the internal members. In addition Drs. Sarah Barlow and Robert Siegel, who both served on the DSMB for BMI2, will comprise the outside members. The DSMB will meet once to twice per year to review study progress, e.g., recruitment, retention, drop out as well as possible adverse events. We will exclude any study investigators as voting members of the DSMB. The PIs from the University of Michigan and AAP will attend all meetings but will not participate in any voting.</ipd_description>
