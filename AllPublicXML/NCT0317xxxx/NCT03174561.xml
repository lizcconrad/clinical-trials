      In this study patients diagnosed using Rome IV criteria with irritable bowel syndrome with
      constipation are included. The study was approved by the Ethic Committee of the University of
      Medicine and Pharmacy &quot;Gr. T Popa&quot; Iasi to be conducted at the Institute of Gastroenterology
      and Hepatology of Clinical Emergency Hospital &quot;Sf. Spiridon&quot; Iasi. The patients are assigned
      after a randomized scheme to one of the groups: diet restriction scheme or diet restriction
      scheme plus a product with inuline, choline and silymarin. After 28 days the patients are
      crossed between the groups and followed for additional 28 days diet scheme with or without
      inuline, choline and silymarin supplementation. All the patients are evaluated initially, in
      the day 28 and in the day 57 for the stool habits, stool characteristics using Brystol Scale
      and symptoms severity (abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, bloating severity,
      patients satisfaction in relation with stool frequency and the impact of IBS on daily
      activity) as appreciated by the patients for the last 10 days.
