          4. Patients have received at least six cycle system chemotherapy based irinotecan or
             oxaliplatin and got a failure outcome; or patients who are intolerance of operation.

          5. No intervention therapy was received for liver lesions during one year.

          6. Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months

          7. Child-pugh's grade A or B (no more than 7 score).

          9. Signed, written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with extrahepatic metastasis

          2. Patients has received TACE,ablation and iodine seed implantation for liver lesions
             during one year.

          3. With obvious arterio-venous fistula

          4. Patients suffered with other cancer(Except for cured basal or squamous cell skin
             cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ)

          5. Hematologic function: leukocytes ＜3000cell/mm3, platelets＜50000/mm3, with no
             hypersplenism.

          6. Adequate renal function (creatinine ≤ 2.0mg/dl)
