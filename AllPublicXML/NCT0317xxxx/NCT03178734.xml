      The purpose of this study is to compare UTI rates and patient satisfaction associated with
      indwelling Foley catheter verses a valved catheter in patients who are being discharged home

      The purpose of this study is to compare UTI rates and patient satisfaction associated with
      indwelling Foley catheter verses a valved catheter in patients who are being discharged home
      with a catheter after urogynecologic procedures via a Randomized Clinical Trial. Total number
      of participants will be 100. Inclusion criteria is all patients undergoing pelvic
      reconstructive surgery/anti-incontinence procedures who are planned to be discharged home
      with a catheter. Exclusion criteria is intra-operative bladder injury during index surgery;
      intra-operative complication requiring continuous bladder drainage; and/or dementia/altered
      cognitive function.
