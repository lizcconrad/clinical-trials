      High blood pressure can cause physical changes to the blood vessels of the body (remodeling).
      If a person who has high blood pressure also has a lot of blood vessel remodeling with their
      condition, they are more likely to have poor results with medical treatment for hypertension.
      The researchers examine the impact of different classes of drugs that doctors use to treat
      high blood pressure (hypertension) on blood vessel remodeling. Some drugs that doctors
      prescribe for their patients contain a &quot;sulfhydryl group&quot; (a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen
      atom). Drugs that have the sulfhydryl group may reduce blood vessel remodeling more that
      drugs that do not. For this study, participants who have high blood pressure perform the
      experiments, take a drug for 16-weeks to lower blood pressure, and repeat the experiments.
      The researchers randomly assign one of three drugs to participants who have high blood
      pressure: a diuretic (&quot;water pill&quot;), a drug containing a sulfhydryl (SH) group, or a drug
      that does not contain a sulfhydryl group. Participants who do not have high blood pressure
      perform the experiments, but do not take any of the drugs. In some of our experiments, the
      researchers use a technique called &quot;microdialysis&quot; (MD). With MD, the researchers perfuse
      some research drugs into the skin on the forearm through tiny tubing that mimics capillaries.
      These MD drugs mimic or block substances the body naturally makes to control the small blood
      vessels in the skin. The drugs remain in nickel-sized areas around the tubing and do not go
      into the rest of the body. The researchers also analyze very small skin samples (skin biopsy)
      obtained from the forearm. Lastly, the researchers use a standard technique called &quot;flow
      mediated dilation&quot; (FMD) that uses blood pressure cuffs and ultrasound to look at the health
      of larger blood vessels in the body. FMD includes placing a small tablet of nitroglycerin
      under the tongue during part of the test.

      Upon initial screening and again within a week of testing, all subjects will have an
      assessment of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Subject screening will be performed by the
      Penn State Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) medical staff and will include a
      physical exam by a clinician, anthropometry, and a chemical and lipid profile, liver and
      renal function. Women will be either postmenopausal (absence of menstruation of &gt;1 year and
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) &gt;25 milli-international units per milliliter (mlU/ml)) and
      not be taking hormone replacement therapy, or normally menstruating and tested in the early
      follicular phase of their cycle. Subjects will also go through an assessment of conduit
      vessel endothelial and vascular smooth muscle function with brachial artery flow-mediated
      vasodilation (FMD), and sublingual nitroglycerin.

      Subjects will undergo initial microdialysis experiments and biopsy samples will be obtained.
      Subjects will then be randomly assigned to treatment group. Blood pressure will be monitored
      every 2 weeks and weekly compliance checks will be made by the researcher's nurse
      coordinator. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be conducted monthly to
      determine the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment and to inform dosing titration.
      Examining pharmacokinetic and dynamic data from the literature indicate that blood pressure
      lowing and peripheral vascular effects are maximized by 12 weeks of antihypertensive therapy
      and maintained thereafter. After 16 weeks of the assigned intervention, subjects will repeat
      microdialysis experiments and additional cutaneous biopsy samples will be obtained. Conduit
      artery measures including brachial artery FMD and responsiveness to sublingual nitroglycerin
      will also be evaluated at this time.
