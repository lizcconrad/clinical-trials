      The purpose of this study is to see the safety and efficient of neoantigen reactive T cells
      (NRTs) combined with programmed cell death-1(PD-1) inhibitor（SHR-1210）in the treatment of
      Chinese patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The tumor-specific &quot;none-self&quot; immunogenic neoantigens encoded by either viral genes or
      somatic mutation genes, possess the potential to induce specific anti-cancer immunity,
      including cellular and humoral immune responses. Today, numerous clinical trials demonstrate
      that although these &quot;none-self&quot; antigens initiate the antigen-specific immunoglobulin G
      antibodies and cluster of differentiation 4（CD4）+/cluster of differentiation 8（CD8）+T-cells
      response, not all of them show a clinical benefit in the response rate, progression-free
      survival or overall survival.Immune tolerance induced by PD-1 or programmed cell
      death-ligand1（ PD-L1）maybe play a vital role for these negative outcomes.Personalized cell
      therapy plus checkpoint inhibitors maybe own a breakthrough in the treatment of those
      malignant diseases without standard options.Our center has successfully established a new
      method for preparing personalized neoantigen reactive T cells(NRTS) for adoptive cell
      therapy(ACT). Today, we will carry out a single center single arm clinical prospective study
      of NRTs combined with PD-1 inhibitor(SHR-1210) for the treatment of Chinese patients with
      advanced refractory solid tumors. Participants are assigned to receive 4 circles of cell
      therapy,and prior to each cycle's immunocytes treatment,preconditional chemotherapy and
      SHR-1210 will be carried out, and IL-2 continuous intravenous infusion（CIV） will also be
      given for 5 consecutive days after each time's cell infusion. The safety and clinical
      response rate（RR） are evaluated. Biomarkers and immunological markers are also monitored.
