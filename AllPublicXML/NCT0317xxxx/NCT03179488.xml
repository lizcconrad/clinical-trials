  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intensity used during transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in both,
      clinical practice and research studies, is often based on subjective commands such as &quot;strong
      but comfortable sensation&quot;. There is not consensus regarding the effectiveness dose of TENS
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy volunteers will divide into two groups: Therapist 1 and Therapist 2. Both
      therapist will apply spinal TENS and sham stimulation for 40min in random order to each
      subject, at an intensity to produce a &quot;strong but comfortable sensation&quot;.
