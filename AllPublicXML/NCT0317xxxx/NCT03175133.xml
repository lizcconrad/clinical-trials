  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will pilot a strengthening intervention targeted to muscles found to be important
      to gait in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies that have tried to
      strengthen leg and trunk muscles in people with MS have failed to improve walking ability
      consistently. The investigators think that is because strengthening exercises were not
      targeted to the correct muscle groups. For this study the investigators propose targeting
      muscle groups that they have found to be strong contributors to walking in a prior study.
      This is the first study to target these muscles, so the investigators propose doing a small
      trial to first evaluate the feasibility of the strength program and the outcomes. The
      investigators will measure strength and walking measures twice before and once after an
      8-week strengthening intervention in a single group of 10 people with MS who are able to walk
      independently. The results of this study will help inform future, larger trials that could
      change the way strength training is conducted in people with MS.

    <description>Strength exercises for ankle PF, hip abduction, and trunk muscles. Exercises will be done in three standard positions of supine, sidelying, prone, seated, and standing. Exercises during the initial 4 weeks will be completed 2x week with supervision of a physical therapist and 2x week at home, for a total of 4x week. For the final 4 weeks of the intervention will be completed 1x week with supervision and 3x week at home.</description>
