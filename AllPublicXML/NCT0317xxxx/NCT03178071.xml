  <brief_summary>

      This expanded access study has being designed following a demand from the FDA, given the
      increase in the number of request for single patient INDs for lorlatinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that an Expanded Access study does not meet the definition of a controlled clinical
      investigation, and as such, is not considered an applicable drug clinical trial per NIH,
      Basic Results for such studies are not required to be reported. Protocol B7461020 has been
      identified as an Expanded Access trial, and has been registered to ClinicalTrials.gov,
      however Basic Results will not be posted. This statement has been placed in the Detailed
      Description section of the protocol registration on ClinicalTrials.gov.
