  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Inovium Ovarian Rejuvenation Treatment is a PRP-based autologous treatment used in
      combination with a stimulated IVF sequence and Pre-Implantation Genetic Screening to treat
      infertility in women experiencing menopause, perimenopause, and premature ovarian failure.

    <textblock>
      This research extends earlier work conducted by Inovium associates in Athens, Greece who
      demonstrated efficacy of intraovarian injection of autologous PRP for resumption of menses,
      hormone stabilization, and conception after IVF in multiple women following PRP+natural cycle
      IVF (i.e., without gonadotropin stimulation). The use of stimulation (gonadotropins) and
      targeted pre- and posttreatment hormone monitoring during this clinical trial aims to
      characterize more fully the transition from PRP dosing, embryogenesis, IVF and conception.

      The current study seeks to describe how PRP works to rejuvenate immune system and ovarian
      stem cells, restore menses, provide hormone stability, and generate successful IVF sequences
      and conceptions. The quality of all embryos generated will be studied via PGS, with the goal
      of generating euploid embryos. Hormone stability and biomarkers of aging will also be
      evaluated to understand the extent of any observed benefits, and to estimate how long such
      effects may be sustained with a single PRP treatment.

      Autologous activated PRP used in this clinical study is isolated from patient derived (blood)
      samples collected on-site, using FDA-approved Regenlab [Lausanne, Switzerland] BCT-1 PRP Kit
      and RegenLab Drucker Centrifuge (FDA 510(k)-Approval #BK110061; ISO#13485).

    <description>PRP is freshly isolated from patients with diminished ovarian reserve as determined by at least one prior IVF cycle canceled for poor follicular recruitment response, or estimated by serum AMH and/or FSH, no menses for â‰¥1 year. Immediately following substrate isolation and activation with calcium gluconate, approximately 5 mL of autologous PRP is injected into each ovary under direct transvaginal sonogram guidance. AMH, FSH, and serum estradiol data will be recorded at 2wk intervals post-PRP and compared to baseline (pre-PRP) values.</description>

    <description>Data collected from all patients in the Treatment Group will be compared to a dataset compiled from 25 - 50 women of similar age having received like treatment via IVF and gonadotropin stimulation for positive fertility outcomes in past clinical work at the Center for Advanced Genetics, as a comparison model and substitute control group. The purpose of this comparison will be to determine overall efficacy of the Inovium Ovarian Rejuvenation Treatment as separated from the standard efficacy rates of CAG-established IVF processes and gonadotropins used in the trial.</description>

      <doc_comment>This investigation extends PRP application to ovarian tissue with a view to document impact on ovarian reserve among women attending for infertility treatment. While autologous PRP has been successfully applied therapeutically to various tissues to accelerate healing and wound repair, this is the first description of direct injection of activated PRP into the human ovary of poor prognosis IVF patients. Evidence of improved ovarian function was noted in all who received intraovarian PRP, possibly as early as two months after treatment. Additional research is needed to clarify which PRP components are responsible for altered ovarian function.</doc_comment>
