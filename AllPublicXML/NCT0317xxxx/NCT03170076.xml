  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that
           primarily affects the liver. It is one of the main causes of chronic liver diseases
           worldwide .

        -  According to World Health Organization (WHO), 2011 , Egypt has particularly high rates
           of Hepatitis C (22%).

        -  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to induce both hepatic and extra-hepatic
           manifestations. About 17% of HCV patients present with at least one skin manifestation,
           which can be directly or indirectly induced by chronic HCV infection .

      -  Skin diseases which are certainly related with chronic HCV infection are mixed
           cryoglobulinemia, lichen planus , porphyria cutanea tarda, Chronic pruritus and
           necrolytic acral erythema; conditions that may share a possible association with HCV
           infection .

        -  while several immune-mediated inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis, chronic
           urticaria and vitiligo, have been only rarely reported in the setting of chronic HCV
           infection .

        -  Peginterferon based regimen with or without ribavirin were the mainstay of HCV treatment
           with a cure rate of about 50%, Although these regimens were lengthy, complex, had
           significant side-effects and high failure rates .

        -  They also had higher rate of exacerbated dermatologic conditions such as discoid lupus,
           psoriasis and Lichen planus .

        -  Recently, Newer all-oral anti viral drugs regimens began to be approved for use in 2014.
           These regimens, involve one pill daily for 12 weeks, they have achieved sustained
           virologic response of over 90% and have more tolerable side effect profiles.

        -  Recently, The European Association for Study of Liver (EASL) 2015, American Association
           for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and Infectious Diseases Society of America
           (IDSA) have now recommended that all chronically infected HCV patient should be offered
           treatment with new oral antiviral drugs .
