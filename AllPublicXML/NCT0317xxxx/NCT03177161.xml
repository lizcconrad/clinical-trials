  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) is a questionnaire that asks patients for their
      views on their own health or the impact of healthcare they have received on their health and
      quality of life (RCN, 2011). The benefit of PROMS is that they gather information from the
      patient's perspective, which offers great potential to improve the quality and outcomes of
      health services (Department of Health 2011).

      There is a PROM (the PROMIS-10 Global Health) and a number of extra questions that are
      recommended for use in people who have had a stroke by the International Consortium for
      Health Outcomes Measurement, but the best way of delivering these questions for stroke
      survivors is unknown.

      At present, the NHS in England, Scotland and Wales are required to offer every stroke
      survivors a 6 month post stroke follow-up appointment. Currently, the information collected
      at the 6 month review is not from the patient's perspective and the best method of collecting
      this information has not been established. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme
      (SSNAP) which is led by the Royal College of Physicians in London promote the 6 month
      follow-up assessment. SSNAP recognise that currently 4 different methods of 6 month follow-up
      appointment occur. The current methods in use are face-to-face assessment, telephone
      interview, online questionnaire or postal questionnaire.

      The aim of this research is to understand if there is a difference between these 4 methods of
      delivering these questions in people who have had a stroke.

      As part of the 6 month review this research study will assess the response rate for 15
      Patient Reported Health Status questions across the 4 recognised methods of delivery;

        -  Face-to-Face

        -  Telephone

        -  Online

        -  Post

      To conduct this research study a sample of 808 stroke survivors will be asked to take part in
      the research. From these 808 people, 202 participants will be randomly assigned to each
      method of administration (Face-to-Face Interview, Telephone Interview, Postal Questionnaire
      and Online Questionnaire).

      The questionnaires received by the research team will not record any personally identifiable
      information. The data will then be utilised by the researchers for statistical analysis in
      order to identify, which method of the 4 methods of administration, under investigation, is
      the most acceptable for stroke survivors. The conclusions of this research will inform the
      roll-out of the most appropriate method of delivering the 6 month stroke follow-up review for
      stroke survivors.
