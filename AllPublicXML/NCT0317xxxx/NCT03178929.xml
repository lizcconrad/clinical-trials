      Primary liver cancer is now a major health problem. In the worldwide, PLC is the fifth most
      common cancer in male, the seventh in female, and has the second highest rate to cause death
      for men . Although the recent advances in treatment of Primary liver cancer have
      significantly improved the prognosis of patients with Primary liver cancer, the overall
      survival rate is still unsatisfactory. One of the reasons for the poor prognosis of Primary
      liver cancer is its high rate of recurrence. Anti-relapse treatment remains a pressing work
      to do.

      In recent years, some study reported that SAMe had an impact on promoting apoptosis and
      inhibiting the growth on breast cancer, colon cancer, gastric cancer and liver cancer in
      vitro and vivo.

      In this study, we aim to examine whether SAMe have an effect on improving patients'
      recurrence after radical treatment of Primary liver cancer.
