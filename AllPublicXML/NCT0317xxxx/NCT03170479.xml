      i. To examine the impact of malnutrition on development quotient of children

      ii. To determine the effectiveness of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) in improving the
      development quotient of severe acute malnourished children under five year of age.

      iii. To investigate the outcome of Vitamin D therapeutic doses intervention with RUTF
      rehabilitation on growth and development of malnourished children.

      1. Research Instrument: For Development quotient Denver 2 screening form and tools will be
           used. Follow up of patients for three months and for recording of their weight Community
           management of acute malnutrition forms will be used. Denver screening tool will be used
           for child development quotient covering all areas of development, fine motor, gross
           motor, language and personal social contact.

        2. Research Settings: The study will be conducted in Dera Ghazi Khan division at, Basic
           Health Units (BHU).

        3. Study design: Randomized Controlled Trial.

        4. Data Collection: Lady Health Visitors (LHWs) will screen the children aged 6 months to
           59 months in their community and will refer the severely malnourished children to
           Outpatient Therapeutic Programs (OTPs).Two groups of malnourished children will be made
           one study and one control group; one group will be treated with RUTF and extra virgin
           olive oil as placebo. Other will with RUTF and two mega doses of Vitamin D randomly,
           first after 15 days of enrollment and second after 15 days of first dose.
