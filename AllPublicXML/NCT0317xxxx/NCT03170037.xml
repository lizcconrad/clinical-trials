      This study hypothesizes that a novel reversal V-E ventilation technique will retain its high
      efficiency as that of standard V-E technique and will be easier to use.

    <textblock>
      Despite advances in intubation technology, difficult airways persist. Because it is failure
      to oxygenate, not failure to intubate, that ultimately leads to brain injury and
      cardiovascular collapse, effective mask ventilation is at least as important as successful
      intubation. Therefore optimizing mask ventilation is crucial for clinicians. When difficult
      mask ventilation encounters, clinicians often switch to two hand technique to hold the mask
      including either &quot;C-E&quot; clamp or &quot;V-E&quot; clamp. Both volume mode ventilation and pressure mode
      ventilation are superior with the V-E technique as compared to the C-E technique. The study
      will test the hypothesis that a novel reversal V-E mask ventilation technique will retain its
      high efficiency as that of standard V-E technique but be easier to use than standard V-E
      technique.

    <description>After induction of anesthesia subject will be ventilated using the standard V-E ventilation technique. Ventilation will be carried out using pressure mode ventilation at respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, I:E ratio of 1:2, peak inspiratory pressure of 20cmH2O and no PEEP. If the subjects can be adequately ventilated, as defined by perceivable chest movement and end tidal CO2 during the first three breaths, ventilation will continue for total ten breaths.</description>

    <description>For the two-handed standard V-E technique, the facemask is first placed over the bridge of the nose and mouth and then held in place by performing at two-handed jaw thrust maneuver with the index and second finger of each hand and maintaining mask contact with the patient's face by using both thumbs with mouth open. A head-tilt is performed by applying a caudal force on the mandible and mask.</description>
