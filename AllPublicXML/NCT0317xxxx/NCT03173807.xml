    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of nutrition and exercise counseling
      program for reducing the incidence of metabolic syndrome in prostate cancer patients on
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the role of dietary modifications and exercise in patients
      started on ADT for preventing and or delaying metabolic syndrome in this aging population.
      The study will employ a randomized, 2-arm wait-control design. Subjects will be randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio into two arms: dietary modifications and exercise counseling (Arm A) or standard
      of care (Arm B). The duration of intervention in Arm A will be 24 months. At 12 months,
      participants in Arm B will be offered the same intervention that Arm A received during months
      1-12. Medical records will be accessed up to 5 years for standard of care visits. The goal of
      this project is to generate preliminary data on the feasibility of applying such an
      intervention on a much bigger population with approximately 100 subjects on each arm. For
      this pilot, we aim to randomize 20 patients to each arm. The principal investigator or
      co-investigators who are evaluating the patient will perform the randomization since this is
      an open-label, non-therapeutic study. The ADT received by patients on both arms is considered
      standard of care therapy for their prostate cancer.
