  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fact that still exist is which method for repairing of secondary cleft palatal fistula is
      the best. This study will have shown whether using of Acellular dermal Matrix decreased the
      fistula formation versus using Conchal Cartilage during secondary fistula. Among studies that
      published, they have not consensus for using acellular dermal matrix. Most of the questions
      are about cost effectiveness, time that surgery and rehabilitation need and patient risk (
      risk of transmission disease from other human tissue )

      Observational study composed of a prospective cohort group receiving ADM compared to a
      retrospective historical cohort group with Conchal Cartilage.

      Primary objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether ADM would lower the incidence of
      palatal fistula in patients undergoing secondary cleft palate fistula repair.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. hypo nasality speech after surgery

        2. Improvement Speech Score
