  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: this double-blind split-mouth clinical trial study was performed to evaluate the
      clinical and radiographic effect of local delivery of lovastatin gel as an adjunct to scaling
      and root planning (SRP) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis.

      Method and Materials: 15 patients with two mandibular molar teeth with probing depth (PD)≥3
      mm, clinical attachment level (CAL)≥3 mm and bone loss more than 3 mm according to parallel
      periapical x-ray and distance from CEJ to alveolar crest, were selected.Totally 24 mandibular
      molars were selected for the study.

      Clinical periodontal parameters included PD, CAL, bleeding index(BI), plaque index(PI) were
      recorded for the selected teeth at baseline and at 1,3 and 6 months. Radiographic assessments
      were performed at baseline and after 6 months. At one side the pockets around randomly
      selected molar were injected with a blunt syringe filled with lovastatin gel 1.2%( case
      group=B), and on the other side, the pockets were filled with a placebo gel by a blunt
      syringe ( control group=A).Two-way repeated measure ANOVA test and T-test were used for
      statistic analysis Spss 23.( P&lt;0.05) was considered significant.

      Statins are an important group of hypolipidemic drugs that are able to modulate inflammation
      and alveolar bone loss. Rosuvastatin (RSV) and atorvastatin (ATV) are known to inhibit
      osteoclastic bone resorption and have been proposed to have osteostimulative properties.
