  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The performance of hepatectomy for liver tumors using the thoraco-abdominal approach (TAA)
      versus the abdominal approach (AA) is still debated.

      The aim of the study is the analysis of the perioperative outcome of patients operated with
      or without the TAA for liver tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospectively maintained database was queried. A 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis
      was applied. Among 744 patients, 246 undergoing hepatectomy with TAA and 246 undergoing
      hepatectomy with AA were compared. These patients were matched for baseline characteristics,
      underlying liver disease, comorbidity, tumor features, and extent of the resection. The rates
      of morbidity and mortality were the study endpoints.
