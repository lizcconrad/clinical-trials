    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of TGR-1202 in R/R FL.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Determine the genetic and other novel biological markers that may be predictive of
           response or resistance to TGR-1202 in patients with relapsed or refractory FL.

        -  Describe the Progression Free Survival (PFS), Duration of Response (DoR) after treatment
           with TGR-1202.

        -  Describe the number of dose delays and dose reductions and other safety profile.

      This is an open label, phase II study of TGR-1202 in patients with relapsed or refractory
      (R/R) Grade 1, 2, or 3A follicular lymphoma (FL). FL is the most common subtype of indolent
      lymphoma. The prognosis of FL depends on the histologic grade, stage, treatment and age of
      the patient. More recently, efforts have been made to find novel regimens for the treatment
      of relapsed FL that do not contain non-specific cytotoxic agents.

      One of the important goals of this phase II study is to discover novel genetic, biochemical,
      and immunological markers that are associated with the response and safety of TGR-1202 in
      patients with FL. TGR-1202 blocks PI3K, a signal that is required for cancer to grow.
