    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the reduction of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) by evinacumab in comparison to placebo after 16 weeks in patients with
      primary hypercholesterolemia (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia [HeFH], or non-HeFH
      with a history of clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [clinical ASCVD]) with
      LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) despite maximally tolerated statin and proprotein convertase
      subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor therapy.
