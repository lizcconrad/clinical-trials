    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ponatinib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST after prior failure
      or intolerability of imatinib. Patients will be enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts based on absence
      (Cohort A) or presence (Cohort B) of KIT exon 13 resistance mutations as measured by liquid
      biopsy. A third cohort (Cohort C) will include patients who have received all approved lines
      of TKI treatments (imatinib, sunitinib and regorafenib).

      Primary Objective

        -  To assess clinical benefit of ponatinib in patients with KIT or PDGFRA mutant GIST
           defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR), which is the composite of complete response
           (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) at ≥16 weeks after start of
           treatment per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (modified RECIST 1.1
           [Demetri et al., 2013]) as a measure of disease control

        -  Two cohorts for second-line patients will be used: Cohort A: patients with secondary
           resistance mutations in other exons or no resistance mutations (as measured by liquid
           biopsy in circulating DNA); Cohort B: patients with evidence of secondary resistance
           mutations in exon 13 as assessed on progressing lesions or in circulating DNA

        -  One additional Cohort (Cohort C) will include heavily pretreated patients (failure of at
           least all approved lines of therapy) regardless of secondary mutation Secondary
           Objectives

        -  To assess progression-free survival (PFS) in each cohort and in the total patient
           population

        -  To assess objective response rate (ORR) in each cohort and in the total patient
           population

        -  To assess overall survival (OS) in each cohort and in the total patient population

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ponatinib in the total patient population

        -  To assess Quality of Life (QoL) Exploratory Objectives

        -  To assess limited elements of pharmacokinetics (PK) in the total patient population

        -  To explore the relationship between GIST genotype and CBR with ponatinib

        -  To explore the feasibility of detecting mutations in KIT and possibly other
           cancer-related genes using circulating nucleic acids derived from blood samples

        -  To explore the usefulness of &quot;liquid biopsies&quot; to predict treatment response and
           development of resistance

        -  To assess duration of follow-up treatment

      Primary Endpoint

        -  CBR consisting of CR+PR+SD by modified RECIST 1.1 (Demetri et al., 2013) at 16 weeks in
           patients with imatinib-resistant GIST (KIT-mutant) with other or no resistance mutations
           (Cohort A) and secondary resistance mutation in exon 13 (Cohort B) Secondary Endpoints

        -  PFS in each cohort and in the total patient population

        -  ORR (CR + PR) in each cohort and in the total patient population

        -  OS in each cohort and in the total patient population

        -  Safety and tolerability of ponatinib

        -  QoL

        -  CBR of Cohort C Exploratory Endpoints

        -  Correlation of plasma levels of ponatinib and response

        -  Molecular genetic features of GIST at baseline and after treatment with ponatinib

        -  Correlation of tumor DNA from available paraffin tissue with genotypes of plasma
           sequencing (&quot;liquid biopsies&quot;) and correlation of plasma genotype with treatment
           response, resistance and duration of follow-up treatment
