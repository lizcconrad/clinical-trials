  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to better understand how pre-existing pain and also discomfort/enjoyment during
      exercise may influence physical activity and be related to body weight the investigators are
      seeking to examine these as they relate to overweight/obesity compared to normal weight
      individuals. Ultimately, the investigators think that people with obesity may have more and
      be more sensitive to pain and have lower discomfort tolerance that may lead them to
      experience exercise more negatively. In the real world, this could result in them stopping
      exercise sooner or avoiding exercise all together. Therefore it is important for the
      investigators to begin to understand this issue better. In addition, some preliminary studies
      in animals suggest that the quality of the diet may influence pain sensitivity. This has yet
      to be examined in humans. As such the investigators will examine whether self-reported diet
      quality and also some markers in participants' blood that can tell the investigators about
      the recent quality of a person's diet, are related to the measures of pain, enjoyment and
      discomfort during exercise.
