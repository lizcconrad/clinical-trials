  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A window of opportunity study which would allow brief treatment of HPV negative SCCHN with a
      CDK4/6 inhibitor, in the pre-operative setting, with biomarker analyses of pre and post
      treatment tissue. Given that the standard treatment for this population is surgical
      resection, this would not impact or alter standard therapy for this population. The goal will
      be to learn more about the alterations in pRB1 levels, as well as other signaling markers, in
      order to be able to eventually plan a biomarker driven treatment study.
