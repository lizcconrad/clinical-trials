  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Narcolepsy is a chronic, disabling condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness
      and, in some patients, falls in muscle tone related to emotions (cataplexies). It often
      begins in childhood or in young adults. Symptoms of narcolepsy are responsible for an
      important handicap in everyday life, and are often misunderstood by the family and
      professional environment. In addition, many comorbidities are associated with narcolepsy,
      such as depression, anxiety, or obesity.

      Few studies have examined the impact of narcolepsy on patients' educational background,
      socio-professional integration, and quality of life. In particular, the factors of
      professional handicap related to the characteristics of the disease and the determinants of
      the insertion of the patients remain poorly known.

      As a better understanding of these determinants could help to inform patients and guide them
      in their choices, NARCOWORK study aims at evaluating the academic and professional
      trajectories of a wide population of narcoleptic patients.
