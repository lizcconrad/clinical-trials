  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Do CHANGE service is designed for cardiac patients who could benefit from lifestyle
      change and a better disease management. The study aims to support patients with behavior
      change by providing them with devices and behavioral intervention in order to facilitate
      long-term behavior change.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The focus of the Do CHANGE project is on empowering individuals with high blood pressure,
      ischemic heart disease or heart failure with tools and services to optimally monitor and
      manage their real-time health condition and disease. The innovative approach of the Do CHANGE
      project also involves the patients' surrounding health ecosystem in the process. The
      traditional difficulties of therapy adherence in a physician-centred care system are
      radically abandoned and replaced by a patient-centred approach. The approach advocated by Do
      CHANGE project focuses on the needs of the patient by not only providing them with innovative
      tools that assess the patient's real-time health condition, but also offer a variety of
      behavioural alternatives. The main hypothesis of the Do CHANGE project is that patients'
      disease self-management and lifestyle will improve as compared to self-management of patients
      who receive the care as usual.

    <description>Lifestyle change will be measured with the HPLP-II questionnaire which assesses multiple domains of lifestyle. This will make it possible to compare the two groups.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed with the WHOQoL-Bref which is a validated questionnaire and taps into different domains of quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Behavioral flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>With the Do Something Different purpose designed questionnaire changes in behavioral flexibility will be measured. This programme has previously shown to be effective in changing lifestyle behaviors among physically healthy subjects.</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is expected that the intervention will not benefit all patients equally and that their might be certain subgroups of patients who are more likely to benefit from this type of approach. Patients with certain demographic and/or psychological profile (Type D personality which will be measured with the DS14 questionnaire) might be more likely to benefit than others.</description>

    <measure>Effects of intervention on physiological data</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is expected that patients' physiological data (in the intervention group) will be affected by the intervention such that we will be able to demonstrate changes in, for example, sleep patterns or patients' ECGs.</description>

    <description>Besides the behavior change programme (Do Something Different)
All patients will receive: Fitbit, Beddit, Care-portal, Do CHANGE app (including dietary habits picture taking), CookiT (smart spatula that monitors cooking behavior)
patients with heart failure will, in addition to the above mentioned, be offered a weight scale, blood pressure monitor, and FluiT (smart cup to measure fluid intake).
Patients with hypertension will also be offered a bloodpressure monitor.
Data from these devices will be gathered and visible for patients (in patient portal) and for their health care provider (health care provider portal). In case of negative results the patient will be contacted by their health care provider (usually the cardiologist).
Once every week the patients will be contacted to discuss their progress and will be given feedback about their dietary intake.</description>
