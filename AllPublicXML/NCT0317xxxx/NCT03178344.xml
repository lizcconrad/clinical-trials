  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) is one method that has been demonstrated
      to enhance alpha oscillations in healthy participants by applying weak electrical currents to
      the scalp to modulate rhythmic brain activity patterns. This study will involve tACS-induced
      frontal alpha oscillations, EEG recordings, and other physiological and biological measures.

    <intervention_model_description>Each participant will receive sham stimulation or 10Hz tACS stimulation at two separate sessions. The order will be randomized (ie, half the participants will receive sham stimulation at the first session and 10Hz tACS stimulation at the second session, and the other half will receive 10Hz tACS stimulation at the first session and sham stimulation at the second session).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study will follow a double-blind experimental design, so neither the participant nor the experimenter will know what kind of stimulation the participant is receiving at what session. A separate unblinded monitor, who will not interact with the participants, will be responsible for creating the stimulation codes for each session.</masking_description>
