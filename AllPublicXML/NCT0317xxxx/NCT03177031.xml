  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing study is undertaken to compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of
      two continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis produced by Fresenius Medical Care (FMC), i.e.
      Stay Safe® (STS) that is produced by a plant in Germany and Stay Safe Link® (SSL) that is
      produced in Malaysia. The study is an open labelled, randomised controlled trial where 434
      patients in total will be randomised to either STS or SSL in a 1:1 ratio.
