  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the most appropriated treatment in end stage renal failure patients
      in order to improve quality of life. However, patients have to take immunosuppressive drugs
      to prevent graft rejection. Tacrolimus is the most common immunosuppressive drug used now.
      However, tacrolimus has narrow therapeutic level and needs regularly therapeutic monitor
      because of inter-individual variation in dosage regimen. Not only age, body weight and drug
      interaction but also genetic factor in metabolic pathway of tacrolimus plays an important
      role in tacrolimus blood level. Previous data showed CYP3A5 genetic polymorphism was
      significant effect tacrolimus blood level. From previous study showed the mean dose of
      tacrolimus required for the induction phase was significantly higher (P= 0.006) in the
      CYP3A5*1/*1 group at 0.142±0.050 mg/kg/day than that required by patients who carried either
      the CYP3A5*1/*3 group of 0.097±0.040 mg/kg/day or the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of 0.077±0.020
      mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus maintenance dose required for CYP3A5*1/*1 group of 0.12±0.03 mg/kg/day
      was 1.3 times higher (P&lt;0.0001) than used for the CYP3A5*1/*3 at 0.09±0.03 mg/kg/day and 2.4
      times higher than the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of 0.05±0.02 mg/kg/day. Therefore, the investigators
      plan to investigate a prospective study to determine the clinical outcome of tacrolimus
      treatment in kidney transplant recipients between genotype guided dosage regimen group and
      conventional group.

      Objective

        1. To determine the clinical outcome of tacrolimus treatment in kidney transplant
           recipients between genotype guided dosage regimen group and conventional group

        2. To determine the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on clinical outcome of kidney
           transplantation recipients Review article Kidney transplantation is the most
           appropriated treatment in end stage renal failure patients in order to improve quality
           of life. National health security office of Thailand estimates the cost of kidney
           transplantation around 250,000 to 400,000 baht per patient. However, patients have to
           take immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine,
           mycophenolate, prednisolone etc. to prevent graft rejection. Tacrolimus is a common
           immunosuppressive drug used worldwide. However, tacrolimus has narrow therapeutic level
           and needs regularly therapeutic monitor because of inter-individual variation in dosage
           regimen. Achieving and maintaining target concentration of tacrolimus are related to
           tacrolimus toxicity and graft rejection. Not only age, body weight and drug interaction
           but also genetic factor in metabolic pathway of tacrolimus plays an important role in
           tacrolimus blood level.

      Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP3A5 are the main enzyme responsible for metabolism of
      tacrolimus. Unlike CYP3A4, CYP3A5 is more polymorphic and expression of enzyme is controlled
      by CYP3A5 gene variants. CYP3A5*3, an A to G transition (A6986G) within intron 3 results in
      the production of a truncated protein, is the most common allele variant. From previous study
      of our group, the allele frequency of CYP3A5*3 was 66% which is lower than those reported in
      the Caucasian population (85%). Prevalence of CYP3A5*1/*1, CYP3A5*1/*3, CYP3A5*3/*3 in 400
      healthy Thai volunteers are 13.75%, 42.75% and 43.50%, respectively (unpublished data).

      Patients who carried CYP3A5*1/*1 or CYP3A5*1/*3 allele showed tacrolimus clearance higher
      than CYP3A5*3/*3 patients (0.679 ± 0.195 vs 0.355 ± 0.091 L/h/kg). Therefore, CYP3A5*3/*3
      patients received 48% lower dose of tacrolimus than CYP3A5*1/*1 or CYP3A5*1/*3 patients in
      order to achieve the same therapeutic range.

      From our previous study showed the mean dose of tacrolimus required for the induction phase
      was significantly higher (P= 0.006) in the CYP3A5*1/*1 group at 0.142±0.050 mg/kg/day than
      that required by patients who carried either the CYP3A5*1/*3 group of 0.097±0.040 mg/kg/day
      or the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of 0.077±0.020 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus maintenance dose required for
      CYP3A5*1/*1 group of 0.12±0.03 mg/kg/day was 1.3 times higher (P&lt;0.0001) than used for the
      CYP3A5*1/*3 at 0.09±0.03 mg/kg/day and 2.4 times higher than the CYP3A5*3/*3 group of
      0.05±0.02 mg/kg/day.

      Previous prospective randomized study showed higher proportion of patients who received
      genotype guided tacrolimus dosage regimen had achieved the target blood level at day 3 after
      started tacrolimus than control group. This study did not show difference clinical outcome
      between two groups and follow period was short, only three months. This study investigated
      only in induction phase.

      Because most of studies investigated only in induction phase and follow up period was short.
      The present study will conduct a randomized prospective study to evaluate whether adaption of
      tacrolimus dosing according to CYP3A5 genotype in both induction and maintenance phase after
      transplantation can achieve target concentration than control group. Moreover, the present
      study will investigate the influence of CYP3A5 polymorphism on kidney transplant outcome.

      Methods This prospective, open label, randomized study will conduct at Nephrology Unit,
      Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand. This
      study was approved by Khon Kaen University Research Ethics Committee for Human Research, Khon
      Kaen University, Thailand (HE551389)

      The patients will randomly assigned to receive tacrolimus at either a fixed dosage
      (conventional group) or genotype guided dosage group.

        1. Induction Phase (0-4 weeks) Patients who will be assigned in conventional group will
           receive tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg /day. Patients who will be in genotype guided group, will
           receive tacrolimus depend on CYP3A5 genotype. CYP3A5*1/*1 patients will receive
           tacrolimus 0.125 mg/kg/day. CYP3A5*1/*3 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.1 mg/kg/day.
           CYP3A5*3/*3 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.08 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus target level for
           this phase will be 5-8 ng/ml.

        2. Maintenance Phase (5-24 weeks) Patients who will be in conventional group, will receive
           tacrolimus 0.08 mg/kg/day. Patients who will be in genotype guided group, will receive
           tacrolimus depend on CYP3A5 genotype. CYP3A5*1/*1 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.12
           mg/kg/day. CYP3A5*1/*3 patients will receive tacrolimus 0.08 mg/kg/day. CYP3A5*3/*3
           patients will receive tacrolimus 0.04 mg/kg/day. Tacrolimus target level for this phase
           will be 3-5 ng/ml.

        6. Welling to be volunteer in this study and sign the inform consent Exclusion criteria
           Kidney transplantation recipients who

      1. Refuse to join this study 2. Have history of drug allergy to tacrolimus 3. Is pregnancy
      and lactating Intervention All renal transplantation waiting list patients will invited to
      join this study and sign inform consent. The patients who will be enroll to this study, will
      be drawn the blood for 6 ml to perform CYP3A5 genotype assay.

      Patients who perform kidney transplantation and enrolled to this study will randomly assign
      in equal number to receive tacrolimus doses as in table 1, one hour before transplantation
      and after transplantation. Tacrolimus blood level, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr),
      will regularly perform on day 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14 and 28 during induction phase (1st-4th week
      after kidney transplantation). Moreover, urine 24 hour for Cr, protein will perform in day 7,
      14, 28 after transplantation. The physicians will modify the daily dose of tacrolimus
      according to their practice in order to achieve target range of trough concentration (5-8
      ng/ml). Patients will receive other immunosuppressive such as corticosteroid, mycophenolate
      mofetil as general practice.

      During maintenance phase (5th-24th week after kidney transplantation) tacrolimus doses will
      be adjusted as in table 1. Tacrolimus blood level, BUN/Cr and urine 24 hour for Cr and
      protein will be perform on 5, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 after transplantation. The physicians will
      modify the daily dose of tacrolimus according to their practice in order to achieve target
      range of trough concentration (3-5 ng/ml).

      DNA extraction and genotype Peripheral blood samples will collect from individual subjects.
      Genomic DNA sample will be extracted from buffy coat by QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini kit. CYP3A5
      genotype will be examined by Real-time polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR). Analysis of
      CYP3A5*3 will be performed using Custom TaqMan® Single nucleotide polymorphism Genotyping
      Assay (Applied Biosystem, Foster city, California) on an ABI PRISM® 7500 Real-Time PCR System
