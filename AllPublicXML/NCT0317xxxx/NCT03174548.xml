      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of food on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin relative
      to a fasted state in healthy adult male and female subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of food on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the main
           metabolite (sotagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide) relative to a fasted state in healthy adult
           male and female subjects.

        -  To investigate the relative bioavailability of sotagliflozin tablet to oral solution
           under fasting conditions

        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of single-dose sotagliflozin under fed and fasted
           conditions in healthy adult male and female subjects.

      The study duration per subject will be 26 to 83 days and will consist of a screening period
      of 2-28 days, a treatment period of 6 days each for Periods 1, 2 and 3, a washout between
      treatment periods of 1-14 days, and follow up visit 10-15 days after the last Investigational
      Medicinal Product administration in period 3.
