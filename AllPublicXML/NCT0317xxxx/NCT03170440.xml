  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently
      co-occur, and these patients often have disrupted sleep. Poor sleep quality is associated
      with several poor heath outcomes that overlap with those that are experienced in PTSD. These
      can include poor cognitive performance and difficulty with emotional regulation. Effective
      treatment of sleep problems in these individuals could substantially improve these symptoms
      and quality of life. Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive
      electrical stimulation technique that has been previously shown to moderate the response of
      the sympathetic nervous system and reduce hyperarousal in patients with mTBI and PTSD. In
      this study, our objective is to determine the effect of tVNS in changing sleep architecture
      and subjective sleep quality, as well as changing emotional and cognitive performance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently
      co-occur and these patients often have disrupted sleep. Patients with PTSD are more likely to
      wake up multiple times a night. Further, autonomic and behavioral components during sleep are
      consistent with a continued fight or flight defensive state while asleep. This includes
      higher heart rate, lower parasympathetic tone, and greater likelihood of nightmares. Further
      supporting this stress response, cortisol levels are inversely related to the proportion of
      slow wave sleep observed in these patients. PTSD is also associated with higher insomnia
      severity scores as well as regional neurotransmitter disruptions in systems critical for the
      regulation of affect. Poor sleep quality is associated with several poor health outcomes that
      overlap with those that are experienced in PTSD. These include poor cognitive performance and
      affective lability as well as associations with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and
      inflammatory diseases including arthritis. Prior research has argued that the etiology of
      large portion of PTSD related symptoms include disrupted sleep. Effective treatment of sleep
      problems in this population could have substantial impact on these symptoms and improve
      quality of life.

      Current prescription pharmacological approaches often have side effects like negative impact
      on sleep architecture, addiction, and cognitive performance consequences. Further, veterans
      often report that they use alcohol and other drugs in order to fall asleep and stop
      nightmares, compounding the issue. Vagal nerve stimulation approaches have potential,
      especially in this population, to improve sleep quality and to also improve
      emotional/cognitive state. Further, brain effects of vagal nerve stimulation include
      attenuated activation of limbic structures critical to manifestation of symptoms in PTSD
      including the amygdala as well as reduced physiological arousal including decreased blood
      pressure. Thus, our objective is to determine the effect of tVNS in changing sleep
      architecture and subjective quality including autonomic state and subsequent (next morning)
      emotional and cognitive performance in patients with PTSD (with and without mild TBI) and
      combat expose healthy controls.The study team will use a within-subject cross-over design in
      a sleep lab based study to assess the impact of tVNS administered at &quot;lights out&quot; on several
      critical sleep variables including sleep onset, sleep architecture and autonomic profile, and
      morning emotional state, sleep quality evaluation, and cognitive performance.
