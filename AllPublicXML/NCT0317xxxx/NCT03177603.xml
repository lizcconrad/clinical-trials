  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2586881, a purified intravenous (IV) formulation of soluble recombinant human Angiotensin
      Converting Enzyme (rhACE2) is being investigated as a treatment for PAH. This GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of GSK2586881 in subjects with PAH. This open-label, dose-escalation
      study will comprise of 4 separate groups based on the planned dose range, and subjects in
      each group will be administered a single dose of GSK2586881 ranging between 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, or
      1.2 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) via IV route. Dose escalation will occur after 4 subjects
      have been dosed per cohort and review of safety, tolerability, PK and hemodynamic data up to
      24 hours post dose has taken place. A maximum of 27 subjects will be included in the study
      and the total duration of the study will be up to a maximum of 59 days.
