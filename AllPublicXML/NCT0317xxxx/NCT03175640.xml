  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. is in the midst of an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. The common use of opioids
      among persons living with HIV, along with their common use of benzodiazepines, has resulted
      in high rates of opioid overdose among this population. This study will test the
      implementation of evidence-based training, mentoring, technical support, and academic
      detailing to encourage HIV physicians to adopt evidence-based interventions to reduce
      overdose risk and treat opioid addiction.

    <ipd_description>The investigators will make study data available to the community of scientists and the public in keeping with NIDA policies. After all data have been collected and the results of the major papers are in press, de-identified data will be made available to other qualified researchers on request. The request will be evaluated by Dr. Friedmann to ensure that it meets reasonable standards of scientific integrity. Ultimately, it is anticipated that de-identified data and codebooks will be warehoused and available through the ICPSR and SAMHDA websites. This data sharing plan will comply with the requirements of the privacy rule and federal regulations under HIPAA and 42 CFR Part 2 that govern the protection of individually identifiable information.</ipd_description>
