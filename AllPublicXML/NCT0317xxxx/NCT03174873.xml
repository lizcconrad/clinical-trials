    <textblock>
      Ray and colleagues define &quot;unexplained infertility&quot; as failure to achieve pregnancy when the
      semen analysis is normal, evidence for ovulation is present, and tubal patency has been
      established. The efficacy of treatment declines with increasing age and duration of
      infertility Infertility is a disease , defined by the failure to achieve a successful
      pregnancy after 12 months or more of appropriate, timed unprotected intercourse or
      therapeutic donor insemination, barber evaluation and treatment may be justified based on
      medical history and physical findings and is warranted after 6 months for women over age 35
      years.

      In unexplained infertility abnormalities are likely to be present but not detected by current
      methods including semen analysis in the man, assessment of the state of ovulation, ovulation
      reserve and patency of uterine tubes in the woman.

      unexplained infertility is not a rare item of infertility. Approximately 15% of infertility
      couple will be diagnosed with unexplained infertility after their diagnostic workup Many
      researches studied the laparoscopic tubal factor like tubo-ovarian relation, tubal kinks and
      fimbrial pathology. But we need to scope on more tubal factors like fatty mesosalpinx ,
      fimbria ovarica, methylene blue free spill and others
