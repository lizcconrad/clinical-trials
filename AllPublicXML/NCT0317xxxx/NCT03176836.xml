  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a cancer predisposition disorder in which most affected
      individuals develop cancer during their lifetime. The majority of LFS patients carry a
      mutation in a gene called TP53, whose normal function is to control cell growth and prevent
      cells with damaged DNA from becoming cancerous. There is currently no way to determine when,
      where or what type of tumour will develop. This project will use novel techniques utilizing
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine how sensitive they are at detecting very small
      tumors and how specific they are in terms of distinguishing malignant tumors from benign
      tumors.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Imaging traits include: signal heterogeneity, mass effect, and neurovascular bundle involvement (recorded on STIR MRI); necrosis, and signal/necrosis ratio (recorded on STIR and DW MRI): FDG metabolic activity and uptake (PET-MRI) or other additional imaging findings. Results will be combined and analyzed for &quot;extraction&quot; of imaging-gene expression phenotypes.</description>

    <description>Participants will be imaged with the standard MRI technique (STIR-MRI) and also new MRI techniques called &quot;diffusion weighted&quot; or &quot;DW&quot; MRI and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-MRI. PET-MRI will be indicated if the results from the routine MRI and DW MRI are contradictory or if laboratory results do not correspond to the standard MRI and DW MRI results.</description>
