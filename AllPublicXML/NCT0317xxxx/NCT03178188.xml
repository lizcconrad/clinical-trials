  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      forty DLE lesions from patients will be recruited in the study. The lesions on one side of
      the body were block-randomized into the treatment group and the other side served as a
      control. The patients can continue their systemic treatments and the PDL is designed to be
      used as an adjunctive treatment. Treatments with the PDL will be delivered in the treatment
      group every 4 weeks for 4 consecutive months while the lesions in the control group received
      a sham. The patients will be evaluated at baseline (week 0), week 4, 8, 12, and at follow-up
      period of 4, 12 weeks after the final treatment (week 16, 24). Erythema index (EI), Texture
      index (TI) will be obtained and digital photographs will be taken and modified Cutaneous
      Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (mCLASI) will be assessed in every visit.
      The digital photographs will later be evaluated by 3-blinded dermatologists. Moreover, side
      effects and patients' satisfaction score will also be recorded.
