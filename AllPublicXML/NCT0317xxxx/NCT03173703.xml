      The purpose of this trial is to collect safety and effectiveness data to support peripheral
      vascular indication of XenoSure biologic patch. This trial is performed to meet the China FDA
      regulation in this kind of device. The clinical trial will be performed solely inside China
      under GCP regulation and all applicable China regulations on medical device clinical trial.
