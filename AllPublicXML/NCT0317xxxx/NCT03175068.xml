  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and generalized Social Anxiety Disorder
      (gSAD) are treated with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) but few have meaningful
      improvement. MDD and gSAD are diseases of brain dysfunction that manifest as impaired emotion
      regulation; CBT teaches emotion regulation strategies but how it works in the brain remains
      largely unknown. Individual differences in brain function related to emotion regulation may
      make some patients better suited for CBT and CBT may remedy the brain dysfunction that
      underlies these disorders. This project will compare CBT with a placebo psychotherapy (i.e.,
      supportive therapy) in MDD and gSAD to test, validate, and refine brain-based markers and
      examine mechanisms of change to examine how CBT works and for whom.

    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and generalized Social Anxiety Disorder (gSAD) are pervasive
      major public health problems. These disorders are characterized by emotion dysregulation, an
      inability or inefficiency to regulate negative and positive affect as reflected in common and
      disorder-specific symptoms (e.g., attentional bias to negative stimuli,
      excessive/inappropriate negative thoughts, hyperarousal, anhedonia, emotional blunting). Such
      dysregulation is believed to result from an imbalance between top-down 'emotion regulating'
      (ER) frontal nodes central in inhibitory control of bottom-up subcortical
      'emotion-generating' (EG) nodes in a Fronto-Limbic Affect Regulation and Emotional Salience
      (FLARES) network. Therefore, successful treatment would be expected to 'normalize'
      neurofunctional disturbances in the FLARES network, which can be measured with fMRI and more
      distal units of brain function -- event-related potentials (ERPs) from
      electroencephalography, startle potentiation from electromyography (EMG), neurocognitive
      performance, and use of regulation strategies in daily life via self-report. The overarching
      objective of the proposed study is to understand how, when, and where CBT works and for whom
      to tailor treatment to improve clinical outcome.

      Without precisely identified &quot;targets&quot; and &quot;predictors&quot; of change, CBT response will continue
      to be unpredictably varied with few achieving meaningful clinical improvement placing them at
      risk for relapse and recurrence. Our proposal builds on published data from our lab and
      others and Preliminary Data which shows FLARES function, as assayed with fMRI, ERPs, EMG, and
      behaviors, is sensitive to change following CBT.

      Importantly, both baseline fMRI and non-fMRI units of brain-behavioral measures predict CBT
      response better than baseline clinical measures. Such knowledge can lead to more precise
      interventions aimed at capitalizing on 'strengths' or improving 'deficits' that may each
      exist before CBT and/or explain why CBT does not work for some patients. The dual development
      of fMRI ('mechanistic') and non-fMRI ('pragmatic') predictors and indices of therapeutic
      change is aimed at advancing precision medicine while increasing the clinical utility of
      'biomarkers' in the outpatient setting. With this objective, we propose to employ
      well-validated paradigms to test ER and EG in the context of negative stimuli, reward
      processes, and fear systems in MDD and gSAD to delineate common and disorder-specific
      mechanisms of change and predictors of CBT outcome. We will enroll 200 patients: 100 MDD
      (without comorbid gSAD), 100 gSAD (without comorbid MDD) and randomize them to 12 weeks of
      manualized CBT or 12 weeks of 'placebo' psychotherapy (supportive therapy) (1:1 ratio).
      Multiple units of FLARES function will be collected in all patients before (Week 0), during
      (midway/Week 6) and after treatment (Week 12) to ascertain CBT 'dose' effects, and in 40
      healthy controls for comparison. Pre-CBT predictors based on binary (responder/non-responder
      status) and continuous (extent of change) outcomes will be examined midway (Week 6),
      immediately after treatment (Week 12), and at 6-month follow-up.

    <description>Patients were randomized to either 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy or supportive therapy. Healthy control (HC) participants did not receive treatment but completed the same assessments at the same time points as patients. Mean BOLD effects in emotion processing and cognitive control tasks at baseline, at mid-point of treatment (for patients)/time interval (for HC), and at end of treatment (for patients)/time interval (for HC). Target areas are analyzed from fMRI scans. The scans were completed on Weeks 0, 6, and 12. Average BOLD effects were calculated for each group.</description>

    <description>The clinical psychologist will use a manualized CBT approach tailored to MDD or gSAD. Over a 12-week period sessions will include core CBT strategies -- psychoeducation, cognitive intervention (e.g., cognitive restructuring), behavioral changes (i.e., fear exposure, behavioral activation strategies) and relapse prevention.</description>

    <description>The clinical psychologist will use an ST approach that resembles client-centered therapy of Carl Rogers (1951) which has been used as a control psychotherapy. The manual is based on supportive psychotherapy principles. Over a 12-week period sessions will emphasize reflective listening and elicitation of affect. In contrast to CBT, therapists allow patients to determine the focus of each session, pulling for emotion, validating emotions when possible, and offering empathetic comments. Therapists will refrain from delineating any CBT theoretical framework and avoided cognitive and behavioral techniques that might overlap with CBT.</description>
