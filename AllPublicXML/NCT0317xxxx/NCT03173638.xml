  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators propose to perform a Phase II Clinical Trial which seeks to
      evaluate the safety of cell therapy as a new treatment for patients who suffer from acute
      non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). If it is successful, a later study
      to assess efficacy will be performed.

      This disease has an age-adjusted incidence rate of 10/100.000, and in many cases it results
      in blindness. Currently, there is no available treatment and second eye involvement occurs in
      approximately 15-25% of the cases.

      All this background originates a particularly dramatic outcome for the patient. Therefore, it
      seems justified to evaluate new therapies that maintain or improve the visual function in
      these patients.

      The Project includes a clinical trial whose purpose is the assessment of the safety of
      intravitreal administration of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with NAION,
      a product in clinical research phase (PEI No. 15-007) already approved for other human
      clinical applications (PEI No. 15-007).

      It can be considered that the therapy with intravitreal injection of MSC is a treatment
      option in patients with acute NAION, since through the paracrine properties of these cells
      (secretion of neurotrophic, immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic factors) it may prevent or
      reduce the progression of axonal degeneration caused by this disease.
