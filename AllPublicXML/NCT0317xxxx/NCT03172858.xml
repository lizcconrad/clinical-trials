  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if an intracervical balloon catheter (IBC) is better than
      oxytocin for induction of labor in the setting of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) or
      breaking the bag of water prior to onset of labor. The investigators suspect that an
      intracervical balloon catheter will shorten the time interval from initiation of induction of
      labor to delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are not enough studies to support the use of intracervical balloon catheter (IBC) use
      in term premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Prospective randomized studies comparing IBC
      placement to oxytocin use in induction of labor for term PROM do not exist. Intracervical
      Balloon Catheter has been shown to reduce duration of labor for women with intact membranes
      undergoing induction of labor. The practice at this institution is to use oxytocin to start
      contractions when a woman has PROM. This study will examine IBC compared to oxytocin use in
      term PROM. This will allow for the evaluation of a cervical ripening method for term PROM
      that may improve women's outcomes. Other outcomes for this study are rates of infection
      during labor, cesarean section, and adverse maternal and/or neonatal outcomes.

    <description>The intracervical balloon catheter will be passed through the cervix either with a speculum exam or by a digital exam. Then the catheter balloon will be filled with 80 cc of sterile fluid. The catheter will be pulled to tension and taped to the patient's leg.
Patients will have the option to IV pain medication at the time of intracervical balloon placement. The intracervical balloon will remain in place for 6 hours unless it falls out spontaneously. At the 6 hour mark, a vaginal exam will assess if the intracervical balloon has pulled through the cervix or if it needs further tension. The intracervical balloon will remain in place a maximum of 12 hours. After a maximum of 12 hours in place the intracervical balloon will be removed and oxytocin will be started per protocol.</description>

    <description>At our institution the policy for oxytocin infusion is to start at a low dose of 2mu/min and to increase by 2mu/min at 15 to 20 minute intervals based on how often uterine contractions are occuring. A specific order from a physician is required to increase the oxytocin dose above 20 mu/min. Oxytocin will be titrated per usual protocol.</description>
