    <textblock>
      The aim of phase 1 of this study is to develop a care need scale (CNS) for adolescents with
      cancer. The aim of phase 2 is to examine the mediating role of care needs between physical
      and psychosocial dysfunction and QoL, and to explore the recovery trajectory and its
      predictors regarding the care needs, physical and psychosocial factors, and the QoL of
      adolescents with cancer at the first, second, and third 3-month periods after initiating
      on-treatment and off-treatment. The aim of phase 3 is to examine the effectiveness of the
      computerized assessment with graphic outcome (CAGO) for fulfilling the care needs of
      adolescents with cancer, its acceptability for adolescents with cancer, and its usability for
      clinicians in pediatric oncology units.
