  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor balance is one of the major risk factors for falling in older adults. A Matter of
      Balance (MOB) is one of the most commonly used fall prevention programs nationally. Despite
      its name, MOB focuses on managing concerns about falling, and does not include a balance
      component. We are testing to see if adding a dual-task balance component (balance and mental
      thinking) to MOB can improve balance and walking better, than MOB only.

      Fall prevention interventions among community-dwelling older adults are essential. A Matter
      of Balance (MOB) is one of the most commonly used community-based fall prevention
      interventions nationally, and is considered the 'fall prevention standard of care'. MOB
      programs are targeted to reduce the fear of falling and promote physical activity among all
      older community-dwelling adults. While evidence indicates that the MOB program leads to
      small, sustained decreases in older adults' perceived fear of falling, there is no evidence
      of objectively measured balance and gait. Despite its name, MOB focuses on cognitive
      restructuring to manage concerns about falling, and does not include a balance component.
      Among community-dwelling older adults, both intact balance and concomitant attention
      (&quot;dual-tasking&quot;) are essential to prevent falls, and dual-task balance components are now
      requisite per evidence-based fall prevention intervention guidelines.

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The proposed pilot study will employ a single-blind, two-group randomized clinical trial. We will randomly assign 24 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 60 years) from an underserved population who are at high fall risk to either: A.) 4-week MOB+DTBC intervention, or B.) 4-week MOB only intervention (n=12/group).</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>As with any active intervention, participants will know their group assignment and double-blinding is not possible. Of note, our primary outcome measures are objective and require post-processing, thus study staff collecting the data will be &quot;blinded&quot; to participant results. Further, our bio-engineer post-processor will be blinded to study assignment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at baseline and post-intervention at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Balance will be assessed using LEGSys™ (Locomotion Evaluation and Gait System, BioSensics LLC) wearable technology. This system uses five sensors attached to right and left anterior shins, right and left anterior thighs, and to the posterior lower back. Balance measures will include changes in sway of ankle, hip, and center of mass (COM) in both mediolateral (ML) and anterior/posterior (AP) directions while standing, with feet parallel and in semi-tandem positions, during eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) conditions (30 seconds/test).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gait</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at baseline and post-intervention at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Gait will be assessed over a distance of 20 meters using the LEGSys™ wearable technology. The system estimates spatiotemporal gait parameters including velocity, stride length, stride time, double support, single support, and stride-to-stride variability, and gait initiation. COM range of motion during walking will be calculated based on the data from the sensor attached to the lower back. Gait will be assessed under usual and maximal walking speeds.</description>

    <measure>Fear of Falling</measure>
    <time_frame>Data will be collected at baseline and post-intervention at 4 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of Falling is defined as concerns about falling. The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) is a self-report measure that assesses concerns about falling for 16 commonly performed activities at home and in community settings (e.g. get in/out of chair, walk in crowded places).</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided with 3 monthly fall calendars and asked to mark it daily (X=no fall, F=Fall) and record details of any fall injury/hospitalization on the back of the monthly sheet.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the standard MOB classes, along with a 15-min DTBC each class, i.e., right and left foot ankle-reaching to three differently colored markers. Three colored dots are placed on the ground in an arc, using different colored stick-on dots. A chair can be placed in front of the color pattern, as needed for safety.</description>
