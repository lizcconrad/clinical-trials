  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a direct result of food-intake in excess of body energy expenditure. Thus,
      induction of increased energy expenditure via the activation of thermogenesis at targeted
      anatomical sites can counterbalance obesity. This trial aims to study RZL-012, a novel
      compound, in treating obesity by activating thermogenesis in subcutaneous fat.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a direct result of food-intake in excess of body energy expenditure. Therefore, a
      feasible approach to combat obesity is via energy-consuming activities, such as physical
      exercise. Unfortunately, our modern society is moving in the other direction, spending more
      time in immobilized positions, at work and at home. An alternative strategy for the induction
      of increased energy expenditure is via the activation of thermogenic cells that utilize fat
      to produce heat.RZL-012 is a novel molecule that enables de-novo generation of thermogenic
      tissue at favorable anatomical sites. As a result, the extra fat accumulated in obese persons
      will be turned into heat. This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose
      escalation Phase 2a clinical trial for the evaluation of safety, efficacy and
      thermogenesis-induction of RZL-012 in overweight and obese volunteers. This trial aims to
      study the ability of RZL-012 in treating obesity via the induction of thermogenic foci in
      subcutaneous fat.
