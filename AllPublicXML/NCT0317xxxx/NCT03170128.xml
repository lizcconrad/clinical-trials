  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of physical therapy as part of the
      non-operative treatment of radial head fractures.There is currently no data to support the
      use of physical therapy in the non-operative treatment of radial head fractures. Likewise,
      there is no data that shows that physical therapy is harmful to patients being treated
      non-operatively for radial head fractures. Investigators believe that prescribing physical
      therapy for patients with non-displaced radial head fractures treated non-operatively is
      unnecessary, and that that it would be equally efficacious to teach patients simple
      stretching exercises that they could perform by themselves. Subjects will be randomized into
      2 groups: Group 1 - Patients will be prescribed physical therapy within the first month
      following fracture; Group 2 - Patients will be given simple stretching exercises to perform
      at home and will not be given a prescription for physical therapy. Patients who agree to
      participate in this study and sign the informed consent will be randomly assigned to one of
      the two groups.
