  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are frequent and disabling
      pathologies. The general practitioner is often at the front line vis-a-vis screening,
      diagnosis and treatment of these pathologies. There are currently many treatments available,
      in particular inhaled corticosteroids, and although the recommendations for management appear
      to be well codified in theory, the adaptation of drug therapy remains complex in general
      practice.

      The prescription of inhaled corticosteroids, often initiated during a general medicine
      consultation, is not simple. The aim of this study is to analyze the relevance of the
      prescription of inhaled corticosteroids in primary care and to identify the criteria
      necessary for the prescription of inhaled corticosteroids available in general practice.

      The main objective of our study is to evaluate the rate of consultations where all the
      elements required for guiding the prescription of an inhaled corticoid are available.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Identify other factors associated with decision-making

        -  Identify the causes of inhaled corticosteroid stopping (de-prescription)
