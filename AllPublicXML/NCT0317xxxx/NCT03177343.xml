  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus represents the leading pathogen implicated in bone and joint infection
      (BJI), usually requiring prolonged combination antimicrobial therapy, which may be
      particularly challenging in the case of MDR bacteria and/or for patients with multiple drug
      intolerance. In the absence of new well-tolerated oral antistaphylococcal drugs, older
      antibiotics must be considered, such as the pristinamycin.

      However, pristinamycin is not currently licensed for treatment of staphylococcal BJI and lack
      of clinical data prevents it from being considered as a reliable alternative therapeutic
      option in current guidelines.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate pristinamycin (efficacy and tolerance) in the treatment
      of MSSA bone and joint infection (BJI).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of pristinamycin in MSSA bone and joint infection</measure>
    <time_frame>80 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome of patients having had pristinamycin is described in this part. The follow up of the patients after termination of antimicrobial treatment is almost 80 weeks.
Treatment failure included: persisting infection under appropriate antimicrobial therapy, relapse after interruption of antimicrobial therapy, septic indication for surgical revision &gt; 5 days after primary surgery, superinfection; and/or death, if related to the BJI or to complication of its management.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerance of pristinamycin in MSSA bone and joint infection</measure>
    <time_frame>45 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The treatment duration could be long (several weeks) as pristinamycin is also used as a long-term suppressive therapy in BJI; thus, we can have 45 weeks of treatment with pristinamycin.
Pristinamycin-related adverse events (AEs) occurring during follow-up were noted and classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; National Cancer Institute, 2003). The accountability of pristinamycin in AE onset was left to the clinician's judgement, with the help of a pharmacovigilance specialist in doubtful cases.</description>
