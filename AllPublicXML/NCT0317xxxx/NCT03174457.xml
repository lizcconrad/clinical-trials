  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of micafungin when
      prescribed for prophylaxis or treatment of fungal infections in different real-world clinical
      conditions and centers, in pediatric patients in Asia/Oceania.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will collect safety and efficacy data from pediatric patients who are prescribed
      intravenous micafungin for prophylaxis. During this trial, patients with two separate
      indications will be treated. The first, Invasive candidiasis will have a minimum treatment of
      2 weeks. The second, Oesophageal candidiasis will have a minimum treatment of 1 week. Both
      indications will have a follow-up period of 4 weeks after treatment.

    <description>Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AEs that started or worsened during the observational period after the start of micafungin treatment will be summarized by the time period of onset. AE occurring within 3 days after end of therapy will be defined as treatment emergent adverse events</description>

    <measure>Overall treatment success</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of trial (up to 95 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall treatment success will be defined as a complete or partial clinical response in proven fungal infection, and by an empirical treatment composite outcome score in probable/possible fungal infection. Overall treatment success for patients receiving prophylactic treatment is defined as the absence of proven, probable, possible or suspected Invasive Fungal Infection (IFI) during the period of prophylactic therapy and up to 4 weeks after stopping micafungin administration</description>
