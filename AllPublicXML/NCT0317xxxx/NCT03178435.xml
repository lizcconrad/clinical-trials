      An interventional controlled trial to test the feasibility of applying risk score based
      prevention for critically ill patient at high risk to develop acute kidney injury (AKI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale AKI is common in the intensive care unit .It contributes
      significantly to mortality and morbidity .the estimated incidence or AKI among critically ill
      patients is 30-40% and morality is high.

      There is a well recognized gap between the optimal care and the delivered care regarding
      prevention and management of AKI.

      The focus over the last few years has been on early detection. A panel of urinary biomarkers
      have proved helpful for early detection of AKI. However the cost and low specificity make no
      single one of them solely reliable .using a panel of bio-markers increases their specificity.

      The concept of electronic alerts has been recently introduced. Some trials have been testing
      its impact on the outcome of AKI. The benefit of electronic alerts is still uncertain .A
      meta-analysis is currently underway to synthesize stronger evidence of electronic alerts
      benefit.

      Another evolving area, is the development of risk score to predict AKI and and hence applying
      timely preventive measures.

      KDIGO recommends applying preventive measures to high risk patients. However no study to date
      has tested risk scores based interventions

      Hypothesis:

      We will use the recently validated score to predict AKI in ICU patients. We will then apply
      preventive measures. To patients at risk .To our knowledge this is the first study to apply
      preventive interventions based on AKI risk score assessment
