  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter Phase 1b, open-label study to assess safety, tolerability, preliminary
      efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cabozantinib taken in combination with atezolizumab in
      subjects with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) (including bladder, renal pelvis, ureter,
      urethra), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study consists of two stages: in the Dose Escalation
      Stage, an appropriate recommended cabozantinib dose for the combination with standard dosing
      regimen of atezolizumab will be established. In the Expansion Stage, tumor-specific cohorts
      will be enrolled in order to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination
      treatment in these tumor indications.

      -  Dose Escalation Stage: to determine the schedule and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
           recommended Expansion Stage dose of cabozantinib when taken in combination with a
           standard dosing regimen of atezolizumab (1200 mg infusion, once every 3 weeks).

        -  Expansion Stage. to determine the preliminary efficacy and safety of the recommended
           combination dose in eight tumor-specific cohorts including subjects with advanced UC,
           RCC, CRPC, and NSCLC
