  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center study of axitinib in combination with
      nivolumab in patients with previously treated and untreated advanced RCC. This clinical study
      will be composed of a dose finding phase (Phase I) and two parallel dose expansion phases
      (Phase II). The dose finding phase will assess the safety of the combination and establish a
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D, the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable
      by the Investigators and the Sponsor Investigator) in patients with advanced RCC who have
      received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy
      of the combination at the RP2D in two parallel expansion cohorts in both previously treated
      and treatment naïve patients.

             leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with known brain metastases are eligible if
             metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence
             of progression for four weeks (after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to
             study drug administration.

          -  Diagnosis of immunodeficiency

             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external
             trigger

          -  Patients have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement

             autoimmune disease.

          -  Major surgery &lt;4 weeks or radiation therapy &lt;2 weeks of study entry. Prior palliative
             radiotherapy to metastatic lesion(s) is permitted, provided there is at least one

          -  Gastrointestinal abnormalities including: Inability to take oral medication;
             Requirement for intravenous alimentation; Prior surgical procedures affecting
             absorption including total gastric resection; Treatment for active peptic ulcer
             disease in the past 6 months; Active gastrointestinal bleeding as evidenced by

             allowed.

          -  Current use or anticipated need for treatment with drugs that are known strong
             CYP3A4/5 inducers, including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital,
             phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John's wort.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab, drugs with a predisposition
             to hepatotoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with
             nivolumab-containing regimen.

          -  Known hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HBV) infection.

             attack

          -  History of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism within 6 months of screening.
