  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ability to provide oxygen to patients undergoing general anaesthesia is crucial. This is
      traditionally provided using face mask, supraglottic airway (breathing tube above voice box)
      or endotracheal tube (breathing tube in wind pipe). However in some patients it may be
      impossible to provide oxygen through any of these above means which can be life threatening
      and lead to permanent brain damage/death. One of the ideal ways of managing this emergency
      situation is to pass a breathing tube through a membrane in the front of the neck called
      cricothyroid membrane with the neck in extension position where permitted. Many studies have
      recommended identifying the cricothyroid membrane before general anaesthesia in high risk
      patients but with their head in neutral position. This study will be a pilot study to check
      if the cricothyroid membrane remains in the same place in neutral and extended positions.

      This is a non-randomised observational pilot study. The results of the study will be used to
      determine the size of the sample required for a planned randomised controlled trial in the
      future. All the volunteers will be asked to lie on a trolley with the head in neutral
      position- Defined as alignment of external auditory meatus (outer ear canal) to the sternal
      angle (prominent portion of breast bone) is horizontal. A radiologist trained in ultrasound
      of the neck will identify the position of upper and lower border of the cricothyroid membrane
      using ultrasound and then mark these borders and the centre point with a black surgical
      marker pen. Then the volunteer will be asked to extend the neck and the same steps will be
      repeated using a red surgical marker pen. The distance between the two centre points will
      then be measured using a calliper/ measuring scale.
