  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac ischemia is a common pathological condition, known to elicit multiple pathological
      processes at the cellular level. One of the most affected is thought to be cellular
      metabolism, key for the adequate cardiac function. The aim is to study mitochondrial
      bioenergetic function, interaction with other cellular systems and influence of several
      co-morbidities in myocardium of the affected patients.

    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease, one of the most common pathologies in the developed world, causes
      hypoperfusion of myocardial tissue, usually evident by the presence of anginal pain. This
      myocardial ischemia elicits alterations in normal cardiomyocyte physiology, which gradually
      deteriorate cellular function, affecting the performance of the entire organ. The condition
      is frequently further complicated (and aggravated) by the presence of various co-morbidities,
      such as diabetes mellitus. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the cardiomyocyte
      bioenergetics and the consequences of potentially reduced mitochondrial metabolic function in
      ischemic heart, and evaluate the potential contribution of other conditions, primarily ones
      affecting metabolic homeostasis.
