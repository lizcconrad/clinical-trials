  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the effect of danirixin hydrobromide 35 milligram (mg)
      tablets on lung function and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in subjects with mild to
      moderate airflow obstruction and a demonstrated history of decline in forced expiratory
      volume in one second (FEV1). Specifically, this study aims to assess whether or not danirixin
      has the potential to impact disease progression in subjects with a COPD progression score
      indicating they are likely to decline based on 5 year data from a COPDGene study and support
      the conduct of a larger Phase III study for disease progression. Subjects will receive either
      placebo or danirixin 35 mg tablets (as hydrobromide hemihydrate salt) twice daily for 52
      weeks (12months). Study subjects will continue with their standard of care inhaled
      medications (i.e. long acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids) while
      receiving study treatment. This study will be an ancillary study within the COPDGene study
      investigating the enrichment strategy for assessing disease progression. Potential subjects
      most likely to decline from the well established COPDGene cohort, will be based on data
      collected over the initial 5 year period. With the use of an enriched population, it is
      anticipated that one year of treatment will be sufficient to detect a trend in altering
      disease progression. Approximately 130 subjects will be screened to enroll 100 subjects in
      this study. The data from this study will provide useful information in determining whether
      to progress to a Phase III study to explore an indication for slowing disease progression.
