      This study is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of
      a turmeric and black cumin seed formulation on cholesterol levels. Each subject will receive
      a specific dose of the formulation or placebo twice daily. Participants will undergo
      assessments of blood tests, vital signs, body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference
      and waist-to-hip ratio with completion of a questionnaire.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the effects of the turmeric and black cumin
      seed formulation on fasting levels of Total Cholesterol.

      Secondary objectives include assessment of the effects of turmeric and black cumin seed
      formulation on: fasting levels of: LDL Cholesterol, parameters in the NMR LipoProfile®,
      Oxidized LDL, Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, blood glucose, Insulin and
      Hemoglobin A1c, as well as the assessments of the values/scores of body weight, waist
      circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure and the SF-36 survey
      scores.
