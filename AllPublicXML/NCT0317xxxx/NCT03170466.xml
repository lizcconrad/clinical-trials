  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced heart failure (HF) typically experience significant burdens that
      negatively impact their quality of life. Although palliative care has been shown to improve
      patient outcomes in other serious illnesses, insufficient data exist to support its use in
      HF. Furthermore, the demand for palliative care in serious illness outstrips the available
      supply of certified palliative care clinicians. This pilot trial will assess the feasibility
      and acceptability of training cardiology nurses in basic palliative care skills and their
      ability to deliver this care alongside usual HF management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced heart failure (HF) suffer from significant pain, fatigue, difficulty
      breathing, anxiety, and depression. Palliative Care (PC) is a medical specialty designed to
      focus on relieving patient suffering by providing an extra layer of support on top of usual
      care. To date, there has been little research on the impact of PC in HF. We will conduct a
      randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived
      effectiveness of training cardiology nurses in PC and administering PC to their patients.
      Patients will be randomized into either the usual care group or the intervention group. Usual
      care participants will receive their care with no alterations, and intervention participants
      will receive the PC intervention from their nurse on top of their usual care. Both groups
      will complete health-related surveys on tablet computers, via email, and/or via telephone. In
      the intervention group, these answers will be used to tailor the intervention to the specific
      patient's needs. Caregivers will also be recruited into the study, and will complete surveys
      similar to the patients via the aforementioned methods.

    <description>The intervention will be delivered through four primary mechanisms. First, an existing HF nurse will deliver the intervention to patients during regularly scheduled visits. Second, telephone calls will reinforce topics. Third, patients will regularly report symptoms through the MyUPMC patient portal. Fourth, the nurse will act as a liaison to communicate concerns to the patient's cardiologist and primary care physician, as well as facilitating other resources (e.g., home health). In addition, follow-up assessments will be completed via phone or email at least 2 weeks post-intervention delivery. Caregivers will complete surveys during the first in-person visit and then during the follow-up assessments.</description>
