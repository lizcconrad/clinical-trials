  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centered randomized controlled trial of women with stress urinary
      incontinence or stress predominant mixed urinary incontinence who desire non-surgical
      therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized trial, eligible patients who provide written consent for participation
      will be enrolled. At enrollment we will collect baseline demographic data and ask
      participants to complete questionnaires and a 3-day bladder diary. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continence pessary or disposable intravaginal device.

    <description>Participants randomized to the continence pessary will be fitted for a pessary by a clinician at enrollment and they will be taught how to remove and reinsert the device. Per usual clinical practice they will be instructed to call with any concerns and scheduled for a return visit in 2 weeks for a follow-up to assess fit and comfort and undergo refitting if necessary.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the intravaginal device will be given a sizing kit in the office, asked to select a size and provided with a 2-week supply of the appropriately sized devices. In accordance with manufacturer guidelines, participants will be instructed that the device is to be used for no more than 8 hours per 24-hour period and that each device is single use only. Participants will return in 2 weeks for a follow-up visit to assess fit and comfort, undergo resizing as necessary and receive an additional 2 week supply of the appropriately sized devices.</description>

    <description>Continence pessaries are inexpensive, reusable intravaginal devices made of flexible silicon that provide support to the urethra to prevent urinary leakage. Continence pessaries are fitted by trained clinicians in the office and managed by patients or their provider.</description>
