  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With improvements in detection and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa), more men than ever are
      living with side effects from PCa treatment; most distressingly, treatment side effects
      include problems with sexual functioning (e.g. erectile dysfunction, climacturia,
      inorgasmia). This study aims to develop a mindfulness-based group treatment for couples with
      sexual functioning complaints post-PCa treatment. Couples will be invited to a four-session
      mindfulness-based treatment group. Pre- and post-treatment outcomes (e.g., distress, sexual
      functioning/enjoyment, relationship satisfaction, treatment adherence) will assess
      feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment for couple's sexual lives after PCa.

    <textblock>
      This is an intervention study designed to assess a novel mindfulness-based treatment protocol
      for couples dealing with sexual dysfunction secondary to prostate cancer treatment. Couples
      will be invited to participate through the Vancouver Prostate Centre (VPC) and the Prostate
      Cancer Survivorship Care (PCSC) Program. Interested couples will be screened for eligibility.
      Eligible couples will be randomized to either an immediate-start or a delayed-waitlist
      control group.

      Prior to treatment, couples will complete an online questionnaire package. Treatment will
      consist of a 4-week mindfulness-based group lead by a clinician trained in mindfulness
      treatment. Sessions are 2hrs in length and take place in consecutive weeks, with daily
      homework recommended between sessions. The intervention was developed based on pre-existing
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy treatment groups for sexual dysfunction developed by Dr.
      Lori Brotto at the UBC Sexual Health Laboratory, mindfulness in sex therapy and intimate
      relationships (MSIR) treatment group developed by Kocsis and Newbury-Helps (2016), and expert
      input. Sessions consist of mindfulness-based training, sex therapy techniques, and education.
      After treatment, couples will be invited to complete a post-treatment questionnaire once
      immediately after the end of treatment, and again 6 months later.

    <description>Eligible couples will take part in a 4-session mindfulness-based therapy group for couples. The groups will last 2 hours in length, for a total of 8 hours of treatment time, and sessions will be scheduled once per week in successive weeks.
The groups will have one highly experienced female facilitator, who is the Study Coordinator. The facilitator led the design of the treatment manual, and has experience in facilitating similar groups. The facilitator will follow a detailed, empirically-informed mindfulness-based treatment manual that was designed for the purpose of this study. All groups will take place in a private group treatment room at Vancouver General Hospital.</description>
