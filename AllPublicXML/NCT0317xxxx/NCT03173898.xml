  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature concerning the success and pain scores of PDL injection technique compared
      with other techniques remains controversial; whereas some studies found no significant
      difference in pain scores between local infiltration and PDL injection, other older studies
      found that pain during administration of PDL injection was described by the majority of
      patients either as greater than local infiltration6, or as negligible or as a less painful
      injection compared with other injection techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      efficacy of and patients' subjective responses to the PDL injection technique as compared to
      the traditional infiltration injection, for the non-surgical extraction of one posterior
      maxillary permanent tooth.

      Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of and patients' subjective responses
      to the periodontal ligament (PDL) anesthetic injection as compared to the traditional
      infiltration injection, for the non-surgical extraction of one posterior maxillary permanent
      tooth. Methods: All patients scheduled for non-surgical symmetrical maxillary posterior
      permanent teeth extraction in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) at the
      University of Jordan Hospital, Amman, Jordan, over a-seven-month period, were invited to
      participate in this prospective randomized double blinded, split mouth study. Every patient
      received the recommended volumes of 2% lidocaine with 1:100.000 epinephrine for PDL injection
      on the experimental side, and for local infiltration on the control side. A Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) and a Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) were used to describe the pain felt during
      injection and extraction, respectively. Statistical significance was based on probability
      values of &lt;0.05 and measured using Chi-Square and Student-t tests, and Nonparametric
      Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests.
