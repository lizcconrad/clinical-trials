    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of solid organ transplantation
      using HIV-positive deceased donors (liver, kidney) and HIV-positive living donors (liver) in
      HIV-positive recipients.

      HIV-positive individuals who agree to accept and receive a solid organ transplant from and
      HIV-positive donor will be followed to determine the safety and efficacy of this practice.

      This is a prospective observational study of solid organ transplantation utilizing
      HIV-positive donors in HIV-positive recipients. Stable HIV-infected adults in need of a solid
      organ transplant (kidney, liver) who meet standard and study specified HIV criteria for organ
      transplantation will be offered enrollment in the study. Deceased donors (kidney, liver) and
      living donors (liver) will be utilized in this protocol. No living kidney donors will be
      enrolled.

      This study will evaluate overall survival and graft survival. In addition the study will
      assess potential complications of organ transplant using HIV+ donor organs, including but not
      limited to: HIV disease progression, development of antiretroviral resistance mutations,
      incidence of opportunistic infections, incidence of transplant complications, impacts of
      liver regeneration, incidence of viral-related malignancies, and incidence of
      HIV-superinfection.

        RECIPIENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA HIV-Positive Recipient Inclusion Criteria (liver, kidney)

          1. Participant is able to understand and provide informed consent.

          2. Participant meets standard listing criteria for transplant.

          3. Documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western Blot,
             positive HIV ab IFA, or documented history of detectable HIV-1 RNA).

          4. Participant is ≥ 18 years old.

          5. No evidence of active opportunistic complications of HIV infection.

          6. Participant CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;/= 200/µL within 16 weeks prior to transplant for
             kidney transplant recipients. For liver transplant recipient, CD4+ T-cell counts need
             to be &gt;/= 100/ul (or &gt;/= 200/µL if history of opportunistic infection) within 16 weeks
             prior to transplant.

          7. Participant most recent HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL (by any FDA-approved assay performed
             in CLIA-approved laboratory), in the 26 weeks prior to transplant. Participants unable
             to tolerate ART due to organ failure or who have only recently started ART may have
             detectable viral load and still be considered eligible if the study team is confident
             there will be a safe, tolerable, and effective antiretroviral regimen once organ
             function is restored after transplantation.

          8. Concurrence by the study team that based on medical history and ART, viral suppression
             can be achieved in the recipient post-transplant.

          9. No history of primary CNS lymphoma or progressive PML.

         10. On a stable antiretroviral regimen. Participants unable to tolerate ART due to organ
             failure may still be considered eligible if the study team is confident there will be
             a safe, tolerable, and effective antiretroviral regimen once organ function is
             restored after transplantation.

        HIV-Positive Recipient Exclusion Criteria (liver, kidney)

        1. Participant has concomitant conditions that, in the judgment of the investigators, would
        preclude transplantation or immunosuppression.

        DONOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA HIV-Positive Deceased Donor (liver, kidney)

          1. Must meet all clinical criteria for HIV-uninfected organ donors.

          2. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection.

          3. Pre-implant donor organ biopsy showing no disease process that would put the recipient
             at increased risk of rapid progression to end-stage organ failure, to be stored for
             the duration of the study.

          4. Donor has documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western
             Blot, positive HIV ab IFA, or history of detectable HIV-1 RNA) from a CLIA-approved
             laboratory.

          5. If known history of HIV infection and prior antiretroviral therapy, the study team
             must describe the anticipated post-transplant antiretroviral regimen to be prescribed
             for the recipient and justify its conclusion that the regimen will be safe, tolerable
             and effective.

        HIV-Positive Living Donor (liver)

          1. Donor meets all clinical criteria to be a living liver donor other than being HIV
             positive.

          2. Donor has documented HIV infection (by any licensed ELISA and confirmation by Western
             Blot, positive HIV ab IFA, or history of detectable HIV-1 RNA) from a CLIA-approved
             laboratory.

          3. No evidence of invasive opportunistic complications of HIV infection

          4. Donor CD4+ T-cell count is &gt;/= 500/µL in the 26 weeks prior to donation.

          5. The most recent HIV-1 RNA has been below 50 copies RNA/ml in the 26 weeks prior to
             donation.

          6. On a stable antiretroviral regimen.

          7. Must be evaluated by the HIV/Transplant Infectious Diseases team to verify resistance
             history and current ART regimens. The potential for transmission of resistant strain
             of HIV will be assessed.

          8. Pre-implant donor liver biopsy to be stored for the duration of the study showing no
             evidence of a disease process that would put the donor at increased risk of
             progressing to end-stage organ failure after donation, or that would present a risk of
             poor graft function to the recipient.

          9. Must be evaluated by an independent HIV study living donor advocate separate from the
             transplant service in addition to the living donor advocate seen by all living donors.
