  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced prosthetic devices are currently controlled by electromyography (EMG) signals
      generated by patient's stump muscles and recorded by surface electrodes attached on the skin.
      This way of recordings is often unreliable, inconsistent and leading to high prosthetic
      abandonment rates for individuals with upper limb amputation. The use of implantable
      electrodes has been long thought as the solution for a more natural control of artificial
      limbs, as these offer access to long-term stable and physiologically appropriate sources of
      control, as well as the possibility to elicit appropriate sensory feedback via
      neurostimulation.

      This Clinical Investigation (CI) is performed to clinically test and verify the safety and
      benefits of a bidirectional interface into the human body that allows permanent and reliable
      communication using implanted electrodes. These electrodes will provide long-term stable
      bioelectric signals for an improved control of artificial limbs. The bidirectional interface
      is based, and requires, the clinically established implant system for bone-anchored
      prostheses named Osseointegrated Prostheses for the Rehabilitation of Amputees (OPRA). The
      feasibility of the device was initially proven through a proof-on-concept patient who has
      used the system without any adverse events for more than three years.

      This CI is performed to verify the safety and benefits of the Osseointegrated Human Machine
      Gateway (OHMG) as an enhancement of the OPRA Implant System for patients with upper limb
      amputation, when used within the intended purpose and according to instructions. The CI will
      be performed at Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Chalmers University of Technology,
      Sweden. A maximum of eighteen patients will be enrolled. Each patient will undergo a surgery
      where the OHMG will be implanted. The patients will participate in 8 follow-up sessions, the
      last one approximately 13 months after the surgery. The study is prospective, where the
      patient is his/her own control.

    <time_frame>13 months</time_frame>
    <description>For a case to be considered successful in terms of signal transfer; 1) it must be possible to record volitional control of at least two independent muscles with a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 2, and 2) elicit sensory perception via nerve stimulation with a pulse less than 1 milliamperes (mA) amplitude and 1 ms width.</description>

    <time_frame>13 months</time_frame>
    <description>All enrolled patients will perform one pre-operative and two post-operative ACMC-tests. The test consists of 30 functional items grouped into 4 hand use areas: gripping, holding, releasing and coordinating. Each person's performance is rated on a 4-pt capability scale. As the items are identified, the rater scores the person's performance on a scale of 0-3 (0 = not capable, 1 = sometimes capable, 2= capable upon request, 3 = spontaneously capable). The results from the pre-operative and post-operative assessments will be statistically analyzed with the Rasch model. Post-operative tests will be conducted 8 and 56 weeks after surgery.</description>

    <description>Patients will be upgraded to the OHMG if already users of the OPRA Implant System, or implanted with the OPRA Implant System plus OHMG. Each patient will work as his/her own control before and after implantation of the OHMG.
A single surgery is required to upgrade OPRA Implant System users to the OHMG, and no additional surgeries are required if the OHMG is implanted at the same time as the OPRA Implant System.</description>
