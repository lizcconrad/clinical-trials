  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will test a combined group therapy plus mobile cognitive behavioral
      therapy intervention targeting defeatist attitudes in consumers with schizophrenia in order
      to change motivational negative symptoms linked to defeatist attitudes.

      The primary purpose of this project is to test whether a psychosocial intervention, Cognitive
      Behavioral Social Skills Training (CBSST) combined with a smartphone-based
      cognitive-behavioral therapy for negative symptoms called, Mobile-assisted Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy for Negative Symptoms (mCBTn) can reduce defeatist performance attitudes
      in consumers with schizophrenia spectrum disorders with persistent moderate-to-severe
      experiential negative symptoms.The project will also identify the optimal dose to engage the
      defeatist attitude target. Pupillary responses, an objective psychophysiological biomarker of
      effort, will be recorded during a cognitive task as a secondary outcome to determine its
      potential as an end point in clinical trials of motivation and effort.
