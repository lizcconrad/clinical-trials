  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to compare clinical outcomes between imaging-guided and
      QCA-guided strategy in patients with native coronary artery disease undergoing BRS
      implantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that intravascular imaging-guided BRS implantation is superior
      to QCA-guided BRS implantation with respect to target lesion failure in patients with native
      coronary artery disease.
