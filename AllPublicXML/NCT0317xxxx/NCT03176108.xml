  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) with or without Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (ADHD) is a
      neurodevelopmental syndrome that has a lasting impact on the child's daily lifestyle and
      leads to functional impairment. ADHD is recognized as the most common psychiatry disorder in
      children and it's considered as a public health problem.

      ADHD is frequently associated with a new diagnostic entity &quot; Disruptive Disorder with
      Emotional dysregulation &quot;. This disorder is characterized by crisis of anger with verbal or
      physical aggression, intensity disproportionate to the context and developmental age.

      Few studies have examined the elements of emotional dysregulation in ADHD in children. Many
      studies have shown the interest of CBT in multimodal management of ADHD symptoms and
      associated disorders.

      The main objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
      Parent/Child program versus a body mediation focused on emotional and behaviorial aspects in
      ADD children aged 7-13 years with dimensional emotional dysregulation at 6 months after
      intervention. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of this program, at short-term
      (at the end of CBT) and at 6 months after intervention, on socio-communicative capacities,
      quality of life, children's functioning and parental stress.

      It's a biomedical research, prospective, controlled, randomized, monocentric, two parallels,
      with an evaluation of the criteria of blind judgment.

      68 patients (parents and children) will be recruited within Montpellier University Hospital.
      They will be divided into a CBT group and a control group (body mediation).

      The CBT group benefits from an intervention based on the program &quot;Better manage its anger and
      its frustrations&quot; of 15 sessions for the children.

      The control group participates in an intervention of body mediation (theatre) of 15 session
      for the children.

      The parents of CBT and Control groups participate in an CBT intervention of 8 sessions every
      15 days.
