    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts to this study: Part I and Part II.

      The goal of Part I of this clinical research study is to study the safety and tolerability of
      atezolizumab in combination with radiation therapy and temozolomide.

      The goal of Part II of this study is to learn if atezolizumab combined with radiation therapy
      and temozolomide can help to control glioblastoma.

      The safety of this combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of several types of cancer, but not glioblastoma. Temozolomide is FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of glioblastoma. The radiation therapy used in
      this study is being delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods.

      It is considered investigational to use atezolizumab in combination with temozolomide and
      radiation therapy to treat glioblastoma.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs and radiation are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      phase based on when you join the study. The first 10 participants enrolled will take part in
      Part I of the study. Up to 50 additional participants will take part in Part II of the study.

      All participants will receive the same dose of atezolizumab, temozolomide, and radiation
      therapy.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Treatment will be given in 2 phases: Concurrent Phase and Adjuvant Phase.

      Concurrent Phase:

      There are 42 days (about 6 weeks) in the concurrent phase.

      You will take temozolomide capsules by mouth every day. Do not open the capsules. If the
      capsules are accidentally opened or damaged, you should avoid inhaling or coming into contact
      with the contents of the capsule.

      You will also receive atezolizumab by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1. If you tolerate
      the drug well, it may be given over about 30 minutes after that on Days 15, 29, and 42 (about
      every 2 weeks).

      You will receive radiation therapy Monday through Friday every week as part of your standard
      care. You will sign a separate consent form for the radiation therapy that explains this
      treatment and its risks in more detail.

      After you finish radiation therapy, you will have a break or &quot;rest period&quot; for about 21-28
      days in which you do not take temozolomide or atezolizumab.

      Adjuvant Phase:

      Each study cycle in the adjuvant phase is 28 days.

      You will take temozolomide by mouth on Days 1-5 of each cycle. You will receive atezolizumab
      by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

      You will not receive radiation therapy during the adjuvant phase of the study.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive temozolomide and atezolizumab for up to 12 cycles. You may receive radiation
      therapy for up to 6 weeks. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Study Visits:

      Concurrent Phase:

      On Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 35 and 42:

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  On Day 22 only, you will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  On Day 1 only, if you can become pregnant, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

      Adjuvant Phase:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This sample will also be used
           for a pregnancy test, if you can become pregnant.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing (Cycles 1 and 3 only).

        -  During odd-numbered cycles (Cycles 1, 3, 5 and so on) only, you will have an MRI.

      On Day 21 of each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are
      needed. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests that may be needed.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This sample will also be used
           for a pregnancy test, if you can become pregnant.

        -  You will have an MRI.

      If the disease gets worse at any time while you are on study, blood (about 4tablespoons) will
      be drawn for biomarker testing. If you have surgery as part of your standard care, additional
      tumor tissue will be collected for biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

      Follow-Up:

      About every 3 months after your last dose of study drugs, the study staff will call you or
      check your medical records to learn how you are doing. If you are called, the call should
      take about 5-10 minutes.

      If you stop taking the study drug and the disease has not gotten worse, you will have the
      following as often as the doctor thinks is needed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI scan.

      The study doctor will discuss with you how often these tests may be performed. If the disease
      gets worse or the study ends, you will no longer have these tests for the study.
