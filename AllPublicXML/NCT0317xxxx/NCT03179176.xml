  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In brain tumor surgery we are confronted mainly with two types of difficulties: (i) the
      identification of the tumor and its limitations in relation to the healthy brain; (ii) the
      identification of functional cerebral regions, ie implicated in neurological function (motor
      skills, sensitivity, language, vision, cognition, etc.). The reference method currently used
      to improve the quality of resection of brain tumors while minimizing neurological risk for
      patients is so called &quot;wakeful&quot; surgery with direct electrical stimulation (DES) of the
      brain. The investigators routinely use ultrasound to localize the tumor within the brain, but
      to date there is no pre- or intra-operative imaging tool to reliably identify tumors and
      functional brain regions. There is therefore a need for innovative imaging in this field.

      For this reason, the investigators propose to evaluate the interest of a new High Frequence
      Ultrasound Doppler (HFUD) (VEVO ®, Visualsonics, Toronto, Canada) in the surgical management
      of patients operated in an awake condition for a brain tumor. The ultra high frequency allows
      to reach a spatial resolution of 30 μm, 5 to 10 times better than MRI and conventional
      ultrasound. The Doppler mode allows the detection of microvascular flows of speeds less than
      1 mm / second. The safety of this device is demonstrated and validated by CE marking
      (December 2015).
