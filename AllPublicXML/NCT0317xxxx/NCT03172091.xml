  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of research is to identify markers of acute rejection by VOC analysis in exhaled
      breath of bilateral-lung transplanted patients. 120 bi-lung transplanted patients will be
      divided into two groups : patients with acute rejection diagnosed on transbronchial biopsies
      and patients with no acute rejection. Exhaled breath will be collected for VOC analysis woth
      electronic nose and mass spectrometry. VOC profiles will be compared between the two groups
      of patients.

      Prospective single-center study. A single visit, no follow-up. The visit will take place
      before or within five days from date of transbronchial biopsies (BTB). It will include a
      noninvasive collection of exhaled breath for VOC analysis. VOC analysis will be conducted
      using two types of devices: &quot;electronic nose&quot; and mass spectrometry.

      120 bi-lung transplanted patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups.

        -  Group A, Acute rejection: 60 patients. Diagnosis of acute rejection retained on
           transbronchial biopsies or functional anomalies with the necessity of modifying the
           immunosuppressive regimen.

        -  Group B, control: 60 patients. Patients without respiratory functional abnormality and
           normal transbronchial biopsy.

      VOC, detected by electronic nose and identified by mass spectrometry, will be compared
      between patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute rejection (group A) and patients without
      rejection (control group B)

      The duration of participation of each patient is 1 day. The duration of the inclusion period
      is estimated at 12 months from the first inclusion. The expected total duration of the
      research is 12 months
