  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research program is to reduce health disparities by deploying an
      information-based intervention to increase caregiver utilization of community-based food
      supports and satisfaction with care among food insecure caregivers of hospitalized children.
      We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate, versus usual care, the effects of
      the CommunityRx-H intervention on caregiver use of food resources (primary), caregiver
      patient satisfaction with care (primary), caregiver mental health-related quality of life
      (secondary), and caregiver household food security (secondary). The proposed research will
      yield an understanding of how to leverage a child's hospitalization to effectively intervene
      on the problem of food insecurity. Findings will inform the rapidly growing field of
      healthcare-based interventions to address health-related social needs.

    <description>CommunityRx-H has two components: (1) health-information technology (HIT) e-prescribing, and (2) a Community Resource Specialist (CRS). CommunityRx functions like an e-prescribing system: a HealtheRx &quot;prescription&quot; is automatically generated at the point of care. The HealtheRx provides referrals to food resources and federal nutrition assistance information tailored to the caregiver's address and proactive social support in the form of SMS-text message nudges from the CRS. Caregivers in the intervention arm are able to request information on resources not limited to food, including employment support, help paying rent or mortgage, etc. Nudges will promote caregiver self- and family management by increasing knowledge of and encouraging activation of community resources.</description>
