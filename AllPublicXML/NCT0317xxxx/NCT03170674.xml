  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate changes in biomarkers of exposure (BOE) to
      tobacco smoke constituents after smokers switch from combustible cigarettes to use of one of
      the three electronic cigarettes or abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-center, randomized, controlled, switching, open-label, parallel cohort
      study. The study will compare biomarkers of tobacco exposure from subjects at baseline levels
      of biomarkers of tobacco exposure after they have switched to one of three electronic
      cigarettes or abstinence for 5 days.

             least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Note: Smokers who use menthol cigarette

             screening, as determined by the Investigator, that would preclude a subject from
             participating safely in the study (e.g., hypertension, chronic lung disease, heart
             disease, neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders) based on screening
             assessments such as safety labs, medical history, and physical/oral examinations;

          2. Self-reports or safety labs that indicate diabetes;

          3. Use of medicine for treatment of depression, unless on a stable dose for the past 6
