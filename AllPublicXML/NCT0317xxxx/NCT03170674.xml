  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate changes in biomarkers of exposure (BOE) to
      tobacco smoke constituents after smokers switch from combustible cigarettes to use of one of
      the three electronic cigarettes or abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a two-center, randomized, controlled, switching, open-label, parallel cohort
      study. The study will compare biomarkers of tobacco exposure from subjects at baseline levels
      of biomarkers of tobacco exposure after they have switched to one of three electronic
      cigarettes or abstinence for 5 days.

          2. Generally healthy males or females, 21 to 60 years of age (inclusive);

          3. Screening expired carbon monoxide (ECO) level ≥ 12 parts per million (ppm);

          4. Self-reports that cigarettes are the only tobacco or nicotine-containing product used
             within 30 days of the Screening Visit (Note: Rare use of other products [e.g., cigar

          5. Self-reports at the Screening Visit smoking on average at least 10 cigarettes per day
             that are filtered, non-menthol, 83 mm to 100 mm length and inhaling the smoke for at
             least 6 months prior to the Screening Visit (Note: Smokers who use menthol cigarette
             products like Camel Crush are not eligible for the study);

          6. Positive urine cotinine test at Screening and Enrollment;

          1. Clinically significant or unstable/uncontrolled acute or chronic medical conditions at
             screening, as determined by the Investigator, that would preclude a subject from
             participating safely in the study (e.g., hypertension, chronic lung disease, heart
             disease, neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders) based on screening
             assessments such as safety labs, medical history, and physical/oral examinations;

          2. Self-reports or safety labs that indicate diabetes;

          3. Use of medicine for treatment of depression, unless on a stable dose for the past 6
             months prior to screening and deemed clinically stable by the PI.

          4. Current scheduled treatment for asthma within the past consecutive 12 months prior to
             screening. As needed treatment, such as inhalers, may be included at the PIs
             discretion pending approval from the medical monitor.

             determined by the Investigator at Screening;

          9. History or presence of hemophilia or any other bleeding or clotting disorders;

         10. Use of anticoagulants (e.g., clopidogrel [Plavix®], warfarin [Coumadin®, Jantoven®],
