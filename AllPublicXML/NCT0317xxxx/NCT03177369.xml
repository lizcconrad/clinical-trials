  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococci represent the first etiologic agents of bone and joint infection (BJI), leading
      glycopeptides use, especially in case of methicillin-resistance or betalactam intolerance.
      Teicoplanin may represent an alternative to vancomycin because of its acceptable bone
      penetration and possible subcutaneous administration. Various studies have shown that
      teicoplanin pharmacodynamic profile was superior compared to vancomycin regarding bone
      diffusion. Few studies have investigated the use of teicoplanin in BJI, particularly through
      subcutaneous administration.

      The aim of this study assesses the efficacy and tolerance of teicoplanin in S. aureus BJI,
      especially focusing on subcutaneous use. This study is a retrospective single-center
      observational cohort study (2001 to 2011) including all consecutive patients managed at our
      institution receiving teicoplanin as part of S. aureus BJI treatment.

    <measure>Efficacy of teicoplanin in S.aureus bone and joint infection</measure>
    <time_frame>90 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The median total duration of follow-up is 90 weeks. Outcome of patients having had teicoplanin is described in this part. Treatment failure is defined as persisting infection under appropriate antimicrobial therapy, relapse after the interruption of antimicrobial therapy, necessity of surgical revision on the account of persisting septic focus ≥5 days after the first intervention, superinfections, and/or fatal outcome if BJI-related.
The results obtained with IV or SC administration are compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerance of teicoplanin in S.aureus bone and joint infection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The median total duration of teicoplanin therapy is 6 weeks (IV or SC). Teicoplanin-related adverse events (AE) occurring during follow-up are notified and classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, National Cancer Institute, 2003). Teicoplanin accountability in the AE occurrence is left to the clinician appreciation, with the help of a pharmacovigilance specialist in doubtful cases.
The results obtained with IV or SC administration are compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacocinetiks characteristics : Cmin value</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>During the first 14 days of treatment, at least one Cmin value is available. A Cmin &gt;15 mg/L is taken as an acceptable therapeutic target. Patients with a Cmin &gt;25 mg/L is considered as overexposure.
(The results for overexposure and Cmin under the therapeutic target are compared for IV and SC administration.)</description>
