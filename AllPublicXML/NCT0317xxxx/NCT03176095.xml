    <textblock>
      Background/Aim: Celiac disease is a common immune-mediated disorder, and the only currently
      available treatment is a gluten-free diet. Recent studies have shown several probiotics to
      carry properties that might positively influence the immunological activity in celiac
      patients.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate how daily consumption of probiotics would
      affect levels of tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA), markers of celiac disease
      autoimmunity in the periphery, as compared to placebo in children at genetic risk for celiac
      disease.

      Methods: Between 2012 and 2015, 90 children were recruited from two ongoing prospective
      celiac disease screening studies at the Skåne University Hospital, Sweden. Participants were
      randomized to either daily consumption of 2 lactobacilli strains or placebo for the duration
      of 6 months.

      Blood samples were drawn at 0, 3 and 6 months and analyzed for both IgA-tTGA and IgG-tTGA
      using radioligand binding assays.

    <description>The participants in the Probiotic group were provided with dietary supplements in the form as sachets with freeze dried bacteria (active lactobacilli culture) mixed with maltodextrin for daily intake (1 per day). The powder was dissolved in water or other non-alcoholic cold drink mixed with fruit before ingestion.
The probiotic product consisted of two different bacterial strains.</description>
