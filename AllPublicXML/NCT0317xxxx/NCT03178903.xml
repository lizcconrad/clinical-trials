  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of tDCS (transcranial direct current
      stimulation) for increasing exercise adherence among low active individuals with elevated
      depressive symptoms. The investigators expect that this project will contribute much needed
      knowledge about the role that tDCS can play in changing the affective experience of exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise adherence is a significant public health problem. Affective experiences during
      exercise predict long-term physical activity (PA) levels. Therefore, approaches to improving
      the affective experience of exercise are both important and likely to have high impact. This
      may be particularly true among individuals with elevated depressive symptoms due to their
      tendency toward more negative and less positive affect. tDCS is a noninvasive brain
      stimulation approach with a growing body of literature supporting its effects on cognitive
      and emotional processing in varied populations, including some support for those with
      depression. In addition, there is recent increased interest in utilizing tDCS in the context
      of exercise (see above) and in obesity prevention. While the effects of tDCS on behavioral
      and cognitive functioning are still developing, promising findings have emerged for tDCS used
      in repeated combination with a behavioral or cognitive intervention. Given that tDCS is
      relatively safe, inexpensive, and portable, individuals who struggle with enjoying exercise
      could be afforded a practical option for increasing and maintaining physical activity levels.

      We propose to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of tDCS versus sham delivered
      3x/week for 8 weeks in the context of a supervised aerobic exercise (AE) program among 72
      low-active individuals with elevated depressive symptoms. Follow-up assessments will be
      conducted at end of treatment, 3, and 6 months.
