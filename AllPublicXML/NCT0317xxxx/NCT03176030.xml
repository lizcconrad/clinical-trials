  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition in older inpatients is a significant problem espicially among those with
      dementia. A number of methods have been used to tackle this issue and oral nutritional
      supplements (ONS) were proven to be the most effective way. However, they are limited by
      their poor tolerability due to lack of familiarity with these products. An alternative method
      is to fortify familiar food with protein, energy and micronutrient. thus, the aim of this
      study to test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering fortified foods to older
      patients whilst in hospital including those with dementia and frailty. This pilot study will
      compare the daily protein and energy intake in older people before and after offering
      fortified food. Furthermore, patients' likeability and staff acceptability of these fortified
      foods will be assessed.

      Malnutrition is a significant problem amongst hospitalised older people, and can impede
      effective recovery. Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are limited by their poor tolerability
      and an alternative strategy is food fortification, the addition of
      protein/energy/micronutrients to frequently eaten food. The aim of this pilot study is to
      establish the feasibility and acceptability of delivering fortified foods to older people
      including those who have dementia and frailty whilst in hospital and to assess whether
      fortified foods could increase the energy and protein intake.

      This is a quasi-experimental study on acute medical wards for older inpatient in two UK
      hospitals, with a before and after comparison. The intervention involves the provision of
      additional between-meal fortified foods (enhanced with protein, energy, and micronutrients)
      and meal supplementation. Daily energy and protein intake will be assessed for three
      consecutive days during the baseline period and then in the intervention period. Likeability
      of fortified food and food choices (the number, type, and frequency of fortified foods
      consumed) will be examined. Likeability of fortified food by patients will be assessed using
      likeability scales. Interviews or focus groups will be conducted with staff to assess the
      acceptability of fortified food. Costs related to developing, packing and delivering the
      fortified foods will be calculated.

      The findings of this pilot study will identify whether delivering fortified food is feasible
      in acute elderly care wards, which foods are preferred and their acceptability. The results
      will inform the design of a definitive clinical trial.

    <description>Daily dietary intake will be assessed on three days during both the baseline and intervention periods using visual assessment. each food or meal will be weighed before serving and once the patient has finished using calibrated scales. In addition, a photograph of each plate of food will be taken before and after consumption for each eligible patient. At the end of each meal, the proportion of uneaten (leftover) food will be recorded in quartiles (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) for each component</description>

    <description>The number, type, and frequency of fortified foods chosen by eligible patients during the intervention period will be recorded. This will be done by using a food chart with images. Thus data will be collected on the type of foods (ice-creams, biscuits, soups or cakes) chosen, flavors preferred by individual patients initially and repeat choices, the number of foods chosen each time and at which time of the day.</description>

    <description>A purposive sample staff (nursing staff, catering staff and volunteers) involved in the delivery of fortified foods from the study wards in both hospitals will be invited to take part in interviews or focus groups. Participants will be recruited until theoretical saturation has been met; a total sample of approximately 15-20 staff members across the two settings is anticipated to be adequate.</description>

    <description>Fortified foods will be delivered to this group for 3 consecutive days mainly on a mid-meal trolley three times a day (between breakfast and lunch around 10am, between lunch and dinner around 3 pm, and in the evening). However, fortified foods will be available 24 hours and patients will be encouraged to order as many as they like anytime during the day.</description>

    <description>The intervention under study is the provision of between-meal fortified foods (enhanced with protein, energy, and micronutrients) and meal supplementation where meals are poorly consumed. Foods will include both savory and sweet foods with different flavors. Foods will be matched as closely as possible in protein and energy and are calculated to provide typically 210 kcal and 5g protein per item. The volume / weight of the foods are standardized to be of relatively small portion size, such as 100 ml for ice-creams, 40 g for cakes and biscuits, and 100 ml for soup. Some of the products will be supplemented with micronutrients particularly needed by older adults, such as Vitamins (C, D, folic acid, B2, B6) and calcium at one third of the Dietary Reference Values (DRV) per portion. The aim is to achieve a daily consumption of two additional fortified food items.</description>
