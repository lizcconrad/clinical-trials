  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) represents the best treatment for patients with selected, early
      stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to the gap between the number of patients on the
      waiting list and the available donors, patients with HCC wait ~1 year to be transplanted.
      While waiting, 25-30% of patients need to come off the transplant list due to tumor
      progression beyond transplant criteria (extrahepatic disease, vascular invasion or increase
      in tumor burden beyond enlistment criteria). To try to avoid this progression, patients are
      treated while waiting with &quot;bridging therapies&quot;, mainly transarterial chemoembolization
      (TACE) and ablation. Around 30% of patients are not eligible for these treatments (.e.g. due
      to poor liver function). Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been shown to be an
      effective treatment for advanced HCC in primarily small, single institutional studies and its
      safety has been reported in cirrhotics. SBRT could be used in patients not eligible to TACE
      or ablation as a bridge to LT reducing the risk of progression in the waiting list. This
      study will evaluate if patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC benefit from receiving SBRT
      while awaiting LT. Patients will be randomized to a treatment arm where they will receive
      SBRT as a bridge therapy or to a no intervention arm. Outcomes prior and post to transplant
      will be performed to evaluate the differences between both arms: proportion of patients that
      do not drop-out of the list (are transplanted), liver decompensation while waiting,
      perioperative measures in those that are transplanted, time to transplant or drop-out,
      overall survival, disease-free survival in those that are transplanted in a population of
      about 330 patients across all sites.

      The RADBRI trial is designed as an explanatory, multicenter, open-label, 2-arm parallel group
      superiority randomized trial with stratification by center and blood group, random permuted
      blocks (lengths of 4 or 6) and balanced allocation (1:1) conducted in 8 centers across the
      world. Including a population of adult patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) included
      in the waiting list for a liver transplant (LT) that are not eligible for transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) or ablation as a bridge to transplant but are eligible to
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Participants will be randomly assigned to either no
      intervention or SBRT with a 1:1 allocation as per an online, central randomization service
      (Sealed Envelopeâ„¢) and stratified by site and by blood type (ABO type) using random permuted
      blocks (lengths 4 or 6). Aiming for a total sample of 332 (166 per group). Patients will be
      followed for 18 months until drop-out from waiting list or LT. A computed tomography (CT) or
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level will be performed every 3
      months while waiting. In those that get transplanted, follow-up will be carried out for
      additional 36 months (every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter).
