      To access the safety and performance of the XPro System to facilitate hemostasis in patients
      undergoing percutaneous endovascular procedures utilizing 8-18 Fr introducer sheath via the
      common femoral.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-center, single arm study to assess the safety and performance of
      the XPro System compared to a historical control developed from published studies of two
      marketed competitive devices, Perclose ProGlide® and Prostar® XL (both from Abbott Vascular,
      Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA). The goal of the study is to show that XPro System is
      non-inferior to the competitors in efficacy and safety. Patients scheduled for percutaneous
      BAV, TAVR/TAVI, EVAR, or TEVAR procedures using an 8-18 Fr introducer sheath will be screened
      for study eligibility. Patients will be followed for 30 days post procedure.
