  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent study suggested that oxidative stress resulting from increased production of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a crucial role in the development of diabetic
      complications. The researches aim to monitor the level of oxidative stress of patient in
      different stage of diabetic nephropathy before and after insulin pump therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwidely, about 30% of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and 20%-50% of T2DM patients
      suffered diabetic nephropathy (DN). Oxidative stress resulting from increased production of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a crucial role in the development of diabetic
      complications. Insulin pump therapy is better than subcutaneous injection in terms of the
      drug safety and effectiveness. The researches aim to monitor the level of oxidative stress of
      patient in different stage of diabetic nephropathy before and after insulin pump therapy.

    <description>The total requisite amount=0.44×weight (Kg); The preprandial and basal amount respectively took up 50% of integral dose.15 minutes before meal the preprandial insulin was equally given by 3 times. The basal insulin was pumped at 00:00-3:00，3:00-8:00，8:00-14:00，14:00-20:00，20:00-24:00.</description>
