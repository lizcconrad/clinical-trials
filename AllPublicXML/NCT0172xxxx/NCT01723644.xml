      CLINPCT study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open intervention clinical trial
      including adult patients admitted in the emergency department with community-acquired
      pneumonia. The objective of this clinical trial is to compare two strategies: clinical
      reassessment and procalcitonin guided diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in patients with
      community-acquired pneumonia. In the clinical reassessment arm, antibiotherapy is
      systematically started in the emergency department. The continuation, the discontinuation or
      the modification of the antibiotherapy initially prescribed in the ED were made at Day 1 and
      Day 5 based on clinical assessment. On Day 1, the aim of the clinical reassessment is
      diagnosis reassessment: to confirm or not the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and
      to confirm or not the antibiotherapy. On Day 5, the aim of the clinical reassessment is to
      evaluate the possibility to stop the current antibiotherapy based on criteria for clinical
      stability defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Temperature ≤37.8°C, Heart
      rate ≤100 beats/min, Respiratory rate ≤24 breaths/min, Systolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg,
      Arterial oxygen saturation ≥90% or pO2 ≥60 mm Hg on room air). In the procalcitonin arm,
      initiation and discontinuation of the antibiotherapy is based on the antibiotic stewardship
      based on procalcitonin (PCT) cut-off ranges previously published. Re-evaluation of the
      clinical status and measurement of serum PCT levels is mandatory after 6-24 h in all
      persistently sick and hospitalized patients in who antibiotic are withheld. The PCT algorithm
      can be overruled by pre-specified criteria, e.g. in patients with immediately
      life-threatening disease. If the algorithm is overruled and antibiotics are given, an early
      discontinuation of antibiotic therapy after 3, 5 or 7 days is more or less endorsed based on
      PCT levels. In hospitalized patients with ongoing antibiotic therapy PCT levels are
      reassessed on days 3, 5 and 7 and antibiotics will be discontinued using the PCT cut-offs
      defined above.
