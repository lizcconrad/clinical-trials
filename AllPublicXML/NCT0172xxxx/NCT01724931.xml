      The purpose of this study is to determine whether aminopterin is effective in the treatment
      of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study that will evaluate
      the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties (the absorption, distribution and
      excretion) of aminopterin following oral administration by subjects with active rheumatoid
      arthritis (≥ 6 tender and ≥ 6 swollen joints) who have not been treated with methotrexate
      (MTX). Subjects are randomized to one of three treatments: placebo, 1 mg of LD-aminopterin,
      or 3 mg of LD-aminopterin in a 1:1:1 ratio. The study hypothesis is that the 3 mg
      LD-aminopterin per week is effective at treating rheumatoid arthritis compared to placebo.

        large joints=2; 4-10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)=3; &gt;10
        joints (at least 1 small joint)=5.

        B. Serology (at least 1 test result is needed for classification):

        Negative RF and negative ACPA=0; Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA=2; High-positive RF
        or high-positive ACPA=3.

        C. Acute-phase reactants (at least 1 test result is needed for classification):
