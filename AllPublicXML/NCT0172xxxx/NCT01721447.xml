  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to determine if using Optison echocardiography contrast increases
      sensitivity and specificity of detecting left atrial appendage thrombus in transesophageal
      echocardiography studies as opposed to standard 2D and 3D TEE imaging without the use of echo
      contrast.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate determination of the presence or absence of left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus has
      a large impact on the clinical course of patients with atrial fibrillation or ischemic stroke
      and has large financial implications as well. Misdiagnosing the presence of LAA thrombus can
      lead to unnecessarily cancelled procedures (cardioversion and atrial fibrillation ablation)
      and potentially hazardous, unnecessary changes in clinical care (such as prolonged Coumadin
      anticoagulation). Missing LAA thrombus can result in continuation of cardioversion or atrial
      fibrillation ablation procedures at a time when there is higher risk of subsequent embolic
      stroke.

      Several of the patients with atrial fibrillation require transesophageal echocardiography
      (TEE) performed prior to cardioversion or atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. There is
      opportunity to enroll most of these patients in our proposed study. There has been
      essentially no work published about the use of echo contrast materials in TEE (other than
      agitated saline), particularly the use of Optison. Thus, the investigators will be exploring
      a new field in echocardiography and echo contrast.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt; 18 years old

          2. Cognitively sound and able to provide informed consent

          3. Indicated for TEE as a standard clinical procedure for evaluation of cardiac health
             status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded for meeting the contraindications for TEE or Optison
        administration.

          1. Contraindications for TEE: Esophageal stricture, tracheoesophageal fistula,
             postesophageal surgery, esophageal trauma, esophagectomy/esophagogastrectomy, barrett
             esophagus, hiatal hernia, large descending aortic aneurysm, unilateral vocal cord
             paralysis, esophageal varices, postradiation therapy, previous bariatric surgery,
             zenker diverticulum, colonic interposition, dysphagia

          2. Contraindications for administration of Optison, including but not limited to:
             Right-to-left cardiovascular shunt, bidirectional cardiovascular shunt, history of
             myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary
             hypertension, tachycardia, Torsades de Pointes, prolonged Q-T Interval, acute heart

             hypoxia, allergy to albumin; Individuals objecting to receiving albumin, a blood
             product, for personal, religious, or cultural reasons.

          3. Not able to provide informed consent

          4. Women who are or who may become pregnant (since Optison may have effects on the fetus
             that are currently unknown). Women who show evidence for practicing approved
             contraceptive measure (abstinence, male or female condoms, on contraceptive pills,
             injection, ring or having mechanical devices such as Intra Uterine Devices) will be
