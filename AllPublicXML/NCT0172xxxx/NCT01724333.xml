  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assessment of oral and dental problems is seldom routine in clinical oncology, despite the
      potential negative impact of these problems on nutritional status, social function and
      quality of life (QoL). A brief, assessment tool for oral/dental health and related QoL-issues
      to improve symptom management has been requested. The present study will be conducted on
      behalf of and with support from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of
      Cancer - (EORTC) Quality of Life Group (QLG). The study represents phase IV, the final step,
      in the development of an international, symptom specific questionnaire module, focusing on
      oral and dental problems in relation to cancer and its treatment. Phase I-III of this
      stepwise development process was conducted from 2008 to 2011, as an international
      collaboration and conducted according to the guidelines for module development set forth by
      the EORTC QLG. The resulting module, the QLQ-OH17, is now subject to an international field
      testing and validation study as described in this project description.

      The present version of the QLQ-OH17 consists of 17 items conceptualized into four multi-item
      scales (pain/discomfort, xerostomia, eating and information) and three single items related
      to use of dentures and future worries. The aim of the present study is to conduct phase IV;
      an international field study to confirm the psychometric properties of the QLQ-OH17

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EORTC guidelines will be strictly followed also in phase IV of the module development.
      Eligible patients will be contacted by the local study coordinator or a study nurse and
      informed about the study. After having provided written informed consent, they will be
      presented with the following two questionnaires for self-report of general symptoms, specific
      dental and oral symptoms, and quality of life issues; the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-OH17. In
      addition to these two, a short debriefing interview will be conducted by study coordinator /
      study nurse for assessment of feasibility and patients' opinion about the questionnaires.

      The case report form (CRF) on medical and demographic data will be completed by the study
      coordinator / study nurse before or after the patients have completed their part.

      A subset of the patients will be assessed twice, as examination of test - retest reliability
      is important in phase IV of the development process.

    <description>The study aims to validate a questionnaire for assessment of oral morbidity, oral health , and quality of life in relation to cancer treatment. Specific outcomes are prevalence of patients with moderate to severe oral morbidity due to cancer treatment (mucositis,stomatitis, taste change, decayed /loose teeth, osteoradionecrosis, ulcers), to investigate if the severity varies with certain background variables , for example, diagnostic group, age, sex, stage of disease, type of treatment, and to investigate the discriminant validity, reliability and responsiveness of the specific items in patient subgroups</description>
