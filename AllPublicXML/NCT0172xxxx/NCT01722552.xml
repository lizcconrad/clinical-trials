  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CATS project is designed to increase understanding of interventions that are feasible and
      effective in helping injection drug users (IDU) or other patients at high risk of poor
      medication adherence who are HIV-positive to maintain a high ART adherence. The study will
      involve: assessing the feasibility and acceptability of using real-time feedback, a wireless
      technology-updated adaptation of an approach the investigators found to be feasible and
      effective in China, to promote ART adherence among Chinese patients, including IDU;
      generating preliminary effectiveness data of real-time feedback on adherence, CD4 count, and
      HIV viral load; and identifying the factors that explain how real-time feedback influences
      intervention success or failure.

      The specific aims of the study are:

      SA1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of using real-time feedback, a wireless
      technology-updated adaptation of an approach we found to be feasible and effective in China,
      to promote ART adherence among Chinese patients. The investigators will conduct a pilot RCT
      of the real-time feedback intervention among Chinese patients in order to assess its
      feasibility and acceptability in this population.

      SA2: Generate preliminary effectiveness data of real-time feedback on adherence, CD4 count,
      and HIV viral load. The RCT will allow the researchers to generate rigorous estimates of
      effect sizes on these important endpoints.

      SA3: Describe the factors that explain how real-time feedback influences intervention success
      or failure. The investigators will use a quantitative-qualitative mixed-methods research
      approach to explore how the intervention influences the experience of adherence support in
      this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will implement CATS over 2.5 years by implementing a randomized controlled
      trial to assess real-time feedback, an intervention that utilizes wireless technology via an
      electronic pill container device ('Wisepill'), and investigating the mechanisms by which the
      intervention operates using quantitative and qualitative research methods. 120 patients will
      be enrolled in a HIV clinic in Nanning, capital of Guangxi province, a border province with
      high rates of HIV and IDU. Enrolled patients will be randomized to intervention vs.
      comparison group for the 6-month intervention. The study will follow all patients for an
      additional 3 months to determine sustainability of intervention impact. In addition to
      adherence and clinical data, quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using survey
      instruments, focus groups, and in-depth interviews. Analysis of these data will enable
      achievement of the specific aims and contribute to the scientific evidence base on effective
      approaches to promoting ART adherence among IDU and other patients.

      <recruitment_details>We recruited subjects from December 2012-April 2013. They were recruited at the Guangxi Provincial ART clinic in Nanning, China. Patients were eligible if they were receiving or initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), aged 18 years or above, deemed at risk for poor adherence by clinic staff or patients themselves, and owned a mobile phone.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>After enrollment, each subject was given a Wisepill electronic adherence monitoring container for use with his/her ART medications. Subjects selected one or more ART medications to be monitored within the device. All subjects underwent baseline adherence monitoring using Wisepill for 3 months before randomization.</pre_assignment_details>
