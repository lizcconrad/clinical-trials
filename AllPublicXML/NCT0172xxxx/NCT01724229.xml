    <textblock>
      The purpose of this evaluation is to observe the performance of two (2) different skin care
      treatment protocols on the skin:

      #1 Kendall™ Body Wash &amp; Shampoo in combination with the Moisture Barrier Cream; or #2
      Kendall™ 2-in-1 Cleanser in combination with the Anti-fungal Cream.

      The scientific evidence supports using these types of skin care products to keep the skin
      healthy in the presence of moisture, urine, stool, or fungal infection. The cleansers are
      preferred over soap and water and can be applied on all areas of the skin. The Moisture
      Barrier Cream is formulated especially for skin exposed to moisture, urine, or stool. The
      Antifungal Cream is utilized for fungal infections associated with athlete's foot, jock itch,
      and ring worm to relieve itching, soreness, and irritation.

      The Kendall™ Body Wash &amp; Shampoo is a no-rinse cleanser that gently removed dirt, urine, and
      stool while maintaining the natural pH of the skin (although it contains a shampoo
      component); it can be applied on all areas of the skin. Kendall™ Moisture Barrier Cream
      performs as a barrier to moisture and irritants when the natural barrier ability of the skin
      has been compromised.

      Kendall™ 2-in-1 Cleanser is a no-rinse cleanser that gently removes dirt, urine, and stool
      and protects the skin from damage. Kendall™ Antifungal Cream is used on fungal infections to
      relieve itching and discomfort.
