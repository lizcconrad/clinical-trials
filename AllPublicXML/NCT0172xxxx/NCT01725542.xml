      Evaluation of efficacy and tolerance to a QUadruple therapy with Asunaprevir , Daclatasvir,
      Ribavirin and pegylated Interferon alpha-2a, in HIV-HCV genotype 1 or 4 coinfected patients
      previously null responders to a standard Pegylated Interferon -Ribavirin regimen.

      The proportion of patients presenting cirrhosis (defined by a METAVIR F4 score on liver
      biopsy and/or with hepatic impulse elastometry ≥ 15 kPa) will be limited to 50% of all of the
      patients included

      The clinical trial is multi-center, national, Phase 2, open-label, single-arm.

      Primary objective is to estimate the Sustained Virological Response rate (SVR) 12 weeks after
      24 weeks of treatment with quadruple therapy combining Asunaprevir, Daclatasvir, Ribavirin
      and Pegylated Interferon alpha-2a in HIV-HCV genotype 1 or 4 coinfected patients previously
      null responders to a Pegylated Interferon -Ribavirin standard regimen.

      Estimated enrolment is 65 patients during the enrolment period (9 months). The first 12
      patients included will be on Raltegravir, Emtricitabine and Tenofovir and will participate to
      the pharmacological sub-study.

      Schedule of assessments:

      Evaluation of inclusion criteria: 4 to 8 weeks Anti-HCV treatment: 28 weeks (or shorter
      according to futility rules) Follow up: 24 weeks following the end of the treatment
