      EGFR-TKI is good for the patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.We design this
      clinical trail to confirm if the efficacy of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
      Inhibitor(EGFR-TKI )(ICOTINIB) is better than whole brain irradiation for the patient with
      EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.
