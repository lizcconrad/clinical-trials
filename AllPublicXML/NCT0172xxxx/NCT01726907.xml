      Traditional transcervical incision of the upper neck is a safe and effective approach for
      resection of the submandibular gland (SMG). However, external scar at the highly visible area
      may be a burden for the patients and sometimes may lead to disfiguring hypertrophic scar or
      keloid. Recently, the investigators reported our surgical technique of 'endoscope-assisted'
      and 'robot-assisted' SMG resection, which was feasible and showed excellent cosmetic outcomes
      since the scar was hidden by the auricle and hair. In our previous feasibility study of
      robot-assisted SMG resection, the investigators proposed that robot-assisted technique may
      overcome the limitations of endoscopic instruments with rigid and straight nature without
      articulation and surgical view of two-dimension. In addition, the ergonomically designed
      operating system was more convenient for the surgeon considering the frequent collision of
      the endoscopic instruments and reversed hand-eye coordination in endoscope-assisted surgery.
      However, clinical trial comparing the surgical outcomes of the two techniques has not been
      reported in the literature.

      In this study, the investigators made a prospective comparative study of robot-assisted
      versus endoscope-assisted SMG resection to determine whether robot-assisted technique has
      benefits regarding early surgical outcomes.

    <description>The surgical procedure and the considerations for surrounding neurovascular structures were similar to that of the endoscope-assisted SMG resection. The da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) including a 30° dual channel endoscopic arm and two instrument arms was introduced. The SMG was retracted using the 5-mm Maryland forceps on the left and the dissection was conducted using a 5-mm spatula monopolar cautery or a Harmonic curved shears on the right. A Yankauer suction handled by a bed-side assistant could be used for counter traction of the gland which facilitated the dissection procedure.</description>

    <description>An assistant held a 10-mm 30° rigid endoscope allowing the operating surgeon to use both hands. Surgical resection tools such as dissector and Harmonic scalpel (Harmonic Ace 23E®; Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, Cincinnati, OH, USA) was held in the right hand and a Yankauer suction or a Debakey forcep was held on the left for traction of the SMG. The dissection plane between the capsule of the SMG was conducted under magnified endoscopic view using the the blade of the Harmonic scalpel and the endoscopic dissector. Routine identification of the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve was unnecessary in SMG resection, since the dissection plane was always deep to the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia which includes the fascia of the gland. The Wharton's duct, facial artery and vein were ligated using the Harmonic scalpel or vascular clip.</description>
