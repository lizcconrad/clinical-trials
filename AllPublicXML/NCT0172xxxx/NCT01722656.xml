  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of intravitreal aflibercept (anti-VEGF therapy) in patients
      with a type of macular degeneration known as vascularized pigment epithelial detachment.
      Previous studies have shown a generally poor outcome in treating this difficult to treat form
      of wet macular degeneration. More recently, multiple pilot studies have shown positive
      benefits to using anti-VEGF therapy. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      treating vascularize pigment epithelial detachment associated with wet macular degeneration
      with intravitreal aflibercept injection.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is ≥ 50 years of age

          -  Subject is willing to participate in this study and to follow the criteria and
             protocol of this study.

          -  The study eye is treatment naïve regarding treatment of neovascular AMD.

          -  Subject is not involved with another clinical study currently.

          -  Subject is willing to follow the protocol outlined in the study.

          -  Ability to understand the informed consent and willingness to sign the informed
             consent.

          -  Presence of a submacular vascularized or fibrovascular PED. The investigator must
             search for the characteristic features of a vascularized PED summarized here:

               1. A notch of irregularity associated with an orange-yellow round, oval, or
                  bean-shaped elevation of the RPE with a smooth, convex surface is seen on
                  examination and fundus photography (FP). Fluorescein angiography (FA) shows
                  uniform staining of the PED with a well-defined margin, and more intense staining
                  (hot-spot) for the focus of the CNV.

               2. A fibrovascular PED with occult neovascularization typically shows stippled
                  hyperfluorescence in the early phase with increasing hyperfluorescent staining
                  and leakage in later phases of FA and a variable surrounding margin. There may be
                  RPE folds.

               3. Regarding PED with a component of retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP), the
                  early features on FP including intraretinal neovascularization (IRN) frequently
                  with adjacent small retinal hemorrhages in its lateral expansion in an
                  irregularly stellate pattern before the development of retinal-choroidal
                  anastomosis and the eventual PED in the later phases. The investigator is
                  required to perform indocyanine-green (ICG) angiography at baseline to establish
                  a RAP lesion and to rule-out polypoidal vasculopathy lesions, since the FA images
                  may not be distinct.

               4. The investigator must also search for other features associated with a PED
                  indicating the presence of a vascular component, i.e. hemorrhage, exudates,
                  and/or chorioretinal folds.

               5. The investigator must confirm the presence of a PED on FA/FP and OCT. Spectral
                  Domain OCT will be utilized. Specifically, the Spectralis OCT manufactured by
                  Heidleberg to maintain uniformity for all the sites. The PED height, SA, GLD, and
                  volume will be measured from the OCT images. The characteristic OCT findings of
                  the vascularized PED must be confirmed, including a distinct elevation of the
                  highly hyperreflective RPE layer with mild backscattering of the underlying
                  choroidal layer in the portion of the PED without any CNV. For the portion of the
                  PED with underlying CNV, typical OCT findings consist of moderate
                  hyperreflectivity contiguous to the overlying markedly hyperreflective detached
                  RPE corresponding to the CNV that usually extends to the choroidal layer. Besides
                  the OCT characteristics confirmation must be made on the FP/FA images of the
                  vascularized PED, as outlined above in detail.

          -  Central foveal involvement by the PED or the CNV due to age-related macular
             degeneration (AMD). The CNV may be classic, occult, or mixed, as long as it is
             associated with a PED. The CNV may be within the PED or adjacent to the margin of the
             PED.

          -  PED ≤ 12 disc area in size.

          -  BCVA with ETDRS of ≥ 19 letters and ≤ 73 letters (20/400 to 20/40).

          -  Evidence of submacular fluid outside or surrounding the PED.

          -  Surface area of the submacular hemorrhage needs to be &lt; 50% of the entire PED.

          -  Submacular fibrosis needs to be &lt; 50% of the entire PED.

          -  Sufficiently clear media (cornea, anterior chamber, lens, vitreous) for OCT, FA and
             FP.

          -  Intraocular pressure (IOP) of 25mmHg or less in the study eye, with or without use of
             ocular hypotensive agents.

          -  Prior treatment of neovascular AMD or any other forms of neovascularization in the
             fellow eye, including anti-VEGF or other forms of therapy targeted specifically for
             the fellow eye does not exclude the fellow eye from enrollment in this study. Prior
             focal corticosteroid treatment is allowed, as long as there is a lack of involvement
             of the study eye. However prior (within 90 days of Day 0) or current systemic
             corticosteroid therapy (oral or intravenous corticosteroid treatment) is not
             permitted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior treatment of neovascular AMD in eye for proposed enrollment (non-naïve eye),
             including previous anti-vascular endothelial factor (anti-VEGF) therapy, photodynamic
             therapy (PDT), radiation therapy, corticosteroid treatment, surgical treatment for
             CNV, thermal laser treatment, and any other prior treatment for neovascular AMD.

          -  Known serious allergies to aflibercept, fluorescein dye, drugs for pupillary dilation,
             topical anesthetic, sterilizing solution (e.g. Betadine Solution).

          -  Contraindication to pupillary dilation in study eye.

          -  Any condition (including inability to read visual acuity charts, or language barrier)
             that may preclude subjects ability to comply with the study protocol and requirements.

          -  Presence of any advanced systemic condition or end-stage disease, advanced Alzheimer
             Syndrome, end-stage cancer, etc., which will likely prevent subject from completing
             study.

          -  Previous therapeutic radiation in the region of the study eye.

          -  Prior retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tear in study eye.

          -  Prior ocular surgery (except YAG laser capsulotomy) for study within the past 90 days.

          -  Anticipated ocular surgery (except YAG laser capsulotomy) for the next 12 months

             chorioretinitis, etc.

          -  Presence of ocular disease other than AMD affecting study eye, i.e. presumed ocular
             histoplasmosis syndrome, android streaks, pathologic myopia (spherical equivalent of ≥
             -8 diopters of myopia or axial length of ≥ 25mm), choroidal rupture, multifocal
             choroiditis, etc.

             contraceptives for 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device
             [IUD]; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or
             jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly) *Contraception is not
             required for men with documented vasectomy. ** Post-menopausal women must be
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months in order not to be considered of child-bearing
             potential. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with
