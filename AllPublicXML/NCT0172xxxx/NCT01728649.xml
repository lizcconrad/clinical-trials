  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reducing a patients body temperature (mild
      hypothermia of 33 degrees Centigrade) will significantly reduce the risk of brain injury
      (notably reperfusion injury and hemorrhagic conversion) in patients that have suffered a
      significant interruption of blood flow to an area of brain (occlusion of large proximal
      cerebral artery) and have undergone successful removal of that interruption
      (revascularization).This will be achieved by comparing patients that have undergone
      hypothermia to those that have not.

      This study is designed to examine the safety and proof of concept of therapeutic hypothermia
      prior to conventional revascularization in subjects experiencing acute ischemic stroke by
      comparing the results to subjects who remain at normal body temperature (normothermic) and
      proceed directly to reperfusion via conventional reperfusion intervention. The
      investigational plan also examines the following outcomes in 85 subjects randomized to either
      hypothermia or normothermia:

        -  Regulation of biomarkers indicative of ischemia-reperfusion injury

        -  Changes in blood brain injury using the Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM)
           protocol MRI as a surrogate imaging biomarker

        -  Incidence of hemorrhagic conversion post reperfusion

        -  Neurologic function at 90 days post acute ischemic stroke. The results of this study
           will be used to power a definitive phase III clinical trial evaluating the combination
           of hypothermia and revascularization versus reperfusion alone.

    <description>As part of standard of care, an interventional reperfusion procedure will be performed on all subjects using current FDA cleared device. Patient will also have a Quattro catheter placed in the femoral vein and temperature brought to 33 degrees centigrade as quickly as possible. They will stay in mild hypothermia for 12 hours and then be rewarmed very slowly. Patients will also undergo blood draws for biomarkers before reperfusion is achieved the immediately, 6 hours then 24 hours after reperfusion.</description>

    <description>Hypothermia will be achieved using the Zoll Thermogaurd XP technology with the Quattro catheter. This catheter has a 9.3 Fr diameter and is 43cm long. It will be placed in the patients femoral vein via Seldinger technique, before reperfusion is achieved. Hypothermia will be initiated prior to reperfusion. Once temperature has reached 33.5 degrees centigrade the patient will remain at that temperature for 12 hours after which the patient will undergo active gradual rewarming at 0.2 degrees centigrade per hour.</description>
