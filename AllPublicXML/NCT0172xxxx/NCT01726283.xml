  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet-A (UVA)-induced
      cross-linking of corneal collagen (CXL) in strengthening and optimizing the biomechanical and
      biochemical stability of the cornea in patients with fruste keratoconus (FFKC), corneas that
      are suspicious for FFKC and corneas thought to be at higher risk of developing ectasia that
      will be undergoing laser vision correction.

      This study is being performed to evaluate the efficacy of ultraviolet-A (UVA)-induced
      cross-linking of corneal collagen (CXL) in strengthening and optimizing the biomechanical and
      biochemical stability of the cornea in patients with fruste keratoconus (FFKC), corneas that
      are suspicious for FFKC and corneas thought to be at higher risk of developing ectasia that
      will be undergoing laser vision correction. CXL is thought to augment the tectonic strength
      of the cornea by using UVA light and the photo-mediator riboflavin. The purpose of this
      non-randomized study is to compare the visual results of patients who are suspicious for
      having an increased risk of ectasia with laser vision correction compared to a group of
      patients that does not have these risk factors. All excimer laser ophthalmic procedures
      currently being performed to correct myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism with FDA approved
      excimer lasers do so by removing corneal tissue and thereby potentially weakening the cornea
      biomechanically. This can result in ectasia even in patients without pre-existing risk
      factors.
