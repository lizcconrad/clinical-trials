  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck and shoulder pain (NSP) is fairly common among high school students in Korea.
      Presumably, the high prevalence of NSP in Korean adolescents is a consequence of an
      inappropriate static position for a prolonged period of time. We suspect that proper
      education and posture correction for Korean adolescents may decrease the prevalence or
      severity of NSP. Although several studies have focused on the etiology of NSP during
      adolescence, few studies have addressed the management or prevention of NSP in adolescents,
      despite its high prevalence in this age group. The aims of this prospective study was to
      identify the effects of education, in terms of recognition of this issue and posture
      correction, on prevalence and severity of NSP in Korean adolescents
