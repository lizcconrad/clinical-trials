  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) remain a significant challenge in our practice.
      However, pharmaceutical prophylaxis is only partially effective and can imply unpleasant
      adverse effects. Accordingly, the use of non-pharmacological methods in preventing PONV is
      appropriate. Acupuncture is reported to reduce PONV and pain, and the adverse events are
      minimal.

      The objective of this multicentre, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial is to
      investigate whether acupuncture can be a supplementary to the ordinary treatment in children
      undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. In addition, the non-specific effect of
      parental attitudes and expectations on the outcomes will be explored.

      Two hundred and eighty patients will be included and randomized into two groups

        1. Treatment group: acupuncture treatment (approximately 15 to 20 minutes) during
           anaesthesia and standard treatment

        2. Control group: standard treatment

      The primary endpoints in the intervention study are nausea, retching, vomiting and pain
      during 24 hours postoperatively. The effect of acupuncture will be studied with regard to any
      association with possible factors of predisposition to PONV, as well as with other factors
      registered during the study. Adverse events from acupuncture will be registered.

      The objective of the self-report questionnaires is to

        -  investigate parental attitudes and expectations to the acupuncture treatment pre- and
           postoperatively

        -  compare data of the outcomes from the intervention trial with data from the
           questionnaires, in order to find any correlation between parental beliefs, attitudes and
           expectations, and the effect of the acupuncture treatment
