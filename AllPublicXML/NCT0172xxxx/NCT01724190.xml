  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if supplementation with Vitamin D in children and
      adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes increases the number of patients who enter
      the honeymoon period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of the insulin
      secreting beta-cells of the pancreas. There is evidence that Vitamin D may play a role in the
      initial risk of development of autoimmune disease, including type 1 diabetes. However,
      Vitamin D may also play a role the natural progression of type 1 diabetes by altering innate
      insulin secretion and sensitivity and by influencing systemic inflammation, directly at the
      level of the beta-cell. Studies have shown that Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is
      frequently reported in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. A majority of newly
      diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes enter a period of partial clinical remission,
      characterized by low or even absent insulin requirements, also known as a honeymoon period.
      This honeymoon period is associated with improved metabolic control, near normal insulin
      sensitivity, and recovery of beta-cell function leading to preservation of endogenous insulin
      secretion. We hypothesize that supplementation with Vitamin D in children and adolescents
      with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes will halt the destructive process within the beta cell
      and improve beta-cell function by increasing endogenous insulin secretion and decreasing
      systemic inflammation, thereby increasing the rate of partial clinical remission.

    <description>Our primary outcome measure will be to determine the rate of partial clinical remission at 9 months of disease duration, which will be assessed by determining insulin dose adjusted hemoglobin A1c (IDAA1c) using the formula (HbA1c% + [4 x insulin dose u/kg/day]). A IDAA1c &lt;9 will be indicative of partial clinical remission.</description>
