    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and effects on Quality of Life
      (QOL) of tramadol/paracetamol (APAP) as an add-on therapy (medication taken in addition to
      another medication) in Filipino participants with chronic (lasting a long time)
      osteoarthritis (disorder, which is seen mostly in older persons, in which the joints become
      painful and stiff).

      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (study
      drug assigned by chance), controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and effects on
      QOL of tramadol/APAP as an add-on therapy in Filipino participants suffering from chronic
      pain because of chronic osteoarthritis. Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups:
      tramadol/APAP group and non tramadol/APAP group. Participants in tramadol/APAP group will
      receive celecoxib 200 milligram (mg) and fixed dose combination of tramadol (37.5 mg)/APAP
      (325 mg) as add on therapy, while the participants in non-tramadol/APAP group will receive
      celecoxib 200 mg only. The total duration of the study will be 4 weeks. The participants in
      both the groups will be given celecoxib 200 mg once daily for 4 weeks. In addition, the
      participants in the tramadol/APAP group will be given add-on tramadol/APAP doses 3 times a
      day for 4 weeks. Participants will be asked to return for follow-up at Weeks 2 and 4.
      Efficacy will be assessed using 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) while QOL will
      be assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Participant safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS-pain) Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a 100 millimeter (mm) scale. Intensity of pain range: 0 mm=no pain to 100 mm=worst possible pain. Change=scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in score from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

    <description>VAS is a 100 mm scale. Intensity of pain range: 0 mm=no pain to 100 mm=worst possible pain. Change=scores at observation minus score at Baseline.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a low back pain-specific, validated instrument that consists of questions related to limitations in performing specific activities of daily living and 1 question related to pain intensity. The ODI is a self-administered questionnaire that is usually completed in less than 5 minutes. The ODI consists of 10 sections. Each section consists of 6 statements ranked from 0 to 5 (0=good to 5=worse). A higher score represents greater disability.</description>

The ODI is a self-administered questionnaire that is usually completed in less than 5 minutes. The ODI consists of 10 sections. Each section consists of 6 statements ranked from 0 to 5 (0=good to 5=worse). A higher score represents greater disability.</description>
