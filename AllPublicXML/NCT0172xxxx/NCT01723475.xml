  <brief_title>First-in-man Dose Escalation Study of BAY2010112 in Patients With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Phase I, Dose-escalation Study to Characterize the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Maximum Tolerated Dose of BAY 2010112, Given Once Daily by Subcutaneous Administration or by Continuous Intravenous Infusion, in Subjects With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study where BAY2010112 is given to humans. Patients with castration
      resistant prostate cancer will be treated. Every patient will receive drug treatment, there
      is no placebo group. Patients will receive different dosages of BAY2010112 to determine the
      safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY2010112.

      The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics and the clinical efficacy of BAY2010112.

      BAY2010112 will be given daily as subcutaneous injection or as continuous intravenous
      infusion. Treatment will be stopped if the tumor continues to grow, if side effects, which
      the patient cannot tolerate, occur or if the patient decides to exit treatment.
