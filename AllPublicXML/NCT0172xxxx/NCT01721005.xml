    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of patient education on feeling the own
      pulse irregularity in the elderly population of Lieto.

      Prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) rises with age. Subjects have often symptoms like
      palpitation and discomfort but especially in elderly population there's significant quantity
      of persons who don't feel any symptoms and fail to seek for medical care for stroke
      prevention.

      The main objectives in this study are to find out the prevalence of AF in the elderly
      population of Lieto, to assess the feasibility and reability of patient education on feeling
      one's pulse irregularity and the affect to the quality of life of the participating subjects
      and monitoring the possible increased burden to the public health care system.

      The study contains two office visits with specified learning session and long-term phone-call
      follow-up.

      The main objectives in this study are to find out the prevalence of AF in the elderly
      population of Lieto, to assess the feasibility of patient education on feeling one's pulse
      irregularity and the affect to the quality of life of the participating subjects and
      monitoring the possible increased burden to the public health care system.

      The study contains two office visits with specified learning session and long-term phone-call
      follow-up. A specially trained nurse will initially give a 10 min education on pulse
      palpation to each person and evaluate their capacity to learn pulse palpation. During
      followup visits the compliance of the patient and possible new arrhythmias plus quality of
      life issues are recorded and their ability of pulse palpation is evaluated by artificial hand
      where various kinds of pulses are transmitted.
