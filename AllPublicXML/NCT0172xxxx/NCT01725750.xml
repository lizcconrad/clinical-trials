  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of 4 weeks of daily light exposure in reducing
      Post-Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Fatigue immediately post-treatment and at a one-month
      follow up. The investigators hypothesize that individuals receiving 4 weeks of bright white
      light treatment will report significant reductions in fatigue compared to individuals
      receiving dim red light treatment for the same duration of time, and that these treatment
      effects will be maintained one month after treatment completion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of bright white light exposure compared to dim red light exposure
      in reducing post-TBI fatigue, an 8-week, randomized parallel-group clinical trial will be
      performed. Outcome assessment will be blinded. Participants will complete a baseline battery
      (T1) including 72 hours of actigraphy. Participants will then be randomized to either the
      Bright White Light (BWL) or the Dim Red Light (DRL) group. After 4 weeks of daily, 30-minute
      light treatments, the baseline battery will be re-administered (T2) along with 3 more days of
      Actigraphy. A follow-up assessment involving the same measures will be administered 1
      month-post cessation of light therapy (T3). Participant treatment allocations will be masked
      for research team members conducting outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures will be
      administered to explore the effects of light therapy on mood, daytime sleepiness, sleep
      quality, circadian rhythms, anxiety, cognition and life satisfaction.

    <description>Philips Actiwatch Spectrum to measure circadian rhythms; it is the size and shape of a digital wristwatch and weighs about one ounce. It is worn on an ordinary watchband and is waterproof. Data can be downloaded and analyzed using Actiware software. The Actiwatch Spectrum logs all physical movement using a piezoelectric accelerometer and detects the presence of ambient light (400-700nm), making it a useful measure of circadian cycles because it allows for accurate quantitative assessment of periods of activity, rest and sleep.</description>
