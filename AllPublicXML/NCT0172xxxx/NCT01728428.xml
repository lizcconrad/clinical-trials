      To determine the clinical manifestation, diagnosis and treatment options of primary
      hemifacial spasm in Chinese outpatient subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 1000 outpatient subjects will be recruited. The inclusion criteria include clinically
      diagnosed primary hemifacial spasm, male or female 18 to 80 years old and informed consent
      has been obtained. The exclusion criteria include secondary hemifacial spasm, other
      involuntary facial movement disorder, history of surgery of microvascular decompression of
      the facial nerve and so on. The outcome measures include the percentage of the treatment
      methods of HFS in outpatient subjects, aggrevated and relieved factors of HFS symptom,
      concomitant symptoms of HFS and adverse events of botulinum toxin treatment in HFS patients.
