    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV adjunctive treatment dose-optimization study evaluating the efficacy,
      safety, and health outcomes of ezogabine/retigabine immediate release (IR) (GW582892)
      compared with placebo in adult subjects with partial-onset seizures (POS). This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study will compare
      ezogabine/retigabine IR (investigator-selected daily doses of 600 milligram (mg)/day, 750
      mg/day, 900 mg/day, 1050 mg/day or 1200 mg/day) with placebo. Study drug will be taken three
      times a day (TID) in equally or unequally divided doses.

      The study design includes up to a 10-week (wk) Screening (≤2 wks)/Baseline (8 wks) Phase, a
      Titration Phase (2 wks), Dose-Optimization Phase (8 wks), Maintenance Phase (8 wks), and
      Taper/Follow-Up Phase (3 wks). The total duration of the study for each subject will be
      approximately 31 wks, and at minimum approximately 27 wks if subjects provide reliable 28-day
      retrospective seizure data.

      Approximately 280 subjects will be screened with approximately 208 subjects randomly assigned
      to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio (ezogabine/retigabine IR, or placebo).

      Subjects will be instructed to start investigational product (IP) the day after the baseline
      visit. During the first week of the Titration Phase, subjects will be taking 300 mg/day (100
      mg TID). During the second week, subjects will be taking 450 mg/day (150 mg/day TID).

      At the beginning of the Dose-Optimization Phase (3rd week of study drug) subjects will take
      600 mg/day (200 mg TID) for one week. Thereafter during the Dose-Optimization Phase, subjects
      will continue to increase their daily dose by 150 mg per week until they have achieved their
      optimal tolerated dose. During this phase, the investigator may choose to have the subject
      stay on his/her designated dose for another week before attempting a dose increase until
      reaching a dose of 1200 mg/day. In addition, in the context of tolerability issues, the
      subject may be reduced to the preceding dose level for one week before attempting to increase
      the dose again at the next scheduled time point until the subject reaches optimal dose.
      Subjects unable to tolerate a minimum of 600 mg/day will be discontinued from the study.

      The Maintenance Phase will begin at Week 10 (Visit 8) and will last 8 weeks. During the
      Maintenance Phase, subjects will remain on the daily TID dose achieved at the end of the
      Dose-Optimization Phase.

      Seizure type and frequency will be monitored throughout the study via a Seizure Calendar and
      will be evaluated at each study visit. Subjects will be instructed to complete the daily
      Seizure Calendar during each phase of the study.

    <time_frame>Week 0 (end of Baseline Phase) through Week 18 (end of Maintenance Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of ezogabine/retigabine IR as an adjunctive treatment was to be evaluated by the percent change in the total partial seizure frequency, which was recorded by participants in the daily seizure calendar. The total 28-day POS rate is defined as the total number of POS reported during the evaluation period divided by the total number of applicable days during the evaluation period with this quotient multiplied by 28 days. The applicable days are the days in which the participant had non-missing seizure data (i.e., either 0 or &gt; 0 seizures recorded). Due to the study being prematurely terminated, there was not sufficient data to summarize or evaluate this endpoint.</description>

    <description>The effect of ezogabine/retigabine IR as an adjunctive treatment on health outcomes was to be evaluated on the basis of functional status and productivity.

             treatment but are currently taking one AED are eligible for enrolment.

          -  Investigator-confirmed partial seizure frequency rate of ≥3 partial seizures per 28
             days over the 8 weeks preceding the screening visit and must not have been

             to maintain an accurate and complete daily written Seizure Calendar and Functional
             Status Diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have generalized epilepsy (e.g. Lennox-Gastaut, Juvenile Myoclonic epilepsy, Absence,
             etc.) or non-epileptic seizures.

          -  Have had innumerable seizures within the 12-month period prior to the Screening Visit

          -  Have a history of pseudo seizures, non-epileptic events or any other type of
             psychogenic seizures that could be confused with seizures.

          -  Have been treated with felbamate or vigabatrin within the 6 months prior to Screening.
             If a subject has been previously treated with vigabatrin &gt;6 months prior to Screening,
             a visual perimetry test performed within 6 months prior to Screening must show normal
             visual fields or no worsening of recognized visual field abnormalities as compared
             with prior to vigabatrin treatment

          -  Benzodiazepines used in any manner other than acute usage as defined in this protocol

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study comparing ezogabine/retigabine immediate release (IR) with placebo, as adjunctive treatment in adults with partial-onset seizures. The study was prematurely discontinued after randomizing only 6 of the planned 208 participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted of a 2-week (or less) Screening Phase, an 8-week Baseline Phase, a 2-week Titration Phase, an 8-week Dose-Optimization Phase, an 8-week Maintenance Phase, and a 3-week Taper Phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percent Change in the 28-day Total Partial Seizure Frequency (POS) From Week 0 (End of Baseline Phase) Through Week 18 (End of Maintenance Phase)</title>
        <description>The efficacy of ezogabine/retigabine IR as an adjunctive treatment was to be evaluated by the percent change in the total partial seizure frequency, which was recorded by participants in the daily seizure calendar. The total 28-day POS rate is defined as the total number of POS reported during the evaluation period divided by the total number of applicable days during the evaluation period with this quotient multiplied by 28 days. The applicable days are the days in which the participant had non-missing seizure data (i.e., either 0 or &gt; 0 seizures recorded). Due to the study being prematurely terminated, there was not sufficient data to summarize or evaluate this endpoint.</description>
