  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid (TA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent. It prevents degradation of fibrin
      and delays the breakdown of hemostatic clots. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies
      and meta analyses to decrease blood loss in elective hip and knee arthroplasty. However,
      concerns about the prothrombotic side effects of systemic administration of TA has hindered
      the widespread adoption of this medication in orthopaedic patients due to their high risk for
      thrombotic complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism Topical
      application of tranexamic acid has been proposed as a way to mitigate the potential
      prothrombotic effects of TA. Topical application of TA has been demonstrated to be beneficial
      in oral and cardiac surgery. Plasma levels of TA have been found to be minimal following
      topical application, minimizing its potential systemic thromboembolic side effects. TA has
      been used topically in total knee arthroplasty, with significant reductions in blood loss and
      no increase in thromboembolic complications8,10. Data on the use of TA in hip fracture
      surgery is limited, and there are no studies examining topical use of TA in hip fracture
      surgery. Our study question is: Does topical tranexamic acid decrease blood loss following
      hemiarthroplasty of the hip for femoral neck fractures?
