      Study Design:

      Part 1.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, escalating single-dose design with
      Healthy volunteers Part 2.Open , sequential, two-period, single dose study with type 1
      diabetes Part 3.Open, sequential, two-period, single dose study with type 2 diabetes

      The principle objectives of this study are to assess safety and tolerability and to explore
      pharmacokinetic(PK) and pharmacodynamic(PD) parameters of a single dose of a novel very-long
      acting insulin formulation (HM12460A) in comparison to a single dose of human Neutral
      Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) in healthy volunteers (part 1), subjects with type 1 diabetes (part
      2) and in subjects with type 2 diabetes (part 3).

      The study will incorporate adaptive elements to provide both PK and PD data. The dose of
      HM12460A to be administered to the subjects with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes will be
      guided by PK data from part 1 of the study; the PD assessment of HM12460A in subjects with
      diabetes will also be informed by knowledge of PK gained from the healthy volunteer study.

             and biochemical investigations as judged by the Investigator.

             engaged in sexual relations of child-bearing potential, the subject must be using an
             acceptable contraceptive method during and for during a period of 60 days after the
             last dose of Study Drug.

          -  Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.
             (Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during
             normal management of the subject).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 3
             months.

             enzymes (AST or ALT &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal) or impaired renal function
             (elevated serum creatinine values above the upper limit of normal) will be excluded.

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the
             results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In
             particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (hemoglobin below
             the lower limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the trial.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal ECG at screening, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  History of alcohol abuse.
