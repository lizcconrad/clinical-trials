      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed combination of azithromycin 1.5% + 0.5%
      Loteprednol eye drops for the treatment of ocular inflammation and infection associated
      bacterial blepharitis and / or keratitis and / or conjunctivitis compared with the individual
      administration of azithromycin 1.5% and 0.5% Loteprednol (separately).

      Estimated to be admitted a total of approximately 60 patients showing blepharitis and / or
      keratitis and / or conjunctivitis: 30 patients will be assigned to the group of Azithromycin
      1.5%/Loteprednol 0.5% Eye Drops (fixed combination) + placebo and 30 patients will be
      assigned to the group of Azithromycin 1.5% + 0.5% Loteprednol (separately)
