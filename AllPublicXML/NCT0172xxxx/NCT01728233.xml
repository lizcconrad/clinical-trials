  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a very rare disease and prognosis depends primarily
      on regional lymph-node involvement. Despite the fact that cure can be obtained in patients
      with low metastatic load (pN1) by monotherapy, combination therapy is required for more
      advanced cases. Medical treatment options only for advanced or metastatic penile SCC are not
      very effective so far and the few chances for cure are solely dependent on multimodality
      treatment, either with surgery or radiation. Based on the observation that the epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) is almost invariably expressed in penile SCC and assuming
      similarities to the SCC of head and neck district, anti-EGFR targeted monotherapy has been
      investigated with promising early results at Istituto Tumori Milan and University of Texas MD
      Andreson Cancer Center. These premises lend support to the use of the pan-HER inhibitor
      dacomitinib for advanced or metastatic penile SCC.
