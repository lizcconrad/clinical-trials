  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Second only to pain, nausea and vomiting are the most uncomfortable complications of surgery
      and anesthesia. Unfortunately, our best defense against post-operative nausea and vomiting, a
      medicine called ondansetron (Zofran), is in dire national shortage. Consequently,
      non-pharmacological methods of prevention and treatment for post-operative nausea and
      vomiting have increased import. Following emergence from general anesthesia, children often
      request food and drink. There have been no studies to date that definitively determine the
      optimal first food or drink choice for these children. This study proposes to randomize
      children to either water or juice first intake following surgery. The investigators expect to
      find that children who consume glucose are less likely to vomit than those who first receive
      water.
