      This study may help identify how abnormalities in brain systems that control the ability to
      ignore irrelevant information may contribute to the development of depression in older
      adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of those who develop depression in late life never had depression before.
      The classic view is that changes taking place in our brains as we age contribute to the
      development of late-onset depression. This view is supported by the relative absence of
      family history for those with late onset depression. This research study will recruit 70
      older adults with late life depression and 70 older adults without depression. All
      participants will receive a sub-clinical, non-contrast (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
      at the beginning of the study and then again 12 weeks later at the completion of the study.
      The depressed older participants will also receive a Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)-approved antidepressant, escitalopram (Lexapro), as treatment for their depressive
      symptoms over 12 weeks. This MRI study may help the researchers identify how abnormalities in
      brain systems that control our ability to ignore distractions, control our emotions, and
      anticipate reward may contribute to the development of depression in older adults. The
      investigators hope that the findings promote the development of tests that may improve the
      detection of older adults at risk for poor treatment outcomes and eventually guide the
      development of novel treatments for depression.
