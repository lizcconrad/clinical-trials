  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the statistics released by the Department of Health,Executive Yuan in
      2005,depression, cancer and AIDS will become the three main diseases of the 21st century.The
      prevalence of depression is 5.8% for males and 9.5% for women in the worldwide total
      population each year.Depression ranks second next to cardiovascular disease and impacts on
      social and economic burdens.From the perspectives of prevalence,suicide rate,loss of
      workforce,family burden,co-morbidities and health care expenses,the issues related to caring
      for patients with depression should not be overlooked.Communication is often neglected while
      exploring the issues of caring for depressed patients,which can consequently affect their
      family,work performance,social interaction,and even leads to a risk of suicide.Therefore,in
      order to enhance their psychological adjustment and health management,it is particularly
      important to achieve effective communications.
