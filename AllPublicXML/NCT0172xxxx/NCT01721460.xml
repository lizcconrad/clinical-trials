  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether dexmedetomidine changes brain cell
      activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to find whether dexmedetomidine is optimal for sedation during Deep brain
      stimulation surgery, we will measure the electrical activity in the STN during Deep brain
      stimulation surgery, and measure how this activity is changed during administration of
      Dexmedetomidine. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine does not change the firing rate and
      pattern in the STN.

    <description>We calculated the root mean square (RMS) of the high frequency electrical activity. This is a common measure for the spiking rate of the population of neurons in the vicinity of the electrode tip. This Measure has been previously described as a useful measure to determine the target location during deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedures. We calculated the change in RMS inside the STN between baseline and peak sedation.
For each subject we normalized the RMS to the RMS of the electrical activity outside the nucleus. This is done to eliminate the effects of noise and variability in electrode resistance. Thus, the normalized RMS is a pure number with no units.</description>

    <description>The study is performed in patients undergoing DBS electrode implantation to their STN for the treatment of parkinson's disease. Microelectrode recording (MER) is performed as part of STN electrode implantation surgery, to increase the precision of the stimulating electrode placement. The study includes administration of dexmedetomidine while recording electrical activity at a single location to evaluate the effects of this drug on the MER.</description>
