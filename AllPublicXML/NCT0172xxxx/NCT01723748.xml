      The treatment with SA still leaves some questions unanswered. Firstly, SA treatment often
      results in a concomitant suppression of the insulin secretion, which might lead to clinically
      significant glucose intolerance. Secondly, the traditional evaluation of disease activity by
      measuring circulating levels of GH and total IGF-I is not reliable enough

      Hypotheses: Treatment of acromegaly with SA versus surgery alone is associated with:

        -  Glucose intolerance despite normalized insulin sensitivity

        -  Modified peripheral GH activity in peripheral target organs assessed on molecular
           endpoints

      Acromegaly is a rare disease usually caused by a benign growth hormone (GH) producing
      pituitary adenoma. In case of inadequate disease control, the condition is associated with
      significant morbidity and approximately a doubling of mortality compared to the background
      population. Medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SA) has been employed for about 20
      years and is a well-established treatment in cases where surgery is impossible or inadequate.
