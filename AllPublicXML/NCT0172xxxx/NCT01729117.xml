      Background and Rationale Research studies have shown that patients with type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) who lose weight have better glucose control and less risk for heart disease. It has
      been difficult to achieve these results in a non-research setting. Meal replacements (MR) are
      pre-packaged meals with appropriate calories and nutrients that enhance adherence to a weight
      loss program by reducing decision-making and facilitating target caloric intake. The
      University of Southern California (USC) arm of the NIH funded Look AHEAD study at Roybal
      Clinic has demonstrated acceptability and success of MRs in conjunction with a structured
      lifestyle modification program in achieving weight loss in underserved Hispanic T2DM
      patients.

      Objectives Our short-term objective is to determine the efficacy, safety and feasibility of a
      3-month full MR program in conjunction with a 1 year standardized lifestyle modification
      program in a clinic setting. Our longer-term goal is to acquire data for sample size and
      power estimates for a larger NIH- or other funded prospective, randomized trial.

      Study Methodology A 1-year, prospective trial study of 30 obese subjects with T2DM treated
      with insulin randomized to 2 groups: standard care (SC) or Meal Replacement group (MR). The
      SC will receive usual care at Roybal Diabetes Management Clinic (DMC). The MR will receive
      MRs and a lifestyle course in addition to the usual clinical care at the Roybal DMC. Phase 1
      consists of 3-months 1200 -1400cal diet using full MR. Phase 2 consists of a 3-month
      transition to the same caloric intake using regular meals and 1 MR/day . Phase 3 consists of
      a 6-month weight loss maintenance period with 1 MR/day. This will be about 1400-1600
      calories/day for women and 1800 to 2000 calories/day for men. Individual and group
      educational, support and counseling visits will be components of all 3 phases of the study.

      Outcomes Efficacy of the program will be determined by weight, waist measurement and waist to
      hip ratio, blood pressure, HbA1c, lipids, and medication use at baseline and at 3, 6, 9 and
      12 months. These are all measurements that are done routinely in these patients. Safety will
      be determined by monitoring of adverse events.

      Data Analysis We will compare the outcomes between the SC and MR at 0,3,6,9 and 12 months to
      determine if there is evidence that the intervention improves outcomes and is safe.
