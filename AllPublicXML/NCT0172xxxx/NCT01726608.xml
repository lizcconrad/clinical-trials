  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate if a technique called Simplicity III®
      Radiofrequency Neurotomy is effective in improving the management of sacroiliac joint pain.
      Currently there are a variety of treatments for managing this pain but there is still some
      doubt as to which treatments are the most effective. Simplicity III® is one such treatment
      for sacroiliac joint pain and has been used in the NHS for many years. It uses electrical
      current to generate heat around the tip of the needle placed close to the nerves that supply
      the sacro-iliac joint. This heat ablates the specific nerves supplying the joint and improves
      pain.

      The traditional method used to treat this type of pain uses multiple injections to target the
      nerves supplying the joint. This method is however both time consuming and the results are
      variable depending upon the number of injections. Therefore a new electrode, called the
      Simplicity III®, was developed to allow the treatment to be undertaken using fewer
      injections. Although this treatment has received formal approval, undergone conformity
      assessment and is available in certain specialist NHS centres for clinical use, there is
      presently limited evidence with regards to its clinical efficacy. We wish to test the
      effectiveness of this new device in treating sacroiliac joint pain. The best way to prove the
      clinical effectiveness is to compare Simplicity III® against an identical procedure where the
      electrode is not switched on and neither the patient nor the doctor is aware whether it was
      switched on. Once pain has been assessed at 3 months, those patients not receiving active
      treatment and remaining in pain will be offered the active treatment.
