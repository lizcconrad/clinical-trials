  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of blood and bone marrow cancers is poorly understood; however, most research
      focuses on how cancer cells grow and develop. Because the causes of these cancers are
      unknown, current treatments may be unnecessarily harsh and often do not provide a cure.
      Identifying the causes of blood cancers would allow for the development of treatments that
      are more likely to provide a cure. To find the causes of blood and bone marrow cancers, we
      will look for specific cancer cell abnormalities that are responsible for cancer cell growth.
      We will then look to see if drugs that can reverse these abnormalities can kill cancer cells.

    <measure>The frequency of mutations causing aberrant function of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in patients with acute leukemias (AL), lymphoproliferative disorders(LPD), myelodysplastic syndromes(MDS), and myeloproliferative disease(MPD)</measure>

    <description>Integrated functional genomics studies (whole genome sequencing, RNAi, proteomics, drug sensitivity, expression profiling) will be used to identify aberrant/potentially treatable signaling pathways that contribute to the formation of hematologic malignancies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the gene expression profiles of neoplastic cells in patients with AL, LPD, MDS, and MPD in comparison with normal phenotype-matched controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the T-cells (controls) and myeloid cells (leukemic), we will isolate CD34+ cells. RNA will be isolated with standard techniques, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix microarrays (Affymetrix Core, OHSU). In collaboration with Dr. Harrington (OHSU Affymetrix Core) we have successfully performed microarray analysis from a little as 10,000 CD34+ cells, using amplification of RNA with a commercially available protocol.</description>

        Patients of any age with a diagnosis or suspected diagnosis of a blood or bone marrow
        cancer may be a part of this study. The provider who will perform the blood draw, bone
        marrow aspirate, or biopsy as part of the patient's routine care will identify possible
        participants from their clinic schedule or patient list, give them information about what
        would be involved in participating in the study including possible risks, and ask if they
        are interested in participating.
