  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experience breathing difficulties
      because the airways deep in their lungs become narrowed. COPD patients use inhaler drugs to
      provide relief from breathlessness. However, current inhalers are inefficient as they deliver
      a 'coarse-mist' of drug-droplets that do not reach the deep airways.

      In our study, we will use an inhaler of 'fine-mist' drug-droplets, tagged with a radioactive
      tracer to track them. We will take images of the lungs to see if the fine-mist droplets reach
      the deep airways, and assess if this improves the breathing capacity in our patients. Our
      research may allow the development of new, more efficient inhalers to improve treatment for
      patients with COPD.

      PURPOSE:

      The purpose of the research (or &quot;knowledge gap&quot; this research is designed to fill) is to
      understand the fate of inhaled drug within the lungs of COPD patients. Current inhalers in
      use were developed to treat asthma, which is predominantly a disease of the large airways,
      and these inhalers may not be optimal in treating COPD patients (which is predominantly a
      disease of the small airways). Poor delivery of inhaled bronchodilators to the peripheral
      deep airways may be a major factor limiting the clinical benefit provided by existing
      devices. The key to successful treatment could be to accurately target inhaled drug to the
      diseased lung sites, which is the hypothesis that this protocol will test.

      DESIGN &amp; FUNDING:

      Dr Omar Usmani has developed the research protocol and the study has been funded by the UK
      Government Department of Health through the NIHR (National Institute for Health Research),
      which funds leading edge research in the NHS focussed on the needs of patients and the public
      and aims to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research. The study has been
      peer reviewed by International Experts in this field of research.

      PROTOCOL:

      This protocol has two studies: Lung DEPOSITION study (in COPD patients and Healthy subjects)
      and Lung PHYSIOLOGY study (in COPD patients and Asthmatics).

      Each study (Lung DEPOSITION and Lung PHYSIOLOGY) will be a randomised, double-blind,
      crossover, (7 treatments,controlled against pMDI salbutamol), study. Treatments will be given
      as one off dose administration.

      There will be an interval of at least 5 days between each study visit. The Lung DEPOSITION
      study will involve radiolabelled drug treatments.

      All the treatments in the LUNG PHYSIOLOGY study will be non-radiolabelled. Salbutamol will be
      the drug aerosol administered to each subject at each visit. Subjects and investigators will
      be blinded to the 'fine-mist' aerosol particle sizes given (at 6 treatments). The control arm
      will be salbutamol drug aerosol delivered as a 'coarse mist' standard metered dose inhaler
      (7th treatment visit).

      RECRUITMENT/SAMPLE SIZE; The study will recruit; Lung DEPOSITION study: 12 mild-moderate COPD
      patients, 12 healthy subjects Lung PHYSIOLOGY study: 26 mild-moderate COPD patients, 13
      mild-moderate asthmatic patients

      INCLUSION / EXCLUSION:

      At the screening vist, no one will be unfairly excluded from the research, particularly as
      COPD is a disease of older age and those over 65 should not be discriminated against. This
      research will therefore reflect the 'real world' of COPD.

    <description>Images of the lungs will be taken for radiolabelled salbutamol treatment. The images will be processed using computer software and the lungs divided into central airways (C - region) and peripheral airways (P -region). We will analyse the amount of radiolabelled salbutamol in each region and calculate how deep into the lungs the inhaled salbutamol has reached by using the ratio C/P which is known as the Penetration Index.</description>

    <description>We will undertake simple blowing physiology lung tests that tell us about the large airways and also the small airways. The small airway tests (Impulse oscillometry R5 and X5; S-acin and S-cond) will be analysed to determine if the inhaled salbutamol has a greater effect on these small airway tests or on the traditional large airway tests (FEV1).</description>
