      A Randomized, Blinded Comparison of Surgical Intervention with the Coflex® Interspinous
      Implant versus Surgical Decompression for Patients with Intermittent Neurogenic Claudication
      caused by Lumbar Stenosis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this investigation, it will be investigated whether the effectiveness of surgical
      intervention with Coflex® is equivalent to surgical decompression after 12 months in people
      with intermittent claudication. The main advantage of coflex® might be a faster recovery
      after surgery, but after long term follow-up it is unknown if this treatment effect remains.
      Therefore in addition, it will be investigated whether surgical intervention with coflex® is
      more effective than surgical decompression on short-term follow-up (8 weeks to 6 months) and
      whether surgical intervention with coflex® is more cost-effective after 12 months than
      surgical decompression.
