    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well dalantercept works in treating
      patients with ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer that
      has returned. Dalantercept may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Dalantercept may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma, treated with dalantercept.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      dalantercept as assessed by the Active Version of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth
      factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B),
      activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), cluster of differentiation 105 (CD105), and other
      markers via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and determine if there is correlation between
      expression and clinical response to treatment.

      II. To determine the correlation between ALK1 gene expression, other markers, and clinical
      response to treatment.

      III. To determine the correlation between concentration of VEGF, bone morphogenetic protein
      (BMP)9, BMP10, and ALK1 in pre-cycle 1 plasma using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA), and clinical response to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dalantercept subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <measure>Progression-free for at Least 6 Months Without Non-protocol Therapy From Study Entry</measure>
    <time_frame>Every other cycle for first 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who survive progression-free for at least 6 months without non-protocol therapy after study entry. Progression is assessed by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines progressive disease as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered progression.</description>

    <time_frame>Every other cycle for first 6 months; then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression confirmed; and at any other time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease, up to 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Complete and Partial Tumor Response by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Every cycle during treatment, then every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every six months for the next three years and then annually for the next 5 years.</time_frame>

    <description>Progression-free survival is the period of time from study entry to time of disease progression, death or date of last contact, whichever occurs first. Progression is assessed by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines progressive disease as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

        <description>Percentage of participants who survive progression-free for at least 6 months without non-protocol therapy after study entry. Progression is assessed by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines progressive disease as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered progression.</description>

        <description>Complete and Partial Tumor Response by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival is the period of time from study entry to time of disease progression, death or date of last contact, whichever occurs first. Progression is assessed by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines progressive disease as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered progression.</description>
        <time_frame>Every other cycle for first 6 months; then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression confirmed; and at any other time if clinically indicated based on symptoms or physical signs suggestive of progressive disease, up to 5 years.</time_frame>

*Patients weighing more than 100kg will start treatment at 120mg, and if dalantercept is tolerated for 2 cycles (i.e. toxicities are tolerable, less than grade 2 and resolved), the patient can be dose escalated to dosing based on actual body weight.</description>
