  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 12-week
      probiotic supplementation on the incidence and duration of infectious episodes in infants
      aged 6 to 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live bacteria that offer a health benefit to the host when administered via
      the diet in adequate amounts. Probiotic supplementation is safe for use in infants to the
      elderly and has demonstrated beneficial effects for a wide variety of health conditions such
      as acute diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, allergies, and inflammatory bowel disease.
      The immune-enhancing benefits of probiotics are attractive, particularly for infants, a group
      that is particularly prone to a variety of infections, e.g. respiratory tract infection,
      strep throat, and diarrhea. Probiotic supplementation has been utilized in previous studies
      of childhood infections with promising results.

      In this study, the safety and effectiveness of 12-week probiotic supplementation on the
      incidence and duration of infectious episodes in infants aged 6 to 12 months will be
      determined. The subjects will receive follow-on formula containing 1 million CFU/g
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (trademarked DR20), 1 million CFU/g Bifidobacterium animalis
      subsp. lactis HN019 (trademarked DR10), or placebo formula for at least three feeds per day
      for 12 weeks.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this clinical trial is the proportion of subjects with one or more of the following confirmed bacterial or viral infections at any time during the study: fever &gt; 37.5ºC (axillary), upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, strep throat, diarrhea, and otitis media.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative days with infectious symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative number of days with infectious symptoms will be defined as the total number of days during the study on which a subject has symptoms of a confirmed infection. Confirmed infections that count toward the primary endpoint include: fever &gt;37.5°C (axillary), upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, strep throat, diarrhea, and otitis media.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative number of infectious episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative number of infectious episodes will be defined as the total number of infectious episodes (defined as presence of one of more symptoms of a confirmed infection) experienced during the study. An infectious episode will be defined as a period when symptoms of a confirmed infection last for more than 24 hours and are followed by at least 3 days of no symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Infant Characteristics Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Infant Characteristic Questionnaire for infants approximately 6 months old (ICQ-6) measures parental perception of infant temperament, focusing on difficult temperament 8. The questionnaire is comprised of 24 items describing infant behavior. The parent or primary caregiver ranks each item on a 7-point scale, indicating the level of perceived difficulty in dealing with the described behavior. Four subscales have been identified through principal components analyses: Fussy/Difficult, Unadaptable, Dull, and Unpredictable.</description>
