    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a condition characterized by an increased pulmonary
      vascular resistance that can lead to right heart failure and death. Several diseases are
      known etiologies of PAH including scleroderma and cirrhosis. The presence of PAH in the
      context of systemic sclerosis or cirrhosis has a dramatic impact on prognosis and survival of
      the connective tissue or liver disease.

      Despite advances in the diagnosis of PAH, echocardiography remains a necessary test for
      screening PAH in patients with scleroderma or cirrhosis. However, echocardiography is less
      than ideal for diagnosing PAH and predicting treatment response. Thus, there is a pressing
      need to identify methodologies that can accurately and non-invasively recognize the presence
      of PAH in patients with scleroderma and cirrhosis.

      Hypothesis:

        1. To measure endothelial function and exhaled gases in patients with scleroderma and
           cirrhosis. To assess whether they correlate with the presence or the development of PAH.

        2. The degree of local (forearm) capillary vasodilation during treprostinil iontophoresis
           identifies patients who will develop PAH and in those already diagnosed PAH predicts
           response to PAH-specific therapies.

      Patients with scleroderma are known to have endothelial dysfunction and limited data
      suggested an association between the degree of endothelial function in scleroderma and the
      presence of PAH. However, these data is preliminary and has not been used to predict response
      to PAH-specific therapy or the development of PAH. We will test patients with cirrhosis
      because they tend to have PAH in the context of a hyperdynamic instead of a hypodynamic state
      as observed in scleroderma and PAH.

      Aims:

        1. To measure endothelial function and exhaled gases in patients with scleroderma or
           cirrhosis to assess whether they correlate with the presence or the development of PAH.

        2. To evaluate the degree of endothelial response to local treprostinil iontophoresis and
           determine if this test can predict the development of pulmonary hypertension or response
           to PAH-specific therapies.
