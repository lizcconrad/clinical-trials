      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose (RD) for further phase II
      studies, of the Galectin-1 inhibitor OTX008 given subcutaneously in patients with advanced
      solid tumors

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overexpression of galectin-1 protein is well documented in different types of cancers, with
      associated bad prognostic and enhanced metastases spreading.

      In-vitro/in-vivo preclinical studies showed that OTX008 inhibits galectin-1 expression. In
      different cancer models in animals, OTX008 reduced tumor growing and metastases spreading and
      it was observed a blood vessels architecture normalization.

      Thus, OTX008 appears to be an innovating approach to treat cancers and this clinical phase I
      study aims to evaluate OTX008 therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors.

             centers. Patients should receive the study treatment within 7 days after registration

          -  Histologically proven malignant solid tumor

             to study entry that could be continued) , radiation therapy, or surgery for at least
             30 days prior to first study treatment administration (45 days for bicalutamide).

          -  Recovery from the toxic effects of prior treatment to NCIC-CTC grade &lt; 1, except
