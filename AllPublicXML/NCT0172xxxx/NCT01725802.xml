      Design: single center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study.

      Study Drug: Subcutaneous (SC), ND0612 (LD/CD solution) or placebo (saline) to be administered
      via a continuously via the CRONO Five SC pump. A 1-week washout period will apply between the
      treatments.

      Population: Eight (8) PD subjects.
