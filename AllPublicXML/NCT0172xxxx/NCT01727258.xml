  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for people with sensitive teeth and involves going to the dentist for 4 visits
      over 6 weeks. At each visit the dentist will look at the mouth, teeth, tongue and gums of
      subjects, and check for sensitive teeth.

      During the first 2 weeks, participants will brush their teeth two times a day with the
      fluoride toothpaste provided.

      Then, if they qualify to continue in the study, participants will be assigned to a treatment
      group. All the groups will get toothpaste currently sold on the market, and one group will
      get a mouthwash with an experimental ingredient to use as well. Subjects will have an equal
      chance of being assigned to any one of the three groups.

      For the next 4 weeks, subjects will use their assigned products according to the directions
      provided. At Visit 1 subjects will be supervised while they brush their teeth to ensure they
      understand the directions. They will also have supervised use of the product at Visit 2.

      We will see if the mouthwash helps to reduce tooth sensitivity during the study.

      This study will consist of run-in and treatment phases. To qualify for the study, subjects
      must meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and return tactile sensitivity scores within
      protocol-specified parameters at both the screening and baseline visits.

      Run-in will consist of a 2-week period during which subjects will use a sodium fluoride
      dentifrice. At the start of the first phase, subjects will attend a Screening Visit. They
      will participate in the informed consent process, complete a medical/dental history, and be
      evaluated for tactile sensitivity to Yeaple probe and response to a cold air stimulus.

      Subjects who qualify through screening will begin a run-in period that will last
      approximately two weeks. The run-in period will be followed by a Baseline visit. Subjects who
      continue to qualify through Baseline will be randomized to one of three treatment groups.

      During the four-week treatment period, all subjects will brush their teeth twice daily for at
      least one minute in their usual manner, with their assigned toothpaste. After brushing,
      subjects assigned to the mouth rinse group will rinse with water, and then rinse with 10 mL
      of the experimental mouth rinse for 60 seconds.

      The study duration is approximately six weeks with each subject visiting the clinical site
      six times.

      Adverse events will be observed and collected by querying each subject at each visit for new
      or continuing symptoms.

    <measure>Mean Tactile Sensitivity Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Yeaple probe. The force at which discomfort was felt by the participant was recorded on a scale of 10-80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

    <measure>Mean Tactile Sensitivity VAS Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

    <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Cold Air Stimulus. When being assessed, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced when cold air was directed at the exposed root of each tooth by marking a single vertical line on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm.

        <title>Mean Tactile Sensitivity VAS Score at Week 2</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <title>Mean Tactile Sensitivity VAS Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). At each visit, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced from the Yeaple probe by marking a single vertical line on a VAS scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The investigator recorded a VAS score of 0 mm for participants who did not experience discomfort at the maximum force of 80 grams. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <population>Analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who used at least one dose of the study product and had baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment.</population>

        <title>Mean Cold Air Stimulus VAS Score at Week 4</title>
        <description>Tooth sensitivity was measured using a Cold Air Stimulus. When being assessed, participants rated their perception of the pain/discomfort experienced when cold air was directed at the exposed root of each tooth by marking a single vertical line on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scale from 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = No Pain/Discomfort and 100 = Intense Pain/Discomfort. The dental recorder measured the length of the line from 0 to the participant's line and recorded the VAS score in mm. The score for each participant was calculated by averaging the scores for all study teeth for that participant.</description>

        <population>Analysis was based on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set, defined as all randomized participants who used at least one dose of the study product and had baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment.</population>
