      The purpose of this study is to see if taking nevirapine (NVP) for HIV changes the way
      artemether/lumefantrine (AL) works in children who are co-infected with both HIV and malaria.
      The brand of AL used in this study is Coartem® Dispersible. This study will compare the blood
      levels of AL in co-infected children who already take NVP prescribed by their doctor with the
      co-infected children who do not take anti HIV medicines because they do not meet national
      guidelines to start them. The study will also assess the safety of using both medications (AL
      and NVP) in children.

    <textblock>
      Malaria and HIV are among the two most important global health problems of our time. Malaria
      accounts for up to 3 million deaths each year, of which 90% occur in Africa where malaria is
      the leading cause of mortality in young children. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
      are the mainstay of antimalarial therapy throughout much of the world, yet pediatric
      pharmacokinetic data on the most widely adopted ACT regimen, artemether/lumefantrine (AL) are
      lacking. Of equal importance is the assessment of key drug-drug interactions in HIV
      co-infected children as ARVs are known to affect the metabolic enzyme activity responsible
      for ACT elimination. This study proposes to investigate the drug-drug interaction between the
      antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine and nevirapine based antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for
      HIV in children co-infected in resource limited settings.
