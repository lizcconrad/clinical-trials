  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib is an established treatment in multiple myeloma; it is common practice in the UK
      to administer bortezomib with dexamethasone. This practice is based on data that supports
      improved response rates with this combination.

      Recent trial data indicates that the addition of vorinostat to bortezomib treatment overcomes
      treatment resistance to bortezomib. As such this current trial is designed to investigate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of combination treatment with vorinostat, bortezomib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and relapsed refractory myeloma.

      A comparison of this Phase II trial with the pivotal Phase III trial conducted by MSD (using
      the labelled bortezomib indication without dexamethasone) will address the impact of
      dexamethasone in regards to tolerability and additional efficacy in myeloma patients.
