    <textblock>
      Decision making capacity fatigues after repeated decisions similar to skeletal muscle. The
      result is decision fatigue, in which subsequent decisions are altered toward the status quo.
      Surrogates are at risk for decision fatigue yet it has not been studied. We propose a
      randomized study in the outpatient setting in surrogates and patients at high risk for
      needing to make complex decisions, in an effort to determine the impact of decision fatigue
      on surrogate self-control and subsequent choices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Just as skeletal muscle fatigues after repeated use, decision-making capacity fatigues when
      repeated choices are made. This phenomenon, in which people experience diminished
      concentration and willpower after repeated decision-making, is termed decision fatigue.
      People experiencing decision fatigue are more likely to bias subsequent choices toward the
      status quo. By choosing the status quo, the decision-maker reserves the option to make an
      alternate choice at a later time, thereby preserving possibilities. Patients and their
      surrogates often make complex medical decisions for which they may have little experience.
      Although clearly at high risk, decision fatigue has not been studied in this population. To
      elucidate these questions, we propose a four-arm study of surrogates and patients in a
      population at high risk for making complex decisions. Surrogates will be randomly assigned to
      varied levels of decision making effort to assess for the development of resultant decision
      fatigue and whether it alters subsequent decisions.

    <measure>Stroop Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of score will be done at the conclusion of instrument completion. The Stroop test is a standard measure of self control that requires three tasks. The last task is the most difficult where the participant must suppress the urge to read the word which is the easier task and instead say the color it is printed in. Standard scoring is the number correct in the Word trial minus the Color-Word trials. This data will be collected immediately following completion.</description>

    <measure>Evidence of status quo bias</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence of status quo bias as assessed by hypothetical decision to limit life sustaining therapy or to continue treatment. To assess for status quo bias, we will use the following technique: after the initial four hypothetical questions and Stroop testing, participants will be asked a hypothetical question about life sustaining therapy (LST). In the question, continuing life sustaining therapy will be counted as maintaining the status quo. This is based on current norms in American health care where life sustaining therapy is continued until a patient or surrogate specifically request otherwise.</description>

    <description>Surrogates will make decisions on 4 scenarios with physician advice, then complete the Stroop test and answer the hypothetical LST question. Within this arm, surrogates will receive two positive recommendations (i.e. to go ahead with the intervention) and two negative recommendations (i.e. to decline the intervention). These positive and negative recommendations will be randomly assigned upon study enrollment. With four hypothetical scenarios, there are six possible options for recommendation variations.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have one of the following diagnoses: aplastic anemia, multiple myeloma,
             myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, stage IIIB or IV lung cancer,
             mesothelioma and/or stage IIIB or IV gastrointestinal cancer (pancreatic, biliary,
             esophageal, gastric, hepatocellular, colon), stage IV melanoma.

          -  Patients must have at least one surrogate at their clinic visit who is willing to
             enroll with them as a pair to be included.

          -  Surrogates are eligible if an eligible patient identifies them as as a surrogate and
             both consent for the study.

          -  All participants must be over the age 18

          -  All participants must be fluent in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients and surrogates will be excluded if they are illiterate or have a medical
             condition known to alter Stroop performance. These include individuals who are
             visually impaired such that they cannot read a computer screen, blind or colorblind,
             patients given sedating medications during their appointment and individuals with past
             medical history of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack (TIA), seizure
             disorder, dementia or traumatic head injury with loss of consciousness.

          -  Patients will be ineligible if they have either tracheostomy or are currently on
             hemodialysis as these would significantly alter responses to the mechanical
             ventilation hypothetical scenario and the hypothetical life sustaining therapy
             question.

          -  Surrogates and patients are ineligible if their paired participant is excluded for any
             of the above reasons.
