      Adherence to treatment is crucial to the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy of allergic
      diseases. GRAZAX® is a registered drug in Europe, with established efficacy in the treatment
      of allergic rhinitis, which has to be taken daily by patients. This study was aimed to
      establish if a device with the characteristics of a mechanical dispenser (Memozax®) could
      improve adherence to treatment in subjects with hay fever due to allergy to grass
