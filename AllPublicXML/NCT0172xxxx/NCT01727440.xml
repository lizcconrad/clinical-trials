    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to enroll 250 participants that have joined the MURDOCK Study
      Horizon 1.5 (Duke IRB Pro00011196) with a current or prior diagnosis of severe acne AND
      current or prior treatment with oral isotretinoin. All 250 participants will answer a 5-page
      questionnaire designed to collect information on the diagnosis of severe acne and response to
      oral isotretinoin treatment. The aim is to identify genetic predictors of severe acne
      vulgaris and the outcome of oral isotretinoin treatment.

    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is an under-studied common genetic disease with tremendous economic
      consequences. Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin conditions treated by doctors. It
      affects 40-50 million people in the USA, with prevalence as high as 85% (recent study from
      Iran was 93%) in teenagers; 18% of woman have late onset (&gt;25yr) acne vulgaris. Severe acne
      has a life-long psychosocial impact due to the significant scarring. Severe acne can also be
      associated with severe systemic inflammatory disease with fever, sterile osteomyelitis,
      inflammatory arthritis and other signs of systemic inflammatory responses. Some of these
      syndromes in Mendelian form (e.g. PAPA syndrome) have known genetic defects. Finally, while
      the data are inconclusive, there have been many suggestions that diet can exacerbate acne in
      some patients. The standard of care treatment for severe acne is systemic retinoid therapy,
      which, is usually, but not always effective. Unfortunately, systemic retinoid treatment is
      associated with significant toxicity, including common cutaneous adverse effects (dry lips,
      eyes, skin fragility), less common laboratory abnormalities such as elevated blood lipids,
      liver function abnormalities, and severe predictable teratogenicity. In addition, systemic
      therapy with retinoids has been associated with systemic diseases such as clinical
      depression, suicide, and inflammatory bowel disease, however the mechanisms and significance
      of these associations has not been determined. Given the frequency and severity of severe
      acne, the predictable severe toxicity of systemic retinoid therapy, and the already
      demonstrated genetic associations found in Mendelian forms of severe acne, it seems likely
      that significant genetic risk factors may be identified in patients with severe acne which
      would promote new and safer therapy, including dietary adjustment.

    <description>All 250 patients with severe acne will be genotyped using the Illumina 610 BeadChip. Whole-exome sequencing will be performed on 100 extremely severe acne vulgaris patients, selected based on severity and response to oral isotretinoin treatment. A case-control GWAS analysis will be performed (250 recruited patients vs. 1000 normal controls of convenience available in other studies at CHGV). Additionally, an association analyses will be conducted using complete exome sequencing data for the most severe cases, compared with controls of convenience (as an extreme trait in the population, there is a reasonable expectation of discovery of any important variants, rare or common). This analysis would also include targeted analysis on available drug response data (efficacy and adverse response).</description>

        Participants must enroll or have enrolled in the MURDOCK Study Community Registry and
        Biorepository prior to joining this Severe Acne Study. At the MURDOCK Study visit, or after
        the participant has enrolled in the MURDOCK Study, they will be asked (either in person or
        via phone) if they would be willing to join the Severe Acne Study.

        Participants between ages 12 and 18 may also join the MURDOCK Study if they meet the
        eligibility criteria for this Severe Acne Study (a pediatric consent form will be used).
