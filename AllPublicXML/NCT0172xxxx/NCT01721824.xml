  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study, is to evaluate the effect of a supported employment
      intervention, IPS-modified for people with mood and anxiety (IPS-MA) on employment or
      education, when offered to people with onset mood or anxiety disorders who are not likely to
      be able to return to work within three month.

      The hypothesis is that the IPS-MA method is associated with a shorter recovery period and
      more people returning to work or education, compared to treatment as usual.

      Background: The IPS-MA method is a modified Individual Placement and Support (IPS)
      intervention, aiming at supporting people with mood or anxiety disorders regain their
      workability and return to work or education. Previous studies have showed, that IPS has an
      effect on employment when offered to people with severe mental illness. Further studies are
      crucial to demonstrate whether the modified IPS, the IPS-MA method, has an effect when
      offered to people with mood or anxiety disorders who are not yet chronified.

      Methods/design:The trial design is a randomized, assessor-blinded, clinical trial of the
      IPS-MA method in addition to treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone for 326
      participants diagnosed with a mood or anxiety disorder, living in the Capital Region of
      Denmark. The primary outcome is competitive employment or education. Secondary outcomes are
      days of competitive employment or education, disease symptoms, level of functioning, and
      quality of life at follow-up 12 and 24 months after baseline.

    <description>During the first 6 months participants are usually offered 3 meetings with their mentor per month, lasting approximately 1 1/2 hours each. The following 6 months they are offered 1 meeting per month, lasting approximately 1 hour. The estimated duration of the IPS-MA intervention is 12 months, but since the needs of the participants are very individual, this may vary.</description>
