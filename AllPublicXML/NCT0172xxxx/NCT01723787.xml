    <textblock>
      Infantile spasms (IIS), a characteristic epilepsy syndrome of infancy with often catastrophic
      developmental consequences, is known in some patients to have many different genetic,
      metabolic and structural etiologies. However, for most patients IIS is the only presenting
      clinical feature and the specific cause is unknown. Only two FDA approved pharmacologic
      treatments for IIS exist, Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and vigabatrin. While vigabatrin
      may be the treatment of choice for Tuberous Sclerosis as a cause for IS, ACTH is the
      treatment of choice for all others. Unfortunately, a substantial number of patients may still
      not respond to ACTH and there is no a priori way that suggests which patients may be
      responders. This has led to the following key questions:

      Can novel genetic analyses determine known genetic causes of IS with greater efficiency (more
      timely and cost-effective)? Can novel genetic analyses determine previously unknown disease
      modifying genes that predispose individuals to develop IS? Can novel genetic analyses
      elaborate genes and gene polymorphisms that favor ACTH responsiveness? Do these polymorphisms
      suggest strategies to improve ACTH responsiveness?

      Primary Aim 1: Apply whole-exome sequencing to determine possible causes of cryptogenic IS
      and evaluate adding whole-exome sequencing to standard practice for determining causes of IS.
      Sub-aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of whole-exome sequencing in suggesting
      disease-modifying genes that may contribute to triggering IS.

      Primary Aim 2: Determine genes, through whole-exome sequencing, that may play a role in
      determining ACTH responsiveness for IS. Sub-aim 2: Correlate genes or genetic factors
      (haplotypes) associated with ACTH responsiveness and disease modification.
