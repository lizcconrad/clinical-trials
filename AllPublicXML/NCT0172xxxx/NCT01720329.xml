      The goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of randomizing residents of long-term
      care facilities to either probiotics or placebo to assess whether probiotics can reduce
      influenza and other viral laboratory confirmed respiratory infection. The investigators will
      determine whether it is feasible to enroll residents and randomize them to a daily course of
      probiotics or placebo and monitor for influenza and other respiratory tract infections. In
      addition, the investigators will asses the feasibility of obtaining a nasal specimen for
      evaluation of the upper respiratory microbiome, measure antimicrobials, and deterioration in
      functional status. All aspects of the proposed trial will be assessed, including enrollment,
      randomization, respiratory infection surveillance, methods for outcome assessment, and event
      rates. The investigators will test the use of our data collection forms and data management
      strategy and will generate date to derive an appropriate sample size.

    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed twice weekly for symptoms for 6 months. This will begin after they have been randomized to probiotics or placebo arms of the study</time_frame>
    <description>this will be confirmed on the basis of reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR)</description>

    <measure>influenza like illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed twice weekly for 6 months after they have been randomized into probiotics or placebo</time_frame>
    <description>influenza-like illness will be defined by the presence of fever, sore throat, and cough and will measure symptom severity</description>

    <description>courses of antimicrobials (name, does and duration) will be recorded by research nurse using information on the medication container or by contacting the prescribing physician if necessary. We will measure antibiotic associated diarrhea which we define as â‰¥ 3 liquid stools/d for at least two day.</description>

    <measure>physician visits for respiratory illness</measure>
    <time_frame>The participant's MD patient record will be reviewed for visits during the 12 months following randomization</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>hospitalizations for lower respiratory infection or pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>Patient will be asked during the twice weekly assessments about any hospitalizations, as well as consulting their MD, during the 6 months following randomization</time_frame>
    <description>cause of hospitalizations will be assessed by the research nurse through interviews with the participants and reviews of hospital medical records. Deaths will be recorded using medical records</description>
