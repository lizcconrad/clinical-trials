  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of bone marrow (BM) as site for
      pancreatic islet transplantationin humans. Our hypothesis is that BM represents a better site
      than liver (currently the location of choice for this procedure) thanks to its potential
      capacity to favor islet engraftment. To address our hypothesis we propose herein a randomized
      phase II trial to compare BM and liver as sites for islet transplantation in T1D patients.

      The study is a phase II, single center, open label, pilot study. We will recruit 12 patients
      with T1D to be randomly (1:1) assigned to receive islet either into the liver through the
      portal venous circulation (standard procedure; arm A, n=6) or directly into the BM at the
      level of the iliac crest (arm B, n=6). Patients will be selected from those eligible for
      islet Tx based on local practice and guidelines.

    <description>Patients will received an intra BM islet infusion at the level of the iliac crest. The direct intra BM administration will be performed following the same procedures that our institution utilizes for administration of cord-blood cells in patients with acute leukemia (Lancet Oncol. 2008;9:831). The procedure is easy and reproducible: a standard needle for BM aspiration is inserted in the iliac crest and cells are gently infused.</description>
