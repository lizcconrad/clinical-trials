  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As obesity rates worldwide continue to increase, there is a focus on identifying active food
      ingredients which increase metabolic rate which can be used as a dietary supplement in the
      treatment of overweight and obesity. Promising animal and cell studies have suggested a role
      for black pepper and an active component of black pepper, piperine, in energy expenditure.
      However, the effects of black pepper have not been determined in humans. The investigators
      hypothesis if that consumption of 1.5g black pepper (0.5g in each of three meals over one
      day) will result in an elevation in 24-h resting energy expenditure when contrasted to a
      control day (no black pepper, same diet intake).

    <description>During the black pepper study day, subjects consumed 1.5g of black pepper (0.5g/meal) in 60.8g of vegetable juice. Black pepper was consumed was a meal on each occasion. 24-hour energy expenditure and substrate utilization will be measured.</description>

    <description>During the no pepper control study day, subjects consumed an identical menu without black pepper. 60.8g of vegetable juice (vehicle) was consumed at each of the three study meals. 24-hour energy expenditure and substrate utilization will be measured.</description>

    <description>Subjects spent two x 24-hour periods inside the metabolic chamber at the UNC NRI (black pepper and no pepper control) each separated by one week. Subjects were requested to arrive at the study center each morning in a fasted state (at least 10 hours). During each study day, subjects remained sedentary. All meals were provided and were tailored to each subject's specific energy requirements. Study meals (with the exception of the 1.5g of black pepper) were identical between the black pepper and no pepper control study days.</description>
