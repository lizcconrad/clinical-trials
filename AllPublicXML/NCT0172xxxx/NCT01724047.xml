  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to identify efficacious and cost effective intervention
      strategies that can improve academic and psychological outcomes for children with ASD, and
      can be feasibly be implemented at fidelity by school personnel in under served elementary
      schools. Two simultaneous interventions will occur.

      In intervention 1, students with ASD in inclusion classrooms will be randomized to the
      Playground Intervention or a waitlist control group. In the Playground Intervention,
      UCLA/ROC/UPENN staff will work with school personals (teachers, paraprofessionals) to
      increase peer engagement on the yard.

      In intervention 2, students in special day classes will be randomized to the 'Schedule Tools
      Activities Transitions' Intervention (STAT) or wait-list control. In the STAT Intervention,
      UCLA/ROC/UPENN staff will work with teachers to implement behavioral strategies in the
      classrooms.

      In both interventions, the conditions are: 1) Immediate treatment, where the training will
      begin immediately after baseline measures are completed. 2) Wait-list treatment, where the
      training will begin the follow school year.

    <description>Intervention is designed for children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) included in a regular education k through fifth grade classroom for at least 50% of the school day. Schools will be randomized to one of two conditions. The conditions are: 1) Immediate treatment, where the training will begin immediately after baseline measures are completed. 2) Waitlist treatment, where the training will begin the following school year. This study will take place at school. All intervention activities will be conducted during recess or lunch where children with autism may have the most difficulty interacting with peers. A total of 14-16 intervention sessions will be held with the child with autism, school personnel, and the child's classmates. The intervention will last approximately 3 months with a 3-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>This study will track the behavioral progress of children whose teachers receive training in these instructional methods. This study also will examine the ability and willingness of teachers to use these methods as they were designed. The study will last approximately 18 weeks (6 weeks of intervention, and a 3 month follow up visit). This study will take place at school. Classrooms will be randomized to one of two conditions. The conditions are: 1) Immediate treatment, where the training will begin immediately after baseline measures are completed. 2) Waitlist treatment, where the training will begin the following school year. All intervention activities will be conducted with a teacher during the school day but not during instructional time. Study staff will visit the school on a weekly basis to train your child's teacher on evidence-based strategies for teaching children with autism.</description>
