  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Widening of the single tibial tunnel following ACL surgery with quadrupled hamstrings
      autograft may contribute to failure of the graft and/or present technical challenges
      secondary to bone loss in a revision setting (Getelman, 1999). As such, efforts should be
      made to minimize the incidence and magnitude of tibial tunnel widening without sacrificing
      the biomechanical properties of the graft construct. The purpose of this investigation is to
      examine the tibial tunnel widening relationship between bioabsorbable interference screws
      composed of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) alone and composite bioabsorbable interference screws
      composed of poly-L-lactic acid embedded with beta tricalcium phosphate (PLLA+TCP) utilized as
      tibial fixation devices.

      Specifically the study has the following objectives: 1) To quantify the extent of tibial
      tunnel enlargement at 3-, 6- and 12-months post ACL reconstruction with autogenous quadrupled
      hamstring graft; 2) To determine if the incorporation of beta tricalcium phosphate to the
      bioabsorbable interference screw alters the observed magnitude of tunnel widening; 3) To
      hypothesize mechanisms for any observed differences between tibial fixation devices; and 4)
      To correlate tibial tunnel widening with clinical outcome status. It is hypothesized that the
      PLLA+TCP bioabsorbable interference screw will not be associated with a reduction in tibial
      tunnel widening around the implant but rather between the implant and articular surface,
      compared to the PLLA alone screw. It is also hypothesized that there will be no effect of
      observed tunnel widening on clinical outcomes or graft failure rates.

    <description>At 3-, 6- and 12-months post-operatively, subjects will undergo radiographic examination of their affected knee (standardized AP and lateral views) for analysis of tibial tunnel parameters. Radiographic analysis will be conducted by a single orthopaedic surgeon/fellow/resident blinded to subject group and clinical examination results. Parameters to be recorded and analyzed according to a standardized method: tibial tunnel diameter (max/min).
We will also look for: Evidence of lysis in the tunnel and changes in morphological features of tunnel over time</description>
