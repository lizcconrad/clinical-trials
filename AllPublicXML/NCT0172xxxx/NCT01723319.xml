      Objectives:The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of HBLPADD Coil
      deep brain TMS in subjects with ADHD.

      Patient Population: The intention is to treat 40 patients diagnosed with ADHD. The patients
      will be of all racial, ethnic and gender categories, ranging from 18 to 65 years of age.

      Structure: The study is a randomized, prospective, 5 weeks, double blind study. Blinding: The
      treatment administrator and the study personnel and patients will be masked to the treatment
      being administrated.

      The study group will receive active dTMS treatment and the control group will receive an
