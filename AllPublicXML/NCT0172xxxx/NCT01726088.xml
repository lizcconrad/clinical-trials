    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if modafinil is more effective than placebo in the
      treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in male combat veterans who have been
      deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in soldiers exposed to combat in
      Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). Unfortunately, currently available
      treatments for combat-related PTSD have produced modest treatment gains at best. New
      treatment strategies that can be directed toward objectively measured correlates of PTSD are
      urgently needed.

      Specific Aims: 1) To determine if there is evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of
      adjunctive modafinil in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. We hypothesize that OEF/OIF
      veterans with PTSD randomized to modafinil 100mg/day for four weeks will experience more
      improvement in PTSD symptoms than OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD randomized to placebo treatment
      for four weeks. 2) To determine if PTSD symptom severity is associated with
      electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and attention and if
      these measures change to a greater degree in participants randomized to modafinil versus
      those randomized to placebo. We hypothesize modafinil treatment will result in greater
      changes in electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and
      attention than placebo treatment.
