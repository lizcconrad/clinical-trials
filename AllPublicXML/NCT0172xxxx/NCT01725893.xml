  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Checkrein deformity represents a dynamic claw toe deformity. Surgical intervention is the
      treatment of choice and many methods have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the outcomes and complications of percutaneous segmental tenotomy of the toe flexor
      tendons.

      The investigators reviewed fourteen patients with checkrein deformity who underwent surgery
      in our hospital between 1993 and 2010. Five patients received FHL and flexor digitorum longus
      (FDL) tenolysis at the musculotendinous junction; among them, two also underwent Z-plasty
      lengthening of the FHL tendon. Nine patients underwent percutaneous segmental toe flexor
      tenotomy. The Hallux Metatarsophalangeal- Interphalangeal Scale (Hallux MTP-IP scale) and
      Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS), English version LK1.0 self-explanatory questionnaire
      were used to evaluate the functional outcomes.
