  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of daptomycin versus standard
      of care (SOC) in pediatric participants aged 1-17 years with bacteremia caused by
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      S. aureus causes a series of invasive diseases in adults and children, including bacteremia.
      Infections due to S. aureus in children, particularly those due to methicillin resistant S.
      aureus (MRSA), are a growing world-wide public health concern.

      Daptomycin, a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial agent, shows rapid in vitro bactericidal
      activity with concentration-dependent killing for Gram-positive organisms, including S.
      aureus. Surveillance studies have demonstrated a daptomycin MIC90 of 0.5µg/ml for both
      methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA with &gt;99% of MRSA isolates being
      categorized as susceptible by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Committee of
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST) and Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute
      (CLSI) breakpoints (5). Clinical trials in adults demonstrated that daptomycin was safe and
      efficacious in complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and bloodstream
      infections caused by S. aureus, including right-sided infective endocarditis (RIE). However,
      information on the safety and efficacy of daptomycin for use in children is lacking.

      The intent of this study in children is to confirm the safety of daptomycin at mean steady
      state systemic exposures (AUC) similar to those reported for adults treated at 6 mg/kg for
      bacteremia.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administration of first dose through the last follow-up visit (up to 77 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life threatening experience, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is considered to be an important medical event.</description>

    <description>Blood was drawn from baseline up to the end of therapy visit to determine the percentage of participants with maximum post-baseline CPK elevations above the upper limit of 500 Units Per Liter (U/L) .</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Sustained CPK Elevations</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to end of therapy visit (up to 44 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was drawn from baseline up to the end of therapy visit to determine the percentage of participants with sustained CPK elevations, defined as two consecutive post-baseline values above the upper limit of normal (ULN)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Focused (Peripheral) Neurological Assessments at Test of Cure (TOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>TOC Safety Visit (up to 56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Focused neurological examinations were done at the TOC/Safety Visit. These examinations include assessments of sensation, pupillary reflex and tracking, peripheral reflexes (biceps, patellar tendon, ankle jerk and plantar response), muscle tone and strength (upper and lower limbs), coordination (finger to nose) and tremor of the hands/fingers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Success at TOC/Safety Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days after the last dose of study medication (up to 56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success was determined by assessing resolution/improvement of signs and symptoms. An assessment of cure or improved is considered clinical success. Cure: resolution of clinically significant signs and symptoms associated with admission infection; no further antibiotic therapy is required for the primary infection under study. Improvement: partial resolution of clinical signs/symptoms of infection such that no further antibiotic therapy is required for the primary infection under study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Overall Success at TOC Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>7-14 days after the last dose of study medication (up to 56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall success is based on microbiologic responses after initiating study drug and clinical response at TOC/Safety Visit. Overall outcome is a success if both clinical and microbiologic outcomes are successes. An assessment of cure or improved is considered clinical success. Microbiological Success: a participant for whom all baseline infecting pathogens were eradicated (presumed or documented) within 7 days from the start of study drug for uncomplicated bacteremia with no source of infection present, and 10 days for complicated bacteremia or when the source of infection has not been removed.</description>

Overall outcome is a success if both clinical and microbiologic outcomes are successes. An assessment of cure or improved is considered clinical success. Microbiological Success: a participant for whom all baseline infecting pathogens were eradicated (presumed or documented) within 7 days from the start of study drug for uncomplicated bacteremia with no source of infection present, and 10 days for complicated bacteremia or when the source of infection has not been removed.</description>
