    <textblock>
      IMMU-114 will be studied at different dose schedules and dose levels in order to assess the
      highest dose safely tolerated. IMMU-114 will be administered subcutaneously (under the skin).
      IMMU-114 will be given 1-2 times weekly for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest. This is
      considered one cycle. Treatment cycles will be repeated until toxicity or worsening of
      disease.
