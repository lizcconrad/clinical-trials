      This pilot clinical trial studies cognitive behavioral therapy in treating anxiety in
      patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and their caregivers. Cognitive behavioral
      therapy may reduce anxiety and improve the well-being and quality of life of patients who
      have stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and their caregivers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify, through both quantitative and qualitative methods, clinical correlates of
      anxiety and points of intervention to reduce anxiety in patients with late-stage lung cancer
      and their primary caregivers.

      II. To apply these findings to develop a brief dyadic intervention based on Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to reduce anxiety in late-stage lung cancer patients and their
      primary caregivers.

      III. To evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention through number
      of completed visits and assessment pre- and post- intervention.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo cognitive behavioral therapy over 1 hour once weekly for a total of 6
      sessions. Sessions are tailored to patient and caregiver cognitions and approach and
      avoidance behaviors.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 1 week.
