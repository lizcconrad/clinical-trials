  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In laparoscopy, over %50 of the all complications occur during establishment of the
      pneumoperitoneum. Lifting of the anterior abdominal wall is aimed to increase the distance
      between the abdominal wall and the intrabdominal structures. Elevation of the anterior
      abdominal wall is recommended for the access to peritoneal cavity in literatures however the
      benefit exactly has not proved. This study aimed to determine the distance from anterior
      abdominal wall to intraperitoneal structures during lifting of the abdominal wall, to
      represent this distance -on the average- generate the safe range whether or not and compare
      with this distance and patient's age, BMI and parity.

    <textblock>
      40 patients who undergoing laparoscopic surgery for various indications are enrolled in the
      study. The telescope is inserted at second trocar place and the distances between anterior
      abdominal wall and visceral organs are measured with plastic hysterometry during maximal
      elevation of the abdominal wall.
