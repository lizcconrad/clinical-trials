  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter randomised controlled trial is to investigate if circadian
      light at the patients bedside (using Philips HealWell system, CE marked)significantly reduces
      prevalence of delirium in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients, who are randomly assigned to the &quot;Lightening arm&quot; will have the circadian light for
      the whole ICU stay. Light levels at the patients bedside will be measured continuously:
      embedded light sensors provide irradiance and luminous lux recordings in red, green, and blue
      color bands and a white light measurement in lux

    <description>Artificial ceiling lighting throughout the day will be provided by the Philips HealWell system, CE marked, which is able to deliver varying light levels and warmer or cooler light according to the time of the day (circadian light). Emergency or examination lighting can be set on demand as circumstances require.
Lighting conditions at the patients bedside will be characterized by transformations on the time-series of light levels as measured by a luxmeter. The following metrics will be used for lighting characterization in a period of 24h: mean levels of bright and dark periods, contrast between bright and dark periods, clustering of bright and dark periods, and circadian variation.</description>
