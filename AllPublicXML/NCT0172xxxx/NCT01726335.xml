  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerance of long-acting
      risperidone when switching from oral antipsychotics in participants with schizophrenia
      (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often
      with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center) and non-comparative study of long-acting risperidone in
      participants with schizophrenia who have a previous history (in the last 12 months) of bad
      adherence to the oral antipsychotic treatment of first or second generation. The duration of
      this study will be 24 weeks and will include following visits: Screening, Baseline, Week 2,
      4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 38 and 50 (End visit or early withdrawal). All the eligible
      participants (after risperidone intolerance test during screening) will receive a dose of 25
      milligram risperidone every two weeks by intramuscular injection (injection of a substance
      into a muscle). Efficacy and safety of the participants will primarily be evaluated by
      Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale, respectively.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>The CGI rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 indicates to &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 indicates &quot;among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant).</description>

    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 50</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each item is scored on a 0-100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

    <measure>Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, and Week 8, 16, 24, 38 and 50</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of a participant's dysfunction (ranging from i [absent] to vi [very severe) within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behavior. The overall score ranges from 1 to 100. Based on the 4-domains there was one total score. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 had a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; participants with scores of 30 or less function so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

    <measure>Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, and Week 8, 16, 24, 38 and 50</time_frame>
    <description>The GAF scale is a 100-point tool rating overall psychological, social and occupational functioning of adults. The higher score range (91-100) refers to a superior functioning in a wide range of activities, and absence of symptoms. The lower score range (1-10) refers to persistent danger of severely hurting self or others; or persistent inability to maintain minimum personal hygiene; or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death.</description>

        <title>Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI-10)</title>
        <description>The DAI-10 is a 10-item questionnaire to assess 1) subjective experience of drug and 2) attitudes and beliefs toward neuroleptics which may influence compliance in schizophrenia participants. It is the binary scale assessing the participant's subjective response. A 'compliant' response is scored as +1; a dysphoric response is scored as -1. A positive sum of items indicates a positive subjective response (SR); a negative sum of scores indicates a negative SR (non-compliant). The final score is the grand total of the positive and negative points. Total score ranges from (-) 10 to (+) 10, higher score indicates positive SR (compliant) and lower score indicates negative SR (non-compliant).</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The eight sections are: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Each item is scored on a 0-100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>

Participants with a score of 71 to 100 had a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; participants with scores of 30 or less function so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>
