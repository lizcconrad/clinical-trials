  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-ME is a research intervention study designed to address the needs of African American men
      who have sex with men (AAMSM) who are at high risk for HIV. The intent of the intervention is
      to decrease HIV risk behaviors among African American MSM using an intervention developed by
      and for African American MSM.

      The hypothesis guiding this study is: that participants who complete B-ME intervention will
      report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison
      group.

      The Specific Aims of this study are 1) to further explicate and develop the intervention, 2)
      to evaluate its efficacy in reducing HIV risk behaviors and 3) to expand the limited body of
      research on HIV prevention/risk reduction practices for African American men who have sex
      with men(AAMSM). The study will use a randomized-controlled trial design to compare receiving
      B-ME intervention to receiving basic men's health and wellness messaging (standard of care),
      hypothesizing: hypothesizing: that participants who complete B-ME intervention will report
      greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison group. The
      study will utilize a pre-test/post-test design with participants randomized to intervention
      and comparison groups; have a strategy to retain at least 80% of participants through study
      completion; collect data at baseline, at 3 months post-intervention, and at 6 months
      post-intervention; and rigorously measure outcomes that directly impact HIV risk. Data will
      be collected at each assessment point to assess B-ME's ability to improve behavioral outcomes
      that directly impact Black MSM HIV risk: (1) number of unprotected anal and vaginal sex
      events; (2) number of unprotected sex events with persons of unknown HIV status; (3)
      frequency of HIV testing, and (4) increased communication between partners about sex and
      strategies for reducing the risk of HIV infection.

             transgendered identified persons will be included).

             d) Report being sexually active in the past 30 days (ie., one or more instances of

             unprotected anal or oral sex with a male identified partner in the past year f) Have
             not previously participated in the CTCA intervention. g) Have not received an
             evidence-based HIV prevention intervention in the past 180 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men are ineligible to participate in the trial if they:

               1. Identify as a transgender woman; OR
