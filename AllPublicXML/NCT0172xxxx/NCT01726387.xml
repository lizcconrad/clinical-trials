  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety, Depression and Somatoform disorders are highly prevalent in primary care. Very often
      these conditions remain undiscovered and/or untreated.

      In order to ease this urgent health care problem in the future, the investigators conduct a
      cluster-randomized controlled trial, implementing a tandem working cooperation between a
      nurse practitioner (Counseling Assistant - CA) and a general practitioner (GP) on-site its
      own practise.

      The CA's task is to enhance the patients abilities to engage in a better self-management of
      their psychological symptoms and complaints, to enhance self-efficacy and empower the
      patients to tackle problems of daily living.

      Anxiety, Depression and Somatoform disorders are highly prevalent in primary care. Very often
      these conditions remain undiscovered and/or untreated. Managing it is time-consuming and
      communication-intensive. Furthermore, the management is restraint by the high
      contact-frequencies in primary care practices in Germany.

    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 Weeks, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>GSE assesses a general sense of perceived self-efficacy. It predicts coping with daily hassles as well as adaptation after experiencing all kinds of stressful life events.
http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/%7Ehealth/engscal.htm &quot;The construct of Perceived Self-Efficacy reflects an optimistic self-belief (Schwarzer, 1992). This is the belief that one can perform a novel or difficult tasks, or cope with adversity -- in various domains of human functioning. Perceived self-efficacy facilitates goal-setting, effort investment, persistence in face of barriers and recovery from setbacks. It can be regarded as a positive resistance resource factor. Ten items are designed to tap this construct. Each item refers to successful coping and implies an internal-stable attribution of success. Perceived self-efficacy is an operative construct, i.e., it is related to subsequent behavior and, therefore, is relevant for clinical practice and behavior change.&quot;</description>
