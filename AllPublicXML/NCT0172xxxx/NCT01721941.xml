  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase I dose escalation study is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of TH-302 when administered with doxorubicin via trans-arterial
      chemo-embolization (TACE) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not
      transplant candidates and have unresectable disease. HCC is the second leading cause of
      worldwide cancer death and is generally incurable without liver transplant. TACE can convert
      about 40% of these patients to transplant candidates. Additionally, in non-transplant HCC
      patients, TACE confers statistical improvements in overall survival. Selective HCC arterial
      catheterization during TACE allows for the delivery of concentrated drugs to the liver tumor
      but the optimal TACE chemotherapy regimen has not yet been determined. TH-302 is a hypoxia
      inducible agent that can be activated in the hypoxic environment induced by TACE.

    <textblock>
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the major modality utilized for tumor downstaging
      for transplant and for local therapy in non-transplant patients. This procedure allows
      delivery of concentrated drugs to the tumor, followed by embolization that eliminates its
      blood supply creating an environment of hypoxia. The process induces tumor ischemia, while
      achieving a drug concentration in the tumor 10 to 25 times greater than can be achieved by
      infusion.

      A hypoxic microenvironment is a characteristic of many solid tumors including hepatocellular
      cancer, further induced by TACE. The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to
      selectively physiologically target the hypoxic microenvironment. While doxorubicin and
      cisplatin have been used as the drugs in TACE among other agents, none have stood out as the
      optimal agent in targeting HCC. Because of the action of TH-302 in hypoxia, this agent has a
      mechanistic advantage as a agent in TACE.

      The current study is designed to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of adding TH-302 to
      the standard doxorubicin based TACE regimen in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinomas.
