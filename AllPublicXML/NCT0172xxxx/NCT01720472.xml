      The purpose of this study is to use the MURDOCK Horizon 1.5 infrastructure (Duke Instutional
      Review Board Pro00011196) to specifically target and enroll 1,000 participants across age
      groups and other demographic categories in order to develop a diverse cohort with specific
      physical and cognitive performance data paired with biological samples.

      The MURDOCK Study, proposes this Horizon 2 study to collect a brief physical and cognitive
      performance assessment from 1,000 MURDOCK Registry participants. Blood sample aliquots will
      also be obtained. These physical and cognitive performance data, paired with -omics data from
      plasma and serum sample analyses, offer promise in the discovery of biomarkers for functional
      decline. This research will provide an important basis for our understanding of the physical,
      lifestyle, and genetic factors which, over the lifespan, contribute to changes in physical
      and cognitive capabilities as we age.
