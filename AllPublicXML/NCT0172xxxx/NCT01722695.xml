    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to show equivalent performance of the Revaclear dialyzer when
      compared to a dialyzer with larger membrane surface area.

      Study design: open, randomized, cross-over, multicentric, controlled prospective

      Medical devices: Revaclear 200 versus FX 60 or Revaclear 400 versus FX 100, depending on
      patient needs

      Patients/sample size: 30 adult chronic hemodialysis patients

      Treatment: Each patient will be treated by hemodialysis for one week (3 dialysis sessions)
      with Revaclear dialyzers and one week (3 dialysis sessions) with FX dialyzers.

      Objectives: intraindividual comparison of dialysis dose; reduction rates and total removal of
      urea, phosphate, creatinine and ß2-microglobulin; albumin loss

      Primary variable: dialysis dose Kt/V urea

      Secondary variable: reduction rates and total removal of urea, phosphate, creatinine and
      ß2-microglobulin

      Safety variable: albumin loss, blood count
