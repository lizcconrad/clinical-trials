  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HSV1716, an oncolytic virus, is a mutant herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I, deleted in the
      RL1 gene which encodes the protein ICP34.5.

      Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive, asbestos-related tumour of the pleural and
      peritoneal cavities. It is a rare cancer which occurs in individuals who have been exposed to
      asbestos, although it typically occurs decades after exposure (10-40 years later). Malignant
      pleural mesothelioma forms plaques that are distributed on the surface of the pleural space
      in the lung. Approximately 30% of patients require an indwelling pleural catheter for
      drainage of pleural effusions. In this patient group, the indwelling catheter may be used to
      facilitate loco-regional delivery of HSV1716 to the pleural space.

      This study seeks to evaluate the safety and biological effects of single and multiple
      administrations of HSV1716 in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      The study will be conducted in two parts. PART A is a single centre, single dose design, open
      label. Patients with inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma will receive a single dose of
      HSV1716 by intrapleural administration. Delivery will be by direct administration via an
      indwelling catheter into the pleural cavity. PART B is a single centre, repeat dose design,
      open label. Two groups of three patients with inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma will
      receive 2 (group 1) or 4 (group 2) single doses of HSV1716 at weekly intervals.
      Administration will be via an indwelling catheter into the pleural cavity.

          -  Patients with pleural effusions and/or 'trapped lung' who (i) have an existing
             indwelling pleural catheter for draining of excess pleural fluid or (ii) who require
             the insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter to drain excess pleural fluid

          -  Patients with a performance status ≤ 2 (ECOG)
