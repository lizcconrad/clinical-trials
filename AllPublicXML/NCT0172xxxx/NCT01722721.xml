  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      physicians in the Emergency Department spend their time on interviewing and examining
      patients, file documentation, communication with colleagues about the patients.

      Introduction of IT technology aims to reduce the administrative workload. However it is the
      impression that more and more time are used behind the PC rather than at the side of the
      patient.

      The aim of this study is to describe how the time is distributed between different task for
      an ED physician, and to analyse whether there are differences in time distribution if the
      physician is working in the outpatient area versus admission area of the ED.
