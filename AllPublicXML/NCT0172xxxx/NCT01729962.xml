  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this comparative clinical study is to collect clinical data to
      demonstrate the equivalence of the investigational device to the predicate device for
      measurements of the eye. The secondary purpose is to evaluate any adverse events that occur
      during the clinical study.

      This is a prospective clinical study to be conducted at a single clinical site located in the
      United States. This study will assess the agreement of an investigational device to the
      predicate device and an ultrasound reference device and the precision of the investigational
      device with a comparison to the precision of the predicate. Any adverse events associated
      with the investigational device can or the predicate device will be assessed.

    <description>The agreement of the Nidek optical biometer with the predicate device will be assessed for the following measures:
Axial Length;
Keratometry;
Corneal Cylinder Axis;
Anterior Chamber Depth;
Central Corneal Thickness;
White-to-White Distance; and
Pupil Diameter.
In addition, the agreement of the Nidek optical biometer with the ultrasound reference device will be assessed for axial length and anterior chamber depth.
The precision of Nidek optical biometer and the predicate device will be assessed for the following measures:
Axial Length;
Keratometry;
Corneal Cylinder Axis;
Anterior Chamber Depth;
Central Corneal Thickness;
White-to-White Distance; and
Pupil Diameter.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Precision Cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>All subjects in the precision portion of the study will each be paired with one Nidek optical biometer and with one predicate device for a total of three Nidek optical biometer/predicate device pairs. Each of the three device pairs will be designated one and only one operator. All subjects in the precision portion of the study will have their measurements repeated three times on each of three Nidek optical biometer and predicate device pairs.</description>

             clinical staff at the clinical site, and can visit on scheduled examination dates.

          2. Subjects who sign an informed consent form to participate in the clinical trial.

          3. Subjects who agree to take the qualifying eye examination and a series of devices
             measurements.

          4. Subjects able to fixate on a target.

          5. Subjects must meet at lease one of the following criteria:

               -  Normal eyes: Subjects with a natural lens without a cataract, corneal
