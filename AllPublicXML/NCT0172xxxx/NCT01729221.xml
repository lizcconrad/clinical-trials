      Prospective study to calculated the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C
      virus infected patients after stem cell therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our prospective research is carried out in one of the stem cell therapy centers in Egypt
      where 140 hepatitis C virus infected patients attending for stem cell therapy are enrolled in
      our study and the patients will be followed up after stem cell therapy where the incidence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma after stem cell therapy will be calculated , another group of
      hepatitis C virus infected patients attending to Kasr El Aini university hospital to receive
      the standered line of care as indicated will be enrolled in our study and will be followed up
      , where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma will be calculated and compared to the
      previous group , to determine if there is a significant difference between both groups
      regarding the incidence of hepatocellular and determine whether stem cell therapy affecets
      the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus infected patients.
