    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study was to analysed the security of a supervised exercise program on
      maternal cardiovascular system and assess the positive effects of this program on maternal
      cardiovascular function and structure

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, the effectiveness of cardiovascular system is necessary to the growth and
      development of the baby, however many changes in it occur during this period.

      Physical exercise has shown to have a positive effect on cardiovascular structure and
      function in the general population.

    <description>Supervised physical conditioning program of three 55—60 minute sessions per week during whole pregnancy (from week 9 to 38). Each session consists of 25-30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise,10 minutes of specific exercises (strength and balance exercises), and 10 minutes of pelvic floor muscles training
Aerobic activity was prescribed at light to moderate intensity, aiming for 55-60 of maximal heart rate. All subjects wore a heart rate (HR) monitor (Polar FT7) during the training sessions to ensure that exercise intensity was light to moderate.</description>
