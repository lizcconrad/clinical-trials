        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with advanced, histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumors,
             refractory to any standard therapy, have no standard therapy available, or subjects
             must have actively refused any treatment which would be regarded standard, and / or if
             in the judgment of the investigator, experimental treatment is clinically and
             ethically acceptable

               -  Expansion phase only: Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed,
                  locally advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer or breast cancer or iNHL, who

             to participate provided that no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in these
             parameters exists.] For subjects on warfarin, close monitoring of at least weekly
             evaluations will be performed until INR is stable based on a measurement at pre-dose,
             as defined by the local standard of care

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiac disease: congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) Class II, unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), new-onset angina (within
             the past 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug), myocardial infarction within
             the past 6 months prior to the first dose of study drug, or cardiac arrhythmias
             requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic
             pressure &gt; 90 mmHg, despite optimal medical management

          -  History of diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus

          -  Fasting blood glucose level &gt;125 mg/dL or HbA1c 7% at screening

          -  Active clinically serious infections &gt; Grade 2

          -  History of organ allograft

          -  Seizure disorder requiring therapy (such as steroids or anti-epileptics)
