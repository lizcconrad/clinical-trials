  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We designed a study to determine whether a single dose of dexmedetomidine or thoracic
      epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia would provide hemodynamic stability,
      reduce stress hormone responses, inhibit inflammatory cytokine secretion, and improve sleep
      quality in patients after thoracic surgery.

      We designed a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, and controlled study to determine
      whether a single dose of dexmedetomidine or thoracic epidural anesthesia combined with
      general anesthesia would provide hemodynamic stability, reduce stress hormone responses,
      inhibit inflammatory cytokine secretion, and improve sleep quality in patients after thoracic
      surgery.
