      This multicenter, observational study will evaluate the correlation between clinical and
      biological factors and International Prognostic Index (IPI) as prognostic factors in patients
      with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving first-line treatment with MabThera/Rituxan
      (rituximab) in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. Eligible patients receiving treatment
      according to standard of care and local guidelines will be followed for the duration of
      treatment (approximately 8 months) and during 1 year of follow-up.
