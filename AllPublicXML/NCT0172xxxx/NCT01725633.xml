  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to examine the safety and feasibility of a supervised progressive
      exercise program in women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Previous research among
      women with metastatic breast cancer has shown that some of the treatments commonly used in
      this population may have an adverse impact on physical fitness levels leading to feelings of
      fatigue and poor quality of life. Supervised exercise training has been shown to reduce some
      of these side-effects in women with early-stage breast cancer receiving common cancer
      treatments. However, it is not known if supervised exercise training is a safe and feasible
      intervention in women with metastatic breast cancer. This study is designed to find out if
      supervised exercise training is safe as the patients undergo treatments for metastatic breast
      cancer.

    <description>Safety will be evaluated by the type and prevalence of adverse events during study-related assessments as well as aerobic training and progressive stretching sessions. The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE) will be used to grade toxicities during the trial.</description>

    <measure>feasibility of aerobic training</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>feasibility will be evaluated by examining several different end points including rates of study eligibility and accrual, etc; however, sample size calculations are based on an integration of aerobic training attendance rate (in the aerobic training group) as well as global trial attrition rates. Together, these end points will be used to determine overall study feasibility.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the progressive stretching group will be provided with a progressive stretching program that matches the aerobic training interventions in terms of program length (16 weeks), social interaction (all sessions will be supervised), and session duration (20-45 minutes/session, ± 10 minutes).</description>

    <intervention_name>Nonlinear Aerobic Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants assigned to the nonlinear aerobic training arm will perform no more than 150 minutes per week of structured supervised aerobic training as part of clinical trial participation. Exercise performed outside the structured sessions (i.e., contamination) will be assessed via self-report of exercise behavior using the Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). For ethical reasons, we will not instruct participants not to exercise outside the structured sessions, but we we will encourage participants to maintain their level of exercise behavior prior to study initiation.</description>
