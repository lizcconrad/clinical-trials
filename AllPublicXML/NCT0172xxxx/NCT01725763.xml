  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a life-threatening cardiovascular disease characterized by
      pathological elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) &gt;/= 25 mmHg at rest. mPAP &lt;
      20 mmHg is defined as normal, values in the range between 21-24 mmHg are described as
      &quot;borderline PH&quot; diagnosed by right heart catheterization. Based on the etiology, PH is
      assigned to 5 groups (WHO, Data Point, 2008), whereas classification of disease is an
      important prognostic and therapy-deciding criterion.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance tomography (CMR) provides a reliable technique to estimate
      elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure from period of existence of a vortical motion of
      blood flow in the main pulmonary artery. Vortex can be visualized in 3-dimensional vector
      field, particle trace and streamline representations and can be analysed with respect to
      vortex related measures (geometry of center, vortex formation, vorticity, propagation
      dynamics …). Furthermore T1-mapping and non-contrast enhanced lung perfusion/ventilation
      scans represent promising techniques for PH characterization.

      Aim of this explorative study is to 1. analyse PH-associated blood flow characteristics in
      the heart and the surrounding great vessels with respect to the 5 groups of PH, and 2.
      investigate the hemodynamic state of &quot;borderline PH&quot; compared to normal mPAP and manifest PH
      by non-contrast CMR.
