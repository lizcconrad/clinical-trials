  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive the vaccine subcutaneously every 3 weeks x 3 and then every 3
      months for 3 years. The rationale for using Poly-ICLC as an adjuvant are two ongoing trials
      at University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) of the MUC1 100mer peptide vaccine - one
      as a therapeutic vaccine in subjects with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and
      the other in subjects with advanced colonic adenomas at risk for developing colon cancer. The
      same formulation, MUC1 100mer peptide admixed with Poly-ICLC, is used in both trials. There
      has been no toxicity observed and the vaccine is highly immunogenic in early disease. In the
      proposed NSCLC trial the anti-MUC1 immune response will be thoroughly characterized.
