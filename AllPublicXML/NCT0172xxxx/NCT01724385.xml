  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab injections for treatment of
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with new dense vitreous hemorrhage (VH) after
      previous full panretinal photocoagulation (PRP).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will carry out a prospective study in patients with PDR and prior complete
      laser treatment who presented with new dense VH. All eyes will be treated with intravitreal
      injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg). Complete ophthalmic examination and/or ocular
      ultrasonography will be performed at baseline and 1, 6, 12 weeks and 6, 9, 12 months after
      first injection. Re-injection will be done in non-clearing and recurrent VH.
