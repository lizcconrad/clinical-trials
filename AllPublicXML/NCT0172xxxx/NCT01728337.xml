      this study was proposed to provide more scientific and objective data on the clinical and
      aesthetic effects of these two toxins (Dysport and Xeomin).

      Subjects will perform 6 (six) visits during the study:

      Screening visit, performed 30 to 1 day before the visit 1, when eligible subjects will be
      recruited and first evaluations will be performed; visit 1, which is the baseline and when
      the injections will be performed; visit 2, 30 +/- 3 days after the injections, when
      evaluations will be performed; visit 3, 90 +/- 3 days after the injections, when evaluations
      will be performed; 4, 120 +/- 3 days after the injections, when evaluations will be
      performed; visit 5, 150 +/- 3 days after the injections, when evaluations will be performed.

      Assessment of percentage (%) of responders, after 5 months of injection, to the effects of
      two BT-A preparations, Dysport® and Xeomin®, by measuring frontalis m. wrinkle intensity at
      maximum contraction, as measured by visual Wrinkles Severity Scale (WSS).
