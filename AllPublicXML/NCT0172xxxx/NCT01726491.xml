  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to understand the role of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)
      methylation in insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and blood tissues. DNA methylation is a
      normal chemical process in the body that modifies DNA. By studying this, the investigators
      hope to better understand the causes of insulin resistance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is defined as the decreased ability of insulin to perform its biological
      function in the muscle, liver and fat. Genetic and environmental factors are known to
      influence insulin sensitivity. It is not known how this is mediated. This study looks at the
      role of epigenetics (modifications of proteins associated with DNA and methylation of DNA) in
      alterations in insulin resistance. We will study lean healthy people, obese non-diabetic
      people and people with type 2 diabetes to characterize the DNA methylation patterns in muscle
      in each group. The second aim of the study is to see how a single bout of exercise affects
      the DNA methylation in the muscle. The third aim looks at the effect of 8 weeks of supervised
      exercise on the DNA methylation.

    <description>This experiment will use the Infinium methylation assay to perform epigenome mapping and define patterns of DNA methylation in skeletal muscle and whole blood tissue of metabolically well-characterized lean healthy, obese nondiabetic, and type 2 diabetic volunteers. We will test the hypotheses that
(1) There is an increased methylation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation and altered methylation of promoters of genes coding for extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal proteins in insulin resistance, (2) The altered methylation patterns observed correspond to protein and mRNA expression changes, and (3) There are coordinated patterns of DNA methylation between the skeletal muscle and whole blood tissues in insulin resistance.</description>

    <description>This experiment will test the hypotheses in lean healthy, obese non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic volunteers that
Increased methylation of the PGC-1Î± promoter predicts a decreased response of this gene to a single bout of exercise, and
Altered methylation of promoters of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes predicts a decreased response of this gene to a single bout of exercise.</description>

    <description>This experiment will test the hypothesis in lean healthy, obese non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic volunteers that
There is decreased methylation of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, and the altered methylation corresponds to protein and mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression changes,
There is altered methylation of genes involved in inflammation and cytoskeletal structure.</description>
