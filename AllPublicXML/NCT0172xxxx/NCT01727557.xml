      This study is being done to compare the two anesthesia techniques which are commonly used in
      the formation of arteriovenous fistulas: local anesthesia and regional anesthesia. Local
      anesthesia means that, your doctor will inject numbing medication directly into the tissue or
      part of your body where the surgery will be done. In this case, the numbing medication will
      be injected directly into the area where your fistula will be made. In regional anesthesia,
      the numbing medication will be injected around the nerve (part of the body that gives
      sensation) for your arm, to make the entire arm numb. The purpose of this study is to compare
      the three month success rates of AV fistulae created by the two anesthesia techniques.

      The primary objectives of the study are:

        1. To evaluate the three-month success rate for AV fistulas constructed while using
           regional anesthesia against those constructed while using local anesthesia. Success will
           be evaluated by a dialysis access ultrasound, which will be performed three months after
           completion of the procedure. Successful will be defined as a mean blood flow of 600
           ml/min and above, or receiving hemodialysis using the newly created AV fistula.

        2. To evaluate the immediate (within 3 days) and long-term complications three months after
           AV fistula construction under regional anesthesia or local anesthesia.

      The secondary objective of the study is to use a short questionnaire survey To assess patient
      comfort level after creation of AV fistula (e.g. nausea, analgesia).
