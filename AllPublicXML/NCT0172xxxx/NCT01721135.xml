    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo controlled, four way crossover, in which the the effect
      of GSK2190915 on the QTc interval is assessed. Healthy subjects will recieve a 5 day course
      of each of the following; oral placebo, GSK2190915 100mg, GSK2190915 1000mg and moxifloxacin
      400mg (single dose) with a weeks washout prior to starting the next course. Key assessments
      include a 12- lead electrocardiogram and pharmacokinetic testing. Safety will be assessed by
      blood pressure, heart rate, clinical laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events
      .

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, four way crossover thorough QT study to evaluate
      the effect of repeat dose GSK2190915 on the QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects.
      Approximately 48 subjects will receive oral placebo, GSK2190915 (100mg or 1000mg) and
      moxifloxacin (400mg). GSK2190915 or matching placebo will be given once daily for 5 days with
      a moxifloxacin matching placebo given on Day 5. Moxifloxacin (positive control) will be given
      as a single-blind single dose on Day 5 with placebo administered on Days 1-4. Individual
      time-matched changes from baseline in QTcF (difference from placebo) for GSK2190915 will be
      determined 0-24 hours after dosing on Day 5 (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints will
      include changes from baseline in QTcF, QTcB and QT interval at each timepoint after 5 days
      dosing of GSK2190915 and single dose moxifloxacin (400mg). Plasma concentrations on Day 5
      (0-24 hours) and pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK2190915 will also be derived.
