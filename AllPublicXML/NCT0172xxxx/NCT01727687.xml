  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As society ages, a large amount of human factors related research has been carried out into
      the subject of the safety of the elderly in their daily lives. However, most research focuses
      on the general elderly population and there is a serious lack of research into elderly
      sufferers of Parkinson's disease (PD), who receive a substantial amount of attention in
      medical circles. In the investigators previous study, the investigators have found that
      patient with PD had decreased ability to cross the road as compared to age/gender matched
      control subjects. Hence, this research proposed several training programs to enhance the
      safety of crossing road, including safe place finding，roadside search，time gap and perception
      of other's intentions. The investigators will compare the parameters of crossing road ability
      before and after training programs in patients with PD and control subjects.

      The results of this research will clarify the correlation between medical scale test
      indicators and movement safety for patients with PD. The effects of training programs will be
      provided for further safety management and design concepts to improve the lives of this
      disease group.

    <description>The main outcome variables were crossing time (CT), remaining time (RT), and safety margin (SM). The CT was the time taken by the subjects to cross the 3.5-m-wide road. The CT was measured at the normal walking pace and the fastest pace of each individual. Response time was measured in the simulated traffic situation and was defined as the time between starting the visual situation and the participant pressing the response button to decide to cross the road. The RT was the difference between the time gap (between the coming vehicle and the pedestrian) and the response time.</description>
