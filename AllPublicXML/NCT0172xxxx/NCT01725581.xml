      The purpose of this study is to show that a new assessment tool for pelvic examination is
      valid and reliable.

    <textblock>
      Physical examination of the pelvis is an important core skill that medical students need to
      acquire. However, due to its intimate nature some students are graduating unable to perform
      competent pelvic examinations. At present, evaluation of the medical students competence at
      pelvic examination is done by subjective faculty assessment. This assessment is typically
      performed at the end of the teaching block and is based on the assessors' recollection of the
      students' performance. This kind of assessment has been shown to have poor validity and
      reliability. This is in contrast to objective structured assessments of technical skill
      (OSATS), which use task specific and global rating scales and have been used to evaluate a
      wide range of clinical and surgical skills. However, no studies to date have evaluated an
      assessment tool for pelvic examination. In this study the investigators aim to determine the
      validity and reliability of an OSATS for pelvic examination. In addition, the investigators
      aim to identify factors that influence the scores in OSATS.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Both validity and reliability are of equal importance so there will be two primary outcomes. Validity will be tested using the proxy measure of construct validity. This will be demonstrated if the results of the OSATS reflect the participant experience.</description>

    <measure>Reliability of assessment tool</measure>

    <description>Reliability will be measured using inter-rater reliability between 3 assessors who will be blinded to the other assessors' marks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Factors other than the stage in training that may influence proficiency in pelvic examination</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>We aim to identify other factors that may influence the participants' score in OSATS in pelvic examination. We will identify potential areas in a questionnaire administered to participant's prior the examination. This information will be collated before the examination in a participant information form. Information regarding gender, age, ethnicity, confidence in examination, interest in future career in obstetrics and gynaecology will be collected as secondary outcome measures.</description>

        Medical students and junior doctors will be approached by the clinical sub dean for O&amp;G at
        Birmingham Women's Hospital (Justin Clark - chief investigator) during the beginning of
        their O&amp;G placement. They will be made aware that outcome and assessment as part of the
        trial will not be incorporated into their final academic grade.
