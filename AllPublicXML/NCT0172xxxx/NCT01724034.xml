  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daily lung ultrasound can help weaning from mechanical ventilation in difficult-to-wean adult
      patients. In this randomized trial, standardized lung ultrasound will be performed daily
      asssociated with standardized interventions aiming to decrease the total time in mechanical
      ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be performed in two intensive care units (ICUs). After randomization, all
      patients in the intervention group will undergo daily lung ultrasounds before the next
      spontaneous breathing trial. The results from the lung ultrasound will indicate specific
      interventions to facilitate weaning:

        -  No sign of lung sliding (ultrasound finding suggestive of pleural movement): prompt
           evaluation for pneumothorax or mainstream intubation will be indicated;

        -  normal lung ultrasound (ultrasound A profile): the patient will be evaluated for deep
           vein thrombosis / pulmonary embolism and/or for reversible airway obstruction (e.g.
           uncontrolled asthma or COPD [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease] exacerbation)-
           followed by appropriate treatment. If the patient has COPD, non invasive mechanical
           ventilation must be used as mode of discontinuing mechanical ventilation;

        -  lung ultrasound shows pulmonary edema (ultrasound B profile): cardiogenic pulmonary
           edema will be differentiated from acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) - followed
           by appropriate treatment (e.g. a negative fluid balance of, at least, 1000 ml before the
           next spontaneous breathing trial);

        -  lung ultrasound shows asymmetrical patterns (ultrasound AB profile or Pulmonary
           Consolidation): the possibility of an uncontrolled infection will be investigated;

        -  presence of simple pleural effusion: diuretics will be indicated (for a negative fluid
           balance of, at least, 1000 ml before the next spontaneous breathing trial) or
           thoracocentesis at description of the assistant team;

        -  presence of complex pleural effusion: other image exam will be performed, and will be
           evaluated by the surgical team.

    <description>If there is no lung sliding - evaluation for pneumothorax or mainstream intubation.
If lung ultrasound shows normal pattern - search for reversible airway obstruction or venous embolism. If the patient has COPD, non invasive ventilation must be used as mode of discontinuing mechanical ventilation.
If lung ultrasound shows intersticial syndrome - evaluate the need to negativate hydric balance before the next spontaneous breathing trial.
If findings are asymmetrical - search for new or uncontrolled infection. If there is simple pleural effusion - researchers should determine a negativation of hydric balance or perform thoracocentesis.
If there are signs of complicated pleural effusion - a new image technique should be performed as evaluated by the surgical team.</description>

The main target is a negative fluid balance of, at least, 1000 ml before the next spontaneous breathing trial. Another possibility is to titrate vasodilators (at least a 20% reduction in the systolic blood pressure) before the next spontaneous breathing trial.</description>
