        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent, prior to any study-specific
             procedures

          -  Volunteers will be males or females aged 18 to 55 years and with a weight of at least
             50 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Male volunteers should be willing to use barrier contraception, ie, condoms, from the
             day of first dosing until 2 weeks after the last dosing with IP.

          -  Females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the unit,
             must not be lactating, and must be of non childbearing potential, confirmed at
             screening .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the volunteer's ability to participate in the
             study.

          -  History or presence of GI, hepatic, or renal disease or any other condition known to
             interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of IP as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or
             urinalysis results as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal findings in vital signs as judged by the
             Investigator
