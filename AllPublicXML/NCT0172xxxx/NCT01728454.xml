  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of two oral doses
      of Proellex administered to premenopausal women with pelvic pain associated with
      endometriosis confirmed within the last seven years and using prescription analgesics for
      symptomatic pain.

      This study is a phase 2, 3-arm-study with an 18 week active dosing period and an option for
      subjects to receive 2 additional 16-week cycles of active treatment at their randomized dose
      (6 mg or 12 mg/day). Placebo subjects who elect additional treatment will receive treatment
      at 12 mg/day. The treatment dose will remain double-blind. The study will be conducted in 3
      stages. In the first stage, women will receive a daily single-blind placebo. This stage will
      last as long as it takes to record at least one full menstrual cycle (ovulation until
      ovulation).

      For stage 2, following the run-in stage, at Visit 3, 60 subjects will be randomized into one
      of 3 arms in a 1-1-1 fashion. The start of dosing should commence as soon as possible after
      ovulation following the end of the previous menstrual event.

      For stage 3, subjects who are eligible to receive additional cycles of treatment and who
      elect to continue treatment will be scheduled within a week before the second expected menses
      (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval. Subjects will receive 2 cycles of treatment
      separated by an off-drug interval (ODI), after which they will be followed until menses has
      returned.
