    <textblock>
      Shoulder tip and abdominal pain following laparoscopic procedures are well recognized as
      causes of post-operative morbidity. This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled
      trial attempts to reduce post-operative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery by
      implementing a simple intra-operative technique.

      Patients who undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallbladder disease or
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair will be recruited to the trial. Patients will be
      randomized to either the current standard (control group) or to receive an intervention to
      remove residual CO2. In the intervention group the pneumo-peritoneum will be removed, at the
      end of the operation, by placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position and utilising a
      pulmonary recruitment maneuver consisting of two manual inflations to a maximum pressure of
      60 cm H2O. In the control group residual pneumo-peritoneum will be evacuated at the end of
      the procedure by passive decompression via the open operative ports.

      This trial recruited 76 randomly assigned patients, 37 in the intervention group and 39 in
      the control group. The overall post-surgery pain scores, as analysed by two-way ANOVA, were
      significantly lower in the intervention group (P=0.0019). On Bonferroni post-tests both 12
      hour (P&lt;0.01) and 24-hour (P&lt;0.01) pain scores were significantly lower in the intervention
      group.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients were recruited from a single Consultant's surgical clinic at the same
             District General Hospital between August 2010 and February 2012. This study was
             approved by the local ethics committee (National Research Ethics Service REC ref:
             09/H0405/65) and informed consent was obtained from all patients after they had the
             opportunity to study information leaflets that were also given to them. The trial was
             designed as a prospectively randomized and double blind trial with a 1:1
             (control:intervention) allocation.

        The inclusion criteria was all adults with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
        physical status grade 1 or 2, who were undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for
        gallbladder disease or laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair performed as a transabdominal
        preperitoneal procedure (TAP). All procedures and data collection occurred at a District
        General Hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The pre-operative exclusion criteria included patients younger than 18 years, those who
        refused to give consent, those that had an inability to understand the research
        questionnaire and pregnancy. Patients who were found to require additional procedures, for
        example a conversion to open surgery, were excluded from the study prior to randomization.
