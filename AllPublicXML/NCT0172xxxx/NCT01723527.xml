  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More Americans are arrested for drug offenses than for any other crime. In 2009, over 294,000
      arrests were made for possession of cocaine or heroin. Incarceration does not address the
      root problems and is frequently followed by relapse and re-arrest after release. In the case
      of opiate-dependent adults arrested for possession of heroin, one potentially effective
      alternative is to divert offenders to methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) as an alternative
      to adjudication of their case. MMT is an effective treatment for heroin dependence, and
      appears very effective for criminal offenders. However, cocaine use is common in MMT
      patients, including those with recent criminal justice involvement, and MMT alone is
      ineffective in addressing cocaine use. Continued cocaine use carries a substantial health
      burden and necessarily entails continued criminal activity. Thus, treatment for diverted
      opiate-dependent offenders should be designed to address cocaine use as well as opiate use. A
      Stage 1 Behavior Therapy Development project is planned over 2 years to adapt, manualize and
      pilot test the Therapeutic Workplace intervention for adults charged with heroin possession
      and offered diversion to methadone maintenance treatment as an alternative to adjudication of
      their case. The Therapeutic Workplace is a novel, employment-based contingency management
      intervention that has been very effective in promoting cocaine abstinence in adults who use
      cocaine persistently during methadone treatment. In the Therapeutic Workplace, participants
      are hired in a model workplace and required to provide drug-free urine samples to work and to
      earn maximum pay. Once we develop and manualize the adapted version of the Therapeutic
      Workplace for adults arrested for heroin possession, a pilot test will be conducted.
      Individuals identified by the State Attorney's office as candidates for diversion will be
      assessed for study eligibility. Given the high rates of injection drug use and
      injection-related transmission of HIV in Baltimore, this study will be restricted to
      injection drug users to evaluate the potential utility of this intervention in reducing HIV
      risk. Eligible individuals will be offered methadone maintenance in lieu of prosecution and
      will be required to remain in methadone treatment for 90 days. All participants will receive
      standard MMT, independent of whether they decide to participate in the pilot study. After
      beginning MMT, participants will be invited to enroll in the pilot study and randomly
      assigned to two study groups. Participants assigned to the Usual Care Diversion group will
      receive the standard MMT. Participants assigned to the Therapeutic Workplace Enhanced
      Diversion group will receive the standard MMT and the Therapeutic Workplace intervention. The
      data from this pilot study will serve as the foundation for a full-scaled randomized
      controlled trial. Overall, the Therapeutic Workplace could serve as a novel and ideal
      intervention for many heroin dependent adults involved in the criminal justice system. The
      use of MMT in lieu of adjudication in combination with the Therapeutic Workplace could
      increase drug abstinence and employment and decrease HIV risk and criminal activity in this
      refractory high-risk population.

    <description>Participants assigned to this condition will receive the standard services and requirements for diversion as described for the usual care group, and will also be eligible to attend the three-phase Therapeutic Workplace (TW) intervention. All phases of this intervention include employment-based drug abstinence reinforcement contingencies. Under these contingencies, participants can work and earn wages or wage subsidies contingent upon drug abstinence as verified by urinalysis. Phase 1 of the TW intervention is expected to increase cocaine abstinence and to prepare participants for employment. Phase 2 of the TW intervention is expected to maintain abstinence while participants are employed in an onsite model workplace. Phase 3 is designed to increase employment in community jobs and to maintain abstinence while participants are employed in offsite community workplaces.</description>

    <description>Participants in this condition will be offered the standard treatment services available in community methadone and buprenorphine programs, including medication (methadone or buprenorphine, respectively), counseling services, HIV testing, and case management. All services will be provided in the treatment clinics. There are a number of clinics within easy walking distance from the research site, and others throughout the city that are reachable by public transportation from the research site. In addition, all participants will receive referrals to the Re-Entry Center, a One-Stop Career Center tailored to the needs of offenders, at all intake and monthly assessments. As mentioned in detail above, participants will be required by the court to stay enrolled in treatment for 90 days. It is important to note that all diverted individuals will receive these services and requirements, independent of whether they agree to participate in the pilot study.</description>
