  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to determine which material, between ceramic and composite,
      is best to manufacture dental inlays and onlays in the treatment of moderate dental substance
      losses, generally due to dental caries. Restorations will be done using direct Computer
      Assisted Design and Manufacturing (CAD-CAM). Another aim of this study is to determine which
      factors influence the success of these restorations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      WHO estimates dental caries prevalence to be over 90% adults worldwide. When tooth substance
      loss due to the decayed tissue is small, a filling is done by the dentist directly. When the
      substance loss is important, dentists often treat it with a crown, which presents the
      disadvantage of further mutilating the tooth. An intermediate technique consists in
      manufacturing an inlay or an onlay: these restorations become more and more common since they
      are a minimally invasive solution in such cases. Inlays and onlays can be made of metal,
      ceramic or composite. Patients tend to refuse metallic restorations, so that dentists
      generally have to choose between composite and ceramic. Composite wears whereas ceramics
      fracture. Published in vitro studies provide possible answers to which material is most
      effective but very few clinical studies have been conducted to confirm them. Material\'s
      choice for inlay manufacturing is thus more country-based than evidence-based (Most french
      dentists choose composite while US dentists prefer ceramics for example). The main objective
      of this trial is to compare the clinical performance of ceramic and composite inlays/onlays.
      Other objectives include looking for the prognostic factors of these restorations and
      validating the criteria proposed by the World Dental Federation (FDI) to evaluate dental
      restorations.

    <description>2 independent evaluators The primary outcome will consist in the FDI instrument for dental restorations assessment, as it was published after consensus in 2007 and updated in 2010 . This instrument is composed of three dimensions (biological, functional and esthetic), each consisting of several items that are assessed by clinical and radiographic examination according to Likert scales of 5 terms. Some items are evaluated quantitatively, others visually.The worst score of all items is retained as the overall score of the restoration, thus resulting in a single (ordinal) primary outcome.</description>
