      The purpose of this non-inferiority study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of a
      mineral and bone disease treatment protocol based on calcitriol to one based on paricalcitol
      in hemodialysis patients using revised Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
      parathyroid hormone targets.

    <textblock>
      Active vitamin D analogs have been the mainstay of treatment for patients on hemodialysis
      with mineral and bone disease (MBD) for the past decade. Intravenous calcitriol is an active
      vitamin D analog which is nearly identical to natural 1, 25 Vitamin D3. Calcitriol results
      from the hydroxylation of previtamin D3 in the liver and kidney. Paricalcitol, 19-nor-1 ,
      25-dihydroxyvitamin D2, is a newer agent vitamin D analog. This agent is believed to have an
      effect more specific to the parathyroid gland, and less specific to absorption of calcium and
      phosphorus from the gut. Although both formulations appear equally effective in suppressing
      parathyroid hormone (PTH), studies have suggested a greater calcemic effect with intravenous
      calcitriol as compared to paricalcitol (1). Due to this, paricalcitol is the predominant
      active vitamin D analog used in hemodialysis patients in the United States. Two recent
      changes in the management of hemodialysis patients will likely reduce the amount of active
      vitamin D analogs used in the near future: the liberalization of PTH goals according to
      international guidelines, (2) and the implementation of bundled payments for dialysis by
      Medicare. These changes challenge previous studies that have analyzed the safety and efficacy
      of these medications. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, cross-over study will be
      to determine whether calcitriol is as safe and effective as paricalcitol in the treatment of
      MBD in hemodialysis patients using the revised KDIGO parathyroid hormone targets. Our
      hypothesis is that calcitriol will be as equally safe and effective as paricalcitol in the
      treatment of MBD in hemodialysis patients.
