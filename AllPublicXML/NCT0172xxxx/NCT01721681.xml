      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of FACTOR X in the prevention of
      bleeding when given as routine prophylaxis over 12 months.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. To assess the pharmacokinetics of FACTOR X after a single dose of 50 IU/kg.

        2. To assess the safety of FACTOR X when given as routine prophylaxis over 6 months (26
           weeks).

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Children with hereditary severe or moderate FX deficiency (FX:C &lt;5 IU/dL), based on
             their lowest reliable FX:C recorded.

          2. Children under 12 years old, whose parent/guardian has given informed consent.

          3. Children with a history of severe bleeding e.g.: intracranial haemorrhage, before
             starting prophylactic therapy, OR a mutation in the F10 gene causing a documented
             severe bleeding phenotype.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Children must not suffer from clinically significant liver disease, renal disease, or
             other coagulopathy or thrombophilia

          2. Children must have no history or suspicion of inhibitors to factor X.

          3. Children who have known or suspected hypersensitivity to the investigational medicinal
             product or its excipients.

          4. Children with a history of unreliability or non-cooperation.

          5. Children who are participating or have taken part in another trial within the last 30
             days.

          6. Children planning more than 4 weeks' continuous absence from the locality of the
             investigational site, between the Screening Visit and the End of Study Visit at
             approximately 6 months (26 weeks) post-Baseline.

            <description>At the Baseline Visit, eligible children received a bolus dose of 50 IU/kg FACTOR X. After the Baseline Visit, children were treated with FACTOR X prophylactically for a period of 6 months (26 weeks).
A dosing regimen of 40-50 IU/kg twice a week was recommended, but was not mandatory. Each dose of FACTOR X was not to not exceed 60 IU/kg.</description>

          <description>One of the secondary objectives was to assess the pharmacokinetics (FX:C incremental recovery 30 minute post-dose at the Visit 1 (Baseline) and the End of Study Visit after a single dose of 50 IU/kg). The overall mean IR calculated for both visits is presented in the outcome measure table.</description>
          <population>Plasma concentrations were obtained for FX:C for all 9 subjects at 30 minutes post dose at Visit 1 and Visit 5.</population>
