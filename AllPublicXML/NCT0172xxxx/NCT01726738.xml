    <textblock>
      This phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600E mutant, unresectable stage III/IV melanoma
      is designed to explore the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to the combination
      of a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitor (trametinib). Tissue will be collected at
      baseline and at progression.If a subject is removed from the study for one of a variety of
      reasons including, but not limited to, an inability to tolerate the combination of dabrafenib
      and trametinib, a need to receive other therapy or completion of 3-years of study treatment
      without progression, and the subject later receives, as part of his/her standard of care, the
      combination of dabrafenib and trametinib and progresses on the standard of care regimen, then
      the subject may be contacted by the treating physician to be put back on to the LCCC 1128
      protocol and have a progression biopsy at this progression time point. Markers of resistance
      will be explored by performing near kinome-wide profiling on tumor samples, and in patients
      who co-enroll in institutional protocol LCCC1108, by sequencing tumors using NextGen DNA
      sequencing technology. Overall response rate and duration to this combination will also be
      assessed.

    <textblock>
      The present phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600E mutant, unresectable stage III/IV
      melanoma is designed to explore the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to the
      combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition. Overall response rate and duration to this
      combination will also be assessed.

      Tissue will be collected at baseline and at progression (clinical or radiological). Patients
      may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as
      they are still experiencing clinical benefit. We anticipate that up to 50% of patients may
      continue on therapy post-progression for 2-8 weeks.

      BRF113220, the phase I/II trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with the MEK
      inhibitor trametinib is ongoing in metastatic melanoma to establish the safety of this
      combination, and to determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) for each agent. Expansion
      cohorts at the RP2D for these drugs in combination were included in the phase I to
      characterize the safety in more detail, and to explore the efficacy of this combination. The
      combination was well tolerated as described in section 1.5, with decreased frequency of rash
      compared to either agent alone and with just 1 report of cutaneous SCC.

      This proposed study will utilize the RP2D determined in the Phase I/II study: trametinib 2mg
      QD and dabrafenib 150 mg BID. Despite a very promising overall response rate of 81%, these
      patients will also likely go on to develop resistance as a result of new resistance
      mutations, and given the cooperative signaling network of kinases that sense inhibition of
      key nodal kinases and induce compensatory responses that offset pharmacological intervention.
      The study objectives are as follows: Objectives Primary Objective To identify kinases that
      are differentially expressed pre- and post-treatment with BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK
      (trametinib) inhibitors, and to determine a kinome signature predictive of resistance to
      BRAF/MEK inhibition in stage III/IV melanoma Secondary Objectives To explore whether
      resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition is associated with new functional mutations in the
      approximately 150 oncogenes / tumor suppressor genes that are assessed in more than 10% of
      the tumors (using NextGen DNA sequencing technology) in the subset of patients who co-enroll
      in LCCC1108, with particular focus on one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS,
      MEK1, MAP3K8 or COT, and PTEN) To determine the overall response rate (ORR: complete response
      + partial response) as measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate the duration of ORR as measured
      via RECISTv1.1 To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) as defined by RECISTv1.1 To
      estimate the rate of overall survival (OS) at 1 year from day 1 of treatment

      Primary Endpoint Kinome signature pathway will be based on comparison of kinome expression
      from pre- and post-treatment biopsies using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with
      mass spectrometry.

             equal to Grade 1 as per CTCAEv4 Willing to undergo biopsy for research purposes only
             Females of child-bearing potential: willing to use two forms of effective
             contraception, and to continue use for 16 weeks post last dose of study medication.
             Effective contraception is defined as any medically recommended method (or combination
             of methods) as per standard of care, including abstinence. Females of non-childbearing
             potential are those who are postmenopausal (defined as greater than 1 year without
             menses with appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age appropriate: &gt;45 years in the
             absence of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In questionable cases, the subject must
             have a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt;40 mIU/mL and an estradiol value
             &lt;40pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L); or who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or tubal occlusion,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy. Men with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must have either had a prior vasectomy or agree to use effective
             contraception as described from D1 of treatment, throughout the treatment period, and
             for 16 weeks after the last dose of study treatment. If a subject becomes pregnant
             during the treatment period of the study, the study treatments should be stopped
             immediately.

        In women of child-bearing potential, negative serum pregnancy test within 48 hours prior to
        day 1 of study treatment and agree to use effective contraception. Effective contraception
        is defined as: (a) an intrauterine device with a documented failure rate of less than 1%
        per year. (b) male partner sterilization prior to the female subject's entry, and this male
        is the sole sexual partner for that female. (c) complete abstinence from sexual intercourse
        for 14 days prior to enrollment throughout study treatment, and for at least 4 months after
        the last dose of study treatment. Abstinence is only acceptable when in line with the
        preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar ovulation,
        symptothermal, post-ovulation methods, etc) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
        contraception. (d) double- barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or
        cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent (foam/gel/cream/suppository). Note:
        hormonal based methods (e.g. oral contraceptives) are not permitted.

        Female subjects who are lactating must discontinue nursing prior to the first dose of study
        treatment and must refrain from nursing throughout the treatment period and for 4 months
        following the last dose of study treatment Measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1

                  therapy is permitted for non-target lesions that are either new or present at
                  baseline provided total dose does not exceed 30 Gy. However, radiation skin
                  injury has been reported with concurrent use of dabrafenib and radiation. To
                  reduce this risk, it is recommended that dabrafenib be held for seven days before
                  and two days after radiation in subjects receiving dabrafenib in combination with
                  trametinib when palliative radiation is prescribed.
