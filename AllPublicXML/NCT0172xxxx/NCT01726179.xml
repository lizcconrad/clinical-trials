  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the goal of the project is to investigate the clinical efficacy of management of early caries
      lesions by resin infiltration and to further scrutinize the patient stress experiences.

      The aim of this study is to test the clinical efficacy of caries infiltration to arrest
      proximal caries lesions in primary molars. It was hypothesized that infiltrated lesions (test
      lesions) will progress significantly less than non infiltrated lesions (control lesions).
      Additionally, it was hypothesized that dental anxiety and stress related to caries
      infiltration will be significantly less than dental anxiety related to a conventional
      restorative procedure. The study will be a controlled clinical trial with a split mouth
      design and blind evaluation of the outcome (caries progression). Caries progression will be
      evaluated annually, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment.

    <description>Patients and their guardians will be instructed to use dental floss to remove dental biofilm in both proximal sites once a day and to brush teeth with fluorated toothpaste twice a day. Besides that, test lesion will be infiltrated with a low viscosity resin (Icon, DMG, Hamburg, Germany). The test lesions will be treated using Icon (DMG, Hamburg, Germany) following the instruction for use.
A sub-sample with children with indication for a composite restoration in at least one proximal surface will be selected for the analysis of dental anxiety and stress.</description>
