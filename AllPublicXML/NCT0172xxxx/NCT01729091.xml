      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding NK cells will help make the
      stem cell transplant more effective in treating the disease. The safety of this treatment
      will also be studied.

      NK cells may kill myeloma cells that remain in your body after your last chemotherapy
      treatment. The NK cells are separated from the umbilical cord blood sample. These separated
      NK cells will then be &quot;grown&quot; (manipulated) in the lab to increase the number of NK cells
      that can be given to you by vein.

      Elotuzumab is designed to directly activate NK cells, that may help kill myeloma cells.

      Lenalidomide (Revlimid) is designed to block a protein that plays a role in cell function and
      growth, which may cause cancer cells to die.

      Melphalan is designed to attach to the DNA (genetic material) of cells, which may cause
      cancer cells to die. It is commonly used in stem cell transplantation.

      This is an investigational study. The way researchers make the NK cells is investigational.
      At this time, it is being used in research only. The NK cell preparation will be provided at
      no cost to you.

      Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available to treat patients with multiple
      myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy.

      Melphalan is commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of myeloma.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Chemotherapy, NK and Autologous Cell Infusions:

      In stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days.
      The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem cells
      are called plus days.

      On Day -15, you will receive elotuzumab by vein over 2-5 hours as an outpatient.

      On Day -9, you will be admitted to the hospital and will receive hydration fluids by vein.

      On Days -8 through -2, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day. You should swallow
      lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open
      the capsules.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day. Do
      not take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose. If you take more than the
      prescribed dose of lenalidomide you should seek emergency medical care if needed and contact
      study staff right away.

      On Day -8, you will receive elotuzumab by vein over 2-5 hours.

      On Day -7, you will receive melphalan by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Day -5 (+/-1 day), you will receive the NK cells by vein over about 1 hour.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein over 30-60 minutes.

      Starting on Day 0, you will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the skin 1 time
      a day every day until your white blood cell count begins to recover. Filgrastim is designed
      to help cells in the bone marrow to multiply, which helps to raise white blood cell counts
      more quickly, lower fever, and decrease the risk of infection.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      You will receive antibiotics as standard of care to help prevent an infection.

      You may receive elotuzumab, lenalidomide, melphalan, NK cells, and/or the transplant as an
      outpatient, if your study doctor approves.

      Pregnancy Tests While Taking Lenalidomide:

      Women who are able to become pregnant must have 3 negative pregnancy tests: within 10-14 days
      before lenalidomide is prescribed, within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed, and
      about 28 days after the last lenalidomide dose. You must fill the prescription within 7 days.

      One (1) time a week for the first month you start taking lenalidomide, women who are able to
      become pregnant will have blood (about 1 teaspoon) drawn for a pregnancy test. Then, in
      females with regular menstrual cycles, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pregnancy
      testing about 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. If menstrual cycles are irregular,
      blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn every 2 weeks, around 14 and 28 days after the last
      dose of lenalidomide.

      These blood tests will be part of a routine blood draw whenever possible.

      Study Visits:

      Before you start treatment, the following tests/procedures will be performed if they were not
      done as part of the routine pre-transplant procedure:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease. To
           collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip or chest bone is numbed with
           anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone marrow is withdrawn through a large
           needle.

        -  You will have a series of x-rays (a bone survey) to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having.

      Up to twice a week from Day -4 to Day +7, blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn
      to check for donor NK cells, if you are one of the first 12 participants enrolled in this
      study. If donor NK cells are found, blood (about 2 tablespoons each time) will be drawn 1
      time each week until around Day +30 (+/-3 days). From 30 to about 100 days after stem cell
      transplant, this blood will be drawn only if you had NK cells in your blood at the last blood
      draw and you are having a routine follow-up visit.

      At each visit after the NK cell infusion on Day -5, or as often as your study doctor thinks
      it is needed, you will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs,
      including graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition in which transplanted tissue
      attacks the body into which it is transplanted in patients receiving a stem cell transplant.
      Graft failure occurs when transplanted stem cells may not be able to grow and multiply in
      your body. If this happens, there will be a high risk of infections and/or bleeding. If the
      number of white blood cells does not get back to high enough levels within 3 weeks after the
      transplant, more stem cells may need to be given.

      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn and urine will be collected for routine tests and to
      check your kidney and liver function as often as your study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after the stem cell transplant:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease.

        -  Urine will be collected to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and
           biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      About 100 days after the stem cell transplant, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and
      urine will be collected to check the status of the disease. If your study doctor thinks it is
      needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain in this study 100 days after the stem cell transplant. Your participation on
      this study will be over when you have completed this long-term follow-up visit.

      You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, you have any infections,
      intolerable side effects occur, you are not able to receive the stem cell transplant, you
      need medical treatment not allowed in this study, your study doctor decides it is in your
      best interest, you cannot keep appointments or take study drugs as instructed, or if you
      decide that you want to leave the study early.
