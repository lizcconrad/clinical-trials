    <textblock>
      Fondaparinux is a parenteral anticoagulant drug approved for the prophylaxis of venous
      thromboembolism in high risk medical patients. A relevant proportion of these patients have
      renal insufficiency and/or thrombocytopenia which represent independent risk factors for
      bleeding. The risk of bleeding may be increased when fondaparinux is administered to patients
      with a reduced renal function and/or low platelet count. A lower dose of fondaparinux, 1.5 mg
      daily, has been approved for patients with renal insufficiency defined by a creatinine
      clearance between 20 and 50 mL/min. However, to our knowledge, there are no clinical studies
      that have specifically evaluated prophylaxis with fondaparinux in acutely-ill medical
      patients with a moderate to severe thrombocytopenia. The scope of this study is to evaluate
      the safety of fondaparinux in high risk hospitalized medical patients with a moderate to
      severe thrombocytopeniada defined by a platelet count between 100,000/uL and 30,000/uL.

    <description>Major bleeding will be defined as overt bleeding associated with: a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more, or leading to a transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole blood, or bleeding that occurs in a critical site: intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal or contributing to death.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay up to two days following hospital discharge, an expected average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but associated with medical intervention, unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, (temporary) cessation of study treatment, or associated with discomfort for the patient such as pain, or impairment of activities of daily life.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay up to two days following hospital discharge, an expected average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
