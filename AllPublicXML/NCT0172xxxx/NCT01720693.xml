  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who are candidates for nephron-sparing surgery, partial nephrectomy is now the
      standard treatment with a surgical, small, clinical T1 tumor (&lt;7 cm). In many recent studies,
      partial nephrectomy provides equivalent oncologic, and superior functional, outcomes compared
      with the standard radical nephrectomy over the short and long term (2, 3). Partial
      nephrectomy techniques, whether open, laparoscopic or robotic, typically involve hilar
      clamping, which creates the desired bloodless operative field, allowing for more precise
      tumor excision and renal reconstruction. This hilar clamping eventually may lead to ischemic
      kidney injury which can compromise the functional outcomes of the remaining kidney.We are
      working now to develop a novel technique of Hypo-Perfusion by achieving partial renal
      arterial clamping, with the goal of completely eliminating surgical ischemia to the renal
      remnant.
