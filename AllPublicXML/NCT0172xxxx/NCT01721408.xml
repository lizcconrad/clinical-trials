    <description>The microbiological response at the subject level was described according to the following definitions of efficacy. Eradication (documented or presumed): none of the baseline pathogens were present in repeat intra-abdominal cultures from the original site of infection taken during the study or a clinical response of cure precluded the necessity of a repeat intra-abdominal culture. Persistence (documented or presumed): documented: any baseline intra-abdominal pathogen was present in the cultures obtained from the original site of the intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, or surgical wound infection during the study; Presumed: repeat microbiological data were not obtained for a participant with a clinical response of failure. Superinfection: Emergence of a new pathogen during therapy, at the site of infection with emergence or worsening of clinical signs and symptoms of infection.</description>

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence without regard to causality in a participant who received study drug. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both AEs and Non-SAEs.</description>
