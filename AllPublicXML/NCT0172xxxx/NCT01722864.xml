        Inclusion Criteria

          -  General good health, other than osteoarthritis (OA) or chronic low back pain (CLBP),
             based upon results of medical and surgical history and medical exam

          -  ≥18 years of age

          -  Voluntarily provide written informed consent

          -  Female subjects eligible if

               1. Not pregnant or lactating; not planning to become pregnant within next 60 days

               2. Surgically sterile, or 2 years postmenopausal, or practicing acceptable birth
                  control for more than 60 days prior to Screening and use of acceptable birth
                  control during the study and 7 days following the last dose of COV155

          -  Male subjects biologically capable of having children must use reliable birth control
             during study and 7 days after the last dose of COV155. Surgical sterilization of the
             subject's monogamous partner qualifies as adequate birth control

          -  Clinical diagnosis of one of the following

               1. OA of knee or hip for at least 1 year with moderate to severe daily pain despite
                  chronic use of stable doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
                  other non-steroidal, non-opioid therapies or with therapy including opioids

               2. Moderate to severe CLBP for at least several hours a day for a minimum of 90
                  days, not due to a known malignancy, and classified as non-neuropathic,
                  neuropathic, or symptomatic for more than 6 months after LBP surgery

               3. OA of knee and scheduled to undergo unilateral primary tricompartmental
                  arthroplasty.

          -  For CLBP/OA: Average in-clinic pain score of ≥3 on 11-point (0 to 10) numerical rating
             scale (NRS) as an average for the last 24 hours at Screening; - Pain intensity score
             of ≥4 on NRS as an average for the last 24 hours at Baseline

          -  For TKR: 11. Post-operative pain intensity scores ≥ 4 on a 0 to 10 NRS after
             discontinuation of post-surgical patient controlled analgesia or intravenous pain
             medications; body mass index ≤ 38.0; classified as either Physical Status (PS)-1 or
             PS-2.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any clinically significant condition or unstable illness that precludes study
             participation or interferes with assessment of pain and other symptoms of CLBP or OA
             or would increase the risk of opioid or NSAID related adverse events

          -  Schizophrenia or an uncontrolled or poorly controlled major psychiatric condition or
             clinically significant anxiety or depression

          -  Active malignancy or history of malignancy within 2 years prior to Screening other
             than dermal or cervical squamous cell carcinoma in situ

          -  History of seizures (exception-pediatric febrile seizures)

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormalities or uncontrolled hypo- or hypertension

          -  For CLBP/OA: Arthroscopic or open surgery on either the knee or hip selected as
             primary OA study joint within 6 months prior to Screening; - For CLBP subjects, a
             surgical procedure for back pain within 6 months prior to Screening, nerve or plexus
             block within 30 days prior to Screening or botulinum toxin injection in lower back
             region within 90 days prior to Screening. For OA subjects, joint injection within 30
             days prior to Screening; - Surgical implants of either the knee or hip selected as the
             primary OA joint; history of spinal stenosis (only CLBP subjects)

          -  For TKR: Major prior open knee surgery on same side as arthroplasty; any other
             surgery/elective procedures within 4 weeks of Screening, or during study; going to
             rehabilitation after surgery

          -  Gastric reduction or gastric band surgery

          -  Taking opioids in equivalents to more than 20 mg hydrocodone or more than 40 mg

             hepatitis C

          -  Any other chronic pain condition other than CLBP or OA that would interfere with the
             assessment of CLBP or OA

          -  Used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, antipsychotic, or benzodiazepine within 14 days
             prior to Screening or started or changed doses of anticonvulsants, selective serotonin
