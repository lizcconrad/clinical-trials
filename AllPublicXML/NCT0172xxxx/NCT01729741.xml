  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroidectomy is one of the most commonly performed operations in general surgery. Available
      data seem to suggest an association between no-drain usage and a shorter duration of hospital
      stay. Seung et al found that the (following thyroidectomy) time to discharge after
      thyroidectomy was significantly shorter in the no drain group compared to the drain group.
      Similar results were recorded in a study conducted by Davari et al. Hyoung et al reported the
      incidence of hematoma formation post- thyroidectomy to be varying between 0.3%-4.3%. Tahsin
      et al reported that post-thyroidectomy bleeding is as rare as 0.3%-1.0%. The fear of an
      hematoma enlarging and obstructing the airway and causing difficulty in breathing, prompts
      many surgeons to use drains routinely after any type of thyroid surgery. The main reason is
      to drain off a possible postoperative hemorrhage, which may compress the airway and produce
      respiratory fail

      This study will be aimed at comparing the patient outcomes with drain and no-drain insertion
      methods after thyroidectomy in a resource limited setting.

      Study population: All adult patients aged between 18 to 79 years who attended the
      endocrinology outpatient clinic and had been diagnosed with goiter.

      Study Participants: All adult patients with goiters who were eligible for thyroidectomy
      Inclusion criteria: All adult patients aged between 18 to 79 years with a diagnosis of goiter
      who consented to participate in the study.

      Exclusion criteria: The investigators excluded patients with goiter who had a history
      suggestive of bleeding tendencies, recurrent goiter, and thyroid cancer with fixation of the
      thyroid gland to surrounding structures and had uncontrolled co-morbidities such as diabetes
      mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT).

      Inserting a drain after goiter surgery and not inserting a drain is the intervention all
      participants receive the same treatment
