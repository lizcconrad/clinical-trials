  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver failure (LF) is a dramatic clinical syndrome with massive necrosis of liver cells.
      Although liver transplantation provides an option to cure patients suffering with LF, lack of
      donors, postoperative complications, especially rejection, and high cost limit its
      application. Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs)
      the novel and promising therapeutic strategy, BM-MSCs can replace hepatocytes in injured
      liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver
      regeneration. Plasma exchange (PE) can improve internal environment by removing endotoxin, it
      helps the liver regeneration and functional recovery and make UC-MSC differentiation into
      hepatocyte like cells, and exert immunomodulatory function. In this study, safety and
      efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) transplantation combined
      with plasma exchange (PE) for patients with liver failure caused by hepatitis B Virus will be
      evaluated.
