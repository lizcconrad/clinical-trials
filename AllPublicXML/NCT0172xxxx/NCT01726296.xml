    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies adherence to survivorship care guidelines in health care
      providers for non-small cell lung cancer or colorectal cancer survivor care. The completion
      of an educational intervention by health care providers may increase compliance and adherence
      to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for survivorship care.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate adherence of oncology health care providers to National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network (NCCN) guidelines for cancer survivorship care in colorectal cancer (CRC) and
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop and assess a targeted educational initiative to improve compliance with NCCN
      CRC and NSCLC survivorship guidelines for oncology health care providers in academic and
      community practice.

      II. To evaluate the impact of this educational initiative on documented adherence and
      compliance with NCCN guidelines for NSCLC and CRC survivorship care by oncology health care
      providers.

      OUTLINE:

      Health care providers complete an educational intervention based on NCCN guidelines in CRC
      and NSCLC survivorship care comprising a power point presentation reviewing evidence and
      guidelines; a USB drive of the NCCN guidelines with paper copy of pages addressing
      survivorship care; an electronic and paper copy of a sample survivorship clinic template note
      with prompts for addressing survivorship care components; and an electronic paper copy sample
      survivorship care plan that can be adapted and distributed at each participating site.
