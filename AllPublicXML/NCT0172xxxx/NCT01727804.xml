      The aim of this controlled clinical study was to evaluate the Neodymiun:yttrium aluminum
      garnet laser, with or without fluoride, in prevention of occlusal caries in the primary
      dentition. High caries risk children (7.6±1.4 years) were selected for this study and
      received the following treatments: G1-1st molar was negative control, and the 2nd molar
      received a resin sealant; G2-1st molar was negative control, and the 2nd molar received laser
      irradiation (100 milliJoule, 5 Hertz - 0.5 Watts); G3-1st molar received only fluoride gel
      and the 2nd molar received fluoride gel + laser irradiation; G4-1st molar received only
      fluoride varnish and the 2nd molar received fluoride varnish + laser irradiation. Patients
      were followed up to 12 months to evaluate the formation of white-spot lesions and/or caries
      cavities by three calibrated observers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical evaluation of the presence of dental caries on tooth occlusal surface</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical evaluation of the volunteers was performed 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment application by three different calibrated appraisers who were blind to the performed treatment.
The clinical and radiographic assessments of the caries lesions were recorded using the clinical criteria described by Chu et al.,(2009), which was adapted from Ekstrand's visual scoring system, and the sealant evaluation was adapted from Beiruti et al.,(2006)
The units of measure are: The scores obtained were considered as the following: V0, V1 and/or R0 represented sound teeth(with no need for restorative treatment), which were assigned a score of 0; V3, V4 and R1 to R3 represented decayed teeth(with a need for restorative treatment), which were assigned a score of 1. Considering the sealant scores, if the tooth evaluated presented with a caries lesion, it was considered to be a decayed tooth(with a need for treatment), regardless the sealant retention status.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  subject age of 7 to 8 years, high caries risk (evaluated by oral hygiene, dietary
             habits and fluoride exposure, according to Kidd 2011), with the first permanent molars
             without caries cavities, restorations, enamel defects, morphological anomalies and/or
             signals of fluorosis. Subjects had to be willing to comply with all study procedures
             and protocols. They had to be residents of Ribeirão Preto or other nearby local
             communities with the same water fluoridation pattern (to eliminate water fluoridation
             as a potential con- founding variable). Subjects had to be healthy and the parents or
             the child legal guardian need to be willing to sign the &quot;Authorization and informed
             consent for research&quot; form. There were no gender restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  suffering from systemic diseases, had a significant past or medical history with
             conditions that may affect oral health (i.e., diabetes, HIV, heart conditions that
             require antibiotic prophylaxis), were taking medications that may affect the oral
             flora or salivary flow (e.g., antibiotic use in the past three months, drugs
             associated with dry mouth / xerostomia), had in-office fluoride treatment within the
             last three months prior to being enrolled in the study, or were not willing to stop
             the use of any mouth rinse during the duration of the study.
