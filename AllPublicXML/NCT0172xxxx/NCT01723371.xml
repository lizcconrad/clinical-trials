  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and feasibility of using a β-blocker (in this case
      carvedilol) in the treatment of pediatric patients with Left Heart Failure (LHF) in children
      with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Carvedilol affects the nervous system, the same
      system that is highly activated in response to stress in patients with PAH. Each patient is
      administered a dosage of carvedilol, according to their weight. This dosage is increased
      incrementally over the span of the study, if the patient responds well to the drug. The study
      will determine whether the potential adverse side effects of carvedilol outweigh the possible
      positive results in reducing LHF. The hypothesis of this study predicts that carvedilol will
      have positive effects in treating LHF, similar to their use in treatment of Right Heart
      Failure (RHF). This is a single-centered pilot study. Each patient will be studied for
      approximately 31 weeks.

    <description>Carvedilol will be administered orally. The initial dose of carvedilol will be 0.05mg/kg/day divided into 2 doses. After two weeks, at subsequent weekly study visits, the dose of carvedilol will be increased incrementally to 0.1mg/kg in Week 2, 0.2mg/kg in Week 3, 0.4mg/kg in Week 4, 0.6mg/kg in Week 5, and 0.8mg/kg in Week 6, when the target dose of 0.8mg/kg/day (if weight is less than 62.5kg) or 50mg/day (if weight is greater than 62.5kg) is achieved. This dosage, assuming no adverse effects, will be maintained between Weeks 6 and 30 of the study. After the maintenance period from Week 6 to 30, patients will be weaned over 5 to 7 days or continued on a non-study drug supply.</description>
