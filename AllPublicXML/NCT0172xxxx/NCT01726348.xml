  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of darunavir for the
      treatment human immunodeficiency virus-type I (HIV-1) infection among Filipino adults.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (study
      conducted at multiple sites), uncontrolled (all the patients receiving darunavir) clinical
      and observational study (study in which the investigators/physicians observe the patients and
      measure their outcomes) to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of darunavir for the
      treatment human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection among adult Filipino
      patients. The study will enroll 10 percentage of patient who would use the product, as a
      requirement of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Patients will be monitored
      from baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter for a period of 24 weeks. Safety evaluations for
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, concomitant medications, and
      co-morbid conditions will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of treatment will
      be for 24 weeks and the total study will be conducted for 3 years.

    <description>This is an observational study. Darunavir will be administered as per the recommended doses and will be given orally every 4 weeks for a period of 24 weeks. For treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adult patients with no darunavir resistance associated substitutions: Darunavir 800 mg will be administered with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food. For treatment-experienced adult patients with at least one darunavir resistance associated substitution: Darunavir 600 mg will be administered with ritonavir 200 mg twice daily with food.</description>
