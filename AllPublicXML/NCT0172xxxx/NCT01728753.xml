          2. Is male or female between the ages of 18 and 80 years old, inclusive.

          3. Tests positive for influenza A or B by a commercially available Rapid Antigen Test
             (RAT) -OR- Has influenza confirmed by diagnostic assay (e.g. non-study RAT or PCR)
             from another clinic during the 48 hours between onset of symptoms and anticipated
             dosing.

             (Note: A subject with a negative RAT result may still enroll if the Medical Monitor
