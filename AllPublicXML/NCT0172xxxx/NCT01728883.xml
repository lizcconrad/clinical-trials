  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of enhancements to the myVisionTrack® in
      regards to patient compliance and test-retest variability. Additionally, the ability of
      myVisionTrack® to detect changes in vision function will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of this study will provide the basis for patient self-monitoring of visual
      function with the myVisionTrack®, and for reporting, storage, and maintenance of collected
      data. The myVisionTrack® is intended to be used remotely by patients to monitor their
      disease. In the case of significant changes, patients will be prompted to visit their
      ophthalmologist. It is hypothesized that this can lead to earlier detection of disease
      progression, which, in turn, can lead to earlier treatment and better prevention against
      vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy (DR).
