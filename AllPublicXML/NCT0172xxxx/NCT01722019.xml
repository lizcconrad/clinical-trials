  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovenous ablation of the greater saphenous vein has nowadays the same outcome as open
      crossectomy and stripping. The two most performed techniques for endovenous ablation are the
      endovenous laser ablation and the radiofrequency ablation. According to the trial of
      Rasmussen, they are equivalent for occlusion but the lower laser wave lengths resulted in
      more pain and paresthesia. The newer wave length of 1470 nm showed lesser side effects in
      observational studies. The aim of this study is to compare radiofrequency ablation with the
      VNUS closure fast ® with laser ablation with a 1470 nm wave length in combination with a new
      fiber, the Tulip fiber ®. This fiber has the shape of a tulip at his tip which avoids point
      necroses of the vessel wall and on consequence results in lesser side effects from wall
      perforations such as pain, haematoma,…
