  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy)has been found to be effective in treating depression
      in West, only limited amount of research has been conducted to find assess its effectiveness
      in low and middle income countries. We have developed culturally sensitive CBT during the
      last few years in Pakistan. Pakistan has high rates of depression. And there is currently a
      need to develop and test evidence based treatments which are culturally sensitive and cost
      effective. IN this project we will be assessing the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive
      CBT based self help intervention for depression in Pakistan against care as usual, using a
      randomized controlled design.

    <description>Intervention was based on our initial work using mixed methods, using mixed methods,in Pakistan. It focused on psycho-education, symptoms management, changing negative thinking, behavioral activation, problem solving, improving relationships and communication skills. One person from the family was involved in all cases. The intervention consists of 7 chapters. Manual can be used by the patient's or carers with at least 5 years of education. A member of the research team called them once every week to remind them of the next chapter and also to discuss any issues o problems that emerged during the previous week.
