  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide and bortezomib when
      given together with dexamethasone in treating patients with amyloid light-chain amyloidosis
      or light chain deposition disease. Biological therapies, such as pomalidomide, may stimulate
      the immune system in different ways and stop abnormal cells from growing. Bortezomib may stop
      the growth of abnormal cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      pomalidomide and bortezomib together with dexamethasone may be an effective treatment for
      amyloid light-chain amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of pomalidomide, bortezomib,
      and dexamethasone (PVD) to take forward in a subsequent phase 2 study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain a preliminary assessment of efficacy of PVD regimen as initial treatment of amyloid
      light-chain (AL) or light chain deposition disease (LCDD).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide and bortezomib.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21; bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days
      1, 8, and 15; and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 3 months.
