      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if stimulating the nerve involved with airway
      constriction, while undergoing procedures that are known to cause asthma exacerbations,
      decreases the level of asthma attack experienced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by shortness of
      breath, wheezing, cough, and fatigue. Some people suffer from sudden worsening of asthma
      symptoms despite being treated with medications. When people have asthma attacks the muscle
      tissue in the airway contracts causing the airway to narrow and decreasing the ability for
      the person to breathe.

      Neurological pacemakers are FDA approved devices that stimulate nerves in the body and have
      been used for the treatment of many disorders such as Parkinson's, epilepsy, chronic pain and
      urinary incontinence. Recent animal studies have shown that stimulating (activating a nerve)
      the carotid sheath area (located in the neck) can cause the rapid relaxation of the muscles
      which contract during an asthma attack. This approach has also been successfully used in
      patients at an emergency room when they came in with a severe asthma attack.

             either:

               1. bronchial hyper-responsiveness to MCT

               2. bronchial hyper-responsiveness to EVH testing

          2. All patients with documented evidence of a positive MCT or EVH test within 36 months
             of Visit 1

          3. Are capable of reading and understanding questionnaires and providing written informed
             consent.

          4. Are willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other
             protocol-specified procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Subjects experiencing an exacerbation of asthma within 6 weeks of Visit 1

          3. Subjects with a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) ≤ 60% predicted, on spirometry

          4. Subjects and medications:

               1. Subjects allergic to methacholine or any other parasympathomimetic agent

               2. Subjects on investigational drugs or participating in interventional research
                  trial(s), 30 days prior to enrollment or during the duration of the study
