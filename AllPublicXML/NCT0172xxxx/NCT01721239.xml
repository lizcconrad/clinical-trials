  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2010 alone were admitted 33,361 patients for treatment in Danish intensive care units.
      There is evidence to former intensive care patients have a significant symptom burden that
      affect recovery, function and activity for up to several years after admission to the
      intensive care unit. For the individual patient involves the low quality of life, delayed
      recovery, prolonged illness and healing process, and increased mortality. It requires that
      health professionals should provide support so patients quicker return to their usual life.
      Follow-up interviews with the staff after hospitalization in ICU have been shown to support
      the patient and identify individual needs and symptoms that can lead to more realistic
      expectations and increased well-being after admission in ICU. Follow-up in Denmark is being
      inconsistent in both the number of hospitals that offer this service, and in the offered type
      of service. Follow-up interviews with and without diaries suggest to improve physical and
      mental well-being and health, with limited scientific evidence of the efficacy of these
      interventions. We will investigate the effect of a standardized follow-up program after
      admission to the intensive care unit, consisting of written information, patient photos taken
      during hospitalization and three follow-up calls compared with standard care (discharge
      without follow-up).

      During a clinical study conducted in several intensive care units in Denmark examined whether
      follow-up calls can improve patients' well-being and health, as well as the meaning of the
      follow-up program has on the patient's everyday life in the first year after hospitalization
      in the ICU.

      The investigation contribute knowledge to the international research by revealing symptom
      burden and efficacy of a follow-up program for up to 1 year after admission to the ICU in
      order to be able to target rehabilitation efforts and improved the quality of life. It will
      be innovative to use the results from a clinical study as a foundation for a database, and
      the method can serve as a precedent for evidence-based introduction of guidelines, database
      registration and create the groundwork for future research in intensive care. This study is
      expected to be profitable to society by preventing frequent readmissions, reduce medication
      costs and fewer referrals to specialists and have a positive effect on retention to the labor
      market. This will provide overall better use of society's expenses.
