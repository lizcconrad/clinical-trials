  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are at high risk for
      developing significant anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapies (CBT) are frequently
      used for children with anxiety symptoms with good success. The purpose of the current study
      was to examine the efficacy of a family-focused group CBT program (Facing Your Fears [FYF])
      compared to Treatment As Usual (TAU). Participants were randomized to either active treatment
      or TAU. It was hypothesized that children who completed the active treatment would
      demonstrate improvement in their anxiety symptoms relative to children in TAU.

    <textblock>
      Children with ASD and anxiety in our initial studies have displayed reductions in anxiety
      symptoms following the delivery of the FYF intervention. Given these initial successes, there
      are two primary purposes of this study. First, to train outpatient clinicians to fidelity on
      the FYF intervention for 8-14 year old children with high-functioning ASD and clinical
      anxiety. Second, to develop an optimal training model for learning the FYF intervention. The
      primary aims of Phase 1 are to develop a training manual and deliver a workshop on the FYF
      model to a group of outpatient clinicians in preparation for the clinicians to deliver the
      FYF intervention to four groups of children with ASD and anxiety. In Phase 2, the primary
      aims include comparing three instruction methods of learning to clinicians at three different
      outpatient clinics, by assessing increases in clinicians' acquisition of the intervention
      techniques and estimating the degree of reduction in anxiety symptoms on the primary outcome
      measures for the children with ASD. Instruction methods are: a) Manual, b) Workshop, c)
      Workshop-Plus. We hypothesize that clinicians receiving the Workshop-Plus (workshop plus
      ongoing consultation) condition will achieve treatment fidelity at a faster rate than
      clinicians receiving the other two instruction methods, and the children with ASD in the
      Workshop-Plus condition will display greater reductions in anxiety symptoms compared to the
      children in the other two conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Clinicians must (1) be at the level of graduate student (or higher) in either a
             masters or doctoral program in clinical, counseling or school psychology; and (2)be
             working in an outpatient clinical setting serving children with ASD

          -  Children must (1) be 8-14 years of age; (2) living with someone who can give informed
             consent to participate;

          -  Children must have a diagnosis of ASD as defined by (a) Autism Diagnostic Observation
             Schedule (ADOS; Lord et al. 1999) score above spectrum cutoff; (b) Social
             Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; Berument et al. 1999) score above cutoff; and (c)
             clinical diagnosis of an ASD as determined by a review of history and current clinical
             presentation by a clinical psychologist and assigning one of the following diagnoses:
             Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not
             Otherwise Specified.

          -  Children must have an estimated Verbal IQ of 80 or above as determined through
             standardized cognitive testing using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence
             (WASI; Wechsler, 2002), or an equivalent measure of intelligence that has been
             administered within the past two years, and attempts to engage verbally with the
             examiner during the administration of Module 3 of the ADOS.

          -  Children must be able to read at a mid-2nd-grade level: Many activities involve
             narrative approaches and early reading is a pre-requisite skill for this intervention
             package; (as assessed by the Letter-Word Identification and Reading Comprehension
             subtests of the Woodcock Johnson Achievement Tests - Third Edition; WJ-III; Woodcock,
             McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001).

          -  Children must evince clinically significant symptoms of either , SAD, GAD, or SP
             anxiety and this impairment is &quot;primary&quot; or more functionally significant than another
             disorder (such as depression) as determined by the clinician evaluator. Children with
             clinically significant scores on SpP will also be included, although SpP cannot be the
             sole anxiety diagnosis for the child.

          -  Parents must (1) be the parent of a child with ASD and clinical anxiety as defined
             above and can give consent for the child to participate in the study; and (2) include
             men and women between the ages of 24-65.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinician-trainees: (1) Inability to attend at least 11/14 group sessions

          -  Children: (1) child is not fluent in English; (2) family cannot commit to having a
             minimum of 1 parent and 1 child attending 11 of 14 sessions within the intervention
             period; (3) child presents with psychosis, severe aggressive behavior, or other severe
             clinical symptoms that require more intensive treatment such as day treatment or
             hospitalization; (4) family plans to seek additional psychosocial treatment for
             anxiety during enrollment through treatment; (5) child is not able to separate from
             parent for a minimum of 30 minutes within the qualifying sessions; Because the parent
             and child interventions occur simultaneously, if a child has significant issues
             separating from the parent, it makes it difficult for the parent to participate in
             their portion of the assessment.

          -  Parents: (1) Parent is not fluent in English; (2) Parent is unable to attend 11/14
             sessions within the intervention period
