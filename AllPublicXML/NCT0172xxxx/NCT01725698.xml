      This research is aimed to evaluate the combination of mesenchymal stem cell, HA-CaSO4, BMP-2,
      and implant in treating critical-sized bone defect.

      In the presence of critical-sized bone defect whose defect size is more than 2.5 cm, bone
      will suffer a healing disturbance. In treating these conditions, the conventional method were
      vascularised bone grafting and bone transport. But the existing methods of treatment have
      many weaknesses Vascularized bone graft is a procedure with a high level of difficulty. Hence
      not every orthopaedic surgeon were able to perform it. It also takes more operating time and
      its failure rate is also quite high.

      Meanwhile, external fixation which is applied with bone transport, was being often complained
      by the patient in terms of cosmetic and psychologically.

      According to diamond concept of bone healing, there are four main factors that influence the
      bone healing. These factors are osteogenic factor (mesenchymal stem cell), osteconductive
      factor (HA-CaSO4), osteoinductive factor (bone morphogenetic protein-2) and mechanical
      component (implant). The potency of each component in fracture healing with/out bone defect
      has been proved in many studies. The combined effect of these components is often studied as
      well, but not in critical-sized bone defect.
