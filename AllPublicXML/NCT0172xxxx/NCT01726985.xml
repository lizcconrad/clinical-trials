  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalizations and readmissions in the United States
      and is a tremendous economic strain on our healthcare system. There is currently, based on
      national averages, a 30% readmission rate and 10% mortality rate within 3 months of being
      hospitalized for heart failure. Retrospective studies have shown benefit to using biomarkers
      such as BNP to guide inpatient heart failure management. Our own CCF retrospective study
      showed that decreasing NT-ProBNP by 23%, making patients fluid negative by more than 1.3L,
      and discharging patients with serum sodium above 135 reduces readmission rates significantly.
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively use the above mentioned goals in the treatment
      of heart failure in order to reduce heart failure readmission and mortality rates.

      All HF patients admitted to CCF will receive a short consent form. The study will enroll
      patients for one year. Physicians will initiate / titrate medications and obtain consults as
      usual but are highly encourage to keep patients in the hospital until at least 2 of the 3
      (above mentioned) criteria are met. Physicians will receive a copy of consent forms,
      educational bulletins, and discharge forms (as described in the Physician Education document
      which is attached to this application). Log-rank test will be used to compare groups.
      Chi-Square will be used to compare prospective patients with retrospective controls (obtained
      in 2010).
