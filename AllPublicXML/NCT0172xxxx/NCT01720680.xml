      -  Title: Open-label, prospective exploratory study to assess the effects of the AlphaCore®
           device on central and peripheral airway dimensions in patients with COPD.

        -  Indication: COPD patients

        -  Study Design: Open-label, prospective design

        -  Study Phase: II

        -  Test treatment duration: 1 day

        -  Test treatment: AlphaCore® device

        -  Dosage regimen: 1 session of stimulation during 90 seconds

        -  Patient number: up to 10 evaluable patients with COPD

        -  Patient age: ≥ 18 years

        -  Sex: male or female

        -  Primary objective: The evaluation of the effect of the AlphaCore® device on central and
           peripheral airway dimensions with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).

        -  Secondary objectives: The assessment of the effect of the AlphaCore® device on lung
           function (spirometry, diffusion and resistance) and on patient reported outcomes
           (PRO`s).
