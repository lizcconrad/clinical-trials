  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of massage therapy on quality of life
      (QOL) in youth and young adults (ages 8 to 21 years) with cystic fibrosis (CF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Massage therapy (MT) is defined as hands on manipulation of the soft tissue of the body with
      the intent to produce therapeutic, physiologic effects and to promote health and well-being
      (Oawriter - OAC - codes.ohio.gov, 2010; American Massage Therapy Association, 2010). Quality
      of life is defined as a self-description (child or adult) or parent's description of the
      child's perceived health and well-being based on satisfaction with physical, emotional,
      psychosocial and school/role functioning (Varni et al., 2002). Additional measures for this
      study which may influence QOL include pain, pulmonary function, ease of breathing and
      thoracic excursion.

      Research Questions:

      i. What differences in changes of QOL scores, as measured by the Peds QL 4.0 (Pediatric
      Quality of Life Inventory) and the CFQ-R (Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised) are found
      in youth and young adults with CF between the group receiving MT and control group? What
      changes in QOL scores in each group are found over time? ii. What differences in changes of
      musculoskeletal pain, as measured by the Numeric Rating Scale for pain are found in youth and
      young adults with CF between the group receiving MT and the control group? What changes in
      pain scores in each group are found over time? iii. What differences in changes of the
      pulmonary function are found in youth and young adults with CF between the group receiving MT
      and the control group in terms of the following:

        1. Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) scores,

        2. Single breath counting score, measuring ease of breathing, and

        3. Thoracic excursion as measured by the cloth tape measure technique? What changes in the
           above pulmonary function in each group are found over time?

Ask: &quot;Are you having pain?&quot; ___No ___Yes (If yes, ask the following questions and repeat for each location:
&quot;Where is your pain?&quot;

How would you describe your pain in your (location)?
Is it sharp like a stabbing knife or dull like an ache or pressure?
Is it constant (is it steady and does not change?) or is it intermittent (does it come and go)?
What do you think caused you to have pain in your (location)?

    <description>Treatment group receives pre-determined massage therapy protocol x 5 over 10-12 weeks. massage therapy protocol includes a blend of Swedish strokes and myofascial trigger point therapy. Initially, dosing will be more frequent. Treatments will be spaced out to determine the ability of the body to maintain a more efficient musculoskeletal system, especially related to respiratory and postural efforts. Each session will end with resting hands and relaxation strokes to signal the end of the session. This protocol invites increased mobility in the musculoskeletal system. The ultimate goal is to return connective tissue (including muscles and fascia) to a more relaxed and neutral state, thus allowing expansion and ease of movement of the areas of the musculoskeletal system being worked.</description>

    <description>The Massage Therapy protocol consists of a series of 5 massages administered over 10 (+2) weeks. Length of time for each visit will be approximately 1.5 - 2 hours Typically, a series of treatments over time allows the body time to integrate tissue related changes and potentially maintain a more healthy musculoskeletal state. Based on expert opinion in the field of MT, following a series of massage treatments administered over time, one can anticipate tissue changes. By adding time between treatments, data will describe the ability of subjects to maintain changes over progressively longer periods of time. Treatment protocol will be based on the application of myofascial trigger point therapy (Timberlake, 1999) to musculoskeletal areas of the body often affected by disease progression in CF.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of CF evidenced by a prior documented positive sweat test (&gt;60 mEq/ml by
             quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis and genotype with two identified mutations
             consistent with CF)

          -  Males and females, aged 8 to 21 years at time of enrollment to obtain a broad range of
             symptoms related to tissue changes. (Over time, individuals with CF present with
             increasing symptoms with age and disease progression.)

          -  English speaking

          -  Pulmonary function clinical baseline &lt;100% (Baseline is defined as the highest PFT
             during the 6 months prior to PFT at enrollment.) * This criteria was eliminated to
             expand eligible subjects (including PFT baseline &gt;100).

          -  Clinically stable as defined by no evidence of acute upper or lower respiratory tract
             infections or other acute illnesses requiring use of antibiotics for at least 14 days
             prior to enrollment. (Pulmonary exacerbation often includes cough which may affect
             responses to MT.) * this criteria was omitted after study began as subjects were
             frequently being treated with antibiotics secondary to CF and pulmonary exacerbations.

          -  Approval to participate from Pulmonary Physician

          -  Informed consent to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposed to any investigational drug or device within 30 days of enrollment

          -  Any other illness at time of enrollment not a direct result of CF that the pulmonary
             physician determines that MT is contraindicated

          -  Inability to lay flat on massage table as is required for massage protocol

          -  Platelet count within past 12 months &lt; 100,000. (Contraindication for deep tissue MT.)
             *eliminated this criteria with medical approval.

          -  INR International Normalized Ratio (INR) - (blood test used to monitor the
             effectiveness of blood thinning drugs) within past 12 months &gt; 1.5 (Delayed clotting
             time is a contraindication for deep tissue MT.) * eliminated this criteria with
             medical approval.

          -  History of hepatosplenomegaly as deep tissue massage is contraindicated.

          -  History of lung and/or liver transplant as deep tissue MT may be contraindicated with
             anti-rejection drug protocol.

          -  Received MT within the past 30 days to eliminate the potential bias of previous
             response to treatment. *changed protocol to allow enrollment and wait 30 days to
             initiate protocol.

          -  Skin condition or injury that would be contraindicated for MT and would restrict
             ability to apply massage strokes according to protocol
