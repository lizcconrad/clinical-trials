      Title: A Phase IV, Open-label, Single-Center Study on the Effects of a Nutritional Supplement
      Combination on Body Weight Management over a 90-day period

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Safety assessment:

      Safety will be assessed by changes in blood chemistries/hematology, and adverse events, of
      nutritional supplement emergent AEs (TEAEs), classified by severity grade, relatedness to the
      nutritional supplement.

      Efficacy Assessment:

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy (changes in body composition and
      measurements as well as influence on appetite and quality of life changes) of the nutritional
      supplement administered repeatedly throughout the study.

      Study Subject Population:

      Healthy adult men and women are eligible for participation upon fulfillment of the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

    <description>Determine the safety and tolerability of a weight loss system and dietary supplements containing ingredients to promote healthy weight
Evaluate the changes in body weight as measured by body weight and body composition changes (as determined by BMI as well as changes in body measurements-waist, hip, arm, and ankle circumferences) of a weight loss system and dietary supplements containing ingredients to promote healthy weight.
Determine changes in substrate energy utilization
Determine subjective measurements of hunger, appetite, feeling of well being during weight loss
Determine changes in expansion and return of blood vessels (pulse wave analyzer)</description>
