      The purpose of this open-label study is to assess the safety, antiviral activity, and
      pharmacokinetics of 9 subcutaneous injections of miravirsen monotherapy (5 weekly doses over
      5 weeks, followed by a further 4 doses once every other week over 7 weeks) over a total of 12
      weeks of treatment. The subjects enrolled in this study are chronically infected with HCV
      genotype 1 and are null responders to treatment with peg IFNÎ±/RBV therapy.
