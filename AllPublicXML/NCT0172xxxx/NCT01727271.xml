  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare monotherapy with tenofovir to sequential therapy with pegylated
      interferon alpha-2b (pegIFN-2b) followed by tenofovir, and to combination therapy with
      pegIFN-2b + tenofovir, in participants with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic
      hepatitis B and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). All enrolled participants will be be
      administered tenofovir alone for 8 weeks and then will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3
      treatment arms.
