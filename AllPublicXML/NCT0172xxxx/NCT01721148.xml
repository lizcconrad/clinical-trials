  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a great need for new therapies for carcinomas that have progressed on or not
      responded to current therapy. There are no approved Met targeted agents in standard clinical
      use. In the population of subjects with advanced carcinomas that are unresponsive to standard
      of care, and based on the relatively safe, reversible and monitorable toxicity profile of
      ASLAN002 in non clinical studies, the potential for benefit from ASLAN002 outweighs the
      potential risks for toxicity.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose of ASLAN002 in subjects
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumours, as well as to define the overall safety profile of
      ASLAN002.

      The purpose of the study is

        -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASLAN002 in subjects with advanced or
           metastatic solid tumours

        -  To define the overall safety profile of ASLAN002

        -  To assess the effects of ASLAN002 on overall cardiac function as measured by blood
           pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and left ventricular
           function

      Secondary:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASLAN002 and its N-oxide metabolite,
           following single and multiple dosing

        -  To provide a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour activity, as assessed by the Overall
           Response Rate (ORR) and changes from baseline in tumour size

             with nitrosoureas, mitomycin C, and liposomal doxorubicin. For biologics (e.g.,
             monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab) and extended-release formulations, the
             washout period must extend 1 month beyond the recommended dosing interval (e.g., for
