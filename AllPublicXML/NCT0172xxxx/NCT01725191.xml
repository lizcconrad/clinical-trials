      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tivantinib in treating younger
      patients with solid tumors that have returned after a period of improvement or have not
      responded to treatment. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of tivantinib
      administered orally twice daily to children with refractory solid tumors.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of tivantinib administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of tivantinib (capsule as well as powder
      formulation) in children with refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of tivantinib within the confines of a
      phase 1 study.

      II. To preliminarily investigate whether cytochrome P450 (CYP450) polymorphisms impact
      pharmacokinetics or toxicity of tivantinib.

      III. To preliminarily investigate whether tumor c-Met and/or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
      expression or downstream c-Met signaling correlate with clinical response to tivantinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
