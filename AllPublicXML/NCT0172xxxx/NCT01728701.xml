  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of ID administration of
      PfSPZ Challenge to volunteers taking chloroquine chemoprophylaxis (an approach called
      PfSPZ-CVac).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single centre, double blind, randomized controlled clinical trial. Volunteers,
      investigators and laboratory personnel will be blinded.

      A maximum of 30 volunteers will be randomly divided into four groups. All volunteers will
      receive standard weekly chloroquine chemoprophylaxis for a period of 14 weeks (98 days).
      During this period, groups 1 and 3 will receive six ID injections of PfSPZ Challenge,
      containing a total of 75,000 PfSPZ of the Pf NF54 strain, on days 8, 36 and 64 (immunizations
      1, 2 and 3). The control groups 2 and 4 will receive ID injections with normal saline (NS) on
      the same days.

      Thirty-three days after the last dose of chloroquine, volunteers in groups 1 and 2 will have
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by the bites of five mosquitoes infected with PfSPZ
      of the Pf NF54 strain. If ≥75% of volunteers in group 1 are protected against this homologous
      Pf CHMI, volunteers in groups 3 and 4 will have CHMI by the bites of five mosquitoes infected
      with the heterologous Pf NF135.C10 strain 75 days after the last dose of chloroquine.

      If &lt;75% of volunteers in group 1 are protected against the homologous Pf CHMI, volunteers in
      groups 3 and 4 will receive an additional immunization (immunization 4), which will consist
      of six ID injections on the same day of 75,000 PfSPZ Challenge and NS respectively, at day
      162. In this fourth immunization period chloroquine will be administered for another 6 weeks
      starting at day 154. Finally, 33 days after the last dose of chloroquine, volunteers in
      groups 3 and 4 will have homologous Pf CHMI by the bites of five PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes.

      After CHMI all volunteers will be treated with a curative regimen of Malarone® (each tablet
      containing 250 mg atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil), either at the time of detection of blood
      stage parasitemia or 21 days after exposure to PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes. Volunteers will be
      checked for parasites by thick smear at least twice after treatment.

      If one of the volunteers is not fit to participate in the study on day -1, an alternate
      volunteer who passed screening will replace him or her. For this purpose 3 additional
      volunteers will be screened for possible back up.

    <description>Signs and symptoms will be recorded at all visits, and whenever a trial volunteer reports signs or symptoms to the trial physician between visits. The following signs and symptoms will be solicited: Fever, Headache, Malaise, Fatigue, Dizziness, Myalgia, Arthralgia, Nausea, Vomiting, Chills, Diarrhoea, Abdominal pain (Verhage 2005), Chest pain, Palpitations and Shortness of breath.</description>

    <measure>Presence of parasitemia after Pf CHMI as assessed by microscopy</measure>
    <time_frame>Thick smears will be performed on all visits following immunizations and Pf CHMI until treatment is finished upto 53 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Thick smear samples will be taken from a 3 ml EDTA vacutainer tube. Thick smears will be performed on all visits following immunizations and Pf CHMI until treatment is finished.
Thick smears will be performed according to a standard operating procedure, which is based on an internationally harmonized protocol for thick smears in CHMIs (Moorthy et al., WHO). In short, 15μl of whole blood will be distributed on standardized 3-well slides, providing an equal slide thickness for all smears. Slides are dried and stained with Giemsa. Per slide, 200 fields will be read, which correlates to 0.5 µl of blood. Slides are considered positive if they contain 2 or more parasites per 200 fields. Thick smears evaluation will take place at the RUNMC.</description>

    <time_frame>Samples collected on all visits following immunizations and Pf CHMI until treatment is finished upto 53 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Samples for qPCR will be collected from the same 3 ml EDTA vacutainer tubes as the thick smear sample. qPCR will be performed according to standard procedure described in Hermsen et al. Mol, Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 247-251. In short, qPCR will be performed on the multicopy 18S ribosomal RNA gene. All samples are spiked with murine white blood cells and a murine albumin gene PCR is used to determine efficacy of DNA isolation.
Samples for quantitative measurement of parasitemia will be prepared and stored at RUNMC. Measurement by qPCR will be performed retrospectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and throughout the period of study upto 53 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall objective is to find immunological markers or signatures that associate with protective efficacy at immune RNA profile or cell response level.
Immunogenicity assays will be performed on samples from both vaccinees and infectivity controls from baseline and throughout the period of study.
Humoral assessment will include antibody assays by immunofluorescence, ELISAs for specific Pf proteins and serological activity with a proteome chip representing thousands of Pf proteins. In addition antibody functionality will be tested in a series of sporozoite inhibition assays.
Cellular assessment of parasite-specific (subset)T cell responses, will be conducted by multi-parameter flow cytometry and ELISPOT assays) using Pf-specific in vitro stimulation by a number of antigens.</description>
