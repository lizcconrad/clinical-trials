      The purpose of this study is to determine whether vestibular exercises provide added benefit
      to balance rehabilitation in older adults with dizziness and normal vestibular function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dizziness is among the most prevalent complaints for which people seek medical help and the
      incidence increases with advancing age. Dizziness represents a diagnostic and treatment
      challenge because it is a subjective sensation, refers to a variety of symptoms
      (unsteadiness, spinning, sense of motion or lightheadedness), and has many potential
      contributory factors. Dizziness is often related to vestibular disease which is treated
      effectively with vestibular exercises. Successful management of dizziness is critical because
      dizziness is a major risk factor for falls in older adults.

      There are parallels between the effects of age-related versus disease-related loss of
      vestibular function - in complaints of dizziness and increased risk for falls. The
      investigators' question, then, is whether the same exercises that are beneficial for patients
      with vestibular pathology are beneficial for older patients with dizziness but normal
      vestibular function.

      Older adults with dizziness who have been referred to Audiology for vestibular evaluation
      will be randomized to receive either standard balance rehabilitation plus placebo eye
      exercises (CON) or standard balance rehabilitation plus vestibular-specific exercises (GS).
      Primary outcomes include symptoms, balance-related confidence, dynamic visual acuity,
      postural stability as measured by sensory organization test, fall risk as measured by dynamic
      gait index, and gait speed. Assessment will occur at baseline, discharge from physical
      therapy (PT), 1 and 6 months post-PT.

    <description>All subjects will perform balance and gait exercises in addition to the eye movement exercises and will be provided a written home exercise program (HEP) consisting of balance and gait exercises designed to improve postural stability and mobility with progressively more challenging tasks. Balance exercises will include maintaining stability in standing with vision and somatosensory cues altered, dynamic weight shifting and performing ankle, hip and step strategies. Gait activities will include negotiating uneven terrains and obstacles, gait with slow head turns focusing on objects, varied speed (speeding up and slowing down), and unpredictable starts and stops. Walking for endurance will be included in the HEP. Each participant will receive a customized balance and gait HEP based on identified impairments and will be progressed according to ability and level of assistance at home as is standard in PT.</description>

    <description>Vestibular adaptation and substitution exercises were designed originally based on the error signals (retinal slip) that induce changes in gain in the vestibular system and will be performed by the experimental group (GS). Adaptation exercises involve head movement while maintaining focus on a target, which may be stationary or moving. Typical progression of adaptation exercises involve increased velocity of head movement, movement of both target and head, target placed in a distracting visual pattern and maintenance of a challenging posture. Substitution exercises specifically attempt to facilitate use of alternative strategies, rather than teaching the specific strategies. During active eye-head exercise, a large eye movement to a target is made prior to the head moving to face the target, potentially facilitating use of preprogrammed eye movements.</description>

    <description>The placebo exercises will consist of saccadic eye movements while the head is stationary and will be performed by the control group. These eye movements will be performed against a plain background in order to eliminate retinal slip and, therefore, eliminate the error signal for vestibular adaptation.</description>
