    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pomalidomide when given together
      with dexamethasone in treating patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma that has
      come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) or intraocular lymphoma
      that is newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory. Pomalidomide may stimulate the immune system
      to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pomalidomide together with dexamethasone
      may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide in combination with
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma
      (PCNSL) or primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) and safety of pomalidomide in combination
      with dexamethasone in patients with PCNSL and PVRL lymphoma in an MTD expanded cohort.

      II. To evaluate overall survival and progression free survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide in the central nervous system. II. To
      identify the predictive biomarkers for responsiveness to pomalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pomalidomide.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15,
      and 22 of courses 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number and severity of all adverse events will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population both overall and by dose level. The grade 3+ adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar fashion.

    <measure>Predictive biomarkers for response to pomalidomide</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to day 21 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation studies will be performed to identify predictive immune markers for response to pomalidomide. Immune cell counts and cytokine profile will be evaluated in blood and CSF at day 1 and day 21 of course 1. Values at each time point and changes after pomalidomide treatment will be both graphically and quantitatively summarized and explored. Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher's exact test will be utilized where appropriate to assess the relationships of these markers with response.</description>
