    <textblock>
      Digital rectal examination is an act clinically performed daily by physicians and surgeons.
      It remains the key diagnostic test and directs the therapeutic management of cancer of the
      lower and middle rectum. It can be done in two main positions: lateral decubitus, and supine.

      However, no randomized study in colorectal surgery is not interested in evaluating the best
      position to perform a full rectal exam.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>realization of a full digital rectal examination</measure>
    <time_frame>The consult could be done prior to the surgery or one month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Full digital rectal examination is defined by a rectal examination for investigating the superior pole of the prostate, to examine the entire circumference and the rectal sphincter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>assessment of sphincter according to the DRESS score</measure>
    <time_frame>The consult can be performed prior to the surgery or one month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This score assesses the sphincter tone at rest and during exercise. This score classes the sphincter tone in both situations: tone undetectable (score = 0) to hypertonic sphincter that does not allow the introduction of a finger (score = 5)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>missing information during the rectal examination</measure>
    <time_frame>The consult can be performed prior to the surgery or one month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This analysis aims to determine what information is missing most often in one group compared to another (height to digital rectal examination, circumference of the digital rectal examination , assessment of sphincter tone)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conversion rate decided by the examiner</measure>
    <time_frame>The consult can be performed prior to the surgery or one month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>the conversion rate decided by the examiner corresponds to the switch from one position to another</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the position by the patient</measure>
    <time_frame>The consult can be performed prior to the surgery or one month after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>After the digital rectal examination, the examiner shows the patient a picture of the two positions and ask him the question: which position is the most embarrassing?</description>
