  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a complex psychiatric disease of uncertain aetiology
      and pathogenesis. A key mechanism of disease susceptibility and treatment response could be
      epigenetic changes in DNA methylation patterns. However, no study has yet demonstrated that
      psychotherapy can exert its therapeutic effect through epigenetic mechanisms. The main aim of
      this study is to analyze the promoter methylation pattern of genes considered to be related
      to the development and psychopathology of BPD, in particular the brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF) and glucocorticoid receptor genes, and the effects of mentalization based
      treatment (MBT) on changes. Associations to changes in BDNF serum levels and salivary
      cortisol levels, as well as key components of BPD aetiology and core treatment targets in
      MBT, will also be investigated. Should epigenetic mechanisms have importance for BPD
      pathology and effects of treatment, there is potential use of DNA methylation patterns as
      valid biomarker measures of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response.

      Hypothesis:

      The formation and maintenance of symptoms in BPD is mediated through neuropsychiatric
      mechanisms that can be affected through psychological treatment. Specifically, aberrant
      epigenetic regulation of neuropsychiatric genes related to behavioural control and affect
      regulation, as well as BDNF and cortisol levels, is ameliorated by therapeutic processes.

      Method:

      Fifty female patients diagnosed with BPD will undergo a year of intensive MBT that is
      designed to target domains of BPD pathology. The patients will be assessed at baseline and
      every 6 months over the treatment period. Matched healthy control subjects will be assessed
      at 6 month intervals to compare changes in DNA methylation, BDNF serum levels, salivary
      cortisol levels, and neuropsychological test performance. To link components of the
      neuropsychiatric mechanisms underlying the onset of illness, course, and response to
      treatment, patients will undergo assessment of clinical symptoms, comorbidity patterns and
      psychosocial impairment. Patients and control subjects will at baseline undergo assessment
      for childhood trauma, self-harm, suicidal behavior, early maladaptive schemas, and
      personality traits, and within the 1-year study period also undergo continuous assessment for
      changes in symptoms of dissociation, depression, and personality dysfunction.
