  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a cooking oil blend of dietary fats rich
      in medium chain triglycerides on energy expenditure and food intake in overweight and obese
      children.

    <measure>Thermic effect of food</measure>
    <time_frame>6 h</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of thermic effect of food over 6 hours after a meal rich in test oil and control oil. The thermic effect of food is the difference between post-prandial energy expenditure and basal energy expenditure. We will assess the difference in thermic effect of food over a 6-hour period between the test oil and the control oil.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory quotient/fat oxidation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 h</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of substrate oxidation by indirect calorimetry over 6 hours after consumption of the test oil and control oil. We will specifically calculate carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates over the 6-hour period post-prandially and compare rates of oxidation of these two substrates between the test oil and the control oil.</description>

    <description>Participants will consume a muffin containing 20 g of dietary fat provided by the test oil and their energy expenditure will be measure post-prandially for 6 hours. At the end of the measurement period, participants will consume a cookie containing 10 g of fat provided by the test oil and their food intake at an ad libitum meal will be measured 1 hour later.</description>
