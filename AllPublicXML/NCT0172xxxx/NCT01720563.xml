  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighty to 90% of SCCHN (squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck) patients in Taiwan were
      betel quid chewers. Thirty to 40% of them experienced mucositis World Health Organization
      (WHO) grade 3 from cisplatin/flurouracil (FU) in neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting. This was
      higher than the 8-11% reported in the Western populations and was related to oral submucous
      fibrosis from betel quid chewing.Severer toxicities, esp. mucositis, could be anticipated in
      patients of betel quid chewing treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with
      cisplatin/FU.PG2 Injection is proved to be safe for clinical use and is effective in
      stimulating the recovery of hematopoiesis and immunity from chemotherapy-induced
      myelosuppression. It also improved the Quality of Life, especially in fatigue, among advanced
      cancer patients. This study will be investigated the effect of PG2 Injection in relieving the
      adverse events of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, such as fatigue, myelosuppression, mucositis,
      body weight loss, and even the compliance of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in treatment of
      patients with advanced pharyngeal or laryngeal SCCHN.
