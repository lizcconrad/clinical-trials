    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies educational counseling in improving communication and
      quality of life in spouses and breast cancer patients. An outpatient education and behavior
      skills training program may help spouses and patients with breast cancer communicate better
      and improve quality of life. It is not yet known whether educational counseling is more
      effective than an educational booklet in improving communication and quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test whether the intervention has a beneficial effect on spouses' outcome variables.

      II. To test whether the intervention has a beneficial effect on ill partners (patients')
      outcome variables.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive the &quot;What's Happening to the Woman I Love?&quot; booklet, which
      focuses on ways to understand and deal with marital communication and relationship issues
      arising from breast cancer diagnosis.

      ARM II: Participants undergo the Helping Her Heal educational counseling program comprising 5
      1-hour sessions 2 weeks apart.

      SESSION I: Participants learn stress management skills and discover ways stress affects
      themselves and their partner.

      SESSION II: Participants practice attentive listening and reduce the tendency to try to
      distract patients from talking about sad or difficult aspects of the cancer experience.

      SESSION III: Patients learn to help their spouse talk when she is quiet or withdrawn, to add
      to their understanding of what she is thinking and feeling, and to add to their ways of
      supporting her during especially difficult times with the cancer.

      SESSION IV: Participants learn strategies for physically reconnecting with spouses.

      SESSION V: Participants review skills from prior sessions, identify strategies he or she will
      continue to use to manage their personal stress, and identify ways to maintain connection and
      support.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
