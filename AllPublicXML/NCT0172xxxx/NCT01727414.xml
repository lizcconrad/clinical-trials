      This study evaluates how children with Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity (ADD)
      respond to medication, and if their response is different from children who have problems
      with both hyperactivity and inattention. In order to do this, children ages 7-11 whose
      primary difficulty is with attention problems and who have never been on behavioral or
      psychiatric medications are being recruited. Once enrolled, children will try one week each
      of 3 different doses of methylphenidate, the most commonly prescribed Attention Deficit,
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication, as well as placebo. Children will be randomly
      assigned to one of six possible medication dose and placebo titration schedules, but the
      study doctor, family, and teacher will not know which dose (if any) children are receiving
      for a given week. Each week, behavioral and side effect ratings will be completed by both the
      child's parent and teacher, and the family will meet with the study doctor for a physical
      examination and to discuss how each week went. Some children will also have
      neuropsychological testing to determine how methylphenidate influences their working memory,
      sustained attention, and ability to inhibit (stop) inappropriate responses.

      All data will be analyzed to decide which medication dose the child responded to best and
      further recommendations for treatment will be given. Ultimately, this study aims to improve
      understanding of how children with ADHD-Primarily Inattentive Type respond to stimulant
      medications by

        -  determining whether these children experience a diminished response to methylphenidate
           compared to children with both hyperactivity and inattention

        -  determining whether certain genetic and environmental factors play a role in this
           response.

      Findings from this study will be used to help streamline the identification of the most
      effective doses of medication for children with ADHD-Primarily Inattentive Type.

      Robust data indicate that stimulant medications reduce ADHD symptoms and impairment, but it
      is unclear whether their efficacy generalizes across the ADHD subtypes. Although
      predominately inattentive type (PIT) is the most prevalent ADHD subtype in U.S.
      population-based studies, few studies have specifically examined response to stimulants in
      this subtype. Instead, medication guidelines for PIT have largely been extrapolated from
      studies enrolling all or mostly ADHD-combined type (CT). Thus, this application seeks to
      improve understanding of stimulant medication response and its predictors in children with
      PIT. We will evaluate participants' response to methylphenidate (MPH), the most widely
      prescribed stimulant, via a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial
      with 3 dose conditions. Our first specific aim is to examine MPH medication and dose response
      in children with PIT (n=120) and CT (n=45) to test the hypotheses that participants with PIT
      have a diminished MPH response and derive less benefit from higher doses compared to those
      with CT. Since only one prior study has examined genetic predictors of MPH response
      variability within PIT-only samples, our second specific aim (exploratory) is to determine
      the potential role of genetic polymorphisms (e.g., those in DAT1, DRD4, NET, ADRA2A, COMT,
      SNAP25, CES1, GRM7, LPHN3) on MPH response in children with PIT (n=120), examining both
      symptom change with MPH and MPH dose response curves. If we identify significant differences
      in MPH response between the subtypes, our findings may guide clinical practice by suggesting
      more effective medication strategies (such as different dosing schedules) for children with
      PIT. In addition, this study may yield pharmacogenetic findings that, in the future, could
      enable physicians to tailor individual treatment plans for children with PIT, ameliorating
      the current prolonged and expensive practice of prescribing by trial and error.

    <description>Assessed via parent and teacher-completed Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales which were administered at the end of each the 4 weeks of the titration trial.
Range: 0-54 [sum of 18 symptom items, rated from 0 (none), 1 (occasionally), 2 (often), 3 (very often)], higher scores indicate more ADHD symptoms Note to address Review Comment: During the 4 week titration trial, the placebo condition and each of the three active dosages (low, medium, and high) were given for one week each. Because the placebo and active dosages were given in random order to preserve the triple blind, all participants did not receive the same order of dosages and it is not possible to connect the connect the dosages (placebo, low dose MPH, medium dose MPH, high dose MPH) to a specific week number (week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4) which would hold for ALL participants. That is why Timeframe was revised from &quot;week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4&quot; to placebo, low dose, medium dose, and high dose week.</description>

             children may also be included if they receive a score of 75 or greater on the Word
             Reading and/or Math subtests, as long as this score is not a significant discrepancy
             from their full-scale IQ score (e.g., a difference of greater than one standard
             deviation or 15 points).

          -  School: Enrolled in a school setting rather than a home-school program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Understanding Level: Participant and/or parent cannot understand or follow study
             instructions.

          -  Psychiatric Medications: Current or prior history of taking any medication for

          -  Exclusionary Psychiatric Conditions: Children with mania/hypomania and/or
             schizophrenia will be excluded. The following comorbid diagnoses will not be excluded
             unless they are determined to be the primary cause of ADHD symptomatology (see below
             for description of this decision process): Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Phobias and
             Anxiety Disorders, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Major Depression / Dysthymia, Eating
             Disorders, Elimination Disorders, Trichotillomania, Tic Disorder, Oppositional Defiant
             Disorder, Conduct Disorder.

          -  Organic Brain Injury: History of head trauma, neurological disorder, or other organic
             disorder affecting brain function.

          -  Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Children with a personal history or family history of
             cardiovascular risk factors will be excluded, or given the option of participating in
             the study after obtaining an EKG and a signed letter from a pediatric cardiologist
             verifying the safety of their participation in a trial of methylphenidate. In this
             case, families will be responsible for the costs of EKG and cardiologist evaluation.
             If for any reason a family is unable to assume the cost of the EKG and cardiologist
             evaluations but still wishes for their child to participate, study staff will
             determine on a case-by-case basis whether the study budget allows the study to offer
             financial assistance to the families for these evaluations.

        <title>ADHD Total Symptom Score</title>
        <description>Assessed via parent and teacher-completed Vanderbilt ADHD Rating Scales which were administered at the end of each the 4 weeks of the titration trial.
Range: 0-54 [sum of 18 symptom items, rated from 0 (none), 1 (occasionally), 2 (often), 3 (very often)], higher scores indicate more ADHD symptoms Note to address Review Comment: During the 4 week titration trial, the placebo condition and each of the three active dosages (low, medium, and high) were given for one week each. Because the placebo and active dosages were given in random order to preserve the triple blind, all participants did not receive the same order of dosages and it is not possible to connect the connect the dosages (placebo, low dose MPH, medium dose MPH, high dose MPH) to a specific week number (week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4) which would hold for ALL participants. That is why Timeframe was revised from &quot;week 1, week 2, week 3, week 4&quot; to placebo, low dose, medium dose, and high dose week.</description>
