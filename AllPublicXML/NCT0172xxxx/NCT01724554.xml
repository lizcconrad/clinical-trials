      The purpose of this study is to look at how effective, safe, and well tolerated Intravitreal
      Aflibercept Injection is in subjects with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) or
      Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of one or more of the following:

             Proliferative retinopathy (PDR) Macular edema secondary to CRVO Proliferative disease
             secondary to CRVO (anterior segment or posterior segment neovascularization).

          2. Be in need of IAI treatment, whether previously treated or treatment-naïve.

          3. Age &gt; 18 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy without concomitant
             proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

          2. Subjects with cataract or other media opacities impairing adequate visualization of
             the retina to the extent that good quality images are impossible.

          3. Presence of any substantial ocular disease (other than diabetic retinopathy or central
             retinal vein occlusion) that may compromise vision in the study eye and /or confound
             interpretation of the data; e.g. substantial cataracts, advanced glaucoma, optic
             neuritis, optic neuropathy or atrophy, marked macular atrophy, history of retinal
             detachment, uveitis, viral or other forms of chorioretinitis, etc.

          4. Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye, or history of
             idiopathic or autoimmune-associated uveitis in either eye.

          5. Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as intraocular pressure ≥ 25 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication).

          6. History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular hole (Stage 3 or 4) in the
             study eye.

          7. Participation in a study of an investigational drug or device within 30 days prior to
             potential enrollment into the study.

          8. Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 60 days
             preceding baseline.

          9. History of vitrectomy surgery in the study eye.

         10. Subjects with 12 or more anti-VEGF injections within 24 months prior to Screening.

         11. Subjects who received anti-VEGF therapy within 30 days of Screening or received
             steroid or laser therapy within 90 days of Screening.

         12. Subjects allergic to fluorescein, povidone iodine (Betadyne) or aflibercept

         13. Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
