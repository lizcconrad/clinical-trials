  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well capecitabine and celecoxib with or without radiation
      therapy works in treating patients with colorectal cancer that is newly diagnosed or has been
      previously treated with fluorouracil, and has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic).
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Celecoxib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving capecitabine and
      celecoxib together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of complete response 2 years following the initiation of first line
      5-FU (fluorouracil) based chemotherapy in patients with initially unresected metastatic
      colorectal cancer who are then treated on the activating cancer stem cells (CSCs) from
      dormancy and priming them for subsequent targeting (ADAPT) protocol.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine overall survival, relapse free survival (if complete response [CR]) based on
      intent to treat (ITT) analysis.

      II. To determine quality of life while on ADAPT therapy.

      III. To determine the effects of v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras)
      mutation status, resection and radiation on response to ADAPT therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients proceed to surgery, radiation therapy with ADAPT therapy followed by maintenance
      ADAPT therapy, or ADAPT therapy. Eligible patients undergo surgical resection at baseline or
      upon achievement of resectable disease after radiation therapy.

      RADIATION + ADAPT: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week and receive
      capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and celecoxib PO BID 5 days per week during
      radiation.

      ADAPT: Patients receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14 and celecoxib PO BID on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 4 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 2 years.

          <description>Patients proceed to surgery, radiation therapy with ADAPT therapy followed by maintenance ADAPT therapy, or ADAPT therapy. Eligible patients undergo surgical resection at baseline or upon achievement of resectable disease after radiation therapy.
RADIATION + ADAPT: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week and receive capecitabine PO BID and celecoxib PO BID 5 days per week during radiation.
ADAPT: Patients receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14 and celecoxib PO BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Capecitabine: Given PO
Celecoxib: Given PO
Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: Undergo IMRT
Laboratory Biomarker Analysis: Correlative studies
Quality-of-Life Assessment: Ancillary studies
Radiation Therapy: Undergo radiation therapy
Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Undergo stereotactic radiosurgery

          <title>Treatment (Capecitabine, Celecoxib, Radiation Therapy)</title>
          <description>Patients proceed to surgery, radiation therapy with ADAPT therapy followed by maintenance ADAPT therapy, or ADAPT therapy. Eligible patients undergo surgical resection at baseline or upon achievement of resectable disease after radiation therapy.
RADIATION + ADAPT: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week and receive capecitabine PO BID and celecoxib PO BID 5 days per week during radiation.
ADAPT: Patients receive capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14 and celecoxib PO BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 3 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Capecitabine: Given PO
Celecoxib: Given PO
Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: Undergo IMRT
Laboratory Biomarker Analysis: Correlative studies
Quality-of-Life Assessment: Ancillary studies
Radiation Therapy: Undergo radiation therapy
Stereotactic Radiosurgery: Undergo stereotactic radiosurgery
Therapeutic Conventional Surgery: Undergo surgical resection</description>
