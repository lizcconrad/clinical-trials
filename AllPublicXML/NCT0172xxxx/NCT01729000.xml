  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the additional use of gloves (with handwashing before
      and after gloving) for all patient contact while infants have intravenous (central or
      peripheral) access in a RCT. Preterm infants &lt;1000 grams or less than 29 weeks gestational
      age will be randomized after birth to either a handwashing-gloving group or handwashing only
      group. The primary outcome will be the incidence of invasive infections (bacterial or fungal)
      or necrotizing enterocolitis. Secondary outcomes will include hospital days, preterm
      morbidities, mortality, and hospital costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All infants who had a birth weight of less than or equal to 1000 grams or who were born less
      than 29 weeks gestation were eligible for this study. 120 subjects were randomized by day of
      life(dol) 8 to one of two study groups--hand hygiene or hand hygiene plus gloving. Study
      signs were placed at the bedside and on the isolette sides of each infant with the
      appropriate study group guidelines.

      The investigators goal was to target the time period these infants are at high-risk for
      infection or NEC and its associated mortality. The targeted time was the first 4 weeks of
      life or longer while intravenous access is still required. The average age for the first
      episode of late-onset sepsis is 22(+/-0.5) days (median: 17 days; 75th percentile: 28 days;
      95th percentile: 57 days). The majority of infections that occur after 4 weeks of life are in
      patients still requiring IV access (peripheral or central). The presence of an intravenous
      line in this group of preterm infants correlates with the presence of risk factors for
      infection that would necessitate the need for intravenous access including: parenteral
      nutrition, lipid infusion, use of broad spectrum antibiotics, and the intravenous line itself
      (if it is a central venous catheter). This strategy focused on the individual infant's risks,
      limits exposure to and decreases cost of intervention.
