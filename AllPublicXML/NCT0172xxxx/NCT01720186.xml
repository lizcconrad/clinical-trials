      This is a pilot study, single-center, prospective, open-label, to assess the acceptability
      and performance of the experimental medical device (SPI) used during an imaging examination
      (PET / CT 4D imaging in synchronized mode centered on the thorax). Each patient will be its
      own control, since the imaging examination will be synchronized simultaneously with the two
      systems: tested Medical Device (SPI) and reference Medical Device(RPM).

Detection of breath cycle of the patient by measuring dCycleSpi (dCycleSpi = Number of synchronization signals emitted by SPI / total number of breath cycle * 100).
Accuracy of detection of inspiratory peak amplitudes with SPI medical device: by measuring dtSpi (dtSpi = standard deviation of the time lag between synchronization signals and maximum inspiratory amplitude for each cycle).

               -  Either the characterization of single pulmonary nodule; Or - the definition of
                  the target volume in radiotherapy.

          2. Patient who meets the following criteria to be eligible for an PET/CT imaging:

               -  Patient able to maintain a supine position for 60 minutes

               -  Patient with no bronchopulmonary infection and with no upper aero digestive tract
                  acute infection in progress (increased risk of false positives)
