  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, H pylori infection has been treated with conventional triple therapy. This
      includes amoxicillin, clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor all given daily for 10-14
      days. In Europe, the guidelines now advocate treatment of H pylori with sequential therapy
      which is 5 days of amoxicillin therapy with proton pump inhibitor followed by 5 days of
      clarithromycin, metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor with better response rates. We
      hypothesize that H. pylori resistance pattern and treatment response rates observed in Europe
      will not be predictive of resistance patterns and response rates in the United States.
