    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to demonstrate the effect of purple rice on post-prandial glucose and
      insulin. The purple color is due, like red wine grapes, mainly to the anthocyanins. The
      safety and tolerability of purple rice is similar to white or brown rice, but contains the
      purple elements common to other foods like grapes.

      This is a study that will have 1 screening visit and 9 study visits. Subjects will come to
      the screening visit for blood chemistry, health questionnaire and speak to the coordinator.
      Each subject passing inclusion/exclusion will go on to eat purple rice for 4 weeks and brown
      rice for 4 weeks. The 4-week feeding periods will be balanced and assigned randomly. The
      subjects will report to the metabolic kitchen to pick up their supply of 14 frozen rice
      dishes each week in a container and return the empty containers as a measure of compliance.
      At the end of each 4-week feeding period, subjects will come to the inpatient unit fasting
      from 9pm the prior night except for water. Subjects will have an intravenous line placed and
      fasting blood will be drawn for chemistry. Subjects will then be given glucose to drink and
      blood will be drawn from then IV line for glucose and insulin at time listed in the consent.
