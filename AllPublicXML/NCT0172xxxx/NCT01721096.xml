      The objectives of the PMS are to observe the frequency, type, and degree of device deficiency
      to assure the safety of the new medical device (XIENCE PRIME) as well as to collect
      information on evaluation of the efficacy and safety for reevaluation.

      The primary objectives of the PMS are to observe the frequency, type, and degree of device
      deficiency to assure the safety of the new medical device (XIENCE PRIME) as well as to
      collect information on evaluation of the efficacy and safety for reevaluation by
      Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA).

      <desc>This Surveillance is conducted per the Ministerial Ordinance on Good PMS Practice for Medical Devices to measure the frequency&amp;status of adverse device effects&amp;AEs in order to assure the safety of the new medical device to be evaluated for repeat review by PMDA. PMDA has requested for a combined AE for follow up period, as the difference between both the groups are just based on length of the device,which does not signify a change in the technology but the same technology applies.</desc>
