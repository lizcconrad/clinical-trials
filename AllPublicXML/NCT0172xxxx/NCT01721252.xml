  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine prospectively the value of a recently identified
      proteomic signature in identifying those patients with lung cancer, who are likely to benefit
      from and respond favourably to erlotinib therapy.

      This is a prospective study of serum proteomics as a predictor of response to erlotinib
      therapy.

      Screening/Baseline

        1. Routine blood tests (Haematology and Biochemistry) as per hospital practice

        2. Research serum sample for proteomic studies (10ml blood sample)

        3. Routine pre-treatment CT but with formal RECIST/WHO measurements of tumour size

      2 months Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib: Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment

      4 months Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib: Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment

      1 year Post Commencement of Treatment with erlotinib (as per current standard of care):
      Routine CT with RECIST/WHO assessment

      Response Assessment: CT scans at baseline, at 2 and 4 months post commencement of therapy and
      one year after treatment with erlotinib will be analyzed with the emphasis on identification
      of disease progression.

      Follow Up: Subsequent follow-up as per routine.
