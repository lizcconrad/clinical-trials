  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most cost effective intervention is to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations in the
      national health system. These unnecessary admissions are increasing for several years,
      reaching rates of over 30% in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
      heart failure at two months of hospital discharge. There is scientific evidence suggesting
      that a multidisciplinary intervention consisting in controling disease and stress associated
      with disease, and modifying eating habits could reduce the number of hospitalizations due to
      disease decompensation.

      The main objective of the study is to assess the rate of readmissions at year of
      multidisciplinary intervention in patients with COPD and / or heart failure.

      We will select 144 patients who will be randomized to two groups (control and intervention
      group) and they will be followed for 12 months through 4 visits (1 month, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months of hospital discharge).

      Patients assigned to the intervention group will be receive three educational sessions (one
      of them will be imparted by nursing, another by the nutritionist and the last one by the
      psychologist). In addition, patients with a BMI &lt;20 and / or&gt; 30 will receive a closer
      monitoring by the nutritionist).

      Patients assigned to the control group will receive usual care in clinical practice.
