      A pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Apica Access, Stabilization, and
      Closure Device for accessing and closing the left ventricular apex during and after
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) procedures. Follow-up assessment will be made
      post-procedure, at 30 days and 90 days as well as longer term follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject age ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Subjects will be selected in accordance with the investigating centers standard
             operating procedures for TAVI subject selection and treatment. Subjects selected will
             meet all of the TAVI inclusion criteria as follows:

               -  Subject has Senile degenerative aortic stenosis with echocardiography derived
                  criteria: mean gradient &gt; 40 mm Hg or jet velocity &gt; 4.0 m/s or an aortic valve
                  area (AVA) of &lt; 0.8 cm2 (or AVA index &lt; 0.5 cm2/m2.

               -  Subject is symptomatic due to aortic valve stenosis as demonstrated by NYHA
                  Functional Class &gt; II.

               -  Additive EuroScore &gt; 9

               -  Aortic annulus diameter &gt; 21mm to &lt; 27mm by TEE

               -  The subject or the subject's legal representative has been informed of the nature
                  of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent.

               -  The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all
                  required post-procedure follow-up visits.

               -  The subject, after formal consults by a cardiologist and two cardiovascular
                  surgeons agreed that medical factors precluding operation, based on a conclusion
                  that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeded the
                  probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically the probability of death or
                  serious, irreversible morbidity exceeded 50%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be selected in accordance with the investigating centers standard operating
        procedures for TAVI subject selection and treatment. The following TAVI exclusion criteria

             aortic regurgitation &gt; 3+)

          -  Pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in an position, prosthetic ring, or severe
             (greater than 3+) mitral insufficiency
