    <textblock>
      The Validation of a Digital Diet Method project is very innovative because it links three
      methods to address the gap in measuring food intake of HS preschool children. Data collection
      is based on EMA theory; participant burden is low, and the Food Image App decreases
      participant and staff burden even further. Data management and analysis are semi-automated
      and relies on advanced computer algorithms. A strength of this approach is its
      semi-automation, which allows us to leverage the strengths of human operators and computer
      automation.

      The goal of the proposed research is to modify the Remote Food Photography Method (RFPM) for
      use with preschoolers. Primary caregivers (the majority will be mothers) and HS assistants
      will use a Smartphone to capture 24-hour images of HS children's food selection and plate
      waste. The RFPM, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). and the Food Photography ApplicationÂ©
      will be used to estimate the energy and nutrient intake of preschoolers. The accuracy of the
      RFPM will be examined by determining the energy and nutrient intake (collectively referred to
      as food intake [FI]) to established methods: 1) actual gram (g) weights of laboratory-based
      test meals and 2) doubly labeled water (DLW) in a natural environment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>This experiment will compare energy intake (EI) calculated using the test method (Remote Food Photography Method or RFPM) against energy intake calculated using weight measures (actual weighing of all food/beverages consumed).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Bland-Altman method was used to measure the agreement between digital photography estimated weight and actual weight. This method uses a two step process that evaluates the accuracy (validity) of a &quot;new&quot; measurement technique compared to and existing &quot;gold standard&quot;, which was the actual weights of foods.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Same statistical analysis methods used for the Primary Outcome Measure will be applied. Additionally, the Bland-Altman technique will be used to assess the degree of agreement between the two methods.</description>
