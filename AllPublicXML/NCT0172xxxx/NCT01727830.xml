      Aim of this in vitro trial is to assess the effect on blood coagulation after 60 % dilution
      with different colloids (HES 130/0.42, Gelatin and Gelatin balanced) and investigate
      reversibility by replacement of fibrinogen (FBG), factor XIII (F XIII), and the combination
      of FBG and FXIII.

      In blood of 12 volunteers the following measurements are performed at baseline and 60%
      dilution with HES 130/0.42, Gelatin or Gelatin balanced: Blood gas analyses, coagulation
      factor concentrations (F II,F VII,F VIII,F XIII), impedance aggregometry and rotational
      thrombelastometry (ROTEM®). Then FBG, F XIII and a combination of both was added, in
      concentrations corresponding to 6 g FBG and 1250 IU F XIII in adults. ROTEM® measurements and
      determination of factor concentrations are again performed.
