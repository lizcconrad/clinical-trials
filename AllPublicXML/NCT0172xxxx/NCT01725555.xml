    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, crossover, open label, phase I study to assess the effect of food on
      the bioavailability of AXL1717 in advanced cancer patients.

      A single, oral dose of AXL1717 is to be administered to patients on each of two occasions
      that are 7-day apart, in random order: after an overnight fast (fasted treatment) and with a
      high-fat or moderate-fat breakfast (fed treatment).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be informed of the nature of the study and have provided written informed consent

          2. At least 18 years of age

          3. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid or hematological malignancy not
             amenable to standard treatment.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2 after optimization of
             analgesics

          5. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          6. Hematology values: blood leukocyte count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L, blood absolute neutrophil
             count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, blood platelet count ≥ 100 x109/L, hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L
             (transfusions are allowed)

          7. Clinical chemistry values: plasma total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of
             the &quot;normal&quot; range (ULN; i.e. reference), plasma AST or ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN (≤5 times if
             liver metastases have been documented) and plasma creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          8. 12-lead ECG with normal tracings; or changes that are not clinically significant and
             do not require medical intervention

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Ongoing infection or other major recent or ongoing disease that, according to the
             Investigator, poses an unacceptable risk to the patient

          2. Known primary or secondary central nervous system malignancy. (Patients with symptoms
             suggestive of possible CNS metastasis such as headache, dizziness or focal
             neurological deficits should undergo CT or MRI of the brain to rule out CNS
             metastasis. Patients who do not have CNS symptoms do not need a CT or MRI of the
             brain.)

          3. Grade 3 or higher constipation within the past 28 days or grade 2 constipation within
             the past 14 days before randomization. (Patients with grade 2 constipation within the
             past 14 days could be re-screened if constipation decreases to ≤ grade 1 with optimal
             management of constipation.)

          4. Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function, GI cancer or GI disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of AXL1717

          5. Coexisting uncontrolled medical condition, including active cardiac disease (such as
             unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, or New York Heart Association
             Class III/IV congestive heart failure), or significant dementia

          6. Hepatic impairment as indicated by abnormalities of transaminases and/or alkaline
             phosphatase (AST and/or ALT &gt; 1.5 × upper limit of normal concomitant with alkaline
             phosphatase &gt; 2.5 × upper limit of normal, ≤5 times if liver metastases have been
             documented)

          7. Major surgical procedure within 4 weeks prior to randomization

          8. Use of potent inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g. Fluconazole) from 3 weeks prior to first
             administration of investigational product

          9. Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) who do not consent to using acceptable
             methods of contraception (i.e. two of the following - oral contraception, barrier
             contraception, intrauterine device). For purposes of this study, WOCBP include any
             female who has experienced menarche, who has not undergone tubal ligation, and who is
             not postmenopausal. Post menopause is defined as: amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months
             without another cause.

         10. Women who are breast-feeding or have a positive pregnancy test at screening

         11. Current participation in any other investigational clinical trial or any
             administration of an investigational agent within 4 weeks of study drug administration
             or 10 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer. Patients with
             unresolved investigational treatment-related AEs may not participate.

         12. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to AXL1717

         13. Lack of suitability for participation in the trial, for any reason, as judged by the
             Investigator
