      in reducing Total Tic Severity in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Disorder is a neuropsychiatric condition that is characterized by the appearance
      of tics that can be simple or complex in nature. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,
      non-rhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization. There are a very limited number of
      medications approved for the treatment of Tourette's Disorder. The goal of the current trial
      is to obtain efficacy, safety, and tolerability data in a controlled condition of a
      Once-daily aripiprazole formulation in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder. The
      trial has an 8-week long double-blind treatment period after a pretreatment
      (screening/washout phase), and the subjects will be followed up for 1 month after the last
      treatment. The Once-daily tablet formulation that will be evaluated in this trial represents
      a daily dosage regimen that is intended to be administered to children and adolescents.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to measure current (time frame of the past 1 week) tic severity. This scale consists of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms, and an impairment ranking. Ratings are made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics each, including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. Summation of these 10 scores (ie, 0-50) provides a TTS that was the primary outcome measure in this trial. The YGTSS ranking of impairment score rated on a 50-point scale anchored from 0 (no impairment) to 50 (severe impairment) to assess impairment experienced in areas of self-esteem, family life, social acceptance, and school scores. This is a fully validated scale in adults and has become a standard instrument for the evaluation of the severity of TD in children.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Tourette's Syndrome (CGI-TS) Score at Week 8.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>To assess CGI-TS severity, the rater or physician answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; However, the evaluation of illness was limited to manifestations of TD only. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients. The change score was obtained from CGI-TS improvement scale assessment: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Week 8) in Total YGTSS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS consists of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms (on a scale of 0 to 5 for 5 different dimensions, including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference) of motor and vocal tics, and an impairment ranking. The Total YGTSS score is the summation of the severity scores of motor and vocal tics and also the ranking of impairment (range of 0 to 100). A missing value of a YGTSS item scale could result in a missing Total YGTSS score. A reduction in Total YGTSS score from baseline represents an improvement in symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint (Week 8) in CGI-TS Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-TS Severity scale (range 0-7) is a single-item rating score, with higher scores representing greater severity or less improvement. A response of 0 (not assessed) is considered and handled as missing data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response is defined as &gt; 25% improvement from baseline to Week 8 in YGTSS TTS or a CGI-TS Change score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved] at Week 8. Response will be considered as missing only if both YGTSS TTS and CGI-TS change score are missing. As long as one of them is non-missing, response outcome will be determined based on the non-missing score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Discontinuation Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment discontinuation rate will be calculated as the number of discontinued participants (ie, those who were withdrawn from the trial without completing the Week 8 visit) over the number of all randomized participants.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in children and adolescents (aged 7-17 years) with Tourette's disorder (TD). 171 participants were screened, of which 133 were randomized to treatment.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The trial consisted of a pretreatment phase and a treatment phase. Pretreatment phase consisted of a screening and washout (when applicable) period. This was followed by an 8-week treatment phase starting with the baseline visit (Day 0). Particpants were randomized 1:1:1 to aripiprazole high dose, aripiprazole low dose or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) Total Tic Score (TTS).</title>
        <description>The YGTSS is a semi-structured clinical interview designed to measure current (time frame of the past 1 week) tic severity. This scale consists of a tic inventory, with 5 separate rating scales to rate the severity of symptoms, and an impairment ranking. Ratings are made along 5 different dimensions on a scale of 0 to 5 for motor and vocal tics each, including number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. Summation of these 10 scores (ie, 0-50) provides a TTS that was the primary outcome measure in this trial. The YGTSS ranking of impairment score rated on a 50-point scale anchored from 0 (no impairment) to 50 (severe impairment) to assess impairment experienced in areas of self-esteem, family life, social acceptance, and school scores. This is a fully validated scale in adults and has become a standard instrument for the evaluation of the severity of TD in children.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Tourette's Syndrome (CGI-TS) Score at Week 8.</title>
        <description>To assess CGI-TS severity, the rater or physician answered the following question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?” However, the evaluation of illness was limited to manifestations of TD only. Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill patients. The change score was obtained from CGI-TS improvement scale assessment: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>

The Total YGTSS score is the summation of the severity scores of motor and vocal tics and also the ranking of impairment (range of 0 to 100). A missing value of a YGTSS item scale could result in a missing Total YGTSS score. A reduction in Total YGTSS score from baseline represents an improvement in symptoms.</description>
