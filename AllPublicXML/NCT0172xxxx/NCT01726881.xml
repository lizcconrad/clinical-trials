  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with a Spinal Cord Injury can develop chronic pain within months of the injury. Up to
      80% of the patients will develop chronic pain called &quot;central pain&quot; and describe the pain as:
      burning, stabbing, or &quot;like electricity.&quot; Central pain mechanism is unknown and therefore
      treatment is currently not effective.

      It is hypothesized that chronic pain is associated with impaired function of the systems
      regulating pain, however, this hypothesis has not been tested among Spinal Cord Injury
      patients. Presence of such a connection, between the regulating system dysfunction and
      central pain, will help both predicting the risk of central pain and develop a treatment.

      The current research objective is to make several sensory measurements which will measure the
      functioning mechanisms of regulation and control of the pain. These measurements are accepted
      throughout the world and are based on psychophysical assessment of patients. these
      Measurements are designed to assess whether Spinal Cord Injury chronic central pain patients
      demonstrate impairment in the regulation of pain. Finding such a link between central pain
      and impaired regulation could shed light on the mechanism of central pain. In addition, these
      measurements are designed to assess whether fresh spinal cord injury patients that have not
      yet developed central pain demonstrate impairment in the regulation of pain immediately after
      the injury. By repeated assessments of pain regulation capabilities, which will be made to
      fresh Spinal Cord Injury patients during the first months of injury, and comparing the
      results of these measurements between those who will develop center pain and those who will
      not, we could identify indicators for predicting the risk of central pain. Another goal of
      the study is to investigate the efficacy of central pain treatment, using a TENS, when the
      parameters of the TENS treatment will be built according to the level of functioning of the
      regulating systems of the individual.
