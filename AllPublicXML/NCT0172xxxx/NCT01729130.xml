  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical measures of adipose tissue mass (BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) do
      not adequately explain the inter-individual and ethnic heterogeneity in diabetes. . There is
      a need to identify novel/universal markers of risk for diabetes (DM) and cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). These biomarkers also can become additional outcome measures for an
      intervention such as pancreatic/kidney transplant. If biological markers show an improvement
      with an intervention before anthropometric changes occur, intermediate outcomes can be an
      encouraging finding for practitioners. This study will focus on the central question of
      &quot;adipose tissue dysfunction&quot; as mediator of metabolic complications of positive energy
      balance, independent of body fat content and distribution. This study will address the
      question of effect of hyperglycemia on adipose tissue function independent of body fat mass.
      This project will take advantage of unique expertise of our investigators to perform detailed
      metabolic studies in patients with diabetes who undergo pancreatic/kidney transplant. The
      results of the proposed study will provide support to the novel approach of identifying
      adipose tissue dysfunction, rather than obesity and fat distribution, as predictor of
      diabetes and CVD across all ethnic groups, age and gender. We will obtain necessary
      preliminary data for future grant submissions to support our central hypothesis and develop
      stronger interactions within and outside The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) with
      clinical investigators in the area of DM and its complications.

        Patients that have End Stage Renal Disease and who will be receiving an isolated kidney
        transplant. This control group will account for effects of immuno-suppression and for
        potential metabolic changes induced by the kidney transplant on adipose tissue function.
