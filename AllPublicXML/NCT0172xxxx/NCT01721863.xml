  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia. The proposed patholophysiological mechanisms
      of AF include abnormal electrical conduction in atrium and sympathovagal imbalance with
      increased vagal tone. Patients with AF have poor exercise capacity that may contribute to
      decreased atrial effective refractory period, and decreased cardiac output and heart rate
      reserve, and may result in poor quality of life. Poor endothelial function had been noted in
      patients with AF, associated with increased risks of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular
      disease. Exercise training has been noted to improve exercise capacity and quality of life in
      patients with AF only in some studies. Endothelial function can be improved by exercise
      training in patients with cardiovascular disease, but no report in patients with AF. Evidence
      of exercise training is still needed in patients with AF. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate the effect of exercise training on

        1. endothelial function

        2. heart rate variability

        3. exercise capacity

        4. quality of life.

      A randomized controlled study was implemented to examine :(1) the effect of interval aerobic
      exercise training combined with resistance training on endothelial function, heart rate
      variability (HRV), exercise capacity, and quality of life (QoL); (2) the influential factors
      related to exercise capacity, and the relationship between exercise capacity and quality of
      life in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation (AF).
