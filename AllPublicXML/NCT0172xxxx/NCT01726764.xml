    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to examine the difference of the pharmacokinetics of metformin with
      and without a 3 weeks pretreatment of St John's Wort. Furthermore secondary objectives
      include changes in GLP-1, C-peptide, serum-insulin and plasma-glucose during an oral glucose
      tolerance test, changes in OCT1 mRNA in plasma and changes in leptin and lipid-profile
      following this possible interaction.
