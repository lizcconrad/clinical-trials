      The investigators aimed in this study to investigate the effects of 4 weeks robot-assisted
      locomotor training on motor recovery of lower extremities and walking ability compared with
      the conventional gait training in subacute post-stroke non-ambulatory hemiplegic patients.

      72 first-ever stroke patients who could not walk independently (FAC &lt; 2), and suffered within
      6 months were enrolled and randomly assigned into 2 groups. The subjects with congestive
      heart failure, malignancies, cardiopulmonary dysfunctions, and who could not walk
      independently before stroke attack were excluded.

      Two groups received 30 minutes conventional gait training including Neurodevelopmental
      Treatment (NDT) basically. The robotic assisted locomotor training group received additional
      robotic-assisted gait therapy for 30minutes with Lokomat® (Hocoma, Zurich, Switzerland) daily
      for 4 weeks, and the conventional gait training group received additional daily conventional
      gait training with NDT for the same periods. The independent walking ability(FAC ≥ 3),
      Functional Ambulation Category (FAC), Motricity index (MI), Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA),
      Modified Barthel Index (MBI), Medical Research Council (MRC) for each lower extremity muscles
      were assessed before, during (2weeks) and after training. And the independent walking ability
      were followed until 3 months.
