      Primary Objective:

      The primary aim of the study is:

      1.To identify and validate a panel of molecular and cytogenetic biomarkers able to predict
      Durable Complete Response (DCR) after chemotherapy and trastuzumab in patients with
      HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary Objective:

      The secondary aims of the study are:

        1. To perform a comprehensive exploration of the molecular and cytogenetic characteristics
           of DCR patients to identify any possible correlation between the tumour's biological and
           cytogenetic characteristics and the degree of clinical response to trastuzumab;

        2. To produce data in preparation for further translational studies on HER2-positive breast
           cancer.

      Type of Study: Translational

      This is a pilot retrospective laboratory-based cohort study.

      Eligible patients will be identified at each one of the participating institutions by a
      systematic cross-matching of the datasets of Medical Oncology, Pathology and Pharmacy
      Departments.

      Patient Population:

      Cohort 1: TNM stage II-IV breast cancer patients with highly trastuzumab-sensitive tumours.

      Cohort 2: (Control group) TNM stage II-IV breast cancer patients with trastuzumab-refractory
      disease.

        Study population will consist of two separate cohorts of patients with HER2-positive breast
        cancer that will be analysed based on their responsiveness to trastuzumab-containing
        chemotherapy. Cohort 1 will include patients with TNM stage II-IV breast cancer with highly
        trastuzumab-sensitive tumours. Results of laboratory analyses from Cohort 1 will be matched
        with those from Cohort 2 (Control group) that includes patients at the same TNM clinical
        stages but with trastuzumab-refractory disease.

        Inclusion criteria for Cohort 1:

          1. Histologically proven AJCC TNM stage II-IV invasive breast cancer

          2. HER2-positivity defined as score 3+ on IHC and/or with HER2/neu amplification on FISH
             test (HER2/CEP17 ratio &gt;2.0 on PathVysion test)

          3. Evidence of complete response (CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria lasting for at
             least 36 months (for stage IV patients only) following a first-line chemotherapy and
             trastuzumab

          4. Pathological Complete Response (pCR) following a neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) and
             trastuzumab (for stage II-III patients only). pCR is defined as no evidence of
             residual invasive carcinoma in the breast (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is allowed)
             AND in all the examined lymph nodes (micro-metastases and isolated tumour cells are
             not allowed).

          5. At least one FFPE archived tissue sample from the primary tumour and/or a metastatic
             site(s) available for laboratory analyses

          6. Adequate follow up information

        Inclusion criteria for Cohort 2:

          1. Histologically proven AJCC TNM stage II-IV invasive breast cancer

          2. HER2-positivity defined as score 3+ on IHC and/or with HER2/neu amplification on FISH
             test (HER2/CEP17 ratio&gt;2.0 on PathVysion test)

          3. Progression of disease according to RECIST 1.1 while receiving trastuzumab (in
             association with chemotherapy or as single agent as maintenance therapy) or within 6
             months from last dose of trastuzumab (for stage IV patients only)

          4. Residual invasive tumour in the breast larger than 2cm and /or at least one micro- or
             macro-metastasis in the axillary lymph nodes following pre-operative
             trastuzumab-containing chemotherapy (for stage II-III patients only)

          5. At least one FFPE archived tissue sample from the primary tumour and/or a metastatic
             site(s) available for laboratory analyses

          6. Adequate follow up information

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Any deviation from the above mentioned Inclusion criteria
