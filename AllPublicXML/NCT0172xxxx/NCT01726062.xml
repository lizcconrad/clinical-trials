    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, parallel group design will be used to test whether a Secondhand
      Smoke Exposure program initiated in the hospital and completed in the home using motivational
      interviewing plus motivational incentives (MI+) is more effective than Conventional Care (CC)
      with Neonatal Incentives Care Unit Infants' parents.
