      This study has two arms, Euiiyin-tang and placebo group. Inclusion of 80 patient each arm.
      They will be screened at first visit. At the baseline, that is the second visit, they will be
      evaluated each outcomes including weight, waist circumference, lipid profile (total
      cholesterol, triglyceride), CRP (C-reactive protein), visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat
      area using abdominal computed tomography (CT), questionnaires of QoL (Quality of Life) and
      eating attitudes, etc. The Euiiyin-tang will provide to the patients from the baseline, it
      contains 4 weeks of serving. After 4 weeks, the visit 3, the evaluation procedure will be
      repeated except lipid profile, CRP, abdominal CT. Another Euiiyin-tang of 4 weeks will be
      given to the patient. The visit 4, 4 weeks after the visit 3, the same procedure will be
      repeated. The visit 5, 12 weeks after from the baseline, the patient will be evaluated
      including weight, waist circumference, lipid profile, CRP, visceral fat area and subcutaneous
      fat area using abdominal computed tomography, questionnaires of QoL and eating attitudes,
      etc.
