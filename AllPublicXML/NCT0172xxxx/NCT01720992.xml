      Background: Shamshuipo District has the highest proportion of low income families, and a
      relatively large percentage of single parents, elderly, new immigrants among all districts in
      Hong Kong (Census and Statistics Department, 2011). In addition to provide these families
      substantial support, a campaign to enhance their family well-being is needed.

      Aim: This project is conducted to enhance their family relationship as well as family
      happiness, health and harmony (3Hs) among families in the Shamshuipo District, through a
      community-based intervention programme combined with a planning tool (booklet).

      Methods: This project adopts a cluster-randomized controlled design, with the application of
      positive psychology concepts as a theoretical framework. A community-based participatory
      (CBP) approach, which is an effective way to engage public health researchers and community
      members (NGOs, other major stakeholders, and participants), will be used. Both quantitative
      and qualitative methods will be used in the evaluation of major outcomes (participants'
      family relationship and 3Hs) at different time points throughout the project. Process
      evaluation will be performed to evaluate the process of each component of the project.

      Procedure: This project will be conducted in three phases.

      Phase 1 includes planning, implementation, and evaluation of a training programme for social
      workers from the 30 participating NGOs. The social workers will be equipped with the
      knowledge and skills of the application of positive psychology as well as logic model. This
      phase also includes the launching event to arouse public awareness of the project.

      Phase 2 includes designing, delivering, and evaluating 30 community-based intervention
      programmes. A planning tool (designed as a booklet) will be distributed to participants of
      the intervention group in the form of 'homework assignment' immediate after the intervention
      programme; whereas participants of the control group will receive the booklet upon the
      completion of the three months follow-up questionnaire assessment. This phase also contains
      focus group interviews among participants to collect their experiences, feelings and changes
      in families after attending the intervention programme. Focus groups among social workers
      will be conducted afterwards to explore their barriers and facilitators in programme
      implementation; as well as their personal and/or collective growth in conducting the project.
      In-depth interview among community stakeholders will be held to explore the social impact of
      the CBPR project, and collect their suggestions for future implementation.

      Phase 3 is a dissimilation phase that the &quot;Positive Family Education Booklet&quot; and &quot;Positive
      Family Practice Manual&quot; will be released. A practice wisdom forum for social workers and
      other major stakeholders will also be organized to share their experiences in conducting the
      community-based programmes.

      Primary hypothesis: Families participated in a community-based programme and received a
      toolkit (intervention group) have higher scores in their family relationship and family 3Hs
      than families who participated in a community-based programme only (control group).

      Secondary hypotheses: (1) Participants' attitudes towards and intention of practising the
      suggested behaviours will be increased immediately after their participation in the
      community-based intervention programme; (2) Participants' attitudes towards, their intention,
      as well as frequency of practising the suggested behaviours will remain higher at 6 weeks and
      3 months after the intervention compared to the corresponding figures of pre-intervention
      (baseline); (3) Participants' scores of family relationship and 3Hs will be significantly
      higher at 6 weeks and 3 months after their participation in the intervention.

    <textblock>
      Shamshuipo District consists of 5.3% of the population in Hong Kong; and ranks the fourth
      most densely populated district in 2010 (Social Welfare, 2011). The proportion of single
      parents, elderly, newly immigrated mainland persons, ethnic minorities, comprehensive social
      security assistance recipients in this district are relatively high; whereas the median of
      monthly domestic household income is the lowest among all districts in Hong Kong (Census and
      Statistics Department, 2011). It is essential to provide substantial support for families
      with low income and under privileged condition. Apart from this, encouraging positive
      thinking among family members may be an effective way to enhance family well-being in this
      district (Linley et al., 2011). A considerable amount of evidence has demonstrated benefits
      of applying positive psychology principles on family well-being. Previous studies including
      the 'nun study' (Danner et al., 2001) and Harvard study (Peterson et al., 1988) suggested
      that people who are happy tend to be healthier and live longer.

      'The Shamshuipo Well-being Movement' ('The Movement'), which adopted a positive psychology
      approach (Seligman &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) to promote four character strengths
      ('gratitude', 'hope', 'resilience', and 'open-mindedness') among their residents to enhance
      family well-being had been initiated in the past two years, under the coordination of Social
      Welfare Department (SWD) of Shamshuipo District. Building on the success of 'The Movement', a
      community-based initiative named 'Enhancing Family Well-Being Project' is collaboratively
      developed between SWD of Shamshuipo District and the School of Public Health, the University
      of Hong Kong. This project will focus on training and mobilizing local community
      stakeholders, and developing, delivering, and evaluating community-based programmes for
      families in Shamshuipo District, to arouse public interests towards an enhanced family
      relationship, as well as family health, happiness, and harmony (3Hs). The collaboration is
      based on evidence that community-based participatory (CBP) approach provides an effective way
      to engage public health researchers and community members (NGOs, other major stakeholders,
      and participants) in an active partnership to take action, in order to promote social change
      (White et al., 2004; Macaulay, 2007; Berge et al., 2009; Shalowitz et al., 2009).

      This project also adopts a cluster-randomized controlled design to evaluate the effectiveness
      of a theory-based action planning toolkit . The toolkit will be distributed to the
      participants for their use at home, like a 'homework assignment', for the purpose of
      enhancing their intention and practices of the suggested behaviours. The development of the
      booklet was guided by the theory of The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), which suggests
      that one's intention can be foster by knowing that the new behaviour has positive outcomes as
      opposed to the negative outcomes that accompany the current behaviour; and planning (action
      planning and coping planning) serves as an operative mediator between intentions and
      behaviour (Schwarzer, 2008). Previous evidence has shown the applicability of the HAPA in
      changing people's health behaviours, e.g., physical exercise, breast self-examination, seat
      belt use, dietary behaviours, and dental flossing; and its generalizability has been
      confirmed by Schwarzer (2008).

      In summary, this is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project using a
      cluster-randomized controlled design; and applying positive psychology concepts to develop
      community-based interventions with a theory-based toolkit, in an attempt to enhance family
      relationship and family 3 Hs in the Shamshuipo District.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a community-based intervention
      programme (with the application of positive psychology) with a theory-based toolkit among
      families in the Shamshuipo District, on enhancing their family relationship and family 3Hs.

      The specific objectives of the study include:

        1. To investigate the effectiveness of the community-based intervention programmes in
           improving family relationship and family 3Hs;

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based toolkit in increasing participants'
           intention and practices of the suggested behaviours; as well as enhancing their family
           relationship;

        3. To evaluate the various components of the project in terms of its structure, process,
           and outcomes;

        4. To engage and build capacity of the social workers through training programmes on the
           application of positive psychology and logic model;

        5. To explore the social impact of the CBPR in collaboration with various NGOs and
           stakeholders in the Shamshuipo District.
