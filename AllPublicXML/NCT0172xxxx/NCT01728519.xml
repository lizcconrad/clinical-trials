  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Birch pollen allergic patients are currently treated by subcutaneous injections of pollen
      extracts either by standard allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) or ultra-rush
      immunotherapy. Such treatment is prone to side effects and has to be performed in a hospital
      environment due to the risk of potential anaphylactic reactions. The aim of this study is to
      test the new product AllerT expected to show widely reduced side effects. AllerT will be
      injected via two different routes, subcutaneous versus intradermal. The primary endpoint of
      the study is the local and systemic safety of repeated injections of the product. Since
      AllerT should provide patients with a pre-seasonal treatment to decrease seasonal allergic
      symptoms, we will also evaluate the potential efficacy of the approach using a nasal
      provocation test (NPT) with birch pollen

      In addition to the initial protocol, post hoc evaluations were conducted, after new ethics
      committee reviews, to assess quality of life during the birch pollen season following the
      trial (April 2009) and to obtain blood samples for evaluation of immunology markers IgG4 and
      IgE after the season 2010 (July 2010) and after the season 2012 (July 2012),
