  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and find out what effects, good and/or bad,
      dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor) alone or dabrafenib when given in combination with gamma knife
      radiosurgery has on participants with a certain type of skin cancer (BRAFV600E melanoma) and
      brain metastases (tumors that have spread to the brain).

    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase II clinical trial. All patients will receive continuous dosing of
      dabrafenib at 150 mg PO bid and trametinib beginning at Cycle 3 Day 1, at a starting dose of
      2 mg PO once daily until progression of disease, withdrawal of consent, or the development of
      intolerable treatment associated toxicity. An MRI will be performed after 28 days of
      treatment with dabrafenib. Patients who have unequivocal disease progression in the brain at
      that time will be deemed to have disease progression at 4 weeks. Patients with a complete
      response of all lesions in the brain will continue to receive dabrafenib and trametinib on
      study but they will not undergo SRS. For patients with stable disease or partial tumor
      responses in the brain, Gamma Knife radiosurgery will be performed on treatment cycle 2, day
      1 (+/- 3 days, 28 day cycle) using a stereotactic head frame and MRI imaging in accordance
      with FDA-approved procedures.

      Melanoma brain metastases

      Cutaneous melanoma is the most aggressive form of all skin cancers. Worldwide, it is
      currently expected that approximately 132,000 people will be diagnosed with melanoma each
      year and some 37,000 people are expected to die of the disease annually. Brain metastases are
      a major source of morbidity and mortality in patients with metastatic melanoma and
      approximately 3 out of 4 develop brain metastases at some point in their disease course. The
      prognosis of metastatic melanoma with CNS involvement is dismal1, and, until recently, no
      medical therapy demonstrated clear evidence of activity against melanoma in the brain. For
      patients with fewer than 4 brain lesions and no brain lesion greater than 3 cm in diameter,
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is the standard-of-care. By delivering highly focal
      irradiation to melanoma brain metastases, SRS confers local control rates exceeding 80% for
      lesions under 2 cm in diameter. However, SRS does not treat micrometastatic disease in the
      brain, and new brain metastases develop in approximately half of patients treated.

      Furthermore, local control rates are lower for lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter. As a
      result, the median overall survival for melanoma patient treated with SRS is only 7 months.

      BRAF mutant melanoma

      The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is a critical proliferation pathway in many human cancers. This
      pathway can be constitutively activated by alterations in specific proteins, including BRAF,
      which phosphorylates MEK1 and MEK2 on two regulatory serine residues. Approximately 90% of
      all identified BRAF mutations that occur in human result in a V600 E/D/Kamino acid
      substitution. This mutation appears to mimic regulatory phophorylation and increases BRAF
      activity approximately 10-fold compared to wild type. BRAF mutations have been identified at
      a high frequency in specific cancers, including approximately 40-60% of melanoma. The
      frequency of this activating mutation and the pathway addiction to which it leads makes
      mutated BRAF an extremely attractive target.

             additional lesions at time of Gamma Knife radiosurgery MRI scan will not be considered
             exclusionary if the detection of these lesions are thought to be due solely to
             difference in imaging techniques (i. e. higher sensitivity, double gadolinium contrast
             MRI utilized at the time of Gamma Knife radiosurgery compared with conventional MRI
             imaging).

             regarding which subjects will be enrolled prior to the initiation of treatment on
             trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Neurological symptoms from melanoma brain metastases

          2. Patients may not have received prior therapy with dabrafenib, vemurafenib, or other

             neurosurgery at least 14 days after neurosurgery as long as they meet all other study
             qualifications.

          4. Pregnant or lactating women. The effects of dabrafenib on the developing human fetus
             are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to
             use a highly effective method of contraception including: hormonal contraceptives
             (oral contraceptives, Nuvaring, Depo Provera) an intrauterine device, true abstinence
             or two barrier methods of birth control including condoms with cervical cap or
             diaphragm. Baseline pregnancy testing is required for all women of child-bearing
             potential. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol who are sexually active with
             women of child bearing potential must also agree to use adequate contraception prior
             to and during the study as outlined above, and for, and four months after completion

          7. Complete resection of a single brain metastasis or of all known brain metastases.
             Patients who have undergone subtotal resection are eligible providing residual disease
             is &lt; 2.0 cm in maximum diameter.

          8. Patients with metastases within 2 mm of the optic nerve or optic chiasm so that some
             portion of the optic nerve or chiasm would receive &gt; 9 Gy from radiosurgery.

          9. Patients with metastases in the brainstem.

         10. Contraindication to MRI (such as cardiac pacemaker).

         11. The following medications or non-drug therapies are prohibited:

               -  Other anti-cancer therapy while on treatment in this study.

                  (Pgp) or Bcrp transporter because they may alter dabrafenib concentrations. The
                  list may be modified based on emerging data. These include but are not limited to
                  those listed in Appendix 2; consider therapeutic substitutions for these
                  medications.

         12. Unresolved toxicity of National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events, version 4.0. Grade 2 or higher from previous anti-cancer therapy,

         13. Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that will interfere
             significantly with the absorption of drugs. If clarification is needed as to whether a
             condition will significantly affect absorption of drugs, contact the Study Chair for
             permission to enroll the subject. Study Chair has final decision regarding which
             subjects will be enrolled.

             regurgitation/stenosis can be entered on study with approval from the GSK medical
             monitor); or history of known cardiac arrhythmias.
