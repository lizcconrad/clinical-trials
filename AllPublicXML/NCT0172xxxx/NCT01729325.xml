  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soldiers in conflict or former conflict regions deployed in peace-keeping missions were and
      are often exposed to multiple traumatic events and situations in which they are forced to
      engage in violent behavior. The Preventive Narrative Exposure Therapy (Pre-NET) aims to
      reinforce resilience thereby reducing the risk of developing or aggravating PTSD or other
      mental disorders as a result of traumatic experiences. The effective prevention of mental
      disorders as a result of war deployment is expected to facilitate reintegration in civil life
      after deployment and reduce uncontrolled violence.

    <description>During Pre-NET the client, with the assistance of the therapist, constructs a chronological narrative of his whole life with a focus on exposure to traumatic stress. Empathic understanding, active listening, congruency and unconditional positive regard are key components of the therapist's behavior who asks in detail for emotions, cognitions, sensory information, and physiological reactions, linking them to an autobiographical context. During two sessions a chronological overview of the whole life with a focus on traumatic events is developed and the most important traumatic experiences are processed.</description>
