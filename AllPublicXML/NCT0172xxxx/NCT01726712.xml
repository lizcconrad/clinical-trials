    <textblock>
      The Network Supported Engagement in Care (NSEC) intervention is a brief, theory based and
      culturally sensitive intervention designed to capitalize on organic yet underutilized social
      support networks in the lives of young black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) who have been
      recently diagnosed with HIV. The intervention has been developed with input from clients and
      their support network members, case managers, social workers, HIV primary care providers and
      pastoral care at a Federally Qualified Health Center. The goal of the intervention is to
      improve retention in care for newly diagnosed YBMSM who present for their first HIV primary
      care clinic appointment.
