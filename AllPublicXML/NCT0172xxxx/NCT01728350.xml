    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3 mos f/u, 6 mos f/u</time_frame>
    <description>A five-item, self-rated scale of global life satisfaction. Items are rated on 1-7 point Likert scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervetion, 3mos f/u, 6mos f/u</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-item self-rated scale of perceived success in areas such as social relationships, self-esteem, and purpose in life. Items are rated on 1-7 point Likert scale.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline on Brief Symptom Inventory-18(BSI-18)at post-intervention and at follow-up points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3mos f/u, 6mos f/u</time_frame>
    <description>An 18-item, self-rated measure of psychological distress. Items are rated on 0-4 Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE)at post intervention and at follow-up points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3mos f/u, 6mos f/u</time_frame>
    <description>A 12-item, self-rated scale that evaluates positive and negative emotions. It produces a score of positive and negative feelings that can be combined to create a balance score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on Purpose in Life subscale of RyffScale of Psychological Well-Being at post-intervention and at follow-up points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3mos f/u, 6mos f/u</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of nine, self-rated items regarding individual goals, sense of direction, and meaning. This subscale was selected because volunteering has been shown to have a positive relationship with a sense of purpose in life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on Hair Cortisol test at post-intervention and at follow-up points.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3mos f/u, 6 mos f/u</time_frame>
    <description>This is considered an Exploratory Measure. Cortisol has been explored as a potential biomarker of well-being; lower levels of salivary cortisol have been associated with higher levels of psychological well-being. Recently, reliable and valid methods for measuring long-term cortisol secretion through hair samples have been developed and are being used as biomarkers of chronic stress in multiple medical conditions.</description>
