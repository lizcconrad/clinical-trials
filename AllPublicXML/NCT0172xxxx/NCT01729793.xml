      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of Digestive Enzyme Blend #2, a
      digestive enzyme dietary supplement product, on markers indicative of inflammation after a
      meal. The markers will be assessed by blood levels tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),
      interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein
      (hsCRP) at times 0, 45 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-meal. A full complete blood count
      (CBC)and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) blood test will also be conducted at times 0
      and 4 hours post-meal. In addition, a questionaire on Gastrointestinal symptoms will be
      administered 4 hours post-meal. The study hypothesis is that some or all of these potential
      markers of inflammation will increase following the meal, and the amount of increase in
      inflammation will be attenuated when a digestive enzyme is consumed with the meal compared to
      the placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that levels of gastric discomfort as assessed by
      the questionaire will be reduced with the digestive enzyme compared to the placebo.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of Digestive Enzyme Blend #2, a
      digestive enzyme dietary supplement product, on markers indicative of inflammation after a
      meal. The study design is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over type
      study. The markers will be assessed by blood levels TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and hsCRP at
      times 0, 45 minutes, 2 hours and 4 hours post-meal. A full blood CBC panel and an ESR blood
      test will also be conducted at times 0 and 4 hours post-meal. In addition, a questionaire on
      Gastrointestinal symptoms will be administered 4 hours post-meal. The study hypothesis is
      that some or all of these potential markers of inflammation will increase following the meal,
      and the amount of increase in inflammation will be attenuated when a digestive enzyme is
      consumed with the meal compared to the placebo. In addition, it is hypothesized that levels
      of gastric discomfort as assessed by the questionaire will be reduced with the digestive
      enzyme compared to the placebo.
