  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of electro-acupuncture for severe
      functional constipation compared with sham acupuncture, used as placebo; the secondary
      purpose is to evaluate the safety and post-treatment effect of electro-acupuncture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic functional constipation is a common disease. To date there has not specific therapy
      on chronic functional constipation. Systematic reviews indicate that acupuncture is probably
      effective for the disease, but the evidence is limited. Recently, we have finished a
      multi-center clinical trial of individualized deep electro-acupuncture (EA) for chronic
      functional constipation (n=460, Registration ID: NCT00508482) which preliminarily showed EA
      was effective.

      This multi-center large-sample randomized controlled clinical trial of acupuncture for severe
      functional constipation is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of EA.

      This project is conducted by Chinese experts, supported by the Chinese Government. The
      research result is expected to provide high quality evidence of EA for chronic functional
      constipation.

Huatuo disposable needles and EA apparatus, type SDZ-V(Suzhou Medical Appliance, China) were used. Participants in the EA group received EA at bilateral acupoints of ST25, SP14,ST37. With participant supine, 0.30 mm×50 mm or 0.35mm×75mm needles were inserted into ST25 and SP14 slowly and vertically, without manipulation, for approximately 30 to 70mm until they pierced the muscle layer of the abdominal wall. EA apparatus were attached transversely to bilateral ST25 and SP14, lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 10/50Hz and current intensity of 0.1 to 1 mA depending on participant's comfort level. 0.30mm × 40mm needles were inserted into ST37 vertically for about 30mm and three small, equal manipulations of twirling, lifting, and thrusting were performed to reach acupuncture de qi.</description>

Participants in SA group received needling at bilateral non-acupoints of sham ST25, sham SP14, sham ST37. Specifically, 0.30 mm × 25 mm needles were used to penetrate the skin vertically at approximately 3 to 5 mm without any manipulation. Similar to EA group, paired alligator clips from the specially constructed EA apparatus were attached to the needle holders. When switched on, the EA apparatus in the SA group had the same working power indicator and sound but no actual current output. Additionally, 0.30 mm × 25 mm needles were inserted into sham ST37 vertically at about 3 - 5 mm without manipulation.</description>

            <description>Sham Electroacupuncture (SA) group consisted of 28 sessions of 30 minutes’ duration, each administered over a period of 8 weeks (five sessions in each of the first 2 weeks, followed by 3 sessions per week in the remaining 6 weeks). Huatuo disposable needles and EA apparatus, type SDZ-V (Suzhou Medical Appliance, China) were used. Participants in SA group received needling at bilateral non-acupoints of sham ST25, sham SP14, sham ST37. Specifically, 0.30 mm × 25 mm needles were used to penetrate the skin vertically at approximately 3 to 5 mm without any manipulation. Similar to EA group, paired alligator clips from the specially constructed EA apparatus were attached to the needle holders. When switched on, the EA apparatus in the SA group had the same working power indicator and sound but no actual current output. Additionally, 0.30 mm × 25 mm needles were inserted into sham ST37 vertically at about 3 - 5 mm without manipulation.</description>

            <description>Electroacupuncture (EA) group consisted of 28 sessions of 30 minutes’ duration, each administered over a period of 8 weeks. Huatuo disposable needles and EA apparatus, type SDZ-V(Suzhou Medical Appliance, China) were used. Participants in the EA group received EA at bilateral acupoints of ST25, SP14,ST37. With participant supine, 0.30 mm×50 mm or 0.35mm×75mm needles were inserted into ST25 and SP14 slowly and vertically, without manipulation, for approximately 30 to 70mm until they pierced the muscle layer of the abdominal wall. EA apparatus were attached transversely to bilateral ST25 and SP14, lasted for 30 minutes with a dilatational wave of 10/50Hz and current intensity of 0.1 to 1 mA depending on participant's comfort level. 0.30mm × 40mm needles were inserted into ST37 vertically for about 30mm and three small, equal manipulations of twirling, lifting, and thrusting were performed to reach acupuncture de qi.</description>

            <description>Sham Electroacupuncture (SA) group consisted of 28 sessions of 30 minutes’ duration, each administered over a period of 8 weeks (five sessions in each of the first 2 weeks, followed by 3 sessions per week in the remaining 6 weeks). Huatuo disposable needles and EA apparatus, type SDZ-V (Suzhou Medical Appliance, China) were used. Participants in SA group received needling at bilateral non-acupoints of sham ST25, sham SP14, sham ST37. Specifically, 0.30 mm × 25 mm needles were used to penetrate the skin vertically at approximately 3 to 5 mm without any manipulation. Similar to EA group, paired alligator clips from the specially constructed EA apparatus were attached to the needle holders. When switched on, the EA apparatus in the SA group had the same working power indicator and sound but no actual current output. Additionally, 0.30 mm × 25 mm needles were inserted into sham ST37 vertically at about 3 - 5 mm without manipulation.</description>
