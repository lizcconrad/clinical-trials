  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with unprotected left main disease (ULMD), angioplasty is emerging as an
      alternative technique. The investigators aimed to determine the rate of major cardiovascular
      events in patients treated by angioplasty for ULMD in a &quot;real world&quot; registry.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend coronary artery bypass graft surgery as the &quot;gold standard&quot;
      treatment in patients with unprotected left main disease. However, patients with ULMD and
      high surgical risk score or favourable anatomy are still referred for angioplasty. Recently,
      several studies and registries comparing surgery and percutaneous intervention with drug
      eluting stents report similar results regarding cardiovascular death and myocardial
      infarction in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease including unprotected left
      main disease.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate major cardiovascular events in a &quot;real world&quot; registry.

    <description>Major cardiovascular events (MACCE)were measured after 1 year follow-up. MACCE included all-cause of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularizations. Non-Q-wave myocardial infarction was defined using universal definition with troponin I. Stent thrombosis was defined according to the Academic Research Consortium definition as definite, probable, or possible and as early or late after the index procedure. Repeat revascularization was composed of any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical bypass.</description>
