  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      French epidemiological data have shown a heterogeneous distribution of the risk of mortality
      from prostate cancer according to region. The main objective is to describe the distribution
      of prostate cancer stages when first line hormonal therapy is introduced (overall and by
      region).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically demonstrated prostatic adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patients never previously treated with hormonal therapy for prostate cancer.

          -  Patients eligible for hormonal therapy after initial consultation (alone or in
             combination with curative treatment).

          -  Patients agreeing to the collection of personal health data for the purposes of the
             study.

          -  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostatic cancer tumours or a biological
             recurrence after curative treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients participating in a clinical study involving prostate cancer at the time of
             inclusion in the investigation.

          -  Patients having received or currently receiving hormonal treatment for prostate cancer
             (surgical castration or other hormonal manipulation, including GnRH receptor
             antagonists, antiandrogens, oestrogens, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors).
