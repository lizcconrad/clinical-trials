      The objective of this investigation is to determine whether participants will have a change
      in mood based on the portion size of foods served. The specific aims of the study are:

        1. Determine the effect of increasing portion sizes on mood.

        2. Determine the effect of decreasing portion sizes on mood.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total grams of snack food consumed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The snack food consumed in this investigation is Lays Potato Chips (Frito-Lay Inc., Plano, TX). Participants will be provided 50 or 100 grams of this food at all sessions depending on which condition they are randomized into. The chips provided to participants in each condition will be measured in grams to the tenth decimal point on an electronic food scale (Denver Instrument Co., Arvada, CO) before and after the session. The weight of the container will also be measured. Total grams of chips consumed during the session will be determined by subtracting pre- and post-consumption weight of the chips.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total grams of fruit consumed</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The fruit used in this investigation is red grapes. Participants will be provided 100 grams or 150 grams of red grapes depending on which of the four groups they are participating in. Each individual will go through all four conditions in this investigation. Fruit provided to participants in each condition will be measured in grams to the tenth decimal point on an electronic food scale (Denver Instrument Co., Arvada, CO) before and after the session. The weight of the container will also be measured. Total grams of fruit consumed during the session will be determined by subtracting pre- and post-consumption weight of fruit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Relative Reinforcing Value of Foods</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the investigation, participants will play a computer game which assesses the relative reinforcing value of the foods used. The number of points earned for each of the foods will be used to assess the relative reinforcing value of the foods.</description>
