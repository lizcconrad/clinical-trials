      The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care
      compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for adolescents in Denmark in need of out-of-home
      placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is difficult to treat adolescents with serious behaviour problems. Although the number of
      adolescents displaying serious behaviour problems is limited, they are a serious concern to
      the society e.g. because of their frequent violent behaviour, criminal activities and lack of
      school adherence.

      Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC)is a community-based treatment program developed
      in USA. The goal of the MTFC program is to decrease problem behaviour and to increase
      developmentally appropriate normative and prosocial behavior in adolescents who are in need
      of out-of-home placement.

      This study will evaluate the effect of MTFC on adolescents in out-of-home placement.

      Participants will be recruited by caseworkers in the municipalities and randomly assigned to
      either MTFC or TAU. TAU will consist of other kinds of out-of-home placements. Outcomes will
      be assessed for all participants at baseline, post-treatment (12 months), and 12 months
      post-treatment. Parents and youth will be asked to fill out questionnaires on e.g. behaviour,
      parental stress, sense of cohesion, general health.
