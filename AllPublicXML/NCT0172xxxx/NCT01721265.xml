  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All subjects in this study have previously been in an Idenix HCV study and received study
      drug for 3 consecutive days. Subjects who had received placebo in a previous Idenix study
      will not be enrolled in this study.

      In this study, researchers will try to find answers to these questions:

        -  How much (if any) hepatitis C virus is in your blood after stopping your Idenix study
           drug?

        -  Is your hepatitis C virus possibly resistant to treatment with the Idenix study drug or
           similar drugs?

  <detailed_description>

      The data obtained from this study will be used to further understand the long-term efficacy
      of Idenix DAAs used to treat HCV infection and to further understand HCV resistance to Idenix
      DAAs.

    <measure>Durability of Sustained viral response [SVR]</measure>

    <description>To evaluate the durability of sustained virological response (SVR). Plasma HCV RNA levels will be monitored over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinetics of resistant variants</measure>
    <time_frame>every 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To describe the kinetics of resistant variants to Idenix direct acting antivirals (DAAs) by HCV RNA sequencing. The presence of each identified resistant variant in the viral population will be descriptively evaluated until the viral population consists entirely of wild-type virus or over a period of 3 years, whichever comes first.</description>
