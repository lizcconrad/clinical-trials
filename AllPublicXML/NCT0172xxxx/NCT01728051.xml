  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of CS-PHP-melphalan has been evaluated in a phase 3 trial conducted
      in the same patient population as well as using the same melphalan dosing as proposed in this
      study. This expanded access protocol will provide an experimental alternative treatment
      option for both physicians and patients until the Delcath CS-PHP System receives marketing
      approval.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven ocular/cutaneous melanoma with liver-dominant unresectable
             metastatic disease, defined as limited extra-hepatic disease and hepatic involvement
             which would, in the Investigator's opinion, result in morbidity and eventual
             mortality. Limited extra-hepatic disease considered acceptable includes:

               -  up to 4 pulmonary nodules, each &lt;1cm in diameter

                  beam radiation therapy

               -  a solitary metastasis to any site that can be resected with limited morbidity or
                  controlled with radiation

          2. ≥1 measurable hepatic lesion per RECIST 1.1

          4. Received an investigational product ≤30 days prior to the 1st CS-PHP-melphalan
             infusion
