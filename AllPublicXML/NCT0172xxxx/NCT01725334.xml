  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a complex, challenging, and heterogeneous psychiatric condition, affecting
      up to 0.5% of the population and responsible for nearly 2% of all Canadian health-care
      expenditure. Much of the morbidity of the illness is related to its negative symptoms,
      including amotivation, asociality, anhedonia and flattened emotional affect, which lead to
      functional impairment and withdrawal from social and occupational domains. In contrast to
      positive symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, there are currently no effective
      treatments for negative symptoms, which experts recognize are largely responsible for the
      long-term disability of a majority of patients with schizophrenia. Advances in neuroscience
      have allowed a greater understanding of negative symptoms and have identified key structures
      and circuits believed to generate and maintain them. Here, we propose the application of a
      targeted therapy, deep brain stimulation, to alter the circuits driving negative symptoms.

      Schizophrenia is a public health challenge with a large proportion of patients suffering from
      predominantly negative symptoms and who derive no benefit from currently available
      treatments. Advances in neuroscience have allowed a greater understanding of negative
      symptoms and have identified key structures and circuits believed to generate and maintain
      them. Here, we propose the application of a targeted therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS),
      to alter the circuits driving negative symptoms. This is a phase I, non-blinded,
      non-randomized, pilot trial, exploring the safety and efficacy of DBS in patients with
      refractory negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Patients must be identified and approached by
      their treating psychiatrist regarding this study. Patients will be given several
      opportunities to review the study details with the investigators before the informed consent
      is presented. All eligible patients will also be reviewed by an independent non-study
      affiliated psychiatrist for confirmation of their diagnosis and assessment of study
      eligibility. The total study duration will be one year for each patient, who will undergo
      regular imaging and psychiatric analyses.

    <intervention_name>Deep Brain Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure involving the implantation of a thin flexible wire called a lead. This device sends mild electric signals to an area of the brain. This study targets two different areas that we believe may be responsible for negative symptoms observed in patients with schizophrenia. There are two stages to DBS: (1) Insertion of the DBS electrodes (2) The connection of these electrodes to a battery under the collarbone.</description>
