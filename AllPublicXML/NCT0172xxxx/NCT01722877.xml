  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that stenting of the femoropopliteal artery in the lower leg leads
      to improved overall results compared to balloon angioplasty alone. However, scar tissue
      development can occur within the stent, a process called restenosis. Treatment of these
      in-stent restenotic lesions has a high procedural success rate but recurrence of scar tissue
      is frequently seen. Several methods have been proposed to treat in-stent restenosis in the
      lower leg arteries but mixed results have been noted. In this study we hypothesize that
      simultaneous tissue excision and aspiration using the JetStream Navitus device (Medrad) can
      lead to a high rate of acute procedural success with low intraprocedural complications and an
      acceptable recurrence rate of restenosis at 6-month follow-up.
