      To explore molecular biomarkers and/or gene expression signatures that predict response to
      bevacizumab given in combination with paclitaxel as first line therapy in HER2 negative
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      This is a prospective, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, single-center, phase II trial. A total
      of 30 patients will be included during a period of 2 years.

      The study will be initiated with a non-randomized, feasibility stage including ten patients
      who will be treated with bevacizumab and paclitaxel, in order to determine the safety of
      metastatic tumor biopsies during therapy with bevacizumab.

      In the second phase, patients will be randomized (1:1) between two treatment arms: A.
      Bevacizumab + paclitaxel and B. Paclitaxel

    <description>The safety objective of the study is to assess whether carrying out metastatic tissue biopsies during treatment with bevacizumab is safe. For this reason, the study will be initiated with a feasibility phase of 10 patients and will be continued to the randomized phase only if the study specific procedures prove to be safe.</description>
