    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to the date of objectively documented progression, date of death, or the date of subsequent therapy; approx. 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR=number of participants with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized participants and reported as a percentage. BOR was defined as the best response designation, as determined by the independent review committee (IRC), recorded between the date of randomization and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy (including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery), whichever occurred first. For participants without documented progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations contributed to the BOR assessment. CR=Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm. PR=At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Analysis made at Primary Endpoint; Study On-going</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Overall Survival (OS) at Primary Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of death; up to 37 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival (OS) was defined the time between the date of randomization to the date of death. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive. OS was followed continuously while participants were on the study drug and every 3 months via in-person or phone contact after participants discontinued the study drug. This interim OS analysis was performed on all randomized subjects when at least 169 events had been observed. Analysis made at Primary Endpoint; Study On-going.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Median Months of Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Independent Radiology Review Committee (IRC/IRRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death; up to 37 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS=time from randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever first. Participants who (1) died without a reported progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death, (2) did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment, (3) did not have any on study tumor assessments and did not die were censored on the date they were randomized, and (4) started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy (including tumor-directed radiotherapy or surgery) without a prior reported progression were censored at the last evaluable tumor assessment prior to or upon initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Per RECIST 1.1, progression is &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (includes baseline sum if smallest on study). The sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of &gt;= 5 mm. Analysis made at Primary Endpoint; Study On-going</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Baseline PD-L1 Expression</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to the date of objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent therapy; approx. 16 months</time_frame>
    <description>PD-L1 expression evaluated as a predictive biomarker for ORR by analyzing the interaction between PD-L1 expression and treatment arms. Randomized participants with an Indeterminate PD-L1 result per the verified assay were categorized as &quot;Subjects without Tumor Tissue Samples&quot;. ORR=number of participants with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by number of randomized participants and reported as a percentage. Analysis made at Primary Endpoint; Study On-going.</description>

    <measure>Median Overall Survival (OS) Time in Months by Baseline PD-L1 Expression</measure>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Global Health Status Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day1) to second Follow-Up; up to 37 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, which is the most commonly used quality-of-life instrument in oncology trials. The instrument's 30 items were divided among 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health/quality of life scale. Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 were transformed to a 0-100 metric. Higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status=better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL. Lower scores for symptom scales=better HRQoL; a decline from baseline for symptom scales =improvement in symptoms compared to baseline. A 10 point difference on a 100 point scale between treatments was considered clinically significant.</description>

        <description>ORR=number of participants with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized participants and reported as a percentage.

For participants without documented progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations contributed to the BOR assessment. CR=Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Global Health Status Scores</title>
        <description>Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed with the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, which is the most commonly used quality-of-life instrument in oncology trials. The instrument’s 30 items were divided among 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and a global health/quality of life scale. Raw scores for the EORTC QLQ-C30 were transformed to a 0-100 metric. Higher scores for all functional scales and Global Health Status=better HRQoL; an increase from baseline indicates improvement in HRQoL. Lower scores for symptom scales=better HRQoL; a decline from baseline for symptom scales =improvement in symptoms compared to baseline. A 10 point difference on a 100 point scale between treatments was considered clinically significant.</description>
