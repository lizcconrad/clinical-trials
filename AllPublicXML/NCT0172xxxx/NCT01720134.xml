  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple pregnancy (MP) is associated with significant fetomaternal complications and a high
      cost. The multiple pregnancy rate per cycle (MPR) of treatment with Assisted Reproductive
      Technology (ART) is 25 % or higher even in countries where ART is reimbursed, much higher
      than the 1% after natural conception, related to the number of embryos transferred, and
      preventable by single embryo transfer (SET). In Belgium, the laboratory costs for 6 fresh ART
      cycles are reimbursed for female patients younger than 43 with a Belgian insurance number
      since July 2003, but only if a limited number of embryos is transferred depending on female
      age and cycle rank. Although this policy has resulted in a significant reduction in the MPR
      after ART in Belgium from 24 % to 13 %, available data are cycle based and it is unknown if
      the cumulative delivery rate per patient is affected by this legislation. The aim of this
      study was to test the hypothesis that Belgian ART legislation since 2003, coupling lab
      reimbursement to restriced embryo transfer policy, has resulted in a reduced CDR when
      compared to the situation before 2003.
