  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether automated telephony may be used for daily
      assessments of paroled offenders, and whether a brief intervention based on these daily
      assessments may result in a more positive development compared to daily assessments only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study whether automated telephony could be used in paroled offenders to perform daily
      assessment of variables associated with recidivism in crime and to study the effects of a
      brief intervention based on these assessments during 30 days following probation.
