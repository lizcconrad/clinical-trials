  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the world leading cause of acquired brain injury. Literature
      suggests a pivotal role for attentional functioning in neurocognitive and behavioural
      consequences of paediatric TBI. Limitations of traditional neuropsychological measures of
      attentional functioning have interfered with identification of the effect of paediatric TBI
      on attentional networks so far. Moreover, the associations between attentional networks,
      learning abilities, academic performance and behavioural and emotional problems following
      paediatric TBI are yet to be explored.

      Background:

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the world leading cause of disability in children (Winslade,
      1998), causing deficits in motor function, neurocognition and adaptive behaviour (Anderson,
      2001). Literature shows that age at injury is inversely related to the magnitude of deficits
      following TBI, highlighting the vulnerability of children for the effects of TBI.

      The neurocognitive consequences of paediatric TBI have primarily been characterized by
      impairments in speed of information processing, attentional functioning and learning
      (Babikian &amp; Asarnow, 2009; Catroppa &amp; Anderson, 2009), interfering with typical
      neurocognitive development. We aim at elucidating the effects of TBI on neurocognitive
      function and investigate the relations between neurocognitive deficits, academic achievement
      and emotional and behavioural function, in order to improve our understanding of the
      post-injury functioning of children that have suffered TBI.

      Methods:

      Patients with TBI will be compared to a control group consisting of orthopedically injured
      patients. Orthopaedic control (OC) groups offer a better comparison to TBI patients than
      typically developing children by controlling for TBI risk factors related to neurocognition
      (e.g. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, socioeconomic status), hospitalisation and
      the type of injuries other than brain injuries.

      Measures:

      Child's Orientation and Amnesia Test, Attention Network Test, Probabilistic Learning Test,
      Child Behaviour Checklist, Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaire, Experimental
      Neurocognitive Test developed at the VU University and Pupil Monitoring System.
