  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term safety and preliminary efficacy of
      intramedullary transplantation of HuCNS-SC cells in subjects with thoracic spinal cord
      trauma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a multi-year observational study following the completion of the
      open-label, single dose Phase I/II study involving transplantation of allogeneic HuCNS-SC
      cells into 12 subjects with thoracic spinal cord injury.

      Subjects will be monitored at routine intervals for safety and preliminary efficacy for four
      years. The LTFU study will commence following the one year post-transplantation termination
      visit of the Phase I/II investigation.
