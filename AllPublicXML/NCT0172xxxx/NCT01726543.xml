Primary efficacy outcome-proportion of the population that achieves an IOP of &gt;5 and ≤ 21 mmHg, irrespective of glaucoma medication use.
Complete success is defined as achieving the target IOP without use of medications.
A qualified success is defined as achieving the target IOP with either no change in medications or a reduction in medication as compared to that used preoperatively.</description>

    <description>As soon as the two scleral flaps (deep and superficial -similar to deep sclerectomy) are dissected, the phacoemulsification is performed and a artificial lense is implanted. After excision of the deep flap the descemets window and ostia of Schlemm canal are created, the microcatheter is placed in the canal and is advanced 12 clock hours within the canal. Surgeon observes the location of beacon tip through sclera and injects the Healon GV. When the catheterisation of the canal is done, the distal tip is exposed and a 10-0 propylene suture is tied to the distal tip. Then the microcatheter is withdrawn and suture is pulled into the canal. As it appears at the other ostium of canal the microcatheter it separated from the suture. A loop is created, encircling the inner wall of Schlemm canal. Then suture loop is tightened to distend the trabecular meshwork inward, placing the tissues in tension, the locking nods are added. The superficial flap is sutured watertight to prevent bleb formation.</description>

    <description>A fornix-based conjunctival ﬂap is dissected superiorly, and the sclera is exposed. A 5 x 5 mm scleral ﬂap is dissected anteriorly into clear cornea using a No. 69 Beaver blade. Then the phacoemulsification procedure is performed and a artificial lense is implanted. Afterwards second deep scleral ﬂap is dissected and excised leaving only a thin layer of deep sclera over the choroid. Anteriorly, the dissection is made down to remove Schlemm's canal and juxtacanalicular trabeculum. Excision of the corneal stroma is performed more anteriorly down to Descemet's membrane. This allows aqueous humor to percolate through the thin trabecular-Descemet's membrane. The superficial scleral ﬂap is then closed with two 10-0 monofilament nylon sutures.The conjunctiva is sutured down over the limbus with one interrupted 10-0 monofilament nylon suture at each corner.</description>
