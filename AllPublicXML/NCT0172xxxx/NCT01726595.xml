  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that doctors and nurses can undergo a brief period of training
      and then use ultrasound to accurately measure blood flow in a forearm artery after a brief
      period when this flow is interrupted with a blood pressure cuff, a measurement the
      investigators call reactive hyperemia. Reactive hyperemia indicates whether the small blood
      vessels in the body are healthy -- lower reactive hyperemia indicates worse small blood
      vessel function. When measured by experienced ultrasound experts, low reactive hyperemia
      strongly predicts death in critically ill patients with infection (severe sepsis).

      The investigators are conducting this study to determine if doctors and nurses, without
      specific pre-existing expertise in ultrasound, can be trained to make these measurements
      accurately. If so, the investigators will prove that these measurements can be applied
      reliably in real-world practice.

      The investigators also hypothesize that reactive hyperemia predict the outcomes of illness
      not just in patients with severe infection, but in other critically ill patients as well.

      Finally, the investigators hypothesize that reduced blood flow after blood pressure cuff
      occlusion is linked with other abnormalities of blood, previously identified in critically
      ill patients. For example, red blood cells from patients with severe sepsis have been shown
      to be stiffer than normal, so they are less able to flow along the small blood vessel
      passages of the body. Red blood cells become stiffer when there is a certain type of stress
      in the body known as &quot;oxidative stress.&quot;

      If the investigators show that low reactive hyperemia, stiff red blood cells, and oxidative
      stress are linked, the investigators hope to develop new treatments that reduce oxidative
      stress, reduce the stiffness of red blood cells, and in turn improve reactive hyperemia.
      Improvements in reactive hyperemia indicate improvements in small blood vessel function.
      Better small blood vessel function means better delivery of oxygen throughout the body. The
      investigators believe that this will improve outcomes for critically ill patients.

      Blood and urine specimens will be obtained within 48 hours of diagnosis of severe sepsis or
      severe non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Subsequent blood and urine
      samples will be obtained 3-5 days after the first set of samples, within 48 hours of ICU
      discharge, and within 48 hours of hospital discharge. Samples will analyzed immediately or
      stored at -80 degrees celsius until use.
