  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to examine the efficacy of an
      educational decision support tool for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who continue to have
      active disease despite use of traditional disease modifying drugs. The study will take place
      at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, PA. Eligible subjects will be identified by the
      treating physician and those providing consent will be randomized to usual care versus use of
      the decision support tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data suggest that undertreatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients may be in part due to
      inadequate decision support when they face whether or not to start biologic therapy. No
      proven way exists to inform or support RA patients who are candidates for biologic therapy.
      Communicating information about biologic medication is particularly challenging because of
      the sheer number of risks to disclose, the difficulty explaining the risks of extremely rare
      adverse events (AEs), and the tendency for people to discount (or underweight) future
      benefits.

      Dr Liana Fraenkel at Yale University is the Primary Investigator and developer of this
      theory-based high quality decision support tool to effectively inform RA patients who are
      candidates for biologics. Dr. Eric Newman will be Principal Investigator for the project
      which will be conducted at Geisinger Medical Center. All subjects enrolled will complete a
      baseline survey and then will be randomized to use of the decision support tool or to usual
      care. Those randomized to usual care will be offered the opportunity to access the tool once
      enrollment is closed and all follow-up visits have been completed.

      Outcomes will be assessed at two and six weeks after the baseline visit by the Geisinger
      Telephone Survey and Interviewing Facility. This facility is equipped with 12 computers and
      runs two shifts a day. The Survey Unit uses a state-of-the-art Windows based Computer
      Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system to administer surveys and collect research data.
      The group holds 12 interviewer licenses for the CATI system. Trained and experienced
      interviewers are available to make the calls from 9 am to 9 pm Monday through Friday and from
      10 am to 2 pm on Saturdays.

    <measure>The Proportion of Subjects Who Are Classified as Having Made an Informed Value Concordant Choice at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We classified subjects as having made an informed choice to escalate care if they answered at least 75% of the knowledge questions correctly and had low decisional conflict as defined by a score of 25 or lower on the combined subjective knowledge and values clarity subscales.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-physician Communication</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-physician communication will be measured using the COMRADE (Combined Outcome Measure for Risk communication And treatment Decision making Effectiveness): a 20-item scale composed of two subscales which address the quality of risk communication (process measure) and the quality of the decision making process (outcome measure). Items are measured on a 5-point agree scales. The COMRADE is a includes two sub-scales (each composed of 10 items): one for risk communication (a process measure) and a second for confidence in decision (an outcome measure). Subscales are summed to generate a total score (Range 20-100). Higher scores reflect poorer outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Use of Biologics</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Use of biologics: The number of patients received a prescription for a new biologic by eight weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To Test Screening and Recruitment Procedures</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To test screening and recruitment procedures we will measure the number of eligible patients, the number of patients excluded by each exclusion criterion, the number of patients referred by rheumatologists each week, and the proportion of patients who agree to participate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To Test Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To test uptake and adherence to the intervention we will measure the proportion of patients randomized to the intervention who access the tool, complete the Best Worse Scaling exercise, print a handout, and use the handout during a follow-up visit with their rheumatologist (for subjects having a second visit within eight weeks). Note, subjects without access to a printer will have the opportunity to do so in the office.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability to Physicians</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability to physicians will be assessed using four items coded on 5-point Frequency scales (1= None of the time and 5= All of the time) administered by the research assistant once all patient follow-up interviews have been completed:
Did the tool make it easier to talk about treatment with your patients?
Did the tool increase the amount of time you spent discussing therapy with your patients?
Did the tool decrease the amount of time you spent discussing therapy with your patients?
Did the tool improve the quality of informed consent for patients initiating biologics?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To Test Adherence to the Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The session management system will record the time spent on each module visited within the tool to assess adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge will be measured using the 20 True/False statements developed for the initial pre-post test study. The number of correct responses are summed to yield a knowledge score (possible range= 0-20). The item order was determined using a random-numbers generator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Willingness</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Willingness: Patients' propensity towards biologics will be measured using the choice predisposition scale (65): This item is coded on a 11-point scale anchored by &quot;Not willing at all&quot; and &quot;Extremely willing&quot; with &quot;Unsure&quot; at the midpoint (65). Higher scores reflect greater willingness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Perceived Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived knowledge and value clarity will be measured using two subscales from the well-validated Decisional Conflict Scale (66). Each subscale is composed of 3 items measured on 5-point agree scales. Scores are rescaled to range from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect greater conflict (poorer outcomes).</description>

        <description>Patient-physician communication will be measured using the COMRADE (Combined Outcome Measure for Risk communication And treatment Decision making Effectiveness): a 20-item scale composed of two subscales which address the quality of risk communication (process measure) and the quality of the decision making process (outcome measure). Items are measured on a 5-point agree scales. The COMRADE is a includes two sub-scales (each composed of 10 items): one for risk communication (a process measure) and a second for confidence in decision (an outcome measure). Subscales are summed to generate a total score (Range 20-100). Higher scores reflect poorer outcomes.</description>
