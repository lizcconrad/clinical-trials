      The purpose of this research study is to identify reasons that cause an all-ceramic bridge to
      fracture which include the thickness of the bridge material, the type of bridge material and
      the bite force of the person. This all-ceramic bridge will be compared to a metal-ceramic
      bridge. The investigators are conducting this study so we can make bridges which can
      withstand forces in the mouth which tend to break them.

      The overall objective of this research is to analyze how properties of ceramic materials and
      different forces in the mouth interact with each other to affect the longevity of these
      bridges. These include fracture toughness, elastic modulus of ceramic layers and supporting
      substrate, core thickness, connector height, wear, loading orientation, and maximum clenching
      force.

      The long-range goal of the proposed research is to formulate design survival statistics that
      will aid the dental community in fabricating properly designed prostheses that can
      predictably survive the oral environment.

      Patients who qualify for this study will be randomized (as in chanced with the flip of a
      coin) into two groups. The first group is a metal-ceramic group where patients will receive a
      bridge with a metal substructure underneath. The second group is an all-ceramic group where
      patients will receive a bridge which is made of hard ceramic material. All patients will
      receive two dental implants which will bond to bone for a period of 4-6 months. An impression
      or mold of the implants will then be made and a bridge will be fabricated based on the
      randomization of the patient. Patients will be asked to return at 6 months and yearly
      thereafter up to 5 years. During these recall appointments, photographs will be taken and
      impressions of the bridge and other teeth will be made. This will allow us to measure the
      amount of wear happening with the bridge and the other teeth. The investigators can also
      examine the amount of bone around the implants as well as the integrity of the bridge.
