  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized Sequential Parallel Design for Double-Blind
      Phase fixed dose, 4-month trial of folate plus B12 as add-on therapy in 200 Ethiopian
      subjects with schizophrenia with stable residual positive or negative symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Folate 2mg plus B12
      400mcg, as an adjunctive therapy in approximately 240 consecutive outpatients with
      schizophrenia from Amanuel Hospital, which is based at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia will be enrolled
      and screened for eligibility. The goal is to randomize and complete 200 subjects from the 240
      enrolled. A Sequential Parallel Design for Double-Blind Phase will be utilized. During the
      first phase of double-blind adjunctive treatment, eligible patients (n=200) are randomized to
      adjunctive treatment with either folate and vitamin B12 (n=60) or placebo (n=150), with a
      2:3:3 ratio for random assignment to the treatment sequences drug/drug (DD; n=70),
      placebo/placebo (PP; n=70), and placebo/drug (PD; n=75), while all continue to receive their
      antipsychotic agent for the entire duration of the study. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate during
      the first phase, 126 patients on placebo will complete the first 56-day phase, and 54
      patients on folate and vitamin B12 will complete the first 56-day phase.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, any subtype

          2. Male or female

          3. Age 18-65 years

          4. Treated with an antipsychotic for at least 6 months at a stable dose for at least 6
             weeks

          5. PANSS total score of at least 60, with at least a 3 (moderate) on one negative symptom
             item or on one positive symptom item.

          6. No acute medical problems; any chronic medical condition (e.g. hypertension)
             consistently treated and stable during the 1 month prior to participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide informed consent

          2. Serum B12 concentration less than 300mcg/L; Complete Blood Count (CBC) results
             consistent with megaloblastic anemia

          3. Serum creatinine concentration greater than 1.4

          4. Current use of folate or B12 supplementation

          5. Current use of any of the following medications: phenobarbital, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, valproic acid, fosphenytoin, primidone or pyrimethamine; antimalarial
             drugs

          6. Alcohol or other substance abuse within 3 months (nicotine allowed)

          7. Subjects with a history of clinically significant neurological, metabolic, hepatic,
             renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or urological
             disorders (e.g. unstable angina, decompensated congestive heart failure, Central
             Nervous System (CNS) infection or history of HIV seropositivity), which would pose a
             risk to the patient if they were to participate in the study or that might confound
             the results of the study. Active medical conditions that are minor or well controlled
             are not exclusionary if they do not affect risk to the patient or the study results.
             For example, the following are not exclusionary: a) stable and well- controlled
             hypertension; b) asthma (no serious attacks in the past year)

          8. Unstable psychiatric illness

          9. Seizure disorder

         10. Pregnancy or nursing
