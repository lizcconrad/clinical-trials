    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Unit-acquired weakness (ICU-AW) is a well-recognized, important and
      preventable sequelae of critical illness, affecting up to 60% of adult ICU patient. ICU-AW is
      associated with increased mortality and length of stay, and negatively impacts long-term
      functional outcomes and quality of life in affected patients and their caregivers. While
      delayed mobilization adversely affects clinical outcomes, early rehabilitation in the
      critically ill adult population is safe, feasible, cost effective, results in more ventilator
      free-days and better functional outcomes at hospital discharge. In contrast, there is a
      paucity of this research in pediatrics. Our research suggests that immobilization is common
      in critically ill children, and rehabilitation is delayed particularly in the sickest
      children who are arguably at highest risk of morbidity. It is unclear however, whether
      delayed rehabilitation leads to adverse outcomes in critically ill children, as has been
      demonstrated in adults. Our objectives of this study are to evaluate if immobilization and
      delayed rehabilitation negatively impacts short-term clinical outcomes and the time to
      functional recovery in critically ill children. The investigators hypothesize that the
      following factors may influence functional recovery and morbidity in critically ill children:

        -  Pre-morbid condition

        -  Age

        -  Time-to-initiation of acute rehabilitation

        -  Critical illness disease severity

      Overall Study objectives:

        1. To describe the functional recovery following prolonged immobility and delayed
           rehabilitation in critically ill children.

        2. To explore the predictors of impaired functional recovery following immobilization in
           critically ill children.

      Prior to conducting a definitive multi-centre study to answer our research questions and
      achieve our study objectives above, we will conduct a pilot study in order to demonstrate
      feasibility.

    <description>Functional Recovery will be measured by the following standardized, validate pediatric assessment tools of function, as defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF): 1) Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI); 2) Participation and Environment Measure - children and youth version (PEM-CY), and preschool version; 3) Pediatric Overall Performance Category score (POPC); 4) Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Score (PCPC)</description>

    <description>In an age-appropriate subgroup, the following measurements will be conducted:
Muscle Strength and aerobic fitness testing (age ≥ 5 years, and/or able to cognitively and physically comply with strength and fitness tests)
Measurement of muscle strength using BIODEX and hand grip strength, and assessment of lean mass (Bioelectrical impedance analysis)</description>

    <time_frame>Duration of Hospitalization, 3 and 6 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The most appropriate method of screening and diagnosing PCCU-acquired weakness has not been well established given the many challenges in ascertainment in this population. Hence, one of the objectives of this study is to determine whether manual muscle strength testing is a feasible and reliable method of screening for this important disorder in the critically ill pediatric population. Muscle strength will be quantified clinically using the (MRC) score by 2 independent assessors. For a subset of age appropriate (≥ 4 years), we will determine their hand-grip strength using a hand dynamometer or Martin Vigorimeter, depending on their age.</description>
