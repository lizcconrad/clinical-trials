    <textblock>
      The use of domiciliary non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in stable chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure has yielded
      variable effects on survival, quality of life and dyspnea. The investigators hypothesized
      that use of NPPV in stable COPD might result in improvement in quality of life and dyspnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with progressive decline in lung
      function with resultant chronic respiratory failure. This leads to significant rates of
      hospitalization, disability, and death. COPD is also associated with sleep disordered
      breathing and nocturnal hypoventilation, resulting in nocturnal and daytime hypoxemia and
      hypercapnia. These, in turn, can contribute to fatigue, dyspnea and impaired quality of life.
      Presence of hypercapnia is associated with a 33% 5-year survival. Nocturnal NPPV can
      theoretically rest overloaded respiratory muscles, prevent nocturnal hypoventilation, and
      reset central respiratory drive in patients with hypercapnia. The use of non-invasive
      positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in late stage COPD appears logical to change this
      inexorable course, to alleviate symptoms and to improve quality of life. While NPPV has a
      definite role in the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, its role in the
      management of late stage stable COPD is controversial. Multiple studies have shown no
      survival benefit for nocturnal NPPV in chronic hypercapnic stable COPD patients. The effects
      on quality of life and dyspnea scores in such patients have been inconsistent. The variable
      efficacy might have been due to late administration of the intervention in the course of
      disease, in the presence of advanced hypercapnic respiratory failure. We sought to assess the
      effect of applying NPPV on indices of health-related quality of life in patients with
      relative normocapnia. We hypothesized that patients with stable severe COPD have improved
      quality of life and reduced dyspnea with the use of NPPV.
