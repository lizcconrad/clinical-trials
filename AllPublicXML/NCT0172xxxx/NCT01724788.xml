      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the absolute bioavailability of furosemide 500 mg (Lasix® Special) oral
           formulation in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of furosemide 500 mg (Lasix® Special) oral
           formulation and 250 mg IV formulation

        -  To compare the pharmacodynamic characteristics of furosemide 500 mg (Lasix® Special)
           oral formulation and 250 mg IV formulation

             of drugs.

          -  Psychiatric or cognitive disturbance or illness, or recreational drug/alcohol use
             that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would affect patient safety and/or
             compliance.

          -  Treatment with the following inhibitors of secretion at the renal level:
             clarithromycin, erythromycin, itraconazole, cyclosporin, ketoconazole, quinidine, and
             verapamil, which cannot be discontinued during the course of the study.
