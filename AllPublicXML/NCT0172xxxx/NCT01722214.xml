  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blinded randomized multicenter placebo controlled trial to determine
      the effect of adalimumab on vascular inflammation (ascending aorta and carotides) in patients
      with moderate to severe psoriasis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis will be included in this multicenter,
      double-blind, placebo controlled study. Patients will be randomized (1:1) at Day 0 to receive
      either adalimumab or placebo. Adalimumab will be administered sub-cutaneously as described in
      the Canadian product monograph (80mg followed by 40mg at Week 1 and 40mg every other week).
      At Week 16, all patients will receive two injections of blinded study products. Patients
      randomized to the placebo group will receive two injections of adalimumab (2 x 40 mg) and
      patients randomized to adalimumab will receive two injections of placebo. As of Week 17,
      patients randomized to the placebo group will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week until
      Week 67. Patients randomized to the adalimumab group will continue to receive adalimumab 40mg
      every other week until Week 51.

      Efficacy will be assessed with 18-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET)
      scan and carotid MRI at baseline, Week 16 and Week 52 (or Week 68 for patients randomized to
      placebo).

      Safety will be assessed with physical examinations, vital signs, adverse events collection,
      routine laboratory examinations, pregnancy test, hepatitis B and C serology (screening),
      Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) or Quantiferon Gold (screening) and Chest X-Ray (CXR)
      (screening).
