    <textblock>
      Constraint-induced movement therapy (CI therapy) is a highly efficacious treatment for
      residual motor disability in chronic stroke. Its effectiveness is believed to be due, at
      least in part, to the therapy's ability to aid the brain in &quot;rewiring itself.&quot; For example,
      CI therapy produces increases in the amount of grey matter (the parts of the brain where
      neuron cell bodies are most closely clustered) in certain areas of the human brain (Gauthier
      et al., 2008). The cellular and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this increase
      in grey matter volume are not known, however. Thus, it is unclear how the therapy helps
      brains &quot;rewire&quot; themselves. This study aims to better understand the timecourse and
      cellular/molecular nature of brain changes during CI therapy. Because there is currently no
      way to directly measure cellular/molecular changes in the brain noninvasively, this study
      will infer what is happening on a microstructural level using new MRI techniques (three
      dimensional pictures of the brain). For example, by charting the timecourse of grey matter
      changes during CI therapy, and cross-comparing this to what is known about the timecourses of
      different cellular/molecular processes, the investigators can gain a greater understanding of
      what cellular processes may be responsible for increases in grey matter. The investigators
      will gain additional information about which cellular processes are important for
      rehabilitation-induced improvement by measuring larger-scale changes (e.g., amount of blood
      flow through different brain areas) that accompany cellular changes. The investigators are
      hopeful that by better understanding how CI therapy can change the brain, the effectiveness
      of rehabilitation can be improved upon. For example, insight into the mechanisms of
      rehabilitation-induced brain change may suggest particular drug targets to increase brain
      plasticity. This study will help us better understand how the brain repairs itself after
      injury.
