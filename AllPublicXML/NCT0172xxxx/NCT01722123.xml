    <textblock>
      Decision making capacity fatigues after repeated decisions similar to skeletal muscle. The
      result is decision fatigue, in which subsequent decisions are altered toward the status quo.
      Patients are at risk for decision fatigue yet it has not been studied. The Investigator
      proposes a randomized study in the outpatient setting in patients at high risk for needing to
      make complex decisions, in an effort to determine the impact of decision fatigue on
      participant self-control and subsequent choices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Just as skeletal muscle fatigues after repeated use, decision-making capacity fatigues when
      repeated choices are made. This phenomenon, in which people experience diminished
      concentration and willpower after repeated decision-making, is termed decision fatigue. (1)
      People experiencing decision fatigue are more likely to bias subsequent choices toward the
      status quo. By choosing the status quo, the decision-maker reserves the option to make an
      alternate choice at a later time, thereby preserving possibilities. Patients and their
      surrogates often make complex medical decisions for which they may have little experience.
      Although clearly at high risk, decision fatigue has not been studied this population. To
      elucidate these questions, we propose a four arm study of patients in a population at high
      risk for making complex decisions. Participants will be randomly assigned to varied levels of
      decision making effort to assess for the development of resultant decision fatigue and
      whether it alters subsequent decisions.

    <description>Measurement of score will be done at the conclusion of instrument completion. The Stroop test is a standard measure of self control that requires three tasks. The last task is the most difficult where the participant must suppress the urge to read the word which is the easier task and instead say the color it is printed in. Standard scoring is the number correct in the W trial minus the CW trials. This data will be collected immediately following completion.</description>

    <measure>Evidence of status quo bias</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Evidence of status quo bias as assessed by hypothetical decision to limit life sustaining therapy or to continue treatment. To assess for status quo bias, we will use the following technique: after the initial four hypothetical questions and Stroop testing, participants will be asked a hypothetical question about life sustaining therapy (LST). In the question, continuing life sustaining therapy will be counted as maintaining the status quo. This is based on current norms in American health care where life sustaining therapy is continued until a patient or surrogate specifically request otherwise.</description>

    <description>Patients will make decisions on 4 scenarios with physician advice, then complete the Stroop test and answer the hypothetical LST question. Within this arm, patients will receive two positive recommendations (i.e. to go ahead with the intervention) and two negative recommendations (i.e. to decline the intervention). These positive and negative recommendations will be randomly assigned upon study enrollment. With four hypothetical scenarios, there are six possible options for recommendation variations.</description>
