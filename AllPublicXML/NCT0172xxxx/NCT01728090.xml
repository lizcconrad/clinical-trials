      The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a hand-washing programme using hand
      sanitizer in the prevention of school absenteeism due to upper respiratory infections.
      Students in intervention classrooms used hand sanitizers at schools and a programme
      educational on hand hygiene. The investigators hypothesize that the use de hand sanitizers in
      elementary school will reduce absenteeism due to upper respiratory infections.

      School absenteeism due to respiratory infections is one of the greatest problems in schools.
      Its high incidence and easy transmission among pupils have a great impact requiring a vast
      number of medical visits, hospitalisations, use of antibiotic and antipyretic treatments,
      symptomatic medication, etc. besides being a cause for school absenteeism and time off work
      for parents. Hand- washing is the most important and effective measure to prevent the
      transmission of infections. The investigators evaluated the effectiveness of a hand-washing
      programme using hand sanitizer in the prevention of school absenteeism due to upper
      respiratory infections.

      A cluster randomised, controlled and open study of 2 cohorts of primary school children
      between the ages of 4 and 12, attending 5 Public Schools in a geographic area of the Almería
      province (Spain). This study was carried out throughout the 8 months of an academic year
      (October 2009 to May 2010). The experimental group washed their hands with soap and water,
      complemented with hand sanitizer, while the control group followed usual hand washing. The
      parents of both groups completed the survey on sociodemographic characteristics and questions
      about hand hygiene referred to when and how their children wash their hands Progenitors of
      children who were absent from school collected upper respiratory infections symptoms and
      handed in the completed form to the teacher. One Research assistant collected the absence
      sheets of the participating classes weekly, telephoned the parents of absent children to
      enquire about the cause of their absence, visited the classrooms and collaborated with the
      teachers in hand hygiene related activities.
