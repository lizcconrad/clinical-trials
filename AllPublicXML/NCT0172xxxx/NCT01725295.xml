    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a common cause of widespread musculoskeletal pain. The investigators have
      found that our patients seem to benefit from a soft tissue physical therapy called
      neurostructural integration therapy (NST). The purpose of this study was to compare NST to
      hydrotherapy which is already used to manage fibromyalgia symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Twenty female patients who met the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for
      the classification of FM were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly allocated to
      receive either hydrotherapy or NST. Patient evaluations were performed at baseline, six
      weeks, three months, and six months. Primary outcome measures included the SF-36 quality of
      life questionnaire, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Total Myalgic Score.
      Duration of morning stiffness and duration of weekly aerobic exercise as reported by the
      participants were secondary outcome measures. Statistics analysis was performed by standard
      parametric and non parametric methods.
