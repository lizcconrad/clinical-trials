    <textblock>
      This study will test if inhalation of Carbon Monoxide (CO) will increase the numbers of
      mitochondria in heart muscle. Mitochondria are the small components of muscle and other cells
      that convert fuel and oxygen to the easily usable forms of energy (ATP) that power all cell's
      activities. Adequate numbers of healthy mitochondria are essential to heart cell function.
      From animal and other studies we have reason to believe that breathing small amounts of CO
      will signal the body to increase the numbers of mitochondria in heart cells. We propose to
      test this theory in heart valve surgery patients by examining a small sample of heart tissue
      (from the right atrial appendage) that is routinely cut out during the preparation of the
      patient for cardio-pulmonary bypass and that would otherwise be discarded by the surgeon.
      Muscle samples from two groups of subjects will be compared. One group will breath CO and the
      other group will breath room air. If CO is effective, we should notice an increase in the
      numbers of mitochondria in the group that was exposed to CO compared to the group that
      breathed room air.

      PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE: Endogenously produced carbon monoxide (CO) is known to act as a
      physiologic signaling molecule to induce mitochondrial biogenesis. This study will test if
      low-level CO preconditioning induces myocardial biogenesis in humans and if clinical benefit
      is derived from it. STUDY ACTIVITIES AND POPULATION: The study is an interventional,
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial with a 2-week follow up period. Forty subjects
      will be recruited from the population of patients scheduled to undergo elective aortic valve
      replacement. For safety purposes patients with coronary disease will be excluded. Subjects
      meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomized to receive either air or air containing CO
      @ 200ppm as a one-hour inhalational treatment per day over the course of the three days
      immediately prior to their scheduled operation. Biochemical markers for mitochondrial
      biogenesis (blood and right atrial tissue) and clinical outcome parameters ( BUN/creatinine,
      and left ventricular function measured by 2D echo) will be measured in all patients pre and
      post-operatively. Right atrial tissue samples will be collected from tissue that is routinely
      excised during placement of venous cannulas for cardiopulmonary bypass. RISK/SAFETY &amp; DATA
      ANALYSIS: Risks will be those of CO inhalation and blood drawing. The 200ppm dose chosen is
      within OSHA work place exposure limits and has been used safely in human subjects previously.
      Data will be analyzed by comparing biogenetic marker levels and clinical parameters pre and
      post intervention and control to CO treatment group.
