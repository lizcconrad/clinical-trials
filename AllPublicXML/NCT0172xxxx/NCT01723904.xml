    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of Rotigotine add-on therapy with low
      doses of Pramipexole or Ropinirole in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD)
      who have insufficient response to L-dopa and low doses dopamine receptor agonists.

    <time_frame>Week 8 (Visit 8) of the 8 weeks Treatment Period (Titration and Maintenance Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI Item 4 was used to assess side effects. It ranges from 0 to 4 as follows: 0 = Side effects not assessable
= No side effects
= Side effects do not significantly interfere with subject's functioning
= Side effects significantly interfere with the subject's functioning
= Side effects outweigh therapeutic efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the Treatment Period in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (&quot;on&quot; State) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 8 (Visit 8) of the 8 weeks Treatment Period (Titration and Maintenance Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part III is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson´s disease. Each of the 27 sub-items in the UPDRS III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The total scores therefore ranges from 0 to 108.
A negative value in Change from Baseline to Week 8 indicates an improvement in motor functions from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of the Treatment Period in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (Average of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;Off&quot; State) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 8 (Visit 8) of the 8 weeks Treatment Period (Titration and Maintenance Period)</time_frame>
    <description>UPDRS Part II measures 'Activities in Daily Living'. The total score ranges from 0 (Best score possible) to 52 (Worst score possible).
UPDRS Part II total score (average of &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; state) is the average of UPDRS Part II total score (&quot;on&quot; state) and Part II total score (&quot;off&quot; state).
A negative value in Change from Baseline to Week 8 indicates an improvement in activities in daily living from Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 8 (Visit 8) of the 8 weeks Treatment Period (Titration and Maintenance Period)</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute time spent &quot;off&quot; is measured in hours per day. A negative value in Change from Baseline to Week 8 indicates that the time spent &quot;off&quot; decreased from Baseline and therefore indicates an improvement from Baseline.
Only subjects with time spent &quot;off&quot; at Baseline (subset of the Full Analysis Set (FAS)) are included in the analysis of this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Absolute time spent &quot;on&quot; without troublesome dyskinesia is measured in hours per day. A positive value in Change from Baseline to Week 8 indicates that the time spent &quot;on&quot; without troublesome dyskinesia increased from Baseline and therefore indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 8 (Visit 8) of the 8 weeks Treatment Period (Titration and Maintenance Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson´s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) is a questionnaire with 15 questions to assess sleep disturbance and nocturnal disability in Parkinson´s disease. The item- scores can range between 0= never and 4= very often. The PDSS score is a sum score of all 15 questions.
A negative value in Change from Baseline to Week 8 indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 8 (Visit 8) of the 8 weeks Treatment Period (Titration and Maintenance Period)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a questionnaire with 18 questions to assess sleep quality. The 18 questions are distributed to 7 elements with each element ranging from 0-3. The global score is the sum score of all 7 elements and ranges from 0-21 with higher values indicating worse sleep quality.
A negative value in Change from Baseline to Week 8 indicates an improvement in sleep quality from Baseline.</description>
