  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic study to determine the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in
      healthy lactating women. The objectives are to determine whether pregabalin is secreted in
      breast milk and if so, to characterize pregabalin pharmacokinetics in breast milk. Other
      objectives are to estimate potential infant exposure to pregabalin if administered to
      lactating women and to characterize the safety and tolerability of pregabalin in lactating
      women.

Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

        <description>The terminal half-life for breast milk (t1/2 [breast milk]) was the time measured for breast milk concentration to decrease by one-half. For the first 5 participants enrolled under protocol amendment dated: 18 Sep 2012, breast milk was collected up to 24 hours after Day 3 dosing over the following time intervals: 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 12, 12 to 24 hours. Terminal half-life was determined over those points characterizing the elimination phase. For the remaining 5 participants, there were 3 additional collection intervals (24 to 32, 32 to 40, 40 to 48 hours) for characterizing the terminal elimination phase. The t1/2 (breast milk) is based on the terminal elimination phase time points from this timeframe.</description>

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.
