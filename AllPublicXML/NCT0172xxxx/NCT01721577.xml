  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, Phase I/IIa study to investigate the
      safety, tolerability, and antitumor efficacy of AXL1717 (picropodophyllin as active agent
      formulated in an oral suspension; PPP) in patients with recurrent malignant astrocytomas
      (glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic
      oligoastrocytoma, and anaplastic ependymoma). Patients will be treated for up to 5 cycles. A
      treatment cycle is defined as 28 days+7 days rest (28+7 days during cycle 1 to 4, and 28 days
      during cycle 5). The following cycle will not be started until the treatment continuation
      criteria are fulfilled. Concomitant supportive therapies will be allowed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AXL1717, as a ready-to-use suspension of picropodophyllin for oral administration, will be
      distributed in bottles for single use at a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Fixed doses will be
      used, i.e. there are no adjustments for weight or body surface. There will be no
      randomization or blinding in the study.

      The trial will be divided in two phases. In the first phase, 10-20 patients will be enrolled
      and treated with 300-520 mg BID of AXL1717 for 28 days. The primary endpoint of the first
      phase is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AXL1717 in patients with
      recurrent or progressive glioblastoma and to assess the safety and toxicity of AXL1717 in
      this patient population. The study has a 3+3 design and the first cohort will be treated with
      400 mg AXL1717 BID for 28 days repeated in up to 5 cycles. If dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
      such as neutropenia occurs, dosing will be interrupted and the individual patient will,
      following normalization, be restarted on the same or a lower dose level according to
      standardized procedure. If two or three of the first 3 patients on a specific dose level
      experience a DLT during the first 28 days of treatment with AXL1717, the following patients
      will be treated with a lower dose level. If one DLT occurs during the first 28 days of dosing
      in the first 3 three patients another 3 patients will be treated with the same dose level. If
      2 of the 6 patients display DLT, the next patients will be treated with a lower dose level.
      The highest dose level without DLT or with maximally one DLT out of 6 patients will be the
      RPTD. All assessments with respect to dose adjustments for subsequent cohorts will be done
      during the first 28 days of treatment. Non-progressing patients may be treated for a total of
      five 28-day cycles (24 weeks).

      In the second phase, 12 patients will be enrolled and treated with the identified RP2D of
      AXL1717 for 28 days repeated in five cycles. The primary endpoints of phase II is to assess
      the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 24 weeks and to assess safety,
      tolerability, and adverse event profile of AXL1717.
