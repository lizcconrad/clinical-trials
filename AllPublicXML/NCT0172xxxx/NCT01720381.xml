    <textblock>
      The study is to demonstrate the accuracy of the OptiScanner in measuring blood glucose levels
      in critically ill patients when compared to a reference YSI 2300 STAT Plus and the Gem 3000,
      the reference standard for Erasme University Hospital.

      One additional blood sample (4 ml)will be collected once a day, separated into Draw an
      additional ~ 4.0 mL from the subject into a syringe once per every 24 hour period. The study
      site will indicate where and at what time the sample was taken. This sample is placed into a
      sodium heparin tube, labeled with the subject number and sampling time and centrifuged on a
      refrigerated centrifuge. The gained plasma will be frozen at minus 70 degrees Celsius or less
      and may be used for potential analysis by the Sponsor, should an analysis of outliers
      indicate the potential presence of an interferent.
