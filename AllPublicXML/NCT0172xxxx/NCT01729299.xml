  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the role of nutrient status on ghrelin regulation of insulin secretion. We
      hypothesize that ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)(both are hormones made in the
      gut,) have differential effects on β-cell function in the fed state. We will compare insulin
      secretion and glucose turnover during meal ingestion using a dual glucose tracer and mixed
      meal protocol in subjects receiving ghrelin or saline. We will also determine the role of
      ghrelin-stimulated GLP-1 levels in this process using the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) antagonist
      Exendin(9-39) (Ex-9).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to study 20 healthy subjects on 4 occasions where they will receive ghrelin,
      ghrelin+Ex-9, Ex-9 or saline infusion after an overnight fast in a randomized order; Ex-9
      will be used to block GLP-1 action. A 240-minute meal tolerance test (MTT) using a dual
      glucose tracer method will serve as the foundation of each study visit. One tracer,
      [6,6-2H2]glucose will be infused intravenously before and during the test meal to quantify
      fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP), and glucose disappearance during the meal. A
      second tracer, [U-13C]glucose, will be included in the meal to trace the appearance of oral
      glucose. The systemic appearance rates of both ingested tracer and total (i.e., ingested and
      endogenously produced) glucose will be calculated. Using this protocol, we will be able to
      evaluate a) insulin secretion in response to mixed-meal ingestion, b) glucose appearance and
      glucose disappearance during meal ingestion, c) the ghrelin effect on these parameters
      without GLP-1, and d) the effect of GLP-1 in the response based on the effects with and
      without Ex-9.

      This dual-tracer method has been used to assess the ability of an individual to dispose of an
      oral glucose load, and accurately fractionates the appearance of ingested glucose in plasma
      (Ra meal), EGP, and peripheral glucose disposal (Rd) in this setting 41-42. The
      [6,6-2H2]glucose and [U-13C]glucose are stable-isotope tracers and are different from
      radioactive-isotope tracers in that they do not emit radiation.

      All procedures will be performed at the CTRC at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
      Center (CCHMC).

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting EGP will be calculated as the ratio of 6,6-[2H2]glucose infusion rate to plasma tracer enrichment (tracer-to-tracee ratio [TTR]6,6 from measurements obtained in the last 20 min of the basal tracer equilibration period, when plasma glucose concentration and 6,6-[2H2]glucose enrichment are stable).</description>

    <measure>glucose appearance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Total rates of glucose appearance after meal ingestion (total Ra) will be calculated by modeling 6,6-[2H2] enrichment ([TTR]6,6) using both a two-compartment model and Steele's equation42. Meal glucose appearance will be determined from the analysis of [U-13C]-glucose fluxes. The meal will be labeled to 2.66% with U-13C]-glucose (TTRmeal). From the measurement of plasma [TTR]13C, we will calculate the exogenous (meal) glucose concentrations, [Gmeal] , from total glucose concentrations, [Gtot] , using the formula [Gmeal] = [Gtot] x [TTR]13C / TTRmeal as previously described 42,45. Endogenous glucose concentration [Gend] will be calculated as [Gend] = [Gtot] - [Gmeal].</description>
