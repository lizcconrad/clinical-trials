      The current trial &quot;A Phase I/II study of Erlotinib +/- Tivozanib as initial treatment for
      Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer assigned by VeriStrat® Serum Proteomic Evaluation&quot; will
      begin by evaluating toxicity for the combination of Tivozanib and Erlotinib to determine a
      phase II dose. The phase II portion of the study will seek to duplicate the finding of the
      BEER trial in a selected population of patients with NSCLC with a VeriStrat® Good signature
      using two oral agents with Tivozanib substituted for bevacizumab. Phase II will be designed
      as a selection-based randomized trial. Patients with VeriStrat® Good signature will be
      assigned to EGFR inhibitor therapy with a randomization to Erlotinib plus/minus Tivozanib.
      Patients with VeriStrat® Poor signature will be assigned to standard of care.
      Standard-of-care chemotherapy as first treatment at the discretion of patient and physician
      will be evaluated for response to treatment, survival and repeat VeriStrat® signature.

             effective method of contraception. Effective birth control includes (a) intrauterine
             device (IUD) plus one barrier method; or (b) 2 barrier methods. Effective barrier
             methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that
             contain a chemical to kill sperm). (Note: Oral, implantable, or injectable
             contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome P450 interactions, and are not considered
             effective for this study).
