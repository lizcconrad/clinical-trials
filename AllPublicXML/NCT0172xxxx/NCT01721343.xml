    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies collaborative targeted case management in improving
      functional status in patients with stage III-IV cancer. Collaborative targeted case
      management may improve functional status and preserve performance in patients with advanced
      cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the comparative effectiveness of the Collaborative Care to Preserve Performance
      in Cancer (COPE) trial arms in preserving functional status.

      II. To assess the comparative cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the COPE interventions.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo enhanced usual care comprising telephonic monitoring, monthly status
      reports, and an oncology care team for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients undergo enhanced usual care as in Arm I and participate in an individualized
      conditioning program delivered by a local physical therapist and coordinated by the
      Rehabilitation Care Manager (RCM) for 6 months.

      ARM III: Patients undergo enhanced usual care as in Arm I, participate in an individualized
      conditioning program coordinated by the RCM as in Arm II, and receive optimized pain
      management through a Pain Care Manager (PCM) for 6 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Acute Care CAT (APC) score in cancer patients out to 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An overall test using a linear contrast across the three arms will be used. If this is significant then tests between individual pairs of arms will follow. A mixed-effects regression model will allow use of multiple APC measurements per subject while allowing for an appropriate within-subject covariance structure. Time will be incorporated as a continuous variable, a polynomial function, or using assessment-specific indicator variables to determine the most parsimonious model that adequately describes the observed patterns.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scores concerning general activity relating to quality of life evaluated by the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) and Cancer Behavior Inventory (CBI) out to 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be analyzed in a similar manner to the primary analysis. Arms II and III, will be aggregated and adherence variables will be used by time interactions to assess whether the rate of change in APC differs based on participants' &quot;dose&quot; of TCM-RS components to identify potential mediators of TCM-RS benefits.</description>
