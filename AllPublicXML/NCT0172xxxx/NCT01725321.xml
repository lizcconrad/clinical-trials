  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of colonic polyps, the
      missed rate for colonic adenoma ranged from 15-32%. In particular, missed colonic polyps in
      the right side colon have been suggested to be the cause for interval cancer that developed
      after a prior negative colonoscopy.

      Different endoscopic image enhanced modules like the narrow band imaging (NBI) have been
      developed to improve colonic polyp detection. However, it remains controversial whether the
      previous version of NBI helps to improve colonic polyp detection. The new generation
      colonoscope is equipped with high definition and improved narrow band imaging (NBI) which
      gives at least twice the viewable distance and contrast. The images obtained are far brighter
      with better resolution than the previous version. It however remains to be determined whether
      this enhanced imaging technique could help to improve colonic polyps detection.

      Hypothesis:

      The new generation NBI increases the detection rate of proximal serrated polyps and reduces
      the missed rate of all colorectal polyps.

      Aims:

        -  To determine whether the new generation NBI improve the detection rate of proximal
           serrated polyps.

        -  To determine whether the new generation NBI improve the detection rate of all colorectal
           adenoma and polyps.

        -  To determine whether the new generation NBI reduce the miss rate of colorectal adenoma
           and polyps.
