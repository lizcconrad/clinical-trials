  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In period I, the treatment effect of FK949E was compared with that of placebo in a blind
      manner in bipolar disorder patients with major depressive episodes. In period II, the
      long-term safety and efficacy of FK949E was evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of two parts. In Treatment Period I, FK949E or placebo was administered
      orally in a blind manner to bipolar disorder patients with major depressive episodes, with
      the aim of evaluating the superiority of FK949E over placebo and the dose response of two
      doses of FK949E based on changes in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total
      score. In Treatment Period II, the long-term safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      open-label FK949E was evaluated in patients who completed Treatment Period I. An analysis was
      performed for data in Treatment Period I and another analysis was done for data in combined
      Treatment Periods I and II.

        <description>The MADRS is a10-item scale to measure the severity of depressive episodes, where each item is rated on a scale from 0 to 6. The MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60 with lower scores indicating less depressive symptoms. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-12.</description>

        <description>The HAM-D17 is a clinician-rated 17-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, where a higher score indicates a greater depressive state.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With HAM-D17 Response (Treatment Period I)</title>
        <description>A HAM-D17 response was defined as a decrease in HAM-D17 total score of 50% or more from baseline. The HAM-D17 is a clinician-rated 17-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, where a higher score indicates a greater depressive state.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With HAM-D17 Response (Treatment Period I)</title>
          <description>A HAM-D17 response was defined as a decrease in HAM-D17 total score of 50% or more from baseline. The HAM-D17 is a clinician-rated 17-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, where a higher score indicates a greater depressive state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP-S: Mania (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP-S is a scale which assesses a participant's severity of their overall bipolar illness, depression, and mania as assessed by the clinician using a scale from 1 (not ill) to 7 (very severely ill). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-12.</description>

            <description>Participants received placebo administered orally once daily at bedtime for 8 weeks in Treatment Period I. Participants who met the transition criteria continued to Treatment Period II which consisted of a transition period in which participants continued to receive placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week dose adjustment period, and a treatment period in which participants received either open-label FK949E 150 mg or 300 mg (depending on dose increase or reduction guidelines) administered orally for 39 weeks. Participants underwent a dose-tapering period (1 week) and a follow-up period (1 week) thereafter.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP-S: Depression (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP-S is a scale which assesses a participant's severity of their overall bipolar illness, depression, and mania as assessed by the clinician using a scale from 1 (not ill) to 7 (very severely ill). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-12.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in CGI-BP-S: Overall Bipolar Illness (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP-S is a scale which assesses a participant's severity of their overall bipolar illness, depression, and mania as assessed by the clinician using a scale from 1 (not ill) to 7 (very severely ill). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-12.</description>

        <description>The CGI-BP-C is a scale which assesses the degree of change or improvement from baseline for each of overall bipolar illness, depression and mania, by grading it using 8 grades, from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) or 8 (not applicable). Grade 8 (not applicable) was regarded as a missing value for purposes of calculating the mean score.</description>

        <title>CGI-BP-C: Overall Bipolar Illness (Treatment Period I)</title>
        <description>The CGI-BP-C is a scale which assesses the degree of change or improvement from baseline for each of overall bipolar illness, depression and mania, by grading it using 8 grades, from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) or 8 (not applicable). Grade 8 (not applicable) was regarded as a missing value for purposes of calculating the mean score.</description>

        <description>The DIEPSS is a scale used to evaluate drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. DIEPSS is composed of 8 individual symptom parameters and a global assessment of severity, each rated on a 5-point scale, with lower scores indicating as &quot;normal.&quot; The DIEPSS total score ranges from 0 (none, normal) to 32 (severe), and excludes the global assessment of severity.</description>

        <description>The YMRS is a scale used to evaluate manic symptoms. The YMRS total score was the total assessment of assessed points for 11 items, ranges from 0 to 60 (each item is scored from either 0-4 or 0-8 by severity (0 = absent and 4/8 = displays mood/behavior to a greater degree). A lower score indicates “Absent” or “Normal.&quot; Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-12.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS): Suicidal Ideation (Treatment Period I)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Ideation - Wish to be Dead (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Ideation – Suicidal Thoughts (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Ideation – Suicidal Thoughts With Method (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (Placebo/FK949E only from week 12, FK949E 150 mg/FK949E &amp; FK949E 300 mg/FK949E from week 4)</time_frame>

Participants who met the transition criteria continued to Treatment Period II which consisted of a transition period in which participants continued to receive FK949E 300 mg for 4 weeks followed by a 1-week dose-adjustment period and treatment period in which participants received either open-label FK949E 150 mg or 300 mg (depending on dose increase or reduction guidelines) administered orally for 39 weeks. Participants underwent a dose-tapering period (1 week) and a follow-up period (1 week) thereafter.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Ideation – Suicidal Thoughts With Method (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
          <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Ideation – Suicidal Intent Without a Plan (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Ideation – Suicidal Intent With a Plan (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 5 items for suicide ideation (1. Wish to be dead; 2. Suicidal thoughts; 3. Suicidal thoughts with a method (no specific plan or intent to act); 4. Suicidal intent (without a specific plan); 5. Suicidal intent with specific plan. If participants responded with a negative response for questions 1 and 2, the remaining questions are skipped. If question 2 was responded to with a positive response, the remaining questions need to be asked. Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Self-injury Behavior Without Intent (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (Placebo/FK949E only from week 12, FK949E 150 mg/FK949E &amp; FK949E 300 mg/FK949E from week 4)</time_frame>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Discontinued Attempt (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (Placebo/FK949E only from week 12, FK949E 150 mg/FK949E &amp; FK949E 300 mg/FK949E from week 4)</time_frame>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Interrupted Attempt (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (Placebo/FK949E only from week 12, FK949E 150 mg/FK949E &amp; FK949E 300 mg/FK949E from week 4)</time_frame>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Preliminary Act to Suicide (Combined Treatment Period I and II</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Suicidal Behavior (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (Placebo/FK949E only from week 12, FK949E 150 mg/FK949E &amp; FK949E 300 mg/FK949E from week 4)</time_frame>
        <population>SAF (for combined Treatment Period I and II) participants with available data at each time point; LOCF imputation was used for value at end of combined treatment period.</population>

            <description>Participants received placebo administered orally once daily at bedtime for 8 weeks in Treatment Period I. Participants who met the transition criteria continued to Treatment Period II which consisted of a transition period in which participants continued to receive placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week dose adjustment period, and a treatment period in which participants received either open-label FK949E 150 mg or 300 mg (depending on dose increase or reduction guidelines) administered orally for 39 weeks. Participants underwent a dose-tapering period (1 week) and a follow-up period (1 week) thereafter.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Suicidal Behavior (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
          <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10</description>
          <population>SAF (for combined Treatment Period I and II) participants with available data at each time point; LOCF imputation was used for value at end of combined treatment period.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Affirmative Response to C-SSRS: Suicidal Behaviors - Completed Suicide (Combined Treatment Period I and II)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS is a scale for assessing risk for suicidal behavior and suicide ideation and was administered by the clinician. Affirmative or negative responses were provided to 7 items to suicidal behaviors (1. suicide attempt; 2. Self-injury without suicide intent; 3. discontinued suicide attempt; 4. interrupted suicide attempt; 5. preliminary action to suicide; 6. suicidal behavior; 7. completed suicide). Baseline for Placebo / FK949E was at week 12 therefore no data were calculated for weeks 1-10.</description>
        <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52 (Placebo/FK949E only from week 12, FK949E 150 mg/FK949E &amp; FK949E 300 mg/FK949E from week 4)</time_frame>
        <population>SAF (for combined Treatment Period I and II) participants with available data at each time point; LOCF imputation was used for value at end of combined treatment period.</population>

Participants who met the transition criteria continued to Treatment Period II which consisted of a transition period in which participants continued to receive placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a 1-week dose adjustment period, and a treatment period in which participants received either open-label FK949E 150 mg or 300 mg (depending on dose increase or reduction guidelines) administered orally for 39 weeks. Participants underwent a dose-tapering period (1 week) and a follow-up period (1 week) thereafter.</description>
