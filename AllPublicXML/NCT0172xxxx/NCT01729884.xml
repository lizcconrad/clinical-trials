    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage IV
      hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build
      an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To quantify and characterize human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific
      central memory T cell (TCM) and effector memory T cell (TEM) subsets in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cell (PBMC) of patients vaccinated with a HER2 cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
      peptide-based vaccine.

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of expanding HER2-specific effector T cells (TE) derived from
      HER2-specific TCM or TEM precursors in patients vaccinated with a HER2 CTL peptide-based
      vaccine and characterize their function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of administering a HER2 CTL peptide-based vaccine in patients who
      are receiving trastuzumab and/or lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
