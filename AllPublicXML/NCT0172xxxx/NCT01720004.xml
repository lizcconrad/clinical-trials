  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of repeated hands-and-knees positioning during labour. The objectives were 1)
      to provide an estimate of enrollment rates, 2) to assess compliance with the study protocol
      by participants and care providers, 3) to obtain women's views about their experiences using
      the hands-and-knees position, and 4) to provide estimates of treatment effects to inform the
      sample size calculation for a large trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women were enrolled in the pilot randomized controlled trial at two hospitals, one in Canada
      and one in the USA. Nurses at both hospitals were trained in how to assist women into the
      hands-and-knees position in bed. Repeated hands-and-knees position was defined as attempts to
      use the position for 15 minutes, hourly from randomization until delivery. Women were not
      asked to assume hands-and-knees for delivery.

    <description>women's views of their birth experiences, including satisfaction with care and care providers, views about hands-and-knees positioning, willingness to use hands-and-knees position in a subsequent labour, comparison of expectations versus experiences of labour. The measures used to assess women's views had been developed for and used in prior trials of forms of intrapartum care by Hodnett and colleagues. Most questions were Likert scales or categorical items.</description>
