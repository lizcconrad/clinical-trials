      Dietary intervention efficacy trials are distinctly lacking in asthma research. This pilot
      study aims to provide effect size estimates and justification, clinical trial and
      intervention feasibility data, and procedural materials for a full-scale randomized
      controlled trial that will determine the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)—a recommended dietary pattern based on proven
      cardiovascular benefits—as adjunct therapy to standard care for adults with uncontrolled
      asthma.

      controlled trial that will determine the efficacy and mechanisms of action of the Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)—a recommended dietary pattern based on proven
      cardiovascular benefits—as adjunct therapy to standard care for adults with uncontrolled
      asthma. Eligible, consenting participants (n=90) will be randomized to receive usual care
      alone or combined with a DASH intervention. Follow-up assessments will occur at 3 and 6
      months. By evaluating a dietary pattern approach to improving asthma control, this study
      could advance the evidence base for refining clinical guidelines and public health
      recommendations regarding the role of dietary modifications in asthma management.

    <measure>7-item Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months post-randomizaton</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ provides a reliable, validated assessment of asthma control focusing on current impairment. Its 7 items assess the components of current asthma impairment as defined in the asthma treatment guidelines, i.e., daytime and nocturnal asthma symptoms, activity limitations, rescue medication use (excluding use to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm), and lung function (FEV1). The ACQ is the only guideline-recommended composite measure of asthma control that includes lung function in its overall rating.</description>

    <description>Sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are common comorbidities of obesity and asthma. The Berlin Questionnaire for Sleep Apnea and the GERD Symptom Assessment Scale will be administered to screen for these conditions and to assess changes in symptoms. In addition, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index will be used to assess participants' usual sleep habits and sleep quality. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) is both a measure of depressive symptomatology and a tentative diagnostic instrument for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) depressive disorders.</description>

    <description>The intervention will employ a series of small group and individual sessions, followed by periodic telephone contacts, to help participants make appropriate dietary changes and develop the skills to maintain these changes over the long term. The initial 3 months of intensive intervention will involve 8 group and 3 individual sessions for 45-60 minutes each. During the next 3 months, participants will receive counseling phone calls once per month for 20-30 minutes each call. Group session sizes may range from 8-15 participants.</description>
