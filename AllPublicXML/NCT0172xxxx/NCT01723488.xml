  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      [F-18]T808 is being developed as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for PET imaging of the
      human brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Siemens Molecular Imaging (SMI) is seeking to determine if [F-18]T808 might be useful as a
      non-invasive assessment tool in the clinical evaluation of subjects with conditions
      associated with tau protein aggregates, such as Alzheimer's disease. The information
      collected under this exploratory study will not be used for diagnostic purposes, assessments
      of the participant's response to therapy or for clinical management of the participants.
      However, this exploratory study will provide baseline information on the safety,
      biodistribution, and dosimetry of [F-18]T808. These data will aid in the design of future
      studies of [F-18]T808 in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Overall, this study will provide
      initial data that inform the development of [F-18]T808 as the first PET imaging agent for
      human tau protein related pathology.
