    <textblock>
      The findings of this project will contribute to the understanding of a comprehensive probe
      for investigation of the effects of monotherapy versus combination rehabilitation
      intervention after stroke, including the topics of possible underlying mechanisms of motor
      recovery as well as the beneficial and adverse effects of intense rehabilitation therapy,
      prognostic factors of the outcomes, and clinimetric properties of the instruments. The
      overall findings of this project will be significant in the era of knowledge translation and
      guide the development of innovative and effective interventions for individualized stroke
      rehabilitation.

    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research project will be to provide scientific evidence of the
      robot-assisted therapy in sequential combination with distributed constraint-induced therapy
      (RT + dCIT)versus monotherapy of the robot-assisted therapy (RT), distributed
      constraint-induced therapy (dCIT), and a dose-matched control therapy (DMCT)in stroke
      rehabilitation. The specific aims of this proposed research are identified as follows:

        1. The investigators will investigate the treatment effects of RT + dCIT compared to RT,
           CIT, and DMCT on motor ability, muscle function, sensory function, daily performance,
           real-world arm activity, quality of life, and motor control variables at before
           treatment, midterm assessment, and after treatment. In addition to study of treatment
           benefits, physiological responses as the potential adverse effects including
           post-exertional fatigue, post-exertional pain, and a biomarker of oxidative stress will
           be also examined in this project. The investigators hypothesized that the therapeutic
           regimen combining RT with dCIT will contribute to more significantly reduction in
           impairment and disability for stroke patients than the other intervention groups.

        2. The investigators will investigate if the clinical characteristics or behavioral markers
           of stroke patients will influence the outcomes after interventions. The proposed
           potential predictors will be chronicity, side of lesion, muscle tone, motor ability of
           distal part of upper limb, and amount of affected hand use.

        3. The investigators will examine whether the improved scores after each treatment reach
           clinically important changes in order to establish the clinical significance relevant
           for individualized medicine. The investigators will also assess and compare the
           clinimetric properties (e.g., validity, responsiveness, minimal detectable change, and
           minimal clinically important difference) of the rehabilitation outcomes to inform
           selection of instruments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The upper-extremity subscale of the FMA will be used to assess motor impairment. The 33 upper limb items measure the movement and reflexes of the shoulder/elbow/forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. They are scored on a 3-point ordinal scale (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially, 2-performs fully). The maximum score is 66, indicating optimal recovery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM consists of 18 items grouped into 6 subscales measuring self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition ability. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 (maximum score 126) based on the required level of assistance to perform the tasks (e.g., 1-complete assistance and 7-complete independence). A higher score on any subscale indicates a less disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale Version 3.0 (SIS 3.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SIS 3.0 is a stroke-specific instrument of health-related quality of life. It contains 59 items measuring 8 domains (i.e., strength, hand function, Activities of Daily Living/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, mobility, communication, emotion. memory and thinking and participation) with a single item assessing perceived overall recovery from stroke. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with lower scores indicating greater difficulty in task completion during the past week. Aggregate scores, ranges from 0 to 100, are generated for each domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual analogue scale (VAS) for assessing post-exertional fatigue and pain</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analogue fatigue scale (VAFS) and visual analogue pain scale (VAPS) will be used to assess the level of post-exertional fatigue and post-exertional pain. The VAS consists of score ranges from 0 to 100 measured in millimeters on a 10-cm vertical line. The scores will be obtained by measuring the lines from &quot;no fatigue&quot; to &quot;very severe fatigue&quot; and from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;very severe pain&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The activity monitors, Actigraphy (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., New York), quantitatively recording the amount of activity in free-living conditions, will be used to reflect increase in the amount of affected arm use over time. The participants will be asked to wear an Actigraphy on each wrist for 3 consecutive days to measure what amount they actually do in their daily life. The Actigraphy can be attached to the subject's limb and measures the motion of that limb through an accelerometer.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Status Score (MSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MSS examines shoulder, elbow (maximum score = 40), wrist, hand, and finger movements (maximum score = 42). The MSS isolates and grades movements of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist using a 6-point scale (0, -1, 1, +1, -2, and 2), ranging from no volitional movement to perform movements faultlessly. Scoring for the hand is based on a 3-point scale (0, 1, and 2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WMFT requires the participant to perform 15 function-based and 2 strength-based tasks. The tasks are averaged to produce a score in seconds that ranges from 0 to 120 seconds. For functional ability scoring, we used a 6-point ordinal scale where 0 indicates &quot;does not attempt with the involved arm&quot; and 5 indicates &quot;arm does participate; movement appears to be normal.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Research Council scale (MRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MRC scale examines muscle power of the affected arm. The MRC scale is reliable measurement in stroke patients with score ranged from 0 to 5. Grade of 0 indicates no contraction, 1: flicker or trace contraction, 2: active movement, with gravity eliminated, 3: active movement against gravity, 4: active movement against gravity and resistance, and 5: normal power.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is one of the most frequently used of the clinical scales for assessing muscle spasticity by means of a quick stretch response. Muscle tone of upper limb will be evaluated by the MAS in this project. The scoring of the MAS ranges from 0 (no increase in muscle tone) to 4 (affected part rigid).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (RNSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RNSA includes tactile sensation, kinesthetic sensation, and stereognosis. For tactile sensation, the patient will be asked to indicate whenever he or she feels the test sensation. For kinesthetic sensations, all 3 aspects of movement will be tested: appreciation of movement, its direction and accurate joint position sense. For stereognosis, the object will be placed in the patient's hand for a maximum of 30 seconds. Identification is by naming, description or by pair-matching with an identical set.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Myoton</measure>
    <time_frame>An expected average of 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The functional state of skeletal muscle was assessed by using myotonometric measurements with the Myoton (Muomeetria Ltd, Estonia) device, created at the University of Tartu in Estonia. The MYOTON represents a noninvasive way to characterize the viscoelastic properties of skeletal muscle in vivo. Three measurement parameters in the MYOTON: F - Frequency, Hz, characterizes muscle tone; D - Decrement, characterizes muscle elasticity; S - Stiffness, N/m, characterizes muscle stiffness.</description>
