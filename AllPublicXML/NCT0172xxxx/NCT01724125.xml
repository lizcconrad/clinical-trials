  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic Personal Health Records (PHRs) hold promise in helping reshape healthcare by
      shifting the ownership and locus of health records from being scattered across multiple
      providers to an approach that is longitudinal and patient-centered. Given the complex health
      needs and the fragmentation of care for persons with serious mental illnesses, these
      individuals could derive particular benefit from a PHR. However, there are currently no
      established PHRs developed for use in this population.

      In order to fill this gap, the investigators propose to develop, test, and disseminate a
      Personal Health Record for persons with serious mental illnesses and one or more comorbid
      medical condition. The Mental Health PHR (MH-PHR) builds on an established personal health
      record which was developed in partnership with medical consumers and is in wide use in a
      number of communities in the United States and abroad.
