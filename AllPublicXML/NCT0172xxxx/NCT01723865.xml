      This is a clinical trial to evaluate the clinical benefit of remote monitoring in patients
      with heart failure having an ICD-CRT implanted.

      Study purpose The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that the monitoring of
      specific clinical parameters, obtained by remote controls of ICD-CRT could improve clinical
      course of patients with heart failure.

      Study design This is a prospective observational study, comparing clinical course of patients
      with heart failure having an ICD-CRT implanted, followed or not by remote monitoring. This
      study will include 870 subjects with ICD and CRT-D, and followed by a remote monitoring
      system (with or without weight and pressure external sensors) or followed by conventional
      ambulatory visits.

      Primary endpoints The primary endpoint of this study is to document no superiority of
      unplanned hospital access for cardiac reasons (included access to the emergency units ) or
      death for cardiovascular causes in remote monitoring group (with or without weight and
      pressure external sensors) compared to conventional follow-up (usual care group).

      Aim of the study The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of a dedicated
      remote monitoring system (RPM) in the management of patients with heart failure and implanted
      with ICDs and CRT-D.

      The clinical benefit will be assessed by:

        -  Increased cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization).

        -  Events arrhythmia: atrial fibrillation, sustained and nonsustained ventricular
           tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

        -  Autonomic profile, echocardiographic parameters, 6-minute walk test, quality of life
           questionnaire.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to estimate the incidence (and its accuracy) of the
      first event of unplanned hospitalizations for cardiac reasons or death from cardiovascular
      causes in the group monitored using RPM (with or without external sensors) and in the group
      management via conventional follow-up (Usual Care).
