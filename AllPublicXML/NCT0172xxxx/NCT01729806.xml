    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab
      when given together with rituximab in treating patients with B-cell lymphoma that has
      returned or has not responded to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and
      rituximab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a recommended phase II dose for ipilimumab in combination with rituximab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary information on the effect of adding ipilimumab to rituximab in
      regard to: immune response; clinical anti-tumor response/overall remission rate (ORR)
      (complete remission + partial remission); progression free survival (PFS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ipilimumab followed by a randomized study.

      PART I:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks
      for 12 weeks and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly for 4 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours
      once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year.

      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-4 and ipilimumab
      IV over 90 minutes once weekly in weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV
      over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once weekly in weeks 1-4 and ipilimumab
      IV over 90 minutes once weekly in weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Patients then receive ipilimumab IV
      over 90 minutes and rituximab IV over 2-6 hours once every 12 weeks for up to 1 year in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
