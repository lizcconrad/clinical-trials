    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose of LY2940680 that can be safely given
      in combination with etoposide and carboplatin followed by LY2940680 alone in participants
      with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer. The study will also compare progression-free
      survival in participants who are administered etoposide, carboplatin and LY2940680 followed
      by LY2940680 alone versus etoposide, carboplatin, and placebo followed by placebo alone.

             relapse only, will be eligible even if diagnosed less than 5 years previously

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and asymptomatic CNS metastases
             requiring concurrent corticosteroid therapy. Treated stable CNS metastases are
             allowed; the participant must be stable after radiotherapy for ≥2 weeks and off of
             corticosteroids for ≥1 week

          -  Presence of clinically significant third-space fluid collections that cannot be
             controlled prior to study entry
