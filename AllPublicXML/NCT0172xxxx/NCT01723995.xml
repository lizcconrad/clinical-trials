      This study aims to evaluate the effect of low-level laser in pain relief and tissue repair in
      mothers with nipple trauma during breastfeeding, compared to a control group.

      The selection was made through the search of women hospitalized in Accommodation beds with
      nipple trauma, lifting of stipulated criteria, and inclusion of women in the study upon
      acceptance and signing of the consent form. To collect the data, a group was formed with
      people trained as evaluators, responsible for election, randomization, filling of First
      Assessment and Subsequent Assessment forms, recording of photo images and pain evaluation
      before and after treatment with laser; and applicators, responsible for laser handling and
      irradiation. Data collection followed the following order: filling of the first instrument,
      breast image capture, suckling observation, identification of pain during the child's breast
      sucking, laser irradiation and re-identification of pain during the child's breast sucking
      after laser treatment. The collection of data of this form occurred continuously every twelve
      hours until repair of the nipple trauma or patient discharge. A minimum of two and a maximum
      of six assessments were carried out, from the inclusion of the patient in the study (taken as
      zero hour) to 60 hours postpartum. Irradiation, in turn, was performed every 24 hours during
      the same period, including one to three irradiations per patient in each of the breasts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Women hospitalized in the Accommodation System with their children, feeding exclusively
        directly from the breast and presenting unilateral or bilateral nipple trauma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Women who were using any other form of treatment for nipple trauma; use of any topical
        substance in the nipple-areola region; presence of inverted and pseudo-inverted nipple;
        presence of mastitis; previous history or presence of malignancies; presence of
        photosensitivity or any adverse reactions to exposure to sunlight; discharge planned for
        the first day of data collection; women under unfavorable psycho-affective and cognitive
        situations which prevented assessment of the analog pain scale, photo image record. and
        observation of breastfeeding; women who had twins, children with gestational age less than
        37 weeks, or birth weight less than 2500 grams.
