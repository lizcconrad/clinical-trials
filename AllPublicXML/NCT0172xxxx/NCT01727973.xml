  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline (50
      mg/d), administered for 12 wk, for patients with active moderate-severe Graves' Orbitopathy
      (GO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves'orbitopathy is an autoimmune disease characterised by an inflammatory phase followed
      by fibrosis. Surgery to correct eyelid swelling, proptosis, and diplopia is effective, but
      can not be done until the inflammatory phase has passed. To arrest the inflammatory phase,
      several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been investigated. Corticosteroids are the
      first-choice immunosuppressive treatment, but they often cause severe side-effects.

      Subantimicrobial dose doxycycline posses known anti-inflammatory effects that are separate
      from their antibacterial mode of action. This mode of action has lead to the routine use of
      subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for rosacea, periodontitis and multiple sclerosis.

      We propose to test the effect of subantimicrobial dose doxycycline for non-sight threatening,
      moderate-severe, inflammatory GO.

    <description>As definition of treatment response, we used the major and minor criteria . Three major criteria were: improvement in diplopia grade (disappearance or change in grade); improvement of ≥8 degrees in any direction of eye movements; reduction of three points or more in CAS. Four minor criteria were: reduction of 2 mm or more in eyelid aperture; reduction of 2 mm or more in proptosis; improvement in grade of soft tissue swelling; decrease in CAS by at least two points. A successful response was defined as an improvement in one or more major criteria or in two minor criteria, in absence of deterioration of any criterion in that observed eye. Deterioration was defined as occurrence of DON, and/or worsening of soft tissue swelling, and/or worsening of diplopia, and/or an increase of ≥2 mm in lid aperture, and/or an increase of ≥2 mm in proptosis, and/or a decrease of ≥8 degrees in duction. No success was defined if there was no change or the changes did not reach the success criteria.</description>
