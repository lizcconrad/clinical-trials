      This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of
      tildrakizumab (SCH 900222/MK-3222) in a population of participants with moderate-to-severe
      plaque psoriasis.

      The base study consists of a screening phase of up to 4 weeks followed by a treatment period
      of 52 weeks, and a 20-week follow-up period. The base study treatment period is divided into
      3 sequential parts.

      In Part 1 of the base study (Week 0 to Week 12), participants will be randomized to one of 4
      study arms (Arm A: tildrakizumab 200 mg + matching placebo to etanercept; Arm B:
      tildrakizumab 100 mg + matching placebo to etanercept; Arm C: matching placebo to
      tildrakizumab + matching placebo to etanercept; Arm D: matching placebo to tildrakizumab +
      etanercept 50 mg).

      In Part 2 of the base study (Week 12 to Week 28), participants in Arm A and Arm B will
      receive matching placebo to tildrakizumab to maintain blinding at Week 12 and will receive
      either tildrakizumab 200 mg (Arm A) or tildrakizumab 100 mg (Arm B) at Week 16. Participants
      in Arm A and Arm B will also receive matching placebo to etanercept once weekly through study
      Week 28. At study Week 12, Arm C participants will be re-randomized to receive their first
      dose of tildrakizumab 200 mg or tildrakizumab 100 mg, and will receive additional doses of
      study medication according to their re-randomized treatment assignment at Week 16.
      Participants in Arm C will also receive matching placebo to etanercept through treatment Week
      28. Participants in Arm D will continue with once weekly doses of etanercept through study
      Week 28 in combination with matching placebo to tildrakizumab.

      In Part 3 of the base study (Week 28 to Week 52), participants in Arm A with &gt;= Psoriasis
      Area Sensitivity Index of 75% (PASI-75) response at Week 28 will be re-randomized to either
      continue tildrakizumab 200 mg or receive tildrakizumab 100 mg at study Weeks 28, 40, and 52.
      Participants with &gt;= PASI-50 response but &lt; PASI-75 response will continue to receive
      tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks and those participants with &lt; PASI-50 response will be
      discontinued from the study. Participants in Arm B with &gt;= PASI-75 response at Week 28 will
      continue to receive tildrakizumab 100 mg every 12 weeks. Those with &gt;= PASI-50 response but &lt;
      PASI-75 response will be re-randomized to receive continued tildrakizumab 100 mg or
      tildrakizumab 200 mg every 12 weeks. Participants in Arm B with &lt; PASI-50 response will be
      discontinued from the study. Participants in Arm C will continue to receive treatment every
      12 weeks according to their re-randomized treatment assignment. Participants in Arm D that
      achieve &gt;= PASI-75 response at Week 28 will be discontinued from the study. Those
      participants with &lt; PASI-75 response at Week 28 will be crossed over to tildrakizumab 200 mg
      to receive doses at Weeks 32, 36 and 48.

      Eligible participants that choose to enroll in the extension study will have an additional
      treatment period of up to 192 weeks and will be monitored for an additional 20 weeks in the
      follow-up period. Each participant will receive tildrakizumab 200 mg or tildrakizumab 100 mg
      every 12 weeks up to study Week 244 according to their treatment assignment at the conclusion
      of Part 3 of the base study.
