    <textblock>
      This trial is being conducted to look for following changes when Korean traditional diets is
      taken in subjects with hypertension and type 2 diabetes:

      To evaluate the improvement of the controlling fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin.

      To assess the controlling blood pressure and heart rate.

      To evaluate the influence on cardiovascular risk factor, Triglyceride, cholesterol, High
      Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol and Low-Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol.

      To evaluate the influence on Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase.

      To evaluate the influence on Cardiovascular risk factor.

      To evaluate the influence on valsava score, breathing score and upright score.

      The investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of Korean traditional diets in
      controlling fasting blood glucose fluctuation, blood pressure, and cardiovascular risk
      factors in hypertensive and type 2 diabetic patients who were taking medications prescribed
      for respective diseases in a 12-week.
