  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) secondary to an indwelling urinary catheter is
      defined as an urge to void or discomfort in the supra-pubic region. This symptom complex may
      cause patient agitated and exacerbated postoperative pain. In clinic, dorsal penile nerve
      block (DPNB) was applied for penile surgery including circumcision and some anterior urethra
      surgery. The investigators hypothesize that DPNB relive CRBD for male patients with
      indwelling urinary catheter under general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CRBD is not uncommon in the postoperative period, especially in male patients who have had
      urinary catheterization after anesthetic induction under general anesthesia, and this symptom
      complex may cause patient agitated and exacerbated postoperative pain. According to the
      previous study, i.v. tramadol 1.5 mg/kg administered 30 min before extubation results in
      reduction in the incidence and severity of CRBD. In clinical practice, tramadol is associated
      with side effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, etc. Clinically, dorsal penile nerve
      block (DPNB) was applied in penile surgery, and got satisfactory pain relief effect
      postoperatively without side effects related to tramadol. Besides, we observed patients
      underwent urethra surgery with urinary catheter left in situ seldom complained of CRBD if
      DPNB and RB performed at the end of operation. We hypothesized that DPNB could relieve DPNB
      for male patient with indwelling urinary catheter insertion after induction of general
      anesthesia.

      In this study we compare the efficacy of dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with 0.33%
      ropivacaine and intravenous tramadol 1.5mg/kg in prevention of CRBD, as well as the
      incidences of side effects postoperatively.
