    <textblock>
      In Demark acutely admitted patients are supposed to stay in the Emergency Department (ED) bed
      ward if the anticipated duration of stay is less than 48 hours.

      However, it is not a trivial matter to estimate duration of stay for emergency patients. a
      number of factors affect this, eg. social background, disease, hospital organisation.

      The aim of this study is to analyse whom are the best among the health staff to predict the
      length of stay: ED nurses, admitting doctors og the specialist, and to analyse if a number of
      variables can be used to improve the prediction.
