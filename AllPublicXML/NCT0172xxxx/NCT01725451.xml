    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of deodorant and antiperspirant use and the presence of
      underarm hair on the absorption of testosterone. Each participant in this study will receive
      6 single doses of 30 milligrams (mg) testosterone applied as a solution to each underarm.
      There is a minimum one day washout period between each dose. This study will last
      approximately 24 days not including screening. Screening is required within 30 days prior to
      the start of the study.

    <description>The AUC from time 0 to 72 hours [AUC (0-72)] postdose, based on baseline-corrected concentrations. Baseline-corrected AUC (0-72) was calculated using the measured concentrations of total testosterone minus mean baseline testosterone concentration.

          <description>Participants randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences involving 6 treatments in each sequence. Each sequence involved 4 single-dose treatments of testosterone 2% solution to unshaved axillae with or without the use of deodorant or antiperspirant products followed by 2 single-dose treatments of testosterone 2% solution to shaved axillae with or without the use of deodorant or antiperspirant products. Each of the treatments was followed by 3 days of pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling and 1-day washout except that there was no washout after the last PK sample for the last treatment.</description>
