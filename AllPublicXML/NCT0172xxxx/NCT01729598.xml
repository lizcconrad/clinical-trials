  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of administration and effects of valproic
      acid on clusterin expression in cognitively-intact, healthy, elderly subjects. Clusterin
      mutations have recently been identified as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's
      Disease and changes in clusterin expression are seen in the elderly who develop Alzheimer's
      disease irrespective of whether they carry these genetic mutations or not. Valproic acid may
      prevent or reverse these changes.

      Fourteen subjects with normal memory and thinking will participate in this study. Ten of
      these subjects will receive valproic acid and 4 will receive a &quot;placebo&quot; capsule with no
      active medicine. Participants will take study medication or placebo for 28 days and be
      followed for a total 35 days in this trial.

      This is a placebo-controlled, single-center, multiple ascending dose study. Seven healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled into 2 sequential cohorts, for a total of 14 enrolled subjects.
      The study will be conducted using two doses of valproate (250 mg PO bid, followed by 500 mg
      PO bid). At each dose level, 7 cognitively intact normal elderly subjects will be entered
      into the study with two subjects randomly selected to receive placebo while the other five
      subjects receive the designated dose of valproate.

      Study procedures will include routine assessment of adverse events, safety labs, baseline
      MRI, physical and neurological exams, and cerebrospinal fluid collection.

      Other investigational medication or devices are prohibited during this study.

    <description>Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event reports and the results of vital sign measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests throughout the study. The incidence of observed toxicities and adverse events will be tabulated, the frequencies compared in participants who receive active medication and those who receive placebo, and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.</description>
