  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to address 3 main sets of questions in the bariatric surgery
      population. 1) Does bariatric surgery, without any other intervention, lead to increased
      physical activity and improved physical fitness? 2) Does wearing a pedometer lead to
      increased physical activity in obese individuals prior to and/or after bariatric surgery?
      Does the increased activity result in improvements in physical fitness? 3) Does physical
      activity counseling increase physical activity prior to and or/after bariatric surgery? Does
      the increased activity result in improvements in physical fitness? The overall goal of the
      study is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on physical activity and assess the
      utility of additional interventions to help postoperative patients adopt a more active
      lifestyle. Participants are randomized to usual care, pedometer use, or pedometer use plus
      exercise counseling before and for the first 6 months after bariatric surgery. In an
      extension of the primary study, from 1 to 5 years after surgery, all patients receive
      exercise counseling. Physiological measures will be assessed to determine whether bariatric
      surgery and/or improved physical activity levels result in improved physical fitness.

    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery leads to improvement or resolution of a variety of health conditions. It is
      also well established that physical activity, with or without weight loss, improves many
      health-related problems and can have a positive impact on mood. Therefore, physical activity
      may amplify the health and psychological benefits often experienced from bariatric surgery.
      Prior to surgery many patients are relatively inactive due to physical and social barriers
      associated with their weight. In addition, many patients find it difficult to adopt an active
      lifestyle after surgery, despite an increased capacity to exercise. However, weight loss is
      associated with physical activity after bariatric surgery. Nonetheless, little is known about
      the most effective means to promote activity among this group of individuals. This study will
      examine changes in physical activity and fitness after bariatric surgery and examine whether
      the addition of pedometer use and exercise counseling may lead to greater improvements.
