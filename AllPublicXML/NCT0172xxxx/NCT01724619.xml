  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer represents a significant health problem in the United States. This year
      179,000 men in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate carcinoma and approximately
      25% of them will die of the disease. In addition, the incidence and mortality of prostate
      carcinoma has been increasing steadily in the United States. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      levels are commonly used as a biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer. Nonetheless,
      there is a significant false negative and false positive diagnosis since PSA levels elevate
      in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis and decrease in patients taking medications
      and herbal remedies. Twenty percent of biopsy-proven prostate carcinoma have PSA levels
      within the normal range, thus confounding the diagnosis based on the PSA screening test.
      Current diagnostic methods that include transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and TRUS guided
      prostate biopsy are logistically difficult and insensitive. These are further complicated by
      equivocal prostatic biopsy findings such as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or
      normal PSA with high clinical suspicion. A tracer with high specificity to prostate cancer
      related structures at a cellular level would enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology
      of prostate cancer and would contribute to the detection, localization and quantification of
      the disease and its metastases. This information will be invaluable in selecting the
      appropriate treatment regimen.

      This study will test the utility of [F-18]FMDHT to image prostate cancer and will evaluate if
      this radiotracer can differentiate primary prostate cancer in the prostate gland from normal
      prostate gland itself. More specifically, we will study the distribution kinetics of
      [F-18]FMDHT in normal healthy humans and in patients with prostate cancer.

      As per exploratory IND requirements, we performed toxicity assessment of FMDHT through an
      outside laboratory (ILS, Inc.) and the results of that study are attached as Appendix A.

      Based on our and others data, we hypothesize that:

        1. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT will distribute initially in various normal tissues following blood
           flow pattern and will clear rapidly from tissues with no AR.

        2. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT will detect metastatic disease that expresses AR.

        3. [F-18]FMDHT PET/CT uptake will be elevated in AR-expressing prostate cancer lesions
           compared to surrounding normal prostate.

      In order to progress [F-18]FMDHT into clinic, we are performing a pilot 'first-in-human'
      biodistribution study in subjects with and without prostate cancer.
