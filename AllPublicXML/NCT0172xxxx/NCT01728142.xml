  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Defense Automated Neurobehavioral Assessment (DANA) was recently developed as a durable,
      portable, and &quot;field-hardened&quot; NeuroCognitive Assessment Tool. The purpose of this study is
      to compare the sensitivity of the DANA Brief exam with the Automated Neuropsychological
      Assessment Metrics (ANAM) battery currently used by the military after concussion. The
      primary hypothesis is that the DANA Brief exam will be more sensitive for detecting continued
      impaired cognitive performance than the ANAM during recovery after a concussion.

    <textblock>
      Among active duty military personnel deployed to combat theaters, blast injury is a leading
      cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Service members with TBI can experience notable
      neurological impairments-e.g., attention disturbances, memory and language deficits, and
      delayed reaction time. Cognitive performance can still be impaired 2-4 weeks after concussion
      with no overt physical symptoms. Thus, there is a critical need to have an efficient means to
      determine the incidence of cognitive deficits in service members exposed to or injured by
      blasts. To that end, this study plans to evaluate the ANAM and the DANA to determine which
      neurocognitive test more reliably and accurately detects cognitive impairments during the
      recovery period from a concussion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active-duty U.S. military service members

          -  Clinical diagnosis of concussion/mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (as defined by the
             American Congress of Rehabilitation, 1993, and DoD), made by the treating clinician
             based on clinical history, examination and/or clinical imaging performed as part of
             standard of care. This includes subjects with concussion from any mechanism
             (blast-related, blunt trauma etc.)--for concussed subjects only

          -  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15 as assessed by the consenting research staff--for
             concussed subjects only

          -  Concussive event that occurred within 72 hours of injury (to exclude service members
             presenting due to lingering effects of a previous injury)--for concussed subjects only

          -  Willingness to participate in the study, ability to communicate and comply with the
             study protocol and ability to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history of other mTBI within 90 days, moderate brain injury within the past 3
             years, or any lifetime history of severe brain injury

          -  History of a documented diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or of
             treatment for PTSD

          -  Taking psychoactive medications, opioids, or other significant sedating medication

          -  Individuals with severe psychiatric disorders requiring continuing medication or
             recent treatment for an alcohol or drug dependency

          -  Report a pain level of 8 or greater on the 10-point Likert scale of 1 to 10 (e.g., 8,
             9 or 10).
