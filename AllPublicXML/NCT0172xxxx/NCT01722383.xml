  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects up to 16% of the adult population and is associated with
      significant morbidity and mortality. People at highest risk from progressive CKD are defined
      by a sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and/or the presence of
      significant albuminuria/proteinuria. Accurate mapping of the bio-clinical determinants of
      this group will enable improved risk stratification and direct the development of better
      targeted management for people with CKD. To address these requirements we have established
      the Renal Impairment in Secondary Care (RIISC) study; RIISC is enrolling a cohort of patients
      at high risk from progressive CKD and compiling a comprehensive and detailed bio-clinical
      phenotype, including vascular and oral health phenotyping, at enrolment and on subsequent
      follow-up.
