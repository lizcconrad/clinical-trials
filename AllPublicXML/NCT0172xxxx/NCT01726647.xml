      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to characterize metabolic signatures
      associated with abdominal fat distribution in 40 women with different BMI 29-40 and different
      abdominal distribution of fat (visceral vs. sub-cutaneous fat).

      No intervention with a product is planned. The subjects will be given one high fat meal with
      commercial products (eggs, milk, cream, bread, fruits, cheese and cheese) on one test day to
      test the post-prandial metabolic response.

    <measure>Metabolic plasma, urine and faeces profiles as a function of fat mass distribution</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes from baseline in metabolic profiles at one day following fat meal intake</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolic profiles of plasma, urine and feces samples are obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry.
Fat mass distribution is assessed using CT scan and DXA (Dual X-Ray Energy Absorptiometry).</description>
