  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rigid thoracoscopy is an established procedure for the performance of pleural biopsies for
      undiagnosed pleural effusions. The semirigid thoracoscope is a relatively new instrument
      designed for the same purpose which is claimed to be more user-friendly. The two devices have
      not been compared in a head-to-head trial in published literature. The investigators attempt
      to conduct a randomised comparative trial between the two devices.
