      This study is a double-masked, randomized, parallel group study in patients with open angle
      glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy of the fixed combination of Latanoprost 50
      mcg / mL / brinzolamide 10mg/ml eye drops compared to Latanoprost 50μg/mL eye drops in
      reducing IOP

      The study is divided into two sequential phases. The Phase I trial is a Phase Screening /
      Eligibility, which includes a screening visit, followed by 2 Visits Eligibility (3 visits).
      The Phase II study is the treatment phase randomized, double-masked that includes visits
      during therapy at Week 2, Week 6 and Month 3

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 18 years of age or older, of either gender and of any race / ethnicity,
             diagnosed with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, which in the opinion of the
             investigator does not have enough control with monotherapy or already receiving
             multiple medications for lowering IOP .

          -  Patients should be able to understand and sign an informed consent form that has been
             approved by an Institutional Review Board.

          -  Measurements of mean IOP in at least 1 eye:

               -  ≥ 24 mmHg and ≤ 36 mmHg at timepoint 9am and

               -  ≥ 21 mmHg and ≤ 36 mmHg in the 11h timepoint in both Visits Eligibility 1 and
                  after washout of any medication to reduce IOP.

          -  The mean IOP should not be&gt; 36 mmHg at any timepoint

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fertile women (those not surgically sterile or postmenopausal for at least 1 year) are
             excluded from study participation if meet any of the following conditions:

               1. currently pregnant or

               2. have tested positive in urine pregnancy Screening Visit or

               3. planning to become pregnant during the study period, or

               4. are breastfeeding, or not using highly effective contraceptive precautions.

          -  Patients with angle Schaffer Grade &lt;2, as measured by gonioscopy (extreme narrow angle
             with complete or partial closure).

          -  Patients with a ratio cup / disc greater than 0.80 (horizontal or vertical).

          -  Patients presenting with loss of central visual field impairment. The loss of central
             visual field is defined as a serious sensitivity less than or equal to 10 dB in at
             least four points of two visual field test closest to the point of attachment.

          -  Patients who can not safely discontinue use of all medications to ocular IOP reduction
             for a minimum of 5 days ± 1 day to 28 days ± 1 day prior to Visit E1.

          -  Chronic inflammatory eye disease, recurrent or severe (ie, scleritis, uveitis,
             herpetic keratitis).

          -  Ocular trauma in the past 6 months.

             approximately 20/80 Snellen).

          -  Another ocular pathology (including severe dry eye) that may, in the opinion of the
             investigator, preventing the administration of an alpha-adrenergic agonist and/or an
             inhibitor of topical carbonic anhydrase (CAI).

             insufficiency), active liver or kidney, severe, unstable or uncontrolled that would
             prevent the safe administration of an alpha-adrenergic topic or CAI in the opinion of
             the investigator.

        Related to previous or concomitant medications

          -  Patients with recent use (within 4 weeks of Visit Eligibility 1) salicylate therapy
             with high dose (&gt; 1 g daily).

          -  Current or planned treatment with any psychotropic drug that increases the adrenergic
             response (eg, desipramine, amitriptyline).

          -  Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

          -  Therapy with another investigational agent within 30 days prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Hypersensitivity to the drug alpha-adrenergic agonists, oral or topical CAIs,
             sulfonamide derivatives or any component of the study drugs in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  Less than 30 days regimen with stable administration before the Screening Visit any
             medications or substances administered by any route and used chronically that may
             affect IOP, including among others, β-adrenergic blocking agents.

          -  Use of ocular hypotensive medication any additional topical or systemic throughout the
             study.

          -  Concomitant use of glucocorticoids administered by any route.
