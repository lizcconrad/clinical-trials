             in the study

          5. With the severity of psoriasis defined as moderate to severe, as reflected in meeting
             all the following criteria:

               -  PASI &gt; 10

               -  BSA (body surface area) &gt; 10 %

               -  PGA moderate to severe

          6. With general good health, or a stable medical condition not considered likely to
             interfere with the conduct of the clinical study, as determined by the investigator
             based upon results of medical history, laboratory results and physical examination

          7. Prior therapy with systemic drugs for psoriasis or naïve to systemic treatment but
             identified as a candidate for systemic treatment.

          8. With a complete record of at least 12 months of other previous topical and systemic
             treatments, if any

          9. Adhering to the following wash-out periods Topical treatment Wash-out Period
             Corticosteroids Vitamin A analogues Vitamin D analogues Anthracene derivatives Tar
             Salicylic acid preparations 2 weeks Systemic treatment Biologics with antipsoriatic
             activity 3 months Conventional systemic antipsoriatic drugs and phototherapy 1 month
             Immunosuppressive medication (if not covered by any of the above treatments)
             Cytostatics 6 months Medications with known harmful influences on the kidneys 5 x

             agree to have pregnancy tests while on study medication. Highly effective methods of
             birth control are defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than
             1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables,
             combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner.
             Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically
             sterilized by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or post-menopausal for at
             least two years.

             cell count outside 30 % of the upper or lower limits of normal for the lab

          4. With a history of malignancies except for non melanoma skin cancer

          5. Suffering from significant gastrointestinal problems (ulcers, diarrhea, etc.)

          7. Are detected to have abnormal liver enzymes &gt;2x the upper limit of the normal range

          8. With active infectious disease

          9. On systemic therapy with drugs that may interfere with the investigational products
             taken within the defined wash-out period
