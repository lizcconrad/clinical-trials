      Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent form of secondary hypertension. It is caused
      by autonomous secretion of aldosterone, encompassing a group of disorders which is for 99%
      predominated by unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral adrenal
      hyperplasia (BAH). Diagnosis of PA is relevant for two reasons:

        1. independent of the level of blood pressure, hypertension due to autonomous aldosterone
           secretion causes more cardiovascular damage than essential hypertension;

        2. PA requires specific treatment: adrenalectomy in case of APA and mineralocorticoid
           receptor antagonists (MRA) in case of BAH.

      Although previously presumed a rare condition (prevalence &lt;1%), PA is now estimated to affect
      6 to 20% of the hypertensive population. Given this high prevalence of PA, as well as the
      amount of cardiovascular damage and the available specific treatment, the question is raised
      whether screening of PA should be introduced in Dutch general practice. To answer this
      important question, several issues with regard to PA need to be elucidated:

        1. International studies report a prevalence of PA in general practice of 6-13%. Prevalence
           in the Dutch population is still unknown;

        2. Because of underdiagnosis of PA and long delay in diagnosis of PA after recognition of
           hypertension (mean eight years), data on characteristics of early diagnosed PA are
           lacking. Proof of early cardiovascular damage would strengthen the case of screening for
           PA and needs to be studied;

        3. Consequently, the diagnostic delay has lead to lack of data on optimal treatment in
           early PA. In the current guideline (NHG-guideline 'Cardiovascular risk management') a
           regimen of antihypertensive drugs is advised, and only if hypertension is refractory for
           &gt;6 months patients are referred. It is unknown if hypertension is resistant to therapy
           in the initial phase of PA. If not, this would also argue for early biochemical
           screening for PA, because even if blood pressure is controlled, the detrimental effect
           of aldosterone itself will go on unopposed. It is therefore required to study the
           response to antihypertensive drugs (not MRA) in these patients.

      Rationale: Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most frequent form of secondary hypertension. It
      is caused by autonomous secretion of aldosterone, encompassing a group of disorders which is
      for more than 99% predominated by unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and
      bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Diagnosis of PA is relevant for two reasons: 1)
      independent of the level of blood pressure, hypertension due to autonomous aldosterone
      secretion causes more cardiovascular damage than essential hypertension; 2) PA requires
      specific treatment: adrenalectomy in case of APA and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
      (MRA) in case of BAH.

      Although previously presumed a rare condition (prevalence &lt;1%), PA is now estimated to affect
      6 to 20% of the hypertensive population. Given this high prevalence of PA, as well as the
      amount of cardiovascular damage and the available specific treatment, the question has been
      raised whether screening of PA should be introduced in Dutch general practice. To answer this
      important question, several issues with regard to PA need to be elucidated:

        1. International studies report a prevalence of PA in general practice of 6-13%. Prevalence
           in the Dutch population is still unknown;

        2. Up to now, the laboratory test for screening for PA, the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR),
           is primarily used in secondary care. The relation between the ARR and outcomes in
           primary care is unknown;

        3. Because of underdiagnosis of PA and long delay in diagnosis of PA after recognition of
           hypertension (mean eight years), data on characteristics of early diagnosed PA are
           lacking. Indications of early cardiovascular damage would strengthen the case of
           screening for PA and needs to be studied.
