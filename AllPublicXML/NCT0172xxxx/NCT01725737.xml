    <textblock>
      Although psychostimulant is the first line of drug to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder, (ADHD), actually there are 10-20% ADHD patient do not response well to current
      medication. Most of parents of children with ADHD in Taiwan dislike to use psychostimulant.
      We expect that GlyTI-M will have better efficacy than placebo to reduce ADHD symptoms. This
      study will also help us to understand the mechanism of ADHD and give a way to develop new
      drug and also a more possible way to treat ADHD children under 6 years old.

      The accumulated neuro-image, hereditary and animal studies showed the correlation between
      glutamate transport dysfunction and ADHD psychopathology. However, there is limited clinical
      trial to testify the effect of modulating the NMDA receptor function of glutamate to treat
      ADHD.

      GlyTI-M is an endogenous Glycine transporter I inhibitor, and it acts on the glutamatergic
      synapse to modulate the neurotransmission of N-Methyl-D-Aspertate (NMDA) receptor. This study
      aims to explore the effect of GlyTI-M among children with ADHD.
