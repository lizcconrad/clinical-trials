  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a frequent symptom in children and infants and is one of the most common reasons
      parents visit a healthcare provider for their child. The US Food and Drug Administration has
      issued a warning that over-the-counter cough and cold medicines including antihistamines,
      decongestants, anti-tussives, and expectorants should not be administered to children younger
      than 2 years of age due not only to lack of proven efficacy, but also because of important
      safety concerns. Honey, another method of soothing cough cannot be used in children &lt;1 year
      due to concerns for infantile botulism. A preparation from agave syrup has been created to
      address the need for an infant cough syrup. Although no studies have formally evaluated the
      use of agave nectar for nocturnal cough associated with Upper Respiratory Infections, the
      demulcent effect and sweet taste of agave nectar may provide some relief from cough in
      children.

    <description>Change from baseline in cough frequency between the first night and the end of the second night. Parents/caregivers will complete a Pediatric Cough Questionnaire (a subjective parent report of cough) using a 0-6 point Likert scale with 0=not at all to 6=extremely often to assess frequency of cough. The same parent/caregiver that completed the questionnaire in the clinic will be asked to complete the questionnaire during the follow-up telephone call.</description>
