  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T cells can penetrate virtually every biologic space and have the power to dispose of normal
      or malignant cells as seen in viral and autoimmune diseases and in the rare spontaneous
      remis-sions of cancer. However, T cells are easily tolerized to self or tumor antigens and
      &quot;immune surveillance&quot; has manifestly failed in every cancer that is clinically apparent. It
      is the goal of these studies to supply the specificities and affinities to patient T cells
      without regard for their &quot;endogenous&quot; T cell receptor repertoire, directed by
      antibody-defined recognition to kill malignant cells based on their expression of antigen. We
      will achieve this by preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to
      yield &quot;designer T cells&quot; from normal patient cells. This extends the approach of Anderson,
      Rosenberg and co-workers to introduce or augment expression of genes in patients' T cells in
      a therapeutic setting.

      Prior studies in model systems demonstrated that recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified
      T cells to respond to antigen targets with IL2 secretion, cellular proliferation, and
      cytotoxicity, the hallmarks of an effective, self-sustaining immune response. It therefore
      becomes of paramount interest to extend these studies to a human system of widespread
      clinical relevance to explore the clinical potential of this new technology. The target
      antigen for these studies is carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) which is predominantly expressed
      on tumors of the colon and rectum, breast, pancreas and other sites.

      CEA is perhaps the most prominent tumor marker among malignancies of epithelial origin:
      colorectal carcinoma, with 60-94% of tumors positive in patients with advanced disease;
      breast carcinoma, with 30-60% of metastatic cases positive for CEA; and cancers of the lung,
      liver, pancreas, head and neck, bladder, cervix and prostate with 30% or more with CEA+
      tumors.

      The application of these therapies in the four Phase II/Pilot clinical sub studies listed
      below proceed after collecting patient lymphocytes by leukapheresis, which are then modified
      by transfer of the chimeric gene for Ig-CD28-TCRzeta. Cells are selected in culture with
      amplification and activation of the now-specific anti-tumor T cells. These are then re
      infused into the patients, with IL2 supplementation, and toxicity and response are monitored.

      There are four sub studies embedded within this Phase II Study of Second Generation Designer
      T Cells in CEA-expressing Adenocarcinomas. The embedded studies are:

        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Gastric Cancers
           (CEA-G)

        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Colorectal
           Cancers (CEA-C)

        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Lung Cancers
           (CEA-L)

        -  A Phase II Pilot Study of Second Generation Anti CEA Designer T Cells in Solid Tumors
           (CEA-S)

      A total of 12 subjects per protocol or a total of 48 subjects will be enrolled combining the
      enrollment of the 4 CEA-expressing protocols.

             other evaluable disease.

          -  Tumor must be CEA-expressing as demonstrated by elevated serum CEA levels(&gt;10 ng/ml).
             Preference will be given to patients with CEA &gt;100 ng/mL to increase the sensitivity
             of CEA as a measure of the tumor response.

        Where preserved tumor tissue is available, direct immuno¬histochemical staining of tumor is
        obtained to demonstrate CEA expression on tumor cells.

             to practice birth control.

          -  Patients with serious or unstable renal, hepatic, pulmonary, cardio¬vascular,
             endocrine, rheumatologic, or allergic disease based on history, physical exam and
