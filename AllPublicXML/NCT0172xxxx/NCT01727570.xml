    <textblock>
      To determine the impact of nutritional supplementation with whey protein on postoperative
      functional capacity in patients undergoing colorectal surgery for cancer.It is hypothesized
      that, compared with a control group receiving nutrition counselling only, patients receiving
      nutritional counselling along with preoperative and postoperative nutritional supplements
      will have a significantly improved change in functional walking capacity from baseline to 8
      weeks after surgery.

      The aims of this research project are the following:

        1. Determine to what extent a nutritional prehabilitation regimen, which includes whey
           protein, initiated before surgery and continued after surgery, optimizes the recovery of
           functional walking capacity following colorectal resection for cancer.

        2. To understand further which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to
           prehabilitation interventions, and predict change in later outcome measures.

    <description>Change in functional walking capacity will be assessed throughout the study according to the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). The 6MWT evaluates the ability of an individual to maintain a moderate level of physical activity over a time period reflective of the activities of daily living. Subjects are instructed to walk back and forth, in a 20 m stretch of hallway, for six minutes, at a pace that would make them tired by the end of the walk; encouragement and feedback are given according to published guidelines.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to fill out a three day record of all food and drink consumed. An appointment with the nutritionist will be given approximately 4 weeks before surgery to go over their regular diet and advice will be given on how to improve the nutritional quality of the diet. Patients will also be given a supply of nutritional supplements to take orally (by mouth) every day. These supplements include a whey protein isolate (Immunocal®, Immunotec Inc), omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil, and vitamins/minerals.</description>
