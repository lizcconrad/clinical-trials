  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meniere's disease is a chronic illness that affects a substantial number of patients every
      year worldwide. The disease is characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo lasting from
      minutes to hours, with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure.
      It has recently been suggested that viral etiologies specially Herpes virus might be the
      underlying reason. The investigators study is a randomized, double- blinded
      placebo-controlled clinical trial in Amiralam Hospital. In this study the primary objective
      is to assess efficacy of Acyclovir in control of symptoms in patients with Meniere's disease
      specially their vertigo attacks. Inclusion criteria would be patient's willingness to
      participate in the study and follow ups, being 18 years old or older, having at least 2
      vertigos per month each at least 20 min, interfering with function, and not on medication for
      Meniere's disease for at least 3 months before the trial. They should not have any history of
      allergy to Acyclovir, renal insufficiency or Creatinine above 1.5 mg/dl, hepatic enzymes more
      than three times normal, serious uncontrolled illness, be pregnant or nursing or have
      previous surgeries on Endolymphatic Sac. Participants will be randomly placed in 2 different
      arms getting either Acyclovir 400 mg or placebo (inert ingredient). They will take the
      medication for 10 days 5 times a day, then 3 times a day for next 10 days, and 2 times a day
      for the last 10 days. Patients will report changes in their symptoms 10 days after initiating
      the drug and in 1, 3, 6 month intervals.

Patients would receive the medication in 2 sessions, first in the beginning of the study and the rest after 10 days. This way it would boost their compliance, and physicians would be aware of possible complications. Patients will report changes in their symptoms 10 days after initiating the drug and in 1, 3, and 6 month intervals. All changes in frequency and duration of vertigo attacks are recorded, and their tinnitus and aural fullness is recorded in a 0(with no symptom) to 4 (very severe) scale.</description>
