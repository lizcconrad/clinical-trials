  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate whether repeating a screening Molecular Breast
      Imaging (MBI) study two years after an initial screening MBI study further improves breast
      cancer detection in women with dense breast tissue.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Past prior screening mammogram within the previous 11-24 months interpreted as
        heterogeneously dense or extremely dense and negative or benign [Breast Imaging Reporting
        and Data System (BI-RADS) Category 1 or 2]

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded if they:

          -  Are physically unable to sit upright and still for 40 minutes

          -  Have self-reported signs or symptoms that may suggest breast cancer (palpable mass,
             bloody nipple discharge, axillary mass, etc.)

          -  Have had needle biopsy within 3 months, or breast surgery or radiation within 1 year
             prior to the study
