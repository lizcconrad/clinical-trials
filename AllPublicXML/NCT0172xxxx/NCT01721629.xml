    <description>The CPAP is taken off at the morning ward round. If the discontinuation of the CPAP fails according to prespecified failure criteria, CPAP is recommenced and continued for at least 24 hours. Then a new evaluation takes place and if the infant again meets the inclusion criteria another attempt of sudden wean can be undertaken. Infants are considered successfully weaned if they are off CPAP for three days.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Gradual wean of nasal CPAP pressure</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The reduction of the CPAP pressure begins at the morning ward round and the pressure is reduced in steps with 1 cmH2O maximum once a day. Each time the pressure is to be reduced the infant needs to be evaluated according to the inclusion criteria and only if these are still met, will the pressure be reduced. When a CPAP pressure at 4 cmH2O is reached the infant is treated with this pressure for 24 hours and then the CPAP is discontinued. Infants are considered successfully weaned if they are off CPAP for three days.</description>
