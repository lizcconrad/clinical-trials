  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of flexible,
      once-daily doses of paliperidone extended-release (ER) in patients with schizophrenia from
      Argentina and Colombia that previously failed treatment with other antipsychotic agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm (one group of patients), open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) multicenter 6-month study. Throughout the study flexible dosing of paliperidone
      ER in a range of 3 to 12 mg/day may be used. Flexible dosing will allow investigators to
      adjust the dosage of each patient based on the individual needs. Patients will receive 3, 6,
      9 or 12 mg of paliperidone ER once daily for 6 months. The tablets will be taken orally.
      Adjustment of the dosage will be done at the investigator's discretion, based on the
      individual patient's clinical response and tolerability to the study drug.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Positive Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS Positive Subscale assesses seven positive-symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Negative Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS Negative Subscale assesses seven negative-symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - General Psychopathology Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS General Psychopathology Subscale Score assesses 16 general psychopathology symptoms. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 16 (absent) to 112 (extreme psychopathology).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a patient. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>This PSP assesses the degree of a patient's dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i, absent to vi, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on the four domains there will be one total score. Patients with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; =&lt; 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Status as Measured by Self-rated Health Status Survey SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is designed to examine a person's perceived health status. The SF-36 includes one multi-item scale measuring eight health concepts: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role-, emotional role-, social role functioning, and mental health. Answers to each question are scored and summed to produce raw scale scores for each health concept which are then transformed to a 0 - 100 scale, a high score defining a more favorable health state. An aggregate summary measure is calculated by averaging the scores from the eight health concepts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Evaluation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>This self-administered scale rates the quality of sleep. Patients will indicate on an 11-point scale how well they have slept in the previous 7 days, from 0 (very badly) to 10 (very well).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daytime Drowsiness Evaluation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>This self-administered scale rates the daytime drowsiness. Patients will indicate on an 11-point scale how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (all the time).</description>

          <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>This PSP assesses the degree of a patient’s dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i, absent to vi, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on the four domains there will be one total score. Patients with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; =&lt; 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

          <title>Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale</title>
          <description>This PSP assesses the degree of a patient’s dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (i, absent to vi, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Based on the four domains there will be one total score. Patients with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; =&lt; 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision.</description>

        <title>Health Status as Measured by Self-rated Health Status Survey SF-36</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is designed to examine a person’s perceived health status. The SF-36 includes one multi-item scale measuring eight health concepts: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role-, emotional role-, social role functioning, and mental health. Answers to each question are scored and summed to produce raw scale scores for each health concept which are then transformed to a 0 – 100 scale, a high score defining a more favorable health state. An aggregate summary measure is calculated by averaging the scores from the eight health concepts.</description>
