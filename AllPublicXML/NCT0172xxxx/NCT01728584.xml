  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the use of deep or standard neuromuscular
      blockade (NMB) in combination with low or standard insufflation pressure in participants
      undergoing a surgical procedure, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Insufflation refers to the
      injection of carbon dioxide into the abdomen during the laparoscopic surgery, to allow
      visualization of and access to the surgical field. The primary hypothesis of the study is
      that the use of sustained deep NMB improves the surgeon's overall satisfaction with surgical
      conditions as compared to standard NMB. The in-patient surgery is performed on Day 1 and the
      participant remains hospitalized for at least 48 hours following the surgery (or at least 24
      hours following the surgery, if local practice does not allow 48 hours of hospitalization
      post surgery). On Day 8, a follow-up visit/contact including all participants occurs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During procedure, surgeon (who was blinded to random assignment) could request that unblinded
      anesthetist change the randomized treatment conditions (called a &quot;rescue intervention&quot;), if
      surgeon considered surgical conditions to be unacceptable. This was to be done systematically
      as follows: If the participant is on standard NMB, the preferred rescue intervention should
      be to increase the NMB to a depth of 1-2 PTCs; for such a participant the second option (if
      participant is also on low insufflation pressure) should be the increase of insufflation
      pressure by 4 mmHg. If the participant is already on deep NMB, the preferred option should be
      (if participant is also on low insufflation pressure) the increase of insufflation pressure
      by 4 mmHg.

    <description>Participants rated pain at 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours after the administration of sugammadex on day of surgery (Day 1), and daily from Day 3 to Day 8. Pain rating was made using an 11-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). Separate ratings were made for overall pain at rest, pain when provoked (e.g., due to participant transition from lying to sitting position) and shoulder pain at rest.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized to 4 arms based on combinations of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) depth and insufflation pressure level. During procedure, blinded surgeon could request that unblinded anesthetist change the randomized treatment conditions (“rescue intervention”), if surgeon considered surgical conditions to be unacceptable.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>At the end of the procedure the surgeon responds to the following question, using an 11-point scale from 0 (poor, needed intervention) to 10 (excellent): &quot;How satisfied were you overall with the surgical conditions related to anesthesia and pneumoperitoneum during the surgery you just performed?&quot; If at any time the surgeon requests a rescue intervention, the overall assessment of surgical conditions should be rated as 0 (=poor, needed intervention). The surgeon will rate the surgical conditions according to his opinion but if a rescue intervention has been applied, that individual participant will be counted with a score of zero in the analysis.</description>

          <title>Score on Surgeon's Assessment of Overall Satisfaction With the Surgical Conditions: By Treatment Arm</title>
          <description>At the end of the procedure the surgeon responds to the following question, using an 11-point scale from 0 (poor, needed intervention) to 10 (excellent): &quot;How satisfied were you overall with the surgical conditions related to anesthesia and pneumoperitoneum during the surgery you just performed?&quot; If at any time the surgeon requests a rescue intervention, the overall assessment of surgical conditions should be rated as 0 (=poor, needed intervention). The surgeon will rate the surgical conditions according to his opinion but if a rescue intervention has been applied, that individual participant will be counted with a score of zero in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Participant's Overall Average Pain Score in the First 24 Hours After Administration of Sugammadex: By Depth of NMB (Standard, Deep) and Insufflation Pressure (Standard, Low)</title>
        <description>Participants rated pain at 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours after the administration of sugammadex on day of surgery (Day 1), and daily from Day 3 to Day 8. Pain rating was made using an 11-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). Separate ratings were made for overall pain at rest, pain when provoked (e.g., due to participant transition from lying to sitting position) and shoulder pain at rest. The participant’s overall average pain score within 24 hours after sugammadex was the average of all pain assessments (including all 3 pain types assessed) at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours after sugammadex dose.</description>

The participant’s overall average pain score within 24 hours after sugammadex was the average of all pain assessments (including all 3 pain types assessed) at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hours after sugammadex dose.</description>
          <population>Randomized participants with available data who had NMB or pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopic surgery, or received sugammadex, and did not convert to open surgery before NMB and/or pressure.

        <title>Number of Participants With Rescue Actions Performed During Surgery in Order to Improve Insufficient Surgical Conditions: By Treatment Arm</title>
        <description>During procedure, surgeon (who was blinded to random assignment) could request that unblinded anesthetist change the randomized treatment conditions (called a “rescue intervention”), if surgeon considered surgical conditions to be unacceptable. This was to be done systematically as follows: If the participant is on standard NMB, the preferred rescue intervention should be to increase the NMB to a depth of 1-2 PTCs; for such a participant the second option (if participant is also on low insufflation pressure) should be the increase of insufflation pressure by 4 mm Hg. If the participant is already on deep NMB, the preferred option should be (if participant is also on low insufflation pressure) the increase of insufflation pressure by 4 mm Hg. The unblinded anesthetist recorded any rescue actions performed. This measure presents the number of participants: with any rescue action performed, with rescue change in depth of NMB, with rescue change in insufflation pressure level.</description>

        <description>Participants rated pain at 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours after the administration of sugammadex on day of surgery (Day 1), and daily (in the morning) from Day 3 to Day 8.

Separate ratings were made for overall pain at rest, pain when provoked (e.g., due to participant transition from lying to sitting position) and shoulder pain at rest.

          <title>Participant's Daily Assessment of Shoulder Pain During Post Operative Period: By Treatment Arm</title>
          <description>Participants rated pain at 1, 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours after the administration of sugammadex on day of surgery (Day 1), and daily (in the morning) from Day 3 to Day 8. Pain rating was made using an 11-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). Separate ratings were made for overall pain at rest, pain when provoked (e.g., due to participant transition from lying to sitting position) and shoulder pain at rest. This measure summarizes the assessment of shoulder pain for the study days following the surgery.</description>
