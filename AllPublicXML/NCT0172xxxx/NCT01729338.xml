  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the overall response rate (ORR), defined as
      partial response (PR) or better at any time during induction therapy. The success of the
      therapy will be determined by ORR with strong consideration given to the secondary endpoints
      of tolerability, duration of response, and quality of life (QOL).

      All patients will be treated with the same experimental regimen. Several novel features are
      being explored: the substitution of cyclophosphamide for melphalan; once weekly AND
      subcutaneous bortezomib instead of standard twice weekly, intravenous dosing; and alternating
      bortezomib and lenalidomide in maintenance.

      The investigators hypothesize that this regimen will prove to be tolerable and effective in
      inducing and maintaining remission in a patient population that is historically very
      difficult to treat, namely Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients who are too elderly or suffer
      comorbidities, such as renal insufficiency, that otherwise complicate aggressive therapies
      like autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). In short, the investigators view this as
      the &quot;Multiple Myeloma trial for non-trial candidates.&quot;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 35 patients will be accrued to this single arm, open label, phase II trial over a
      period of about 18 months, studying induction chemotherapy with VELCADE, cyclophosphamide and
      dexamethasone administered on an attenuated dosing schedule to accommodate non-candidates for
      high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation - an often frail patient
      population. Maintenance therapy will follow with alternating lenalidomide and VELCADE. All
      patients should receive antiviral (zoster) prophylaxis, and peptic ulcer prophylaxis is
      recommended. Aspirin and/or anticoagulation are left to study physician discretion. All
      patients will be treated with the same experimental regimen. Several novel features are being
      explored: the substitution of cyclophosphamide for melphalan; once weekly AND subcutaneous
      bortezomib instead of standard twice weekly, intravenous dosing; and alternating bortezomib
      and lenalidomide in maintenance. The overarching aim is to preserve efficacy while minimizing
      toxicity and inconvenience to this often frail patient population.

    <measure>Functionality as Assessed Using the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Geriatric Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mean functionality in study subjects, quantitatively scored using the standardized and validated Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Geriatric Assessment Tool, which comprehensively assesses aspects of a patient's functionality such as symptoms (e.g., pain, anxiety), social support (e.g., someone to turn to for help), and ability to carry out routine activities (e.g., grocery shopping) or physical exertion (e.g., climbing stairs) was assessed at baseline.
The score is obtained by inserting patient-specific data into the online calculator found at http://www.mycarg.org/Chemo_Toxicity_Calculator, which is based on the risk score described in Hurria A, Togawa K, Mohile SG, et al. Predicting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer: a prospective multicenter study. J Clin Oncol. 2011;29(25):3457-3465.
The risk score ranges from 0-19, with 0-5 indicating low risk, 6-9 intermediate risk, and 10-19 high risk for severe (grade &gt;2) toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Risk Score as Assessed Using the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Geriatric Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Calculation of the risk score requires that the patient be assessed with the CALGB Assessment Tool, which has both a patient self-reporting questionnaire and a clinician assessment. Both will be used in this trial, and thus patients will have risk scores based on their own self-assessments and risk scores based on the clinicians' assessment. The risk score ranges from 0-19, with 0-5 indicating low risk, 6-9 intermediate risk, and 10-19 high risk. The distribution of the risk score in this trial will be described by plotting the median of the risk score against time, with patient and clinician assessments overlaid on the same plot.</description>

Question 30: How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?
7 point scores are standardized to a scale of 0-100, where 100 means highest possible quality.</description>

        <description>Mean functionality in study subjects, quantitatively scored using the standardized and validated Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) Geriatric Assessment Tool, which comprehensively assesses aspects of a patient's functionality such as symptoms (e.g., pain, anxiety), social support (e.g., someone to turn to for help), and ability to carry out routine activities (e.g., grocery shopping) or physical exertion (e.g., climbing stairs) was assessed at baseline.
The score is obtained by inserting patient-specific data into the online calculator found at http://www.mycarg.org/Chemo_Toxicity_Calculator, which is based on the risk score described in Hurria A, Togawa K, Mohile SG, et al. Predicting chemotherapy toxicity in older adults with cancer: a prospective multicenter study. J Clin Oncol. 2011;29(25):3457-3465.
The risk score ranges from 0-19, with 0-5 indicating low risk, 6-9 intermediate risk, and 10-19 high risk for severe (grade &gt;2) toxicity.</description>

        <description>Calculation of the risk score requires that the patient be assessed with the CALGB Assessment Tool, which has both a patient self-reporting questionnaire and a clinician assessment. Both will be used in this trial, and thus patients will have risk scores based on their own self-assessments and risk scores based on the clinicians’ assessment. The risk score ranges from 0-19, with 0-5 indicating low risk, 6-9 intermediate risk, and 10-19 high risk. The distribution of the risk score in this trial will be described by plotting the median of the risk score against time, with patient and clinician assessments overlaid on the same plot.</description>
