    <textblock>
      Objective of the REAL PTX trial is to compare paclitaxel-eluting stents to paclitaxel-eluting
      balloons for treating symptomatic peripheral artery disease of the femoropopliteal artery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The REAL PTX trial has been designed as prospective, randomized, multi-center, post-market
      study investigating the effect of the paclitaxel-eluting stent Zilver® PTX® (DES)in
      comparison to the use of a paclitaxel eluting balloon (DEB)in treating symptomatic peripheral
      artery disease of the femoropopliteal artery.

      Up to 150 patients will be enrolled in Germany and Belgium. Enrollment is expected to be
      completed within approximately six months of initiating the study.

      One group (DES or DEB) will be considered to yield significantly better results of the
      primary patency rate than the other group at 12 months follow up.
