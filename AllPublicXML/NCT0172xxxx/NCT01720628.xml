      Objectives: Behçet's disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis. Since vascular endothelial
      dysfunction plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease, we considered
      angiogenic cytokines as an interesting target for investigation in BD. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the possible role of angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the pathogenesis of BD.

      Design and Methods: Sixty five patients with BD and 21 healthy control subjects were included
      in the study. Serum angiogenin, bFGF and VEGF concentrations were determined by using in
      vitro enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instructions.

    <description>The median serum angiogenin level was significantly higher in all patients with BD than controls (P=0.001). However there was no statistically significant difference between all patients and patients with or without ocular involvement. The mean serum bFGF and the median serum VEGF levels were higher in patients with ocular involvement than all patients, patients without ocular involvement and controls. But these differences did not reach statistical significance.</description>
