  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Left valvular heart disease has become one of the most common heart disease in Western
      countries. This disease evolve over many years and are characterized by a long phase where
      the patient is &quot;asymptomatic&quot;.

      it is characterized by discomfort LV filling may worsen and lead typically to a pressure
      increase of LV pressure and the left atrium (LA) (1). The onset of symptoms is unpredictable
      and may occur at the stage of diastolic or systolic dysfunction.

      Ventricular dysfunction may be insidious, the goal is to detect early dysfunction, knowing
      that it is often very difficult to know if the patient is actually symptomatic. The onset of
      symptoms sign an intolerance to the increase in LV filling pressures and LA , causing
      pulmonary hypertension .

      Therefore, the study of the level of LV and LA filling pressures , if possible by a
      noninvasive method, would identify patients apparently asymptomatic even though their
      condition is advanced.

      Pressures filling pressures can be explored by two methods:

        -  cardiac catheterization, which is a direct and invasive measurement method

        -  echocardiography, which is an indirect measurement method which has the advantage of
           being non-invasive The goal of this research is to compare the two methods.
