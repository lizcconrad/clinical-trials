  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transition is the planned movement of teens with chronic conditions from child-centered to
      adult-oriented healthcare. National bodies have published detailed guidelines about the
      importance of helping teens move to adult healthcare. However, there is no research regarding
      how to best organize and deliver Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) transition programs. Data is
      urgently needed. Therefore, the aim of this program is to develop research evidence that will
      better prepare health care providers to improve how they can help adolescents with
      transition.

      This project will determine whether a nurse-led transition intervention program is better at
      preparing teens with CHD to independently manage their medical care, compared to the care
      that is currently provided. The most important finding of this study will be whether or not
      these teens subsequently attend the adult cardiology clinic that specializes in CHD problems,
      and the timing of when they attend.

      Hypothesis: A transition intervention in combination with usual care, improved time to first
      Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) clinic attendance compared to usual care alone.
