    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK2890457 in humans. The study will be conducted
      in 3 parts: - Part A (conducted at a single investigative site) will determine the safety and
      tolerability of GSK2890457 alone in healthy subjects during six weeks of dosing, as well as
      evaluating the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with metformin. Part A consists of
      Screening, Treatment (6 weeks) and Follow-up periods. - Part B (conducted at multiple sites)
      will determine safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics (PD) in subjects with Type 2
      diabetes (T2D) when co-dosed for six weeks with liraglutide (Victoza). Part B consists of
      Screening, Run-in (1 week), Stabilization (12 weeks), Treatment (6 weeks) and Follow-up
      periods. - Part C (conducted at multiple sites) will determine safety, tolerability, and PD
      in subjects with T2D when co-dosed for 6 weeks with metformin. Part C consists of Screening,
      Run-in (1 week), Stabilization (12 weeks), Treatment (6 weeks) and Follow-up periods.

        <description>Hypoglycemia is defined as symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia (e.g. dizziness, light-headedness, shakiness) which are confirmed by glucometer measurement of complete blood count (CBG) or plasma glucose value of &lt;50 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) for Part A or &lt;70 mg/dL for Parts B and C (when possible, CBG values were confirmed with a laboratory measurement). In situations when no glucose sample could be measured at the time of the event, the investigator, at his or her discretion, characterized an event as ‘hypoglycemia’ based on reported signs and symptoms alone.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), ALT, Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Gamma Glutamyltransferase (GGT) During Double-blind Treatment Period of Part A</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

            <description>Healthy participants received oral dose of matching placebo to GSK2890457 as units of 5 g kit BID for 6 weeks. Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg IR tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters of ALP, ALT, AST and GGT During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <description>The electrolytes include calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide content/bicarbonate, potassium, magnesium and sodium. Assessments were done pre-dose at on Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg IR tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters of Electrolytes, Glucose Phosphorus Inorganic, BUN and Cholesterol During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>The electrolytes include calcium, chloride, carbon dioxide content/bicarbonate, potassium, magnesium and sodium. Assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters of Direct Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin, Creatinine and Uric Acid During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg IR tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameters of Albumin and Total Protein During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters of Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Total Neutrophils, Platelet Count, WBC Count During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

            <description>Participants with T2D, received oral dose of GSK2890457 as units of 5 g kit BID for 6 weeks. Each unit of 5 g kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. Participants continued their usual dose of metformin during the treatment period along with GSK2890457, taken one hour prior to GSK2890457 as once daily or BID.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters of Basophils, Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Total Neutrophils, Platelet Count, WBC Count During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
          <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

            <description>Healthy participants received oral dose of matching placebo to GSK2890457 as units of 5 g kit BID for 6 weeks. Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg IR tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters of Hemoglobin and MCHC During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Hematology Parameters of RBC Count and Reticulocytes During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
          <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

          <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Urinalyisis Dipstick and Microscopic Results During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part A</title>
        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Only those parameters for which at least one value of abnormal urinalysis result was reported are summarized. The participants were categorized as rare, trace, +1, 2+, RBC’s and WBC’s as &lt;1, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Protein concentration ranged from trace to 1+, where trace indicated lowest concentration and 1+ indicated highest concentration. Trace was the highest concentration for occult blood. Bacteria concentration ranged from rare to moderate, where rare indicated lowest concentration and moderate indicated highest concentration. Ketones ranged from trace to 1+, where trace indicated lowest concentration and 1+ indicated highest concentration. RBC and WBC ranged from &lt;1 to 4, where &lt;1 indicated lowest concentration and 4 indicated highest concentration. Highest concentration indicated worse outcome.</description>

            <description>Healthy participants received oral dose of matching placebo to GSK2890457 as units of 5 g kit BID for 6 weeks. Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) prior to breakfast (morning) and 10 g (2 unit) prior to dinner (evening). On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg immediate release (IR) tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Only those parameters for which at least one value of abnormal urinalysis result was reported are summarized. The participants were categorized as few, trace, +1, 2+, 3+, 0-3, 10-20, 0-5, 6-10, and 20-40. Few was the highest concentration of bacteria. Occult blood ranged from trace to 1+, trace indicated lowest and 1+ indicated highest concentration. Epithelial cell ranged from 0-5 to 10-20, 0-5 indicated lowest and 10-20 indicated highest concentration. Glucose ranged from trace to 3+, trace indicated lowest and 3+ indicated highest concentration. 0-5 was highest concentration for hyaline casts. Ketone ranged from trace to 1+, trace indicated lowest and 1+ indicated highest concentration. RBC and WBC ranged from 0-3 to 20-40, 0-3 indicated lowest and 20-40 indicated highest concentration. Highest concentration indicated worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. The participants were categorized as few, many, moderate, trace, +1, 2+, 3+, 0-3, 10-20, 0-5, 6-10, 20-40, 40-60. Protein and ketone ranged from trace to 1+, trace indicated lowest and 1+ indicated highest concentration. Bacteria and uric acid crystals ranged from few to moderate, few indicated lowest and moderate indicated highest concentration. Trace was the highest concentration of occult blood. Epithelial cells ranged from 0-5 to &gt;10, 0-5 indicated lowest and &gt;10 indicated highest concentration. Glucose ranged from trace to 3+, trace indicated lowest and 3+ indicated highest concentration. 0-1 was highest concentration for hyaline casts. RBC and WBC ranged from 0-3 to 40-60, 0-3 indicated lowest and 20-40 indicated highest concentration. Highest concentration indicated worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Sign Parameter of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part A</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessments were performed after resting in a supine or semi-supine position for at least 10 minutes. The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vital Sign Parameter of SBP and DBP During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>Vital sign assessments were performed after resting in a supine or semi-supine position for at least 10 minutes. The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <description>Vital sign assessments were performed after resting in a supine or semi-supine position for at least 10 minutes. The assessments were done pre-dose at Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42. Baseline value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg IR tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Intervals During Part A</title>
        <description>Single 12-lead ECGs was obtained after participants rested in a supine position for at least 10 minutes using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the HR and measured PR, QRS, QT, QT duration corrected for HR by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) and QT duration corrected for HR by Bazett’s formula (QTcB intervals. The assessments were done at Day 1 (pre-dose, triplicate), Day 42 (pre-dose) and Follow-up Visit. Baseline value was defined as the average of the triplicate pre-dose assessments done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 42 and Follow-up) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

            <description>Healthy participants received oral dose of matching placebo to GSK2890457 as units of 5 g kit BID for 6 weeks. Each unit of 5 g placebo kit contained 3 sachets of powder and a bottle containing 3 capsules. The powder was mixed with 12 ounces of flavored water, capsules were taken with 120-240 mL of water. The participants were titrated up from 15 g to 40 g over a 7 day period, if tolerated. On Day 2 the dose was 15 g, taken 5 g (1 unit) in morning and 10 g (2 unit) in evening. On Day 4, 15 g (3 unit doses) in morning and 15 g (3 unit doses) in evening. On Day 7, 20 g (4 unit doses) in morning and 20 g (4 unit doses) in evening. On Day 1 and 42, after overnight fasting, participants received 500 mg IR tablet of metformin just before breakfast. On Day 1 (5 g) and Day 42, matching placebo to GSK2890457 was given in the evening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Intervals During Part B and C</title>
        <description>Single 12-lead ECGs was obtained after participants rested in a supine position for at least 10 minutes using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the HR and measured PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, QTcF and RR intervals. The assessments were done at Day -1 (pre-dose, triplicate), Day 42 (pre-dose) and Follow-up Visit. Baseline value was defined as the average of the triplicate pre-dose assessments done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 42 and Follow-up) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Overall Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) Score During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part A</title>
        <description>The impact of GI symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the GSRS. The GSRS is a 15-item related to abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation syndromes, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Overall GSRS was the mean of items 1 to 15. Possible overall scores range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to GI symptoms and higher scores indicating a lower quality of life with respect to GI symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, 14 and 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Overall Gastrointestinal (GI) Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS) Score During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part A</title>
          <description>The impact of GI symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the GSRS. The GSRS is a 15-item related to abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation syndromes, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Overall GSRS was the mean of items 1 to 15. Possible overall scores range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to GI symptoms and higher scores indicating a lower quality of life with respect to GI symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, 14 and 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing.</description>

        <description>During the assessment of body weight in the unit, the participant wore lightweight indoor clothing and removed shoes. The assessments were done pre-dose at Day -1, Day 1, Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, Day 42 and Day 43. Baseline value was defined as the average of Day -1 and Day 1 values. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-Baseline (Day 7, Day 14, Day 28 and Day 42) values. If either the Baseline or post-Baseline value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to be missing. Day 42 value was the average of Day 42 and Day 43 values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Glucose Area Under the Curves From Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC [0-24 Hours]) During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>AUC was calculated using the linear trapezoid method that is the sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments at the time points (at Day -1 and Day 42). The weighted mean was then calculated by dividing the AUC by the length of the time interval over which it was calculated. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline (Day -1) values from the post-Baseline value (Day 42). Data is reported for weighted mean glucose AUC (0-4 hour) post-breakfast and AUC (0-24 hour) post-breakfast. Adjusted mean is reported as least square (LS) mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Fasting Insulin and Weighted Mean Insulin AUC (0-4 Hour) and AUC (0-24 Hour) During the Double-blind Treatment Period of Part B and C</title>
        <description>Two fasting samples 5 minutes apart were taken for insulin. Baseline insulin level was the average of the 2 fasting samples. For insulin weighted mean AUC (0-4 hour) and weighted mean AUC (0-24 hour) was calculated for Baseline (Day -1) and end of treatment (Day 42). AUC was calculated using the linear trapezoid method that is the sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments at the time points (at Day -1 and Day 42). The weighted mean was then calculated by dividing the AUC by the length of the time interval over which it was calculated. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline (Day -1) values from the post-Baseline value (Day 42). Data is reported for weighted mean insulin AUC (0-4 hour) post-breakfast and AUC (0-24 hour) post-breakfast.</description>

        <description>HOMA-IR was calculated from the Day -1 and Day 42 fasting glucose and insulin values using dataset generated from the HOMA-2 model. It contained the estimates for HOMA-% insulin sensitivity (S) for pairs of fasting glucose and fasting insulin values. Study data was merged with the HOMA dataset by glucose and insulin. HOMA-IR was calculated as 100/HOMA-%S. HOMA-IR was not determined for any values outside the ranges of plasma glucose 3.5 to 25.0 mmol/L (63 – 450 mg/dL) and plasma insulin 20 to 400 pmol/L. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline (Day -1) values from the post-Baseline value (Day 42). Data for Part C of the study was not collected because fasting glucose and insulin were not available at the specified time points.</description>
