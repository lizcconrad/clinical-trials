    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether patients who receive regular physical therapy immediately
      following a modified neck dissection surgery will report decreased shoulder disability,
      decreased pain, improved or maintained shoulder range of motion and strength, and improved
      quality of life than those who receive only home instruction.
