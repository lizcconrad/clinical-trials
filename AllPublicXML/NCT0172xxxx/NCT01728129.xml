  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the sensitivity of the DANA Rapid exam with the MACE
      cognitive score. The primary hypothesis is that the DANA Rapid exam will be more sensitive
      for detecting impaired cognitive performance than the MACE cognitive score in the setting of
      a clinical diagnosis of concussion at the point of injury in the combat setting. A secondary
      purpose of this study is to examine a serial performance on the DANA Rapid exam in those
      subjects diagnosed with a concussion. The secondary hypothesis is that the DANA Rapid exam
      will show improvements in performance during the recovery period after concussion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), over 60% of combat casualties
      have been the result of explosive blasts, and many of these critical injuries involve trauma
      to the head. As a result, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been deemed a &quot;signature wound&quot; of
      OIF and OEF. The symptoms of head injuries, particularly of concussion/mild TBI (mTBI), can
      be sever but subtle, suggesting that early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to a wounded
      warrior's appropriate medical care. Most first providers in the war theater are medics who
      could benefit from an improved diagnostic test to better identify service members with
      concussion/mTBI. The MACE cognitive test is heavily weighted towards memory, is not 100%
      specific, and does not preclude a diagnosis of concussion being rendered despite a score in
      the normal range. Thus, an objective test of neurocognitive function, such as the DANA Rapid,
      that can be rapidly administered in theater by a combat medic would be highly beneficial to
      accurate clinical diagnosis and timely treatment. The results of the present study will
      provide information on the predictive value of the newly developed DANA handheld computer in
      assisting in the diagnosis of concussion in service members who have been blast exposed. If
      the DANA Rapid exam proves to be equally or more accurate than the MACE in detecting
      cognitive deficits, these tests and the handheld computer will also contribute to improved
      health care for service members by minimizing the time between injury and diagnosis.

    <description>The primary hypothesis is that an abnormal score on the DANA Rapid will positively identify a greater proportion of concussed individuals than an abnormal cognitive score on the MACE would. Conversely, scores within normal range on the DANA Rapid should be able to rule out cognitive deficits more accurately than a normal score on the MACE</description>

    <description>Subjects will have been exposed to a potentially concussive event but be clinically evaluated and found not to have sustained a concussion. Control subjects from this arm will take both the MACE and DANA Rapid twice: once within 24 hours of potentially concussive event, and again on the day of return to duty.</description>

    <description>The MACE is currently the only standardized and Department of Defense-designated method for the initial evaluation of suspected concussion in military operational settings. The MACE documents the history of the injury-causing incident; assesses cognitive deficits in orientation, immediate memory, concentration, and delayed recalls; and involves a neurological screening by a clinician.</description>
