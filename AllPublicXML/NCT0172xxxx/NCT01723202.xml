  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well dabrafenib works with or without trametinib
      in treating patients with recurrent thyroid cancer. Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet
      known whether dabrafenib is more effective when given with or without trametinib in treating
      thyroid cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To screen two different regimens (GSK2118436 [BRAFi] [dabrafenib] as a single agent versus
      the combination regimen of GSK2118436 [BRAFi] and GSK1120212 [MEKi] [trametinib]) and
      identify which regimen is more promising for subsequent testing in a phase III trial in
      radioiodine refractory BRAF-mutated differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To understand duration of objective response, progression-free survival and overall
      survival for each treatment group.

      II. To assess tolerability and adverse events of GSK2118436 (BRAFi) as a single agent and the
      tolerability and adverse events of GSK2118436 (BRAFi) and GSK1120212 (MEKi) in combination,
      in patients with DTC.

      III. To evaluate impact of experimental drugs on serum tumor marker thyroglobulin and its
      correlation with overall response rate.

      IV. To understand pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics of experimental
      drugs using serial tumor biopsies, tumor blocks and peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Patients with
      disease progression may cross-over to arm II.

      ARM II: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

    <description>Frequency and severity of adverse events in each of the treatment arms will be collected and summarized using descriptive statistics. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that is graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated&quot; or &quot;unlikely to be related&quot; to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing. The incidence of severe (grade 3+) adverse events or toxicities will be described.</description>

    <description>Tolerability of the regimen in each of the treatment arms will be collected and summarized using descriptive statistics. We will also capture the proportion of patients who go off treatment due to adverse reactions or even those who refuse further treatment for lesser toxicities that inhibit their willingness to continue participation on the trial. These tolerability measures will be assessed within each of the treatment arms and we will explore differences in these measures between the arms.</description>
