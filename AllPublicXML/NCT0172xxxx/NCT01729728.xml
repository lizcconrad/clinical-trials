  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if a drug called tapentadol administered by mouth safely relieves pain in
      children. Look at the amount of tapentadol in the blood after a single oral dose.

      Tapentadol oral solution for children is still being tested and is not yet registered.
      Tapentadol tablets are effective in treating both acute and chronic pain in adults. This
      trial will help to understand how tapentadol oral solution works in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lower age limit for the clinical trial was initially set to 3 years of age in the
      protocol. The trial planned for the inclusion of participants in three age categories. Age 3
      to less than 6 years (young children), age 6 to less than 12 years (older children) and age
      12 to less than 18 years of age (adolescents). There was a request by the Paediatric
      Committee (PDCO) at the European Medicines Agency to include participants 2 years of age
      (very young children). The protocol amendment thus planned to combine the two youngest age
      groups into a single reporting group. The protocol amendment only planned that the very young
      children group would have separate analysis for the Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) Scale
      and for the presentation of the serum concentrations, because the pharmacokinetic sampling
      scheme used in the 2 year old participants was different from the young children group (aged
      3 to less than 6 years).

    <measure>Pain Intensity Assessments Using the McGrath Color Analog Scale in Adolescent Participants and Older Children (Age 6 to Less Than 18 Years).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 15 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity assessments were with a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) scored McGrath color analog scale (CAS) in participants aged 6 years to less than 18 years, i.e. in Adolescents and Older Children. Participants were presented with the CAS and instructed to place the sliding bar on the color that best represented their pain intensity level at the time of assessment. The CAS is a pocket size tool used to measure the self-reported pain intensity of the older participants. The CAS consists of a 145 mm long triangular shaped strip of plastic, varying in width and hue from 1 mm wide and light pink hue at the bottom (and text no pain), to 3 mm wide and deep red hue at the top (most pain). This instrument includes 2 sides. One side shows the color pain intensity scale as described and the other shows a graduated scale, which provides a specific numeric value for the participant-reported level of pain.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 15 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>The Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) Scale was developed by the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School and Health Systems. The FLACC Scale is a behavioral scale for scoring postoperative pain in children between the ages of two months and seven years or in persons unable to communicate. In this trial the scale was used in the young and very young children, i.e. in participants aged 2 to less than 6 years. This tool includes five categories of pain behaviors, including facial expression, leg movement, activity, cry, and consolability. The clinician observes the participant for 5 minutes or more and scores each category with a 0, 1 or 2. The scores are added together for a total score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). The higher the total score the higher the pain.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Assessments Using the McGrath Color Analog Scale in Adolescent Participants and Older Children (Age 6 to Less Than 18 Years).</title>
        <description>Pain intensity assessments were with a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) scored McGrath color analog scale (CAS) in participants aged 6 years to less than 18 years, i.e. in Adolescents and Older Children. Participants were presented with the CAS and instructed to place the sliding bar on the color that best represented their pain intensity level at the time of assessment. The CAS is a pocket size tool used to measure the self-reported pain intensity of the older participants. The CAS consists of a 145 mm long triangular shaped strip of plastic, varying in width and hue from 1 mm wide and light pink hue at the bottom (and text no pain), to 3 mm wide and deep red hue at the top (most pain). This instrument includes 2 sides. One side shows the color pain intensity scale as described and the other shows a graduated scale, which provides a specific numeric value for the participant-reported level of pain.</description>

        <description>This assessment tool was used in 3 to less than 12 year old participants, i.e. Older Children and Young Children.
The Faces Pain Scale (Revised) [FPS-R] score as allocated to a selected face by the participant. There are 6 faces and the participant is asked to indicate on a face to express how much it hurts.
The numeric value 0 (no pain) to 10 (very much pain) is read off the reverse side of the scale by the clinician.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Assessment Using the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Scale in Young and Very Young Children (Age 2 to Less Than 6 Years).</title>
        <description>The Face Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) Scale was developed by the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Michigan Medical School and Health Systems. The FLACC Scale is a behavioral scale for scoring postoperative pain in children between the ages of two months and seven years or in persons unable to communicate. In this trial the scale was used in the young and very young children, i.e. in participants aged 2 to less than 6 years. This tool includes five categories of pain behaviors, including facial expression, leg movement, activity, cry, and consolability. The clinician observes the participant for 5 minutes or more and scores each category with a 0, 1 or 2. The scores are added together for a total score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). The higher the total score the higher the pain.</description>

        <title>Sum of Pain Intensity Differences Over the 4 Hours After Dosing Derived From the Different Pain Scales and for All Age Groups</title>
        <description>Different pain intensity assessment tools were used in the different age groups. Therefore the sum of pain intensities were calculated and are reported for each age group based on the tool used.
Adolescents - Age 12 to Less Than 18 Years.
Older Children - Age 6 to Less Than 12 Years.
Young Children - Age 3 to Less Than 6 Years.
Very Young Children - Age 2 to Less Than 3 Years.
CAS (McGrath color analog scale) [Theoretical Range: -40 to + 40],
VAS (100 mm Visual Analog Scale) [Theoretical Range: -400 to + 400],
FPS-R (6-point Faces Pain Scale - Revised) [Theoretical Range: -40 to + 40],
FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability score) [Theoretical Range: -40 to + 40].
A mean score of zero indicates that there was no pain intensity change over the 4 hours.
The positive values indicate that in the group as a whole the sum of all pain intensity values over the first 4 hours lead to a reduction in pain in the time period.</description>

        <description>Mean and Standard Deviation of Serum Concentrations of Tapentadol-O-glucuronide. Tapentadol-O-glucuronide is the metabolite of tapentadol. Metabolites are sometimes referred to as &quot;breakdown products&quot;. The body alters the administered medication to a metabolite so that it can be more easily or quickly removed from the body. Tapentadol-O-glucuronide concentrations were measured in participants. Serum was analyzed by means of liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) at 10 ng/mL.</description>

        <description>12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were part of the planned safety assessments. 12-lead Electrocardiograms were performed prior at the enrollment visit after informed consent and at the discharge visit. The discharge visit was as per standard of care.
The changes in ECG parameters are reported. Negative mean values indicate that the millisecond intervals decreased from the enrollment to the discharge visit. Positive mean values indicate that the millisecond intervals increased from the enrollment to the discharge visit. The Letters P,Q,R,S and T refer to specific medically defined points on an ECG tracing and correspond to specific heart activities.</description>

        <title>Non-Compartmental Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax (Maximum Concentration) of Tapentadol After a Single Dose of Tapentadol in Adolescents (Age 12 to Less Than 18 Years).</title>
        <description>Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained using frequent sampling techniques in participants 12 years to less than 18 years of age.
Serum samples (frequent sampling) were drawn at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 15 hours. The concentration of tapentadol (active drug) is assessed during absorption and distribution.
The maximum concentration is derived from the Area Under the Curve, from dose to 15 hours (AUC 0-15). It is the highest amount of active drug observed in the blood sample</description>

The clinical “intensity” of an adverse event was classified as:
Mild: Signs and symptoms that can be easily tolerated. Symptoms can be ignored and disappear when the subject is distracted.
Moderate: Symptoms cause discomfort but are tolerable; they cannot be ignored and affect concentration.
Severe: Symptoms which affect usual daily activity.
For adverse events where the intensity changes over time, the maximum intensity observed was documented.</description>

        <title>Non-Compartmental Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax (Maximum Concentration) of Tapentadol-O-glucuronide After a Single Dose of Tapentadol in Adolescents (Age 12 to Less Than 18 Years).</title>
        <description>Tapentadol-O-glucuronide is the metabolite of tapentadol. Metabolites are sometimes referred to as &quot;breakdown products&quot;. The body alters the administered medication to a metabolite so that it can be more easily or quickly removed from the body. Serum samples (frequent sampling) were drawn at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 15 hours. The concentration of tapentadol-O-glucuronide (metabolite) is assessed to study absorption and distribution.
The maximum concentration is derived from the Area Under the Curve, from dose to 15 hours (AUC 0-15). It is the highest amount of metabolite observed in the blood sample.</description>

        <description>Tapentadol-O-glucuronide is the metabolite of tapentadol. Metabolites are sometimes referred to as &quot;breakdown products&quot;. The body alters the administered medication to a metabolite so that it can be more easily or quickly removed from the body. Serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained using frequent sampling techniques in participants 12 years to less than 18 years of age. The time to maximum concentration is derived from the area under the curve from dose to 15 hours (AUC 0-15). The Tmax is the time after dosing at which the maximum concentration of the tapentadol-O-glucuronide (metabolite) occurs.

Both ALP and GGT can be elevated in bile duct or liver complications. In the study there were 3 planned safety blood draws for routine blood tests: at Visit 1 (during the enrollment period, including surgery), at Visit 2 (prior to study drug administration) and at Visit 3 (prior to discharge from the hospital). The discharge visit was as per standard of care.</description>
