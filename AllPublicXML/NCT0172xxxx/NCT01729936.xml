    <textblock>
      Primary care centres are a key setting to treat people with overweight and moderate obesity.
      There is growing evidence that sitting for a long time is negatively associated with people's
      health. Interventions with the aim of reducing daily time of sedentary activities can be an
      effective strategy to increase daily energy expenditure. To improve the effectiveness of
      programmes promoting physical activity in primary care we need some clear action protocols
      that can be easily integrated in the daily routines of primary care professionals.

      Objective. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a six-moth primary
      care intervention to reduce diary hours of sitting time in overweight and obese sedentary
      patients, as well as to increase their weekly caloric spend.

      Methods. The design of the study is a simple randomized controlled trial. Ten primary care
      centers will be invited to participate and will be randomized into control (CG) and
      intervention group (IG). Each professional will randomly invite to participate voluntarily
      moderate obese or overweight patients (BMI: 25-34,9 kg/m2) of both sexes, aged between 25 and
      65 years old, who are 6 or more than 6 hours daily sitting. A total of 400 subjects (200
      individuals in each group) are needed. In addition, 50 subjects with fibromyalgia will be
      included in the study to know the feasibility of the intervention among them.

      The main dependent variable (sitting times) will be measured with an ActivPAL during first
      and last intervention week. There will be a follow up after 3, 6 and 12 months of the end of
      the intervention. Other variables included in the study: number of steps walked, subjective
      level of physical activity, weight, height, BMI, skinfolds, waist circumference,
      triglycerides, total cholesterol, (LDL and HDL), glucose, sociodemographic variables, blood
      pressure and quality of life related to health. A descriptive analysis of all variables and a
      multivariate analysis to assess differences among intervention and control group will be
      undertaken. Multivariate analysis will be carried out to assess time changes of dependent
      variables. All the analysis will be done under the intention to treat principle.

      The intervention will be based on a recommendation to find alternatives to progressively
      substitute Sitting time by doing the regular activities standing or walking. Control group
      will receive minimum advice.
