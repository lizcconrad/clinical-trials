    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB033 in subjects with
      their first episode of unilateral acute optic neuritis (AON). The secondary objective of this
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB033 in this
      study population.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; in the view of the Investigators, placed the subject at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); however, this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigators, could have jeopardized the subject or may have required intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Summary of BIIB033 Concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One pre-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) sample and 1 post-dose PK sample (approximately between 1 and 3 hours after the end of IV infusion) were collected for all participants on Day 1 and at Weeks 4 through 20 (every 4 weeks). Additionally, only 1 PK sample was collected at Week 24 and Week 32. (There was no dosing on Week 24 and Week 32, so only one blood sample for BIIB033 concentration was taken.) Samples collected at early termination visits were treated as predose samples for the next scheduled visit.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; in the view of the Investigators, placed the subject at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); however, this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigators, could have jeopardized the subject or may have required intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.</description>
