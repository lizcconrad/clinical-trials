    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether in patients with acute decompensated
      congestive heart failure and the cardiorenal syndrome, i.e. a state in which therapy directed
      to improve symptoms is limited by further worsening renal function, fluid removal by
      ultrafiltration is superior to different pharmacological approaches in acutely relieving
      congestion and preventing further deterioration in renal function and whether it results in
      longer admission-free survival 90 days after enrolment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute decompensated congestive heart failure (ADCHF), the most common single cause of
      hospitalization over 65 years, results in 4-8% in-hospital mortality and 30-38% incidence of
      readmissions within 3 months after discharge. While fluid accumulation remains the main
      factor causing hospitalization, impaired cardiac output in ADHF causes renal arterial
      underfilling and increased venous pressure, reducing the glomerular filtration rate and
      causing acute kidney injury.

      Aggressive therapy is required to alleviate volume overload during hospital admission and
      achievement of a dry weight is capital in preventing rehospitalisation. Currently diuretics
      are considered the standard of care for volume overload in ADHF, yet any patients, especially
      those with advanced HF become soon resistant to standard doses of loop diuretics, so
      escalating doses and the association of thiazides are often required to achieve effective
      diuresis, an approach that will progressively worsen renal function, causing the cardiorenal
      syndrome.

      When diuretic resistance develops and symptoms persists, mechanical fluid removal via
      ultrafiltration should be considered. Ultrafiltration is an alternative method of sodium and
      water removal, that filters plasma water directly across a semipermeable membrane in response
      to a transmembrane pressure gradient, resulting in an ultrafiltrate that is isoosmotic
      compared with plasma water, In view of the limits of traditional therapies for the treatment
      of congestion and concomitant progressive renal dysfunction in ADHF patients, there is a
      compelling need for additional studies to individuate the better method for fluid removal in
      volume-overloaded patients and guide management decisions to reduce associated morbidity.

      The main objectives of the present project are to evaluate whether in patients with acute
      decompensated congestive heart failure and the cardiorenal syndrome, i.e. a state in which
      therapy directed to improve CHF symptoms is limited by further worsening renal function,
      fluid removal by ultrafiltration is superior to different pharmacological approaches in
      acutely relieving congestion and preventing further deterioration in renal function and
      whether it results in longer admission-free survival 90 days after enrolment
