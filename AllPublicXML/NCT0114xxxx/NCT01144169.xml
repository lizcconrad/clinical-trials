      The main goal of this research study is to determine whether treating patients with renal
      cell cancer with hydroxychloroquine before surgery can make the cancer easier to kill.
      Another goal is to see how the study drug affects the body's immune cells which fight cancer
      cells.

      Autophagy is a cellular survival mechanism that protects from stress-induced programmed
      death. Autophagy may enable renal cancer to escape from cytokine therapy, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy or targeted agents. Hydroxychloroquine prevents autophagy by blocking
      acidification of lysosomes, and is being studied in clinical trials as a means of enhancing
      of cancer therapy. This phase Ib clinical trial will test the hypothesis that pre-operative
      exposure to HC reduces biologic markers of autophagy in peripheral blood, normal kidney and
      renal cancer specimens obtained at the time of nephrectomy. These data will be used in the
      design and pharmacodynamic monitoring of future therapeutic trials of HC in combination with
      high dose interleukin-2 and other systemic therapies for advanced RCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with suspected primary or metastatic RCC (stage 1-IV) with planned
             nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1

          -  Normal renal, hepatic, and hematologic function at the time of enrollment as evidenced
             by:

               -  Serum creatinine level ≤1.5 the upper limits of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin level ≤1.5 X ULN

          -  White blood cell count &gt; or = 3.5x109/ml per ml and platelet count ≥ 100x109 per ml

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received chemotherapy for any diagnosis within 12 months prior to
             study entry.

          -  Prior use of radiotherapy or investigational agents for RCC.

          -  Concurrent malignancies with evidence of active or measurable disease except
             non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Inability to adhere to study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  History of allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to the study drug
             (hydroxychloroquine) or current therapy with the study drug for other reasons.

          -  Other concurrent experimental therapy.

          -  The effects of HC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. All females of childbearing potential must have a blood test
             or urine study within two weeks prior to registration to rule out pregnancy. Should a
             woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. If a man impregnates a woman while participating in
             this study, he should inform his treating physician immediately as well.

          -  HIV-positive patients are not excluded from the study. However, for patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy, the potential impact of pharmacokinetic
             interactions with HC is unknown. Therefore, HIV-positive patients actively receiving
             anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study.

          -  Patients with psoriasis are ineligible unless the disease is well controlled and they
             are under the care of a specialist who agrees to monitor the patient for
             exacerbations.

          -  Patients requiring the use of enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication that includes:
             phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone or oxcarbazepine are excluded.
             Hydroxychloroquine is known to affect the CYP2D6 metabolic pathway. A list of drugs
             with potential interaction is included in Appendix H.

          -  Patients with previously documented macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy are
             excluded.

          -  Patients with known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GP6D) deficiency

          -  EKG with QTc &gt;500 msec at baseline (average of 3 determinations at 10 minutes
             interval). Subjects with ventricular pacemaker for whom QT interval is not measurable
             will be eligible on a case-by-case basis.
