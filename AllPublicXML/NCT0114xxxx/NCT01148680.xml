             years

          -  No residual insulin secretion (plasmatic basal and stimulated C-peptide &lt; 0.3 ng/ml)

          -  HbA1c considered acceptable by the selection committee

          -  Insulin needs &lt; 0.85 IU/kg/day

               -  Patient with terminal renal failure and functional kidney graft for at least 6

             transaminases levels over twice normal values) ; pancreatitis history, gallbladder
             stones that could potentially migrate; HLA hyperimmunisation (PRA &gt;20%).

          -  Criteria related to diabetes complications :

               -  Non-stabilized proliferating diabetic retinopathy

          -  Exclusion criteria non-specifically related to islet infusion: evolutive vascular
             disease, evolutive cardiopathy (especially myocardial infarction less than 6 months
             ago, cerebrovascular stroke less than 6 months ago, evolutive arteritis with trophic
             disorders) ; systemic infection including hepatitis C and HIV ; leuconeutropenia ;
             thrombocytopenia, non-stabilized neoplastic pathology ; pregnancy or project of
             pregnancy within the next 24 months ; poor therapeutic compliance

          -  Criteria related to immunosuppressive protocol : renal failure (glomerular filtration
             &lt; 35 ml/min/1.73 m²) and/or proteinuria &gt; 0.5 g/24h ; non-treated hyperlipidemia
             (LDL-C &gt; 130 mg/dL) ; blood pressure &gt; 160/100 mmHg

          -  Clinical insulin resistance : assessed by patient's weight, BMI and exogenous insulin
             requirements (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m² or insulin dose &gt; 0.85 UI/kg/day)
