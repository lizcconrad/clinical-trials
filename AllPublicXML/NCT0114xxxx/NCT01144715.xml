    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate a therapy delivery system for stroke patients
      that provide accessible, affordable stroke care. User-friendly home therapy robots and a
      telerehabilitation system are combined to monitor and provide therapy that is accessible for
      patients in rural and underserved locations. The robotic-based home therapy intervention will
      produce significantly greater improvement in upper extremity motor function than Usual and
      Customary Care enhanced with a (non-robotic) home therapy upper extremity rehabilitation
      program at the end of 8 weeks of home therapy.

    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this proposal is to evaluate a combined clinic/home robotic-based
      stroke therapy delivery and monitoring system in rural and underserved locations that
      provides accessible, effective and affordable care for stroke survivors with residual limb
      impairment. The study is a prospective, single-blind, multi-site Randomized Controlled Trial.
      A total of 96 patients within 6 months post-stroke will be enrolled and randomly assigned to
      one of two groups: robotic based home therapy or a self administered (non-robotic) home
      therapy program.

    <measure>Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 8 weeks post enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of recovery of arm-hand function is measured with the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). The ARAT assesses activity limitations of the upper extremity. It includes 19 items divided into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement. Scores range from 0-to-57 with a higher score indicating a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 8 weeks post enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is used to measure the degree of function using timed tasks. The WMFT is a 17-item measure used to assess activity limitations of the upper extremity. It is comprised of 2 strength items and 15 timed task performance items. The task performance items begin with the measurement of simple proximal movements and progress to more complex distal and whole limb movements. The WMFT yields two scores: 1) a functional ability score quantifying quality of performance, and 2) a timed score quantifying speed of performance in seconds. A shorter time is better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Test</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment at 8 weeks post enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Upper Extremity neurological impairment will be measured using the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Test (FMA). The FMA is an impairment-based measure consisting of 33 movements with higher scores indicating increased ability of the patient to move out of synergistic patterns toward more isolated movements. Movement quality of the affected UE is compared to the non-affected UE on 0-2 ordinal scale with 0 indicating no movement at all, 1 indicating partial movement of the affected extremity, and 2 indicating movement equivalent to the non-affected UEs. The score ranges from 0-to-66.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale (SIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment at 8 weeks post enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life changes are measured with the Stroke Impact Scale questionnaire. The SIS is a self-rated QOL questionnaire that addresses several domains following stroke: physical strength, memory, feelings and emotions, communication, activities of daily living (ADL), mobility, hand use, meaningful activities, and overall percentage recovery from the stroke. We report the Hand Function subscale, which ranges from 0-to-100. A higher score reflects better hand function.</description>

    <description>The goal of the Hand Mentor ™ (TM) device is to improve Active Range of Motion in the distal musculature of the paretic limb of patients with stroke. Development of HM patient protocols are based on basic principles of motor learning: the protocols actively engage the patient in activities, progressively increase task difficulty based on patient performance, actively assist patient if necessary (i.e. patient is not passive), provide meaningful feedback at regular intervals, require sensorimotor integration and incorporate the use of tasks that that are intended to transfer to distal motor performance.</description>

Development of HM patient protocols are based on basic principles of motor learning: the protocols actively engage the patient in activities, progressively increase task difficulty based on patient performance, actively assist patient if necessary (i.e. patient is not passive), provide meaningful feedback at regular intervals, require sensorimotor integration and incorporate the use of tasks that that are intended to transfer to distal motor performance.</description>

        <title>Wolf Motor Function Test</title>
        <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) is used to measure the degree of function using timed tasks. The WMFT is a 17-item measure used to assess activity limitations of the upper extremity. It is comprised of 2 strength items and 15 timed task performance items. The task performance items begin with the measurement of simple proximal movements and progress to more complex distal and whole limb movements. The WMFT yields two scores: 1) a functional ability score quantifying quality of performance, and 2) a timed score quantifying speed of performance in seconds. A shorter time is better outcome.</description>

The FMA is an impairment-based measure consisting of 33 movements with higher scores indicating increased ability of the patient to move out of synergistic patterns toward more isolated movements. Movement quality of the affected UE is compared to the non-affected UE on 0–2 ordinal scale with 0 indicating no movement at all, 1 indicating partial movement of the affected extremity, and 2 indicating movement equivalent to the non-affected UEs. The score ranges from 0-to-66.</description>

We report the Hand Function subscale, which ranges from 0-to-100. A higher score reflects better hand function.</description>

          <description>Use of the Hand Mentor (TM) Stroke Therapy Device at home for 8 weeks
Hand Mentor (TM) robotic stroke therapy device: The goal of the Hand Mentor ™ (TM) device is to improve Active Range of Motion in the distal musculature of the paretic limb of patients with stroke. Development of HM patient protocols are based on basic principles of motor learning: the protocols actively engage the patient in activities, progressively increase task difficulty based on patient performance, actively assist patient if necessary (i.e. patient is not passive), provide meaningful feedback at regular intervals, require sensorimotor integration and incorporate the use of tasks that that are intended to transfer to distal motor performance.</description>
