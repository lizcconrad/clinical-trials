  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the safety and efficacy of six new malaria vaccines - AdCh63 AMA1,
      MVA AMA1, AdCh63 MSP1, MVA MSP1, AdCh63 ME-TRAP &amp; MVA ME-TRAP. These vaccines consist of
      inactivated viruses which have been modified − so they cannot reproduce (replicate) in
      humans, and also to include genetic material (genes) for malaria proteins which are expressed
      by the malaria parasite during both liver and blood stage infection. The vaccines are
      designed to stimulate an immune response to these malaria proteins (immunogenicity describes
      the nature and magnitude of this immune response) and thus provide protection against malaria
      infection. The protective efficacy of vaccines will be evaluated by challenging a small
      number of volunteers who have received the vaccines with malaria infection from the bites of
      infected mosquitos(sporozoite challenge).

    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess if volunteers who receive the novel vaccine candidates; AdCh63 MSP1, MVA MSP1, AdCh63 AMA1, MVA AMA1, AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP in heterologous prime boost regimens are protected wholly or partially against malaria infection in a sporozoite challenge model. This will be determined by noting the number of subjects who develop malaria infection and the time in hours between exposure and parasitaemia as detected by thick-film blood smear compared with controls.
To assess the safety of the immunisation regimens alone and during co-administration.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity of vaccine</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess immunogenicity of the vaccine regimes by measuring IFN-γ ELISPOT, flow cytometry and antibody responses to MSP1, AMA1 and ME-TRAP antigens before and after malaria infection. If there is evidence of partial or complete protection, we will explore immunological correlates of protective immunity.</description>
