  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Angiocal® (PRS-050-PEG40) is safe and well
      tolerated when it is injected into the veins of patients with solid tumors. Other purposes of
      this study are to investigate how the body of the patients reacts to Angiocal®, how the blood
      level of Angiocal® develops after injection and how the tumor responds to the injection of
      Angiocal®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation study with Angiocal® in patients with solid
      tumors using a group sequential adaptive treatment assignment. Patients will be allocated to
      different dose levels in small cohorts and will receive one single dose application on Day 1,
      followed by a repeated dosing period. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of Angiocal® when administered intravenously to patients with solid
      tumors. The secondary objectives of the study are the characterization of the pharmacodynamic
      response, evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of Angiocal®, observation of tumor
      response.
