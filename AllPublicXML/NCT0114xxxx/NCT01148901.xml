      This trial is designed to measure improvement of hip involvement in patients with ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) after receiving 4 doses of infliximab. Participants will receive infliximab
      5 mg/kg (as an intravenous perfusion over a period of 2 hours) at Weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14,
      consistent with the approved dosing regimen described in the label. Participants will be
      evaluated for hip pain, functional capacity and stiffness before and after 14 weeks (4 doses)
      of treatment. Further treatment after 4 doses is based on standard clinical practice as
      determined by the trial site.
