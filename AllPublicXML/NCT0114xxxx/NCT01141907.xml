  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects over 5 million Americans with HF morbidity reaching epidemic
      proportions. Annual rates of new and recurrent HF events including hospitalization and
      mortality are higher among African Americans. In this study, the investigators are testing an
      interdisciplinary model for heart failure care, with focus on enhancing self management and
      use of telehealth, which has significant potential to improve self management and outcomes.

      The main purpose of this study is to learn how to help African Americans with heart failure
      care for themselves at home. We hope to find out if a team including a nurse and community
      health navigator using a computer telehealth device can help people with heart failure stay
      healthier. The team will help people with heart failure to manage their medication, monitor
      their symptoms and weigh themselves every day after they leave the hospital. The team will
      also help people with heart failure learn to solve problems that may keep them from following
      their treatment plan.

    <description>The intervention is aimed at controlling heart failure (HF) and preventing exacerbations and hospitalizations by improving self management behaviors with the support of the Home Automated Telemonitoring (HAT) system. The intervention will be delivered by a RN-community health navigator (CHN) team over three months to HF patients and their caregivers in their home and via telephone and HAT system. The intervention will be initiated during the index hospitalization or as soon as possible after randomization. The RN-CHN team will collaborate with the participants, their caregivers, and their usual source of HF care. Intervention strategies include tracking of weight and HF symptoms to provide automated feedback regarding self management and plan of care, enhancing medication and symptom self management, promoting HF care follow up, and using a patient centered record to promote communication with providers.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to usual care are treated by their usual source of HF care in the usual manner and in accordance with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines for the management of HF. Usual care for HF patients admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital also includes the following: 1) Referral to HF clinic if the patient has no usual source of care and 2) HF patient education booklet.</description>
