  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects this new drug foretinib has on this
      type of breast cancer, called &quot;triple negative&quot; breast cancer because the cancer tissue is
      estrogen, progesterone and HER2 receptor negative.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is no treatment that will cure this type of cancer.
      Although some types of chemotherapy can cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better
      options are needed.

             grade 1.

          -  Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or one prior line of chemotherapy
             in the recurrent/metastatic setting. A minimum of 21 days since the last dose of
             chemotherapy must have elapsed prior to registration.

          -  No prior therapy with a c-Met inhibitor or angiogenesis inhibitor. Other targeted

             effects of the radiation therapy prior to registration, and at least 21 days have
             elapsed from the day of the last fraction of radiation to the date of registration.
             Exceptions may be made for non-myelosuppressive radiation to peripheral areas.

             prior to study registration and have no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage are
             eligible).

          -  Untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions and/or have symptomatic
             cardiac dysfunction. Patients with a significant cardiac history (even if controlled)

          -  GI tract disease resulting in an inability to absorb oral medication.

          -  Active or uncontrolled infections, or with serious illnesses or medical conditions
             which would not permit the patient to be managed according to the protocol.
