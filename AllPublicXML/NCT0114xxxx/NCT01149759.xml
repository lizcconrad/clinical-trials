    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) or eczema is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease that affects
      1-3% of the adults and up to 25% of the children in the United States. Patients with severe
      AD will be studied during a 24-week study with systemic cyclosporine (Neoral, capsule form)
      to evaluate the immune suppression and pathological correlation of cyclosporine A in these
      patients in order to determine the extent to which immune activation drives the pathological
      epidermal phenotype.

      Patients will be first screened to be sure they are healthy (aside from atopic dermatitis)
      with a physical exam, and lab tests. These lab tests consist of CBC, biochemical profile,
      hepatitis B and C profile, urine analysis, HIV, PPD, and urine pregnancy test (if
      applicable). Patients will return in 2 to 3 days for PPD reading. A repeat serum creatinine
      will be drawn at this time so as to have 2 baseline values. Patient will begin taking
      cyclosporine at 5 mg/kg of body weight in 2 divided daily doses for 12 weeks, and after this
      period the dose will be reduced by 1mg/kg per week (the tapering down will start at 12 weeks
      of treatment), so that cessation of treatment will occur after 16 weeks from the start of
      treatment. Patients will then be followed in clinic for an additional 8 weeks for a potential
      relapse, and if a relapse will occur topical treatment with corticosteroids,
      immune-modulators or phototherapy may be instituted. Patients will be seen in the outpatient
      clinic at baseline, wks 1,2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 and every 2weeks until completion of a
      24-week study. Biopsies (of lesional and non-lesional skin) will be done to assess
      histological response at baseline, week 2, week 6 (optional), week 12 and at relapse
      (optional). Bloods for safety analysis and pregnancy test (if applicable) will be done at
      each visit, and vital signs will be measured at that time. Serum IgE, eosinophils, and serum
      cytokines will be done at baseline, and every 2 weeks until week 16, and at week 24. At each
      visit patients will be assessed for adverse events. Clinical assessment, and ultrasound, will
      be done at each visit. The most widely accepted clinical assessment tool is known as SCORAD
      (SCORing for Atopic Dermatitis). This tool combines clinical features of AD such as erythema,
      dryness, lichenification, percent body surface area, as well as quality of life issues such
      as pruritus and loss of sleep due to disease. Another assessment tool we will be using is the
      static IGA (investigator global assessment). The IGA represents an overall evaluation of
      dermatitis performed by the investigator at every visit. IGA scores utilize a 6-point scale,
      ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe disease). IGA scores measure disease severity based
      on morphology, without referring back to the baseline state. Ultrasound study provides an
      alternate, non-invasive method of assessing disease activity in the skin. Clinical photos
      will be done at weeks 0, 6, 12, 16, and 24.In this study, we would like to determine whether
      AD, like psoriasis, is an immune-driven disease of epidermal hyperplasia and differentiation.
      To establish the immune contribution to AD, we will treat patients with standard doses of CsA
      and measure the extent of immune suppression in skin lesions by quantitative measures of
      pathological leukocytes and expression of inflammatory gene products. At the end of 12 weeks
      of treatment we will determine whether pathological epidermal hyperplasia is reversed by
      quantitative and qualitative measures of epidermal hyperplasia and aberrant epidermal
      differentiation. In addition, we will correlate the extent to which the epidermal phenotype
      is modulated with the extent to which skin inflammation is suppressed, as the effect of
      suppression of specific inflammatory molecules on resulting keratinocyte responses is not
      known. The alternative hypothesis in AD is that it is not an immune-mediated disease, but
      instead a disease of primary epidermal differentiation due to germline alterations (gene
      deletions) in filaggrin and other genes that cooperate to differentiate a normal epidermal
      barrier at the level of stratum corneum. The alternative hypothesis is considered to be the
      most likely patho-mechanism in AD by a number of current researchers. The alternative
      hypothesis would be supported by this study if pathologic epidermal hyperplasia persists in
      the skin regions with significant suppression of the immune/inflammatory pathways induced by
      CsA treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe AD (defined as having a mean SCORAD score&gt; 40,, with significant disease
             activity, pruritus, and sleep disturbances (13), suitable for treatment with
             Cyclosporine, and have failed or unsuitable for other treatment modalities, including
             topical and or systemic steroids or phototherapy. Patients must also have an IGA score
             of 3 or greater,

          -  Males and females age 18 and above (if females are of child-bearing potential they
             must agree to use acceptable contraception during the study).

          -  No systemic treatment contraception must commence 2 weeks prior to initiating the
             drug.

          -  No systemic treatment for 4 weeks, no topical treatment or phototherapy for 2 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously treated with cyclosporine and had unacceptable toxicity

          -  Past or current history of malignancy (except for treated isolated skin cancers)

             such as but not limited to creatinine &gt;1.5 ULN, SGOT&gt;2.5 ULN. Values greater then
             grade 1 would most likely represent clinically significant renal, hepatic or
             hematologic disease

          -  Stage I hypertension is defined as &gt;140/90. Patients with this blood pressure or
             higher on two separate occasions, whether on medications or not, will be excluded (JNC
             guidelines www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension )

          -  Significant lipid panel abnormality (any grade 1 toxicity on CTC scale)

          -  Lactating females

          -  Other medical condition that would increase the risk of cyclosporine toxicity

          -  Positive PPD

          -  Primary or secondary immune deficiency (including known HIV status)

          -  Possible or known pregnancy

          -  Serious infection (such as active hepatitis)

          -  Concurrent use of other immunosuppressive agents such as MTX, Immuran,
             Cyclophosphamide, Cellcept, etc.(because of the possibility of excessive
             immunosuppression and the subsequent risk of malignancies)

          -  Active infections, infections or history of serious infection requiring
             hospitalization, antibiotics, antivirals,or antifungals within 30 days of baseline

          -  History of other inflammatory skin conditions (such as psoriasis, pemphigus, etc.

          -  Patients with background skin conditions that might be directly related to atopic
             dermatitis (such as post inflammatory hyperpigmentation) will not be excluded as well
             as common background non-inflammatory skin conditions such as seborrheic keratosis,
             benign pigmented lesions, acne, etc

          <title>SCORAD Change Score</title>
          <description>SCORAD (&quot;SCORing Atopic Dermatitis&quot;) is a clinical tool for assessing the severity (i.e., extent, intensity) of atopic dermatitis (AD) as objectively as possible with scores ranging from 0-100. The higher the score indicates more severe AD. For this outcome the SCORAD change score is computed as an absolute number which is comparing improvement in the SCORAD score of participants at week 12 compared to their SCORAD score at baseline.</description>
