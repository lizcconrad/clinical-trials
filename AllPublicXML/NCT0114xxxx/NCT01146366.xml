  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively look at the utility of routine cervical mediastinoscopy (lymph node biopsy)
      in patients with clinically staged T2N0M0 NSCLC, as well as patients with clinically staged
      T1N0M0 NSCLC with a high maxSUV of the primary tumor on PET imaging.

      Hypothesis #1: The prevalence of mediastinal lymph node metastases detectable by cervical
      mediastinoscopy is sufficiently low (&lt;10%) to not support the routine use of this test in the
      study population.

      Hypothesis #2: The preoperative detection of occult(hidden) N2 lymph node metastases by
      cervical mediastinoscopy in patients with clinically staged T2N0M0 NSCLC or T1N0M0 NSCLC with
      maxSUV &gt;10 on PET does not provide a survival benefit when compared to detection of occult N2
      lymph node metastases at the time of thoracotomy using nodal dissection or systematic
      sampling.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have proven or suspected clinical stage I NSCLC. Clinical stage IA
             (T1N0M0) patients are only allowed participation if the maxSUV of the primary tumor is
             &gt;/=10. Clinical stage IB (T2N0M0) must be by size criterion only (i.e. the tumor must
             be &gt; 3cm in size. Patients that have T2 tumors by visceral pleural involvement only
             are not eligible for the study).

          2. Patients must be surgical candidates for at least a lobectomy or other anatomical
             resection (via either video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or open approach).

          3. Patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod score of 0, 1 or 2.

          4. Patients must not have undergone previous invasive mediastinal staging for this
             cancer.

          5. Patients must not have a tracheostomy.

          6. Patient must have a CT of the chest and upper abdomen or an FDG-PET scan performed
             within 60 days of enrollment to the study that confirms their clinical stage I status.
             Both scans must be performed, only one needs to be within 60 days of enrollment to the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        There are no separately noted exclusion criteria. All criteria are listed under inclusion.
