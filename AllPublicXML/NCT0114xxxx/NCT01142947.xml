    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered first-line treatment for persistent asthma, yet
      little is known about the genetic factors that influence response to this therapy. This study
      seeks to quantify response to ICS therapy in African American and white patients, as well as
      look for genetic markers that predict treatment response.

    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are considered first-line therapy for the management and
      control of patients with persistent asthma. Use of inhaled steroids has been associated with
      reduced airway responsiveness, improved lung function, diminished symptoms, and fewer
      exacerbations. However studies show considerable inter-subject variability in ICS response
      with only 33% to 50% of patients demonstrating substantial improvement in forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) following therapy. It has also been estimated that corticosteroid
      resistance accounts for half of all asthma-related health care costs. Therefore understanding
      the factors that contribute to corticosteroid resistance is both clinical and economically
      important. African-American patients, in particular, appear less likely to respond to
      corticosteroid therapy when compared with white patients. However, it is not currently known
      whether this difference results from genetic or environmental factors, or whether differences
      exist in inhaled steroid responsiveness (i.e., the recommended route of therapy). This
      question is of particular importance, since African-American patients suffer
      disproportionately from asthma-related complications. To date there have been studies
      examining potential mechanisms of corticosteroid responsiveness, but none have addressed
      inhaled corticosteroid responsiveness, nor were these studies designed to identify
      potentially causative genetic factors at a population-level. Therefore in this proposal we
      first plan to assess differences in inhaled corticosteroid responsiveness (i.e., improvement
      in FEV1) between African-American and white patients with asthma following 6 weeks of inhaled
      beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) treatment. Second, we will seek to identify genetic loci
      associated with ICS responsiveness in this cohort treated with BD for 6 weeks. The diversity
      of our cohort is a distinct advantage, as it allows us to use both association analysis and
      admixture mapping to jointly identify loci associated with steroid response. Next, we will
      take advantage of our ability to assess ICS exposure and clinical outcomes longitudinally in
      our patient population so as to assess for pharmacogenomic interactions on asthma
      exacerbations (i.e., asthma-related emergency department visits, asthma-related
      hospitalizations, and oral steroid bursts) in this same group. Lastly, we will validate
      observed drug x gene interactions on asthma exacerbations in a separate, larger cohort of
      patients with asthma. This latter group will also come from our screened asthma population
      and will comprise those for whom we have both DNA and clinical data (i.e., historic ICS
      exposure measures and clinical outcomes). Therefore, in this proposal we plan to identify a
      set of genetic polymorphisms associated with ICS responsiveness as defined by both an
      improvement in pulmonary function and an alteration in exacerbation-related clinical
      outcomes.
