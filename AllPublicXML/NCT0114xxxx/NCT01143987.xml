  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active parathyroid glands among renal dialysis patients contribute to calcified and hardened
      blood vessels. Such damage to the blood vessels, in turn, takes a significant toll in terms
      of cardiovascular disease. Calcimimetics has been suggested to lower the risk of vascular
      calcification. Role of cinacalcet was demonstrated in animal model but human data are
      lacking. The investigators designed an open label pilot study to evaluate the effect of
      cinacalcet in 20 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately controlled secondary
      hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome is the aortic pulse wave
      velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment.

      Mineral metabolism disturbance and hyperparathyroidism contribute to arterial stiffness and
      vascular calcification. The vascular damage, in turn, contributes to significant
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of end-stage renal disease patients. Calcimimetics has
      been suggested to lower the risk of vascular calcification. Role of cinacalcet was
      demonstrated in animal model but human data are lacking. We design an open label pilot study
      to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet in 20 peritoneal dialysis patients with inadequately
      controlled secondary hyperparathyroidism despite standard treatment. The primary outcome is
      the aortic pulse wave velocity at 26 and 52 months after cinacalcet treatment.
