  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, comparative, double-blind controlled
      clinical study intended to establish 1) the optimal method of determining calorie
      requirements and 2) the optimal amount of protein supply in chronically ventilated patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed in a chronic ventilation department.

      Enrolled patients will be randomly allocated to receive calories as dictated by:

      The Harriss-Benedict formula (Group 1) or Indirect Calorimetry (Group 2)

      After one week of admission to the hospital department and study enrollment we will review
      the first results of the study.

      After seven days of hospitalization and study enrollment patients who have not been weaned
      from the ventilator, will be divided into three groups.

        1. Patients in the first group will receive caloric support calculated by the HARRISS
           BENEDICT equation and protein dose of 1.1 to 1.5 grams per kilogram weight.

        2. Patients in the second group will receive caloric support as measured by indirect
           calorimetry and will receive protein at 1.1 grams per kilogram weight.

        3. Patients in the third group will receive caloric support as measured by indirect
           calorimetry and will receive protein at a dose of 1.5 grams per kilogram weight.

      Outcome of treatment results will be performed after one ,four and eight weeks:

        1. Length of hospitalization

        2. Weaning from Mechanical Ventilation

        3. Development and progression of pressure ulcers

        4. Infectious diseases incidence

        5. Amount of insulin needed for glucose control

        6. Length of mechanical ventilation

        7. Readmission to Intensive Care Unit

        8. Mortality rate
