  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a cognitive-existential intervention
      (using either an individual or a group format) to improve the existential and global quality
      of life of patients as compared to usual care in a population of adult non-metastatic cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People diagnosed with cancer must learn to cope with loss of meaning and empowerment which
      compromises quality of life. Questions regarding &quot;Why me?&quot;, along with universal existential
      concerns about death, search for meaning, and sense of control over one's life, often
      constitute the principal source of overall suffering. Since there is no single and
      identifiable cause for cancer, those existential questions are commonly observed among
      patients who demand specific interventions to properly address this central issue. The
      existential approach can be used to help patients find meaning in the midst of a crisis. It
      addresses a central issue of survivorship in cancer.

      The conceptual model explains the relation between being exposed to a stressful and traumatic
      life event such as cancer and the risk of progressing toward adjustment difficulties which
      compromises quality of life and existential integrity. Cancer constitutes a major stressor
      involving significant losses that confronts the person's beliefs system. A set of therapeutic
      strategies can help to cope with this inevitable challenge: 1) cognitive-behavioral
      strategies; 2) direct existential intervention; and 3) social support through
      supportive-expressive strategies. Adjustment first involves cognitive reframing of the
      perception of the situation (situational meaning). Cognitive reframing also contributes to a
      readjustment of personal beliefs and values (global meaning and existential dimension).
      Existential strategies enable to further this process by including cognitive (beliefs, sense
      of coherence, expectations), motivational (choice, goal setting, and goal driving) and
      affective dimensions. The expressive-supportive strategy promotes active listening and
      non-judgmental support to encourage expression of emotions. The use of these active coping
      strategies (meaning-based) to the threatened-life challenge enables optimization of
      existential and global quality of life, as opposed to employing passive strategies such as
      avoidance.

    <description>At every time frame, we use two questionnaires to measure the primary outcome:
The McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL): 16 items plus a single-item global scale.
Spiritual well-being (FACIT-SP): The FACIT-SP is a sub-scale of the FACT-G (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General) and a French version of the &quot;FACIT-SP, FACIT-Spiritual well-being scale&quot;. This questionnaire has two sub-scales: Meaning/Peace (8 items) and Faith (4 items).</description>

    <description>Over the past 2 years we developed a 12-week cognitive-existential intervention consisting of 12 modules. The first three modules essentially involve cognitive and behavioral techniques proposing reinforcement of the use of active behavioral (e.g., relaxation, activation) and emotional (cognitive reframing) strategies. This content comes from classical cognitive-behavioral techniques. The next 3 modules, inspired by empirically-tested interventions further explore emotional strategies. The last six modules specifically address the existential dimension. They are adapted from logotherapy techniques, which are also empirically-based, and have been adapted to a French-Canadian culture by our team. They aim to improve meaning-based and emotional coping strategies.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be of 18 years of age or more;

          -  Speak French;

          -  Have received a diagnosis of non-metastatic cancer;

          -  Be available to participate in the program of 12 weekly group or individual sessions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Depressive mood (score greater than 10 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
             depressive subscale) that could interfere with the intervention. Since we specifically
             target the existential dimension and it might temporarily provoke questioning in
             patients, high psychological distress must first be addressed using other approaches.

          -  Diagnosis of metastatic cancer or diagnosis of non-metastatic cancer with a usually
             fast-growing and unpredictable course, making it unlikely to adhere to the
             intervention (e.g., pancreatic cancer, acute leukemia, glioblastoma).
