  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of genes on addictive and neuropsychiatric disorders is complex, especially
      given that multiple genes likely influence certain behaviors that are correlated with
      addiction. Researchers are interested in looking at the genetic information of individuals
      who are enrolled on National Institute for Drug Abuse studies to investigate specific genetic
      variants that may be related to substance abuse. Researchers will study the effects of genes
      on several aspects of thinking such as attention, memory, decision making, problem solving,
      learning, and emotional feelings, and investigate the ways in which genetic information
      affects addictive behaviors and substance abuse. In addition, researchers will study how
      genes may explain differences in imaging data in substance users.

      Objectives:

      - To collect genetic information for research on genetic aspects of addiction and substance
      abuse.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults age 18 or older

             -  (1) healthy, non-drug-using nonsmokers,

             -  (2) healthy smokers,

             -  (3) healthy individuals dependent on other commonly abused drugs, and

             -  (4) individuals with other psychiatric disorders.

        -  Participants must be right-handed, and must be enrolled in another National Institute on
           Drug Abuse, Intramural Research Program imaging protocol.

      Design:

        -  This study involves one to two visits to National Institute on Drug Abuse, Intramural
           Research Program that may be separate from the participant s current research protocol
           study visits or on the same day as those visits. .

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample and complete questionnaires about mood, memory,
           and learning.

        -  Participants may also be asked to do a few tasks, such as playing computer games
           involving coin tosses and money management, or responding to questions on a computer
           screen.

      Objective: To determine genetic variants as well as behavioral measures across different
      study group populations. Results of these will be used as regressors to help explain
      inter-individual differences in data collected across IRP protocols.

      Study Population: The study population will include 1) healthy non-smoking, non-drug
      dependent participants 2) healthy nicotine-dependent individuals 3) healthy individuals
      dependent on other commonly abused drugs 4) individuals with other psychiatric disorders and
      5) treatment-seeking individuals dependent on nicotine or other commonly abused drugs.
      Participants must be under evaluation for another NIDA-IRP protocol, generally healthy, and
      age 18 or older.

      Design: This study will require 1 visit (approximately 4-6 hours) to the NIDA-IRP, which may
      be in conjunction with another NIDA-IRP study. The characterization instruments are divided
      into two sections: Common Instruments and Additional Instruments. Common Instruments include
      instruments in common with what is done under a similar protocol at NIAAA. All participants
      will complete these instruments along with the blood sample, Delayed Discounting task and MRI
      scan. The completion of these items will define a completer of this protocol. Subjects will
      have the option to complete the study in multiple visits if they choose. After being
      consented into the study, the participant will be asked to submit a blood sample, complete
      various questionnaires, characterization instruments and several behavioral tasks. Blood will
      only be drawn once, provided there are no technical problems (such as sample damage during
      collection, preparation, shipping or assay) requiring a repeat draw. Participants in more
      than one NIDA-IRP protocol will be asked to repeat a few of the time-sensitive questionnaires
      in this protocol during subsequent MRI visits, as required by other IRP imaging protocols in
      which the subject may be participating. Data acquired in this protocol will be compared to
      data acquired in other NIDAIRP protocols.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures in this study are the genetic, behavioral and
      phenotypic factors that are related to addiction. Secondary outcome measures are to compare
      the genetic, behavioral and phenotypic factors to imaging and behavioral data acquired across
      other IRP protocols.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All participants must be:

          1. eligible for or already enrolled in a NIDA-IRP study.

          2. greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Justification: Some NIDA-IRP studies have
             includeed teens, aged 13 - 17, but no current studies include them so we will only
             include adults in this study for now.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Not consented to NIDA IRP imaging protocol. Exclusion criteria are limited to those in the
        NIDA IRP imaging protocol to which the subject has been consented.

        Exclusion for MRI portion:

          1. History of neurological illnesses including but not limited to CVA, CNS tumor, head
             trauma, MS or other demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders, or migraine
             in treatment.

          2. Cognitive impairment (unless this population of subjects is included in another IRP
             protocol in which the subject is also participating).

          3. Current major mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder (unless this population of subjects
             is included in another IRP protocol in which the subject is also participating).

          4. Pregnancy.

          5. HIV

          6. Unable to undergo MRI scanning due to possible pregnancy, metallic devices in the
             body, claustrophobia or body morphometry.

          7. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications that may
             interfere with the BOLD MRI signal.

          8. Left-handed.
