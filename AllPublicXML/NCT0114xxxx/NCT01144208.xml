  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if poor bone quality increases the risk of specific
      types of treatment complications in patients with distal radius fractures treated with open
      reduction and Locking Compression Plates(LCP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite fractures of the wrist being widely regarded as &quot;fragility fractures&quot;, there is good
      evidence that they are caused by diminished Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and that a low BMD
      value predicts a higher fracture risk at the distal radius. Both measurements of areal BMD
      with DXA and volumetric BMD with peripheral Quantitative Computer Tomography (pQCT)showed a
      lower BMD in women with Colles' fractures. Thus, Colles' fractures can be recognized as a
      good indication of underlying osteoporosis. High resolution peripheral Quantitative Computer
      Tomography at the distal radius will be evaluated in a subset of patients.

      Clinical experts are concerned that osteoporosis increases the risk for poor outcomes and
      complication rates in surgical patients with osteoporosis. However, this has not yet been
      confirmed in clinical studies. It is important to investigate this question in order to
      correctly advise clinicians and patients and possibly develop tailored approaches for
      treatment of osteoporotic patients with distal radius fractures.

    <description>High-resolution pQCT of the contralateral side with an XTremeCT will be performed in a subset of patients in Zürich. To obtain the bone mineral content the CT values will be calibrated with the help of a phantom in hydoxyapatite (HA) densities in mg HA/cm3. The relation of bone volume to tissue volume will be calculated as BV/TV. These values will be analyzed separately.</description>
