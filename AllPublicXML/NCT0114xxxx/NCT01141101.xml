  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and
      infections have been increasing in the general population, including the pediatric
      population. It has been reported that MRSA colonization persists for up to four years, and
      therefore the youngest pediatric patients, specifically those who are less than 2 years of
      age, have a high risk of prolonged colonization during a period of time when they are
      susceptible to significant skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) attributable to MRSA. Once
      prolonged colonization takes place, recurrent SSTIs are commonplace, resulting in substantial
      morbidity and in some cases mortality, as well as a significant cost to the healthcare
      system. Individuals colonized with MRSA have an increased risk of developing MRSA infections,
      which range from mild disease, such as carbuncles, to severe infections, such as necrotizing
      pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome. The prevalence of severe MRSA infections is also greatest
      in neonates and infants, where increased MRSA colonization has been observed. In the early
      infant period, the most common manifestation of MRSA disease is pustular skin lesions, which
      affect approximately 5% of the general population, with MRSA-colonization being a major risk
      factor for this disease. Moreover, the prevalence of pustular disease is increasing in the
      general population, and there are numerous case reports of invasive, life-threatening MRSA
      disease in the early infant period.

      Corresponding to the increasing prevalence in the community, the carriage of MRSA in pregnant
      women has also escalated, and vaginal carriage is significant in pregnant women. As an
      analogy, maternal vaginal Group B Streptococcal (GBS) colonization is the major risk for
      infant colonization regardless of whether early or late neonatal colonization or disease
      occurs. It is quite feasible that vaginal MRSA carriage predisposes newborns to colonization
      during the birthing process; however, this mechanism has not yet been well studied. There are
      other mechanisms implicated for early infant colonization, including close contact with
      MRSA-colonized mothers through daily care and breastfeeding. MRSA colonization in one
      household member greatly predisposes colonization in others; therefore, early infant
      colonization could result from contact with other MRSA-colonized individuals in a household.
      Currently, it is not clear which factors are the most important in influencing early infant
      MRSA colonization and subsequent infection.

      Not only is the prevalence of MRSA colonization and infection on the rise, but there have
      been few if any measures that have been established to prevent colonization and subsequent
      infection in adults and children. Eradication measures have shown limited long-term benefit.
      If vertical transmission of MRSA can be established as a critical event in the pathogenesis
      of disease, potentially effective strategies could be tested, and possibly the spread of MRSA
      in the community interrupted.

      Hypotheses and Specific Aims:

        1. Identify the proportion, rate and time of MRSA colonization in infants born to mothers
           with and without MRSA colonization;

        2. Compare risk factors for infant MRSA colonization in these two groups;

        3. Determine the prevalence and risk factors for developing MRSA infections in the
           MRSA-colonized infant.

        The exposed group will include 100 MRSA-colonized mothers and their babies. The unexposed
        group will include 100 MRSA-negative mothers and their babies. The groups will be
        conveniently selected from all mothers and infants meeting the inclusion and exclusion
        criteria each month. Enrollment will continue until 100 babies and mothers in the
        MRSA-positive mother group and 100 babies and mothers in MRSA-negative mother group are
        enrolled. We estimate that enrollment will require approximately 18 months to complete.

        Household contacts of infants will be enrolled. A contact is defined as any individual who
        had or has had the same primary residences (who has lived in the same house for at least
        one week) as the infant since the infant's birth. We will ask the infants mother to
        identify the infants household contacts.

        Infant care givers include any person who provides daily care to infant for at least 4
        hours per day at least 3 days of week.
