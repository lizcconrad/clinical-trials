  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain plant foods are high in furanocoumarins. Test tube and animal studies suggest that
      furanocoumarins may help prevent cancer. It is difficult to determine in humans if
      furanocoumarins do prevent cancer because there isn't an objective way to tell who has eaten
      these compounds. This study will develop a urine test to determine if an individual ate foods
      that contain furanocoumarins.
