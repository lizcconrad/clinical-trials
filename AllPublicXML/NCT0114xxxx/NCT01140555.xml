    <textblock>
      This pilot study has a sequential design involving three groups to ensure appropriate
      development and evaluation of the optimal procedural steps of the D-UAO device and to confirm
      that those steps are reproducible in the hands of multiple surgeons.

      1. Group 1 - beginning with the use of the current instructions for use (IFU) will have
           adjustments made as necessary to the D-UAO procedural steps for uterine artery occlusion
           confirmed by 2/3-D Power Colour Doppler ultrasound (2/3DPD).

        2. Group 2 - verify that optimal D-UAO IFU procedural steps generated in Group 1 as
           confirmed by 2/3DPD.

        3. Group 3 - verify that the optimal D-UAO procedural steps are reproducible in the hands
           of multiple surgeons in addition to the group 1 investigators, as confirmed by 2/3DPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 25-55 years with regular menses and at least one symptom related to uterine
             fibroids (for example heavy bleeding).

          -  Completed child-bearing.

          -  At least one uterine fibroid of 3 cm diameter or greater with a prevailing pathology
             (e.g. as opposed to adenomyosis) of fibroids determined through abdominal/transvaginal
             ultrasound.

          -  Confirmation of the ability to clearly visualise bilateral uterine arteries with
             2/3DPD.

          -  Dominant fibroid (defined as &gt;3cm in diameter) must be well vascularised as determined
             by CE-MRI (for Group 2 and 3 patients only).

          -  Able to tolerate the required prolonged supine position during treatment
             (approximately 6 hours).

          -  Cervix suitable for tenaculum placement as determined by pelvic exam.

          -  Normal Pap smear within the last 36 months.

          -  Agrees to participate in the study, and following review of the patient information
             sheet documents this agreement by signing the Ethics Committee approved informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, or uterine artery ligation.

          -  Pregnancy (As confirmed by a urine pregnancy test at screening and immediately prior
             to procedure).

          -  One or more lower uterine segment fibroids determined through pelvic exam which in the
             examiner's opinion would prevent proper clamp application.

          -  Any known contraindications to the contrast agent to be used for the CE-MRI as
             determined by the study radiologist (for Group 2 and 3 patients only).

          -  Pelvic mass outside the uterus suggesting other disease processes.

          -  An intrauterine device (IUD) in place during the day of procedure.

          -  Hydronephrosis as determined by interpretation of a pre-procedure renal ultrasound.

          -  No ureteral jets observed on ultrasound prior to clamping.

          -  Presence of a pedunculated fibroid determined by ultrasound, hysteroscopy, or saline
             infused sonography or CE MRI.

          -  Any current acute or chronic systemic infection or localized pelvic infection,
             including an unresolved urinary tract infection.

          -  Clinical history of any thromboembolic disease.

          -  History of gynecologic malignancy, atypical endometrial hyperplasia, or pelvic
             inflammatory disease.

          -  Using anticoagulation therapy (except OTC treatments, e.g. aspirin), or has a known
             underlying bleeding disorder.

          -  In the investigator's opinion, any medical condition or psychiatric illness that could
             potentially be life threatening or affect their ability to complete the study visits
             according to this protocol.
