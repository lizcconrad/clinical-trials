  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the trial is to test the hypothesis that Online Adaptive
      Radiotherapy for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer is feasible across multiple Radiation
      Oncology departments.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm multicentre feasibility trial in which the primary aim is to determine
      the compliance rate of patients to online adaptive radiotherapy for muscle invasive bladder
      cancer over multiple Australian and New Zealand centres. The compliance rate is defined as
      the proportion of patients successfully completing treatment without a major protocol
      deviation.

      Subject to the accrual being at least 40 patients in the first 2 years, accrual will continue
      until a total of 50 patients have been accrued. If this accrual target is not met, then
      consideration will be given to stopping the trial early due to poor accrual. Each patient
      will be followed-up until 2 years after the last patient's date of accrual. Assessments for
      toxicity and recurrence or progression will take place at four weeks after completion of
      treatment, then three monthly from the end of treatment for the first 12 months and then 6
      monthly thereafter.

    <description>A radical dose of radiotherapy to be delivered to the entire bladder volume: 64Gy in 32 fractions over 6 weeks and 2 treatment days.
Conventional plan is used to deliver treatment for fractions 1 to 7 using a standard planning approach and a CTV to PTV margin of 1.5cm.
Adaptive plan is used to deliver treatment for fractions 8 through 32 using the same standard techniques as for fractions 1 to 7 but using one of three specific CTV volumes,namely: small, average or large. In all these cases the CTV to PTV margin is 0.7cm. Image guidance using a treatment unit based verification CT unit (Cone Beam CT or CT on Rails)based on soft tissue delineation is used to position the treatment fields and select the plan to best cover the CTV.</description>
