  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following a cryptogenic stroke, many patients are nowadays treated with the percutaneous
      closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO), assuming that the aetiology of the stroke is
      secondary to a paradoxical embolism. After the PFO closure procedure a dual antiplatelet
      regimen is often prescribed for 3-6 months and several cardiologic and neurologic follow-up
      exams are scheduled in the first 12 months of follow-up. Usually a transthoracic +/-
      transoesophageal echocardiography (TTE +/- TEE) are performed at 6 months, however this kind
      of control is not systematically performed. In order to improve the clinical outcomes in this
      young patients' population, the investigators prospectively perform a complete cardiologic
      and neurologic follow-up program to all patients undergoing a successful percutaneous closure
      of a PFO.

      The aim of these controls is to confirm the good position of the PFO-device, to confirm the
      absence of any residual right to left shunt or any significant atrial arrhythmias Furthermore
      this prospective follow-up will analyze the possible mechanisms leading to a cerebral stroke
      recurrence (e.g. size of the PFO, presence of an atrial septal aneurysm, presence of a
      residual shunt, size of the utilized closure device, ....).

      At follow-up the following exams will be performed:

        -  at hospital discharge: chest X-ray +/- TTE + 7-days event loop record (ELR)

        -  at 6 months: clinical cardiologic and neurologic examination + TTE + TEE + 7-days ELR +
           trans-cranial doppler (TCD) with micro bubbles detection.

        -  at 1 year: clinical cardiologic and neurologic examination + TTE +/- TEE + 7-days ELR +
           trans-cranial doppler (TCD) with micro bubbles detection +/- cerebral MRI
