  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental disorders, mainly various anxiety and depressive disorders, are an increasing reason
      for sick leave and disability pension. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been shown to
      have an effect on anxiety and depression, but the investigators know little about this in
      relation to employment. Close follow-up in ordinary employment increase employment
      participation for serious mental illness, but this is not yet investigated to the same degree
      for lighter mental disorders.

      Center for Work-Coping (No: &quot;Senter for Jobbmestring&quot; - SJM) combines Cognitive behaviour
      therapy (CBT) and individual placement and support (IPS) and facilitation of work for people
      with anxiety and depression who are in danger of falling out of work.

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in SJM. The effect
      will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which participants will be
      randomized to SJM or regular follow-up by The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration
      (NAV) or by their regular general practitioners (GP) and self-help resources. The main
      outcome measures are work participation with changes in mental health as a secondary outcome.
