      5.2 AUTOLOGOUS PBSCS HARVESTING

      5.2.1. PBSCs will be collected during recovery phase after the second cycle of HDAC
      consolidation chemotherapy.

      5.2.2. For mobilization, recombinant human granulocyte- colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF,
      Filgrastim) will be given subcutaneously at a dose of 10 mcg/kg from day 9 of the 2nd HDAC
      cycle until the completion of harvesting.

      5.2.3. PBSCs harvesting will be performed via perm-cath or Quinton catheter, which will be
      inserted with fluoroscopy-guided before starting and will be removed after finishing harvest.

      5.2.4. Harvest will be initiated from the day when the peripheral absolute neutrophil count
      reach up to 0.2 x 109/mm3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected by
      leukapheresis method with 'CS-3000' (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) or other compatible machine. Cell
      collection will be performed for at least 2 days and the duration of collection can be
      extended until a target CD34+ cell dose of 5 x 106/kg (in terms of body weight of recipient)
      is collected.

      5.2.5. If adequate numbers of CD34+ cells are not collected, the 3rd HDAC chemotherapy will
      be done and mobilization/harvest procedure will be repeated.

      5.2.6. Stem cells harvested from patient will be frozen in liquid nitrogen tank for future
      autologous HCT cell infusion.

      5.3.PRETRANSPLANT WORKUP FOR AUTOLOGOUS HCT 5.3.1. Pre-workup for checking the current
      disease status and feasibility for autologous HCT will be performed before the conditioning
      and infusion of autologous HCT.

      5.3.2. It is recommended that baseline workup for hematologic / non-hematologic status will
      be performed at least 1 month prior to the initiation of conditioning. Bone marrow aspirate/
      biopsy with cytogenetics and diagnostic lumbar puncture can be performed immediately before
      the initiation of conditioning.

      5.3.3. Pretransplant workup tests are listed in Appendix IV.

      5.4. CONDITIONING REGIMEN FOR AUTOLOGOUS HCT 5.4.1. On admission, 5.4.1.1.Menstruating women
      will be given norethindrone (Norlutate) 10mg po daily until platelet count is consistently
      over 100,000 /mcL.

      5.4.1.2.Actual body weight (ABW) for busulfan will be calculated using following guidelines;
      5.4.1.2.1.If ABW is less or equal to ideal body weight (IBW), use ABW. 5.4.1.2.2.If ABW is
      greater than IBW but ABW is within 120% of IBW, use IBW. 5.4.1.2.3.If ABW is 120% or greater
      than IBW, use IBW+25% (ABW-IBW). 5.4.1.2.4.IBW(ideal body weight) will be calculated in
      5.4.1.2.4.1.Male: 50 kg + 2.3kg (height[inch]-60) 5.4.1.2.4.2.Female: 45.5kg + 2.3kg
      (height[inch]-60) 5.4.1.2.4.3.1inch=2.54cm 5.4.2. On day -8, preparation drugs will be
      administered to patient as below; 5.4.2.1.Hydration with 0.9% normal saline will be started
      at 6PM and infused continuously at a rate of 100mL/hr through day -4.

      5.4.2.2.Allopurinol 300mg/day will be taken p.o. once a day from day-8 to -2. 5.4.2.3.Heparin
      100 U/kg/day in normal saline 500 mL will be infused continuously at a rate of 20mL/hr
      through day 20 (6pm). Heparin should be discontinued if there is clinically significant
      bleeding or aPTT level exceeds 1.2 time of the upper normal limit.

      5.4.2.4.Dilantin 15mg/kg (ABW) in normal saline 300cc will be infused continuously at a rate
      of 200mL/hr at 8PM, and then, 200mg will be taken p.o. twice a day through day -4. Dilantin
      level should be monitored in the morning of day-7 and -6 to maintain the level within 10 to
      20 mg/L.

      5.4.3.1.Busulfan 3.2mg/kg/day in normal saline of 10 times the volume of busulfan will be
      infused continuously over 3 hours with an interval of 24 hours on days -7 to -5 (for 3 days).

      5.4.3.2.Etoposide 200mg/m2/day in normal saline 1000mL will be infused continuously over 5
      hours twice a day with an interval of 12 hours on day-3 to -2 (for 2 days).

      infusion.

      5.5.1.2.PBSCs will be infused via saline infusion set without in-line filters. 5.5.1.3.Vital
      sign should be checked 4 times with 15 minutes of interval, 4 times with 30 minutes, and then
      4 times with 1 hour. Electrocardiogram monitoring will be performed from the start until the
      completion of PBSCs infusion.
