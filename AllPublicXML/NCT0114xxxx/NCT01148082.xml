  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to investigate school response to families who have children
      with cancer. It is anticipated that the results of this study will enhance the support that
      schools can give to the population of families who have a child with cancer. The study will
      involve the parents in these families, the principal and an educator in the school of the
      child with cancer. Measurement tools will include surveys, interviews, and other relevant
      educational and medical documents.

    <description>Identify significant patterns. Documents, interview, surveys and the quantitative instrument will be analyzed with an inductive cross-case analysis. Inductive analysis means that the patterns, themes, and categories emerged out of the data rather than being imposed on them prior to data collection and analysis. A cross-case analysis means that the information will be grouped together according to answers from different people, themes, perspectives or issues. Then, a content analysis will be conducted which includes the process of identifying, coding, and categorizing the primary patterns in the data. In the final step, the data will be interpreted. Interpretation, by definition, goes beyond description. Interpretation means attaching significance to what was found offering explanations, drawing conclusions, making inferences, building linkages, attaching meaning, imposing order and dealing with rival explanations</description>
