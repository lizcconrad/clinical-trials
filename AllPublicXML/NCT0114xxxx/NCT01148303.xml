  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to study whether the use of the pain medication etoricoxib (Arcoxia)
      taken just before the Ramadan fast will prevent or lessen headache that some people get while
      fasting. The investigators hypothesize that etoricoxib will reduce the number of people
      getting headache, more than placebo. The investigators will do this by giving participants in
      the study either real medication or placebo (sugar pill) and comparing the results. The
      investigators will study this over two weeks. The first week one group will get the medicine
      and the other the placebo. The second the groups will switch. Neither the subjects nor the
      investigators will know who is in which group.

    <description>The subjects will be asked to fill out a daily 'headache diary' at the end of the fast. They will be asked if they had a headache on that day, and if so its severity. We will then compare the number of subjects having a headache on each day and total number of 'headache days' between the groups.</description>

    <measure>Severity of Headache</measure>

    <description>We will ask the subject if they had a headache on a given day to rate its severity. We will then compare the severity of headache between groups.</description>

    <measure>Overall ease of fast</measure>
    <time_frame>Two weeks</time_frame>
