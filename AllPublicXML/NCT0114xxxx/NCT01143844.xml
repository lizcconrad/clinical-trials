      Hypothesis: Girls and women exposed to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy experience
      endocrine changes more similar to women in their late reproductive years than to same-age
      peers. These changes will be more dramatic in women who receive high dose therapy compared to
      women who receive low dose therapy.

      At annual visits over 3-5 years, a combination of physical exam, medical history, menstrual
      diary keeping, pelvic ultrasound and blood hormones tests will be used to measure &quot;ovarian
      reserve&quot; , that is the number and quality of the eggs that remain in the ovaries. The study
      will also try to learn if those who received higher doses of certain chemotherapies are more
      likely to have changes in these tests sooner than those women who received smaller doses of
      these same drugs. Additionally a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sample will be collected to look
      for gene variations that may predict susceptibility to ovarian damage from cancer treatments.
      Information learned from this study may help researchers to develop guidelines to identify
      problems with a female cancer survivor's ovaries before irregular menses or other symptoms of
      ovarian failure occur.

      Up to 400 females will participate in this study in one of three cohorts:

           radiation therapy

        -  150 Unexposed peers, ages 11-35, never exposed to chemotherapy or radiation therapy

        -  100 Unexposed females, ages 40-50 never exposed to chemotherapy or radiation therapy

        Subjects with a history of cancer, or other conditions treated by chemotherapy, will be
        identified through local survivorship programs or self-referral. In addition, two groups of
        regularly menstruating unexposed subjects will be recruited through local advertising: a
        group of similar-age subjects and another group in the late reproductive years. Exposed and
        unexposed controls will be frequency matched with respect to age (within 2 years) at
        enrollment. In addition,subjects will be balanced with respect to self reported
        race/ethnicity. Enrollment is purposefully targeted and stratified for this study to
        reflect the population in the pediatric and adult oncology practices.
