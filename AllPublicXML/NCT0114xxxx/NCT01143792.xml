  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth who leave home for the streets are at significantly more risk for a multitude of
      problems, yet little research is available to guide treatment intervention efforts with this
      population. Studies document high rates of substance use, HIV risk, mental health problems,
      teenage pregnancy and criminality. Research to date examining homeless, street living youth
      has been primarily descriptive; less effort has been directed towards developing and
      evaluating treatment interventions for this group. The majority of homeless youth do not
      receive substance abuse treatment, with one study reporting that only 15% of street living
      youth report ever receiving mental health services. The effectiveness of the Community
      Reinforcement Approach (CRA) with street living youth was studied in our recently completed
      Stage 1 trial. The proposed study is a Stage II clinical trial examining outcome of CRA
      individual therapy as compared to two interventions commonly employed, yet little researched,
      with this group. All clients will be randomized to one of three theoretically distinct
      interventions: (1) CRA therapy, (2) Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), or (3) Case
      Management (CM). The relative effectiveness of these interventions will be evaluated at 3, 6,
      and 12 months post-baseline. The Social Ecology Theory of Development (Bronfenbrenner, 1979)
      guides our change hypotheses and intervention. Proposed change mechanisms (mediators) for
      each intervention will be evaluated. Differential treatment response as a function of
      ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation and abuse (moderators) will be investigated to
      better understand the interventions. The study will also examine how, if at all, treatment
      engagement, retention and expectations impact youth response to the three treatments.
      Information gained through this project may help address the gap in our understanding of how
      best to effectively intervene with a group at high risk for continuing health and
      psychological problems.
