      The purpose of this study is to determine tranexamic acid plasma levels in children
      undergoing cardiac surgery at risk of bleeding and to compare two dosing regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is administered intravenously to prevent bleeding associated with
      cardiac surgery and by pass in adult and children. The pharmacokinetic of this product is
      unknown in the pediatric population. Only a few studies report a clinical efficacy with
      different dosages. The purpose of this study is to determine the plasma level of TXA using
      two different administrations methods: continuous versus intermittent. The second objective
      is to determine whether fibrinolysis decreased. The population consists in children weighting
      10 to 30 Kilos, undergoing cardiac surgery and at high risk of bleeding.
