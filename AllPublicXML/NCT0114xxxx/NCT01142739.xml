  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levodopa-induced dyskinesia severely limits the use of levodopa in Parkinson's disease and
      constitutes a debilitating complication of dopaminergic treatment in late stage. Among
      several neurobiological mechanisms identified so far, the investigators have established in
      experimental models the key role of D1 receptor hypersensitivity and a&quot;Ras-ERK&quot; signalling
      pathway. As the very same dopamine receptor machinery and the Ras-ERK pathway are present in
      blood lymphocytes, the investigators wish to test the hypothesis that the level of ERK
      phosphorylation in lymphocytes is a biomarker of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's
      Disease.

      The study will be performed in dyskinetic levodopa-treated patients and non-Parkinson's
      Disease controls. Blood sampling &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; levodopa treatment (1 hour post-dose), as
      well as clinical data collection will be done during a scheduled pre-op work-up (deep brain
      stimulation). Subsequently, suspended lymphocytes from blood samples will be immunolabelled
      using an anti-pERK antibody and mean fluorescence intensity and percent of labelled
      lymphocytes will be assessed by flow cytometry. Additionally, plasma and urine samples will
      be collected &quot;on&quot; et &quot;off&quot; for dosage of dopamine. The motor effect of levodopa will be
      assessed through UPRSIII rating scale and eye movement (saccades) speed by non-invasive
      oculometric recordings.
