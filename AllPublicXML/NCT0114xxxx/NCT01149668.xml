      An open-label, monotherapy, multicenter, extension study open to subjects who have derived
      benefit from PCI 24781 PO for at least 6 months and want to continue receiving study drug.

      Subjects enrolled in this study will receive PCI-24781 at the schedule and dosage from their
      prior protocol. Treatment may be continued as long as there is no evidence of progressive
      disease or unacceptable toxicity.
