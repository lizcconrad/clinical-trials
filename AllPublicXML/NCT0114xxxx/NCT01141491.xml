  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoma patients are at high risk for their cancer to recur even when the sarcoma has been
      removed surgically or treated with radiation or chemotherapy. The patients in the study will
      be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive either a vaccine that is combined with an
      immune system stimulant or the immune system stimulant alone. The immune system stimulant is
      called OPT-821 and is an immunological booster. The trivalent vaccine is being developed to
      teach the patient's immune system to recognize 3 types of sugars called GM2, GD2 and GD3 that
      are found primarily on the surface of sarcoma cells. If the trivalent vaccine can stimulate
      the patient's immune system to develop antibodies which recognize and target the GM2, GD2 and
      GM3 sugars, then the patient's antibodies could attack and kill any remaining sarcoma cells
      potentially preventing the recurrence of sarcoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, multi-center study of a trivalent
      ganglioside vaccine plus the immunological adjuvant OPT-821 (Arm A) versus OPT-821 alone (Arm
      B) for patients with metastatic sarcoma at initial presentation or with relapsed disease who
      have been rendered disease-free following either surgical resection or multi-modality
      therapy. The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of vaccine therapy over
      non-specific immune therapy. Another aim of this study is to obtain sufficient data to
      further the development of this specific vaccine therapy as well as guide future study
      designs for therapeutic cancer vaccines in general.

      To be eligible, patients must have histologically confirmed sarcoma, must be clinically free
      of disease after surgery or multimodality therapy, and must be within 8 weeks of completion
      of such therapy. Given the limited data regarding ganglioside expression in Ewing sarcoma,
      rhabdomyosarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, patients with these sarcoma subtypes
      with the exception of pleomorphic/anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma will be excluded. Patients must
      have a history of distant metastatic disease; patients with locally recurrent disease only
      will not be eligible, as these patients demonstrate a different natural history from those
      with metastatic disease.

      All treatment will be performed in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive a total of 10 treatments of either the vaccine plus OPT-821 (Arm A) or
      OPT-821 alone (Arm B). Treatment will be administered on Visit Weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 16, 28, 40,
      52, 68, and 84. All patients will receive 150 mcg of OPT-821.

    <description>The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) over time.
Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization until any evidence of tumor growth or appearance anywhere in the body or death from any cause as determined by the principal investigator at each site. The principal investigator will determine Progression-free survival by using CT scans to evaluate disease recurrence. For the purpose of this study, progression of disease is defined as the development of tumor growth or recurrence at any site of the body as determined by the principal investigator at each study site or death from disease</description>

        <description>The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) over time.
Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization until any evidence of tumor growth or appearance anywhere in the body or death from any cause as determined by the principal investigator at each site. The principal investigator will determine Progression-free survival by using CT scans to evaluate disease recurrence. For the purpose of this study, progression of disease is defined as the development of tumor growth or recurrence at any site of the body as determined by the principal investigator at each study site or death from disease</description>
