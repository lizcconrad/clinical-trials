  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomised, double-blind study will compare an oral immunomodulatory solution to a
      placebo for the prevention of acute severe mucositis in head and neck cancer patients treated
      surgically and concomitantly with radiochemotherapy. The investigators expect a decrease of
      25% of severe acute mucositis in experimental arm.

    <description>The patients will benefit in each case from a similar energy supplement (either Oral Impact or placebo) during the 5 days preceding the course of chemotherapy. They will receive the supplement 3 times per day at 10am, 3pm and 5pm outside of their meals. In total, the patients will take the supplements for 15 days (3 courses of 5 days). If the patient has difficulty taking the treatment orally, it can be given via an enteral tube (nasogastric tube or percutaneous gastrostomy). All patients in the protocol will systematically receive a dietetic consultation.
This consultation by a dietician will detect malnutrition and result in nutritional counsel if necessary (advice re. enrichment of diet, CNO without immunonutrients, artificial nutrition). Follow-up appointments with a dietician will be organised every 3 weeks to maintain adherence to the suggested dietary changes.</description>
