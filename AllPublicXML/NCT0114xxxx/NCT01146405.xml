      1. To investigate whether the auditory stimulation causes changes in hormones levels
           (cortisol+prolactin) during general anesthesia.

        2. To determine if there is a correlation between hormones levels (cortisol+prolactin) and
           dreams recall.

        3. To investigate whether, in patients receiving auditory stimulation, there is a
           correlation between hormones levels (cortisol+prolactin), serum remifentanil
           concentration and detection of implicit memory.

        4. To investigate the presence of primary auditory cortex activation (temporal lobe) in
           patients with implicit memory and in those with dreams recall using the EEG-ERP 128
           channels GES300 EGI system.

    <textblock>
      Patients from group A, during maintenance of anesthesia, at the time of trocar insertion,
      will listen (via MP3) a piece of one of two stories, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, each
      followed by four keywords. In group B, patients will be isolated from the sounds of the
      operating room using specific headphones.

    <description>The blood sample will be taken 30 minutes before induction of anaesthesia to determine baseline hormones (cortisol + prolactine) levels.</description>

    <measure>Remifentanil concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes after achieving a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 12 mmHg</time_frame>
    <description>One blood sample will be taken to determine steady state concentration of remifentanil (only in a subset of patients).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 hours after surgery for explicit memory, implicit memory and for dreams recall detected after awakening from anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to associate with keywords the first thing that comes them to mind (implicit memory). Also eplicit memory and dreams recall will be tested at the same time. The content of intraoperative dreams (confirmed by a brief post-anesthesia interview) will be analyzed using the 5-point Likert scale.</description>
