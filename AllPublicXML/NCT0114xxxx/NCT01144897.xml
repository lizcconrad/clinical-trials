    <textblock>
      One purpose of this research study is to examine if a special type of imaging test, a
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan using the radioactive material [C-11] acetate, will
      be helpful in detecting prostate cancer lesions in subjects with castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer. This PET scan will be combined with a computed tomography (CT) scan taken during the
      same imaging session. The other purpose of the PET-CT scan using [C-11] acetate (PET Acetate
      Scan) is to assist in identifying who is responding to the treatment (docetaxel
      chemotherapy).

    <description>PET-acetate as an intermediate endpoint in the assessment of response of patients undergoing docetaxel for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC).
Subjects will be treated with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2 every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Subjects will have two PET acetate scans - one prior to beginning chemotherapy and one approximately 8-9 weeks after chemotherapy has begun.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written consent document.

          2. Patients must have histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate at any
             time in the past.

          3. At the time of enrollment: Patients must have evidence of castrate resistant
             metastatic prostate cancer (patients with rising PSA only and no other radiographic
             evidence of metastatic prostate cancer are not eligible). In addition, progressive
             disease is required as per #5 below.

          4. Two categories of eligible patients exist: Measurable disease with any level of serum
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) OR Non-measurable disease (positive bone scan) with
             PSA equal or greater than 2 ng/ml

             Definition of Measurable Disease/Target Lesions - Any lesion &gt;/= 1 cm on spiral
             computed tomography (CT) that is believed to represent metastatic prostate cancer and
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter). However,
             if the lesion is a lymph node, it needs to be equal or greater than 20 mm (longest
             diameter) based on CT scans or physical exam (palpable lymph nodes). Chest X-ray with
             clearly defined lung lesions surrounded by aerated lung or parenchymal lung lesions
             measured as 10 mm or greater with a spiral CT are also eligible.

             Definition of Non-measurable Disease/Non-target Lesions - Non-target lesions include
             all other lesions not included above, including bone lesions. Previously irradiated
             lesions should not be used for eligibility unless progression was documented after
             radiation therapy.

          5. In order to be eligible, patients must have demonstrated evidence of progressive
             disease prior to enrollment. Progressive disease is defined as any one of the
             following:

               -  Measurable Disease Progression: Objective evidence of increase 20% or more in the
                  sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions from the time of maximal
                  regression after prior therapy; or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

               -  Bone Scan Progression: Appearance of two or more new lesions on bone scan. If no
                  prior bone scan exists, presence of 2 lesions is needed for eligibility.

               -  PSA Progression: An elevated PSA (2 ng/mL or higher) which has risen serially on
                  at least two occasions at least each 1 week apart. Note: If patient was on
                  antiandrogens as last therapy, 6 weeks need to elapse after discontinuation of
                  the antiandrogen. For prior ketoconazole, 4 weeks need to elapse. If the
                  confirmatory PSA (#2) value is less than the first rising PSA value, then an
                  additional rising PSA (#3) will be required to document progression. For the
                  purposes of this study, the last PSA value recorded prior to the initiation of
                  treatment will be considered the baseline PSA.

          6. Progression despite standard androgen deprivation therapy.

          7. At least 4 weeks since any systemic steroids (any dose; unless used chronically for
             another illness at equal or less than 10 mg of prednisone daily, or in conjunction
             with prior ketoconazole resulting in slow steroid taper) and any other hormonal
             therapy.

          8. No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

          9. Four weeks or longer since major surgery and fully recovered.

         10. Four weeks or longer since any prior radiation (including palliative) and fully
             recovered.

         11. No prior strontium or samarium.

         12. Concurrent bisphosphonate use is allowed. However, if patient has not previously been
             on bisphosphonate, first dose should only occur after the baseline positron emission
             tomography (PET) acetate scan has been obtained.

         13. ECOG performance status: 0-2

         14. Age ≥ 18

         15. Required Initial Laboratory Values (within 14 days of registration):

        ANC ≥1500/microL; Platelet count ≥ 100,000/microL; Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper limits of
        normal; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limits of normal; AST and ALT ≤ 1.5 x upper limits of
        normal; PSA level requirements: see #4; Serum Testosterone ≤ 50 ng/ dL (for patients who
        have not had bilateral orchiectomy); Estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt; 30 mL/min

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No known brain metastases (brain imaging MRI/CT is not required unless clinical
             symptoms).

          2. No current congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV).

          3. No serious or non-healing wound, ulcer or bone fracture.

          4. No peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2.

          5. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other
             recombinant human antibodies are not eligible.

          6. Patients who received prior docetaxel for any reason are not eligible.

          7. PC-Spes, Saw Palmetto, and St. John's Wort must be discontinued before registration.
             The discontinuation of other herbal medications and food supplements is strongly
             encouraged. Patients may continue on daily vitamins and calcium supplements.

          8. No known allergy to acetate.

          9. No severe claustrophobia

         10. Concurrent use of statins is allowed on study but use should not have started 30 days
             prior to entry into the study
