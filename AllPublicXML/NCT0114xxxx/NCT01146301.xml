      As with coronary artery stenting, activation and embolisation of platelets occurs with
      carotid artery stenting (CAS). Based on promising data on the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin
      in coronary stenting this dual antiplatelet regimen has been introduced as adjunctive
      treatment during CAS. There is as yet, however, no randomized controlled trial which compared
      different loading doses of clopidogrel during CAS. Taking into account that a wide
      interindividual variability in the response to a loading of clopidogrel exists, this study is
      intended to establish the optimal loading dose of clopidogrel. Therefore platelet function
      testing and a 1-hour of postprocedural TCD (transcranial doppler) monitoring will be
      performed.

      Objective: Firstly, to investigate whether the absolute magnitude of Platelet Inhibition
      inversely correlates with the number of TCD-detected microemboli during and after CAS in
      patients who are being pre-treated with either a 300 mg or a 600 mg loading dose of
      clopidogrel. Secondly, if there is any impact on early neurological outcome determined by the
      loading dose of clopidogrel.

    <textblock>
      Carotid angioplasty with stent placement (CAS) has become a well-accepted treatment option
      for carotid artery stenosis. In combination with experience in CAS procedures and the
      introduction of protection devices and low-profile systems, the periprocedural risk of
      thromboembolic complications are comparable to that of standard surgical carotid
      endarterectomy (CEA) In our centre, all patients with severe asymptomatic carotid artery
      disease ( luminal diameter reduction of more than 80%, according to NASCET criteria)
      scheduled for cardiac surgery are eligible for CAS.

      As with coronary artery stenting , activation and embolisation of platelets occurs with CAS.
      Based on promising data on the use of clopidogrel plus aspirin in coronary stenting, this
      dual antiplatelet regimen has been introduced in CAS. Specifically, an antiplatelet regimen
      with aspirin(300mg) and a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel at least 24 hours before carotid
      angioplasty has currently been the treatment of choice in carotid angioplasty with stent
      placement.

      However, several studies have reported a wide interindividual variability in the response to
      a 300 mg loading of clopidogrel with a subsequent substantial proportion of patients not
      receiving the optimal benefit from it. Therefore, it has been suggested that a 600 mg loading
      dose will result in a faster onset, a higher responsiveness and a higher magnitude of
      platelet inhibition without any increase in bleeding complications. For these reasons, the
      interventional cardiology has already adopted the 600 mg loading dose regimen as standard of
      care during percutaneous coronary interventions. There is as yet, however, no randomized
      controlled trial which compared different loading doses of clopidogrel during CAS.

      Using transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral artery during CAS, it is
      possible to register the number of TCD-detected microembolic signals during and after CAS.
      This monitoring enables the operator to diminish the risk of stroke during CAS. However, a
      significant number of patients develop an ischemic stroke in the hours following CAS after a
      symptom-free interval As published by van der Schaaf et al., in TCD monitoring after CEA, one
      hour of monitoring appeared to be effective to select those patients in whom the number of
      microemboli did not spontaneously decrease. More important, postoperative TCD monitoring was
      able to detect those patients who were at risk for new adverse cerebral events after the
      operation. Other studies demonstrate the potential application of ultrasonic emboli detection
      to examine the efficacy of new platelet agents in relatively small number of patients.

      It remains to be established whether a higher magnitude of platelet inhibition before CAS has
      an additional protective effect by decreasing the microembolic load measured on TCD after the
      procedure. Moreover, such a TCD-monitoring post-CAS has not been performed systematically in
      the past and thus could reveal valuable information helpful to the understanding of post
      procedural cerebral complications and risk stratification.

    <measure>The number of TCD-detected microemboli during and immediately after the CAS procedure.</measure>
    <description>The TCD monitoring of the Middle cerebral artery will be started during and immediately after the CAS procedure , using a 2 MHz TCD ultrasound probe. The Doppler spectra will be observed on-line and the audio-Doppler signal will be made audible in the angiography suite. For off-line analysis, the audio Doppler signals will be recorded on CD ROM. Analysis of recordings will be performed by an observer blinded to the clinical details and study group. Standard criteria for microemboli detection will be used.</description>

    <description>Blood samples for platelet function testing will be drawn at two different time-points: Before the administration of the study medication (baseline value) and immediately before the CAS-procedure. (time-interval will be approximately 24 hours) Platelet function testing will be performed with several platelet function assays: &quot;classical&quot;light transmittance aggregometry, The VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, Thrombelastograph® (TEG®) PlaletetMapping™ Assay and the Platelet function analyser (PFA-100).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Periprocedural adverse cerebral events</measure>
    <description>All patients will be assessed prior to treatment, at discharge and at 30 days following the procedure by an independent stroke neurologist. Strokes will be considered disabling (major), if patients has a modified Rankin score of more than 3, at 30 days after onset of symptoms. A minor stroke is defined as a Rankin score of 3 or less that resolves completely within 30 days. Transient ischemic attack and amaurosis fugax are diagnosed if the symptoms disappear within 24 hours. Fatal stroke is defined as death attributed to an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.</description>
