  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a home based program can teach parents and
      moderately overweight kids who are of 8-12 years old with a BMI% between 85-97%, how to
      manage their child's weight. The study uses manuals and involves a short visit to the clinic
      every other week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 4-5 million children between the ages of 6-17 in the United States are obese.
      Children who are obese are at an increased risk for many negative health consequences in
      childhood and in adulthood. In addition, these children are at an increased risk for
      psychosocial consequences in childhood and adolescence, including poor self-esteem, teasing,
      verbal abuse and social isolation. Guided self-help offers an opportunity to provide
      empirically based programs to a larger amount of the target population. Once such treatment
      methods are available, it is possible that the guided self-help treatment for childhood
      obesity can be disseminated to primary care practitioners, psychologists, nurses, and health
      educators. Ultimately, the goal of this application is to develop a treatment protocol that
      can be used by clinics and lay health professionals to intervene with children who are
      overweight and their parents.

    <description>The delayed treatment group does not start treatment immediately after the baseline assessment. This group serves as the control group, by not receiving any treatment for 5 months. After the 5 months, the delayed group participants are asked to come in for a second assessment that involves completion of surveys and measurement of height, weight, and physical activity level. After this assessment is completed, the delayed group participants can begin the 5-month treatment.</description>
