      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and fluorouracil, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      panitumumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy given together with radiation
      therapy is more effective with or without panitumumab in treating patients with advanced
      cancer of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or oral cavity.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying chemotherapy given together with
      radiation therapy to see how well it works compared with chemotherapy and radiation therapy
      given together with panitumumab in treating patients who have undergone surgery for advanced
      hypopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, or oral cavity cancer at high
      risk of recurrence.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if the addition of concurrently administered panitumumab to standard
           adjuvant chemoradiation, with 1 of 2 cisplatin-based regimens, significantly prolongs
           disease-free survival of patients with macroscopically completely resected, advanced
           squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx, larynx, or oral cavity at high
           risk of recurrence.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if the pre-surgery dose of panitumumab will alter the RNA expression of
           several genes and that these changes will provide additional prognostic information that
           can be used in future patient management. (Exploratory)

        -  Measure the differences in RNA expression by RNA microarray and the results analyzed to
           create a gene expression classifier that will be checked for outcome prediction by
           association with disease free survival and down regulation of the glucose metabolism as
           measured by FDG-PET. (Exploratory)

        -  To create a European biobank of biological samples which can be used for future research
           projects in this disease. (Exploratory)

        -  To predict radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity based on in vitro lymphocyte
           apoptosis test and SNPs analysis. (Exploratory)

        -  To assess the impact of radiation-induced side effects (swallowing dysfunction and
           xerostomia) on patient's quality of life.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by treatment center,
      radiotherapy technique (3D-CRT vs IMRT), chemotherapy regimen (European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC]) vs Arbeitsgemeinschaft Radiology Oncology [ARO]
      schedule), tumor location (larynx vs oropharynx vs hypopharynx vs oral cavity), pN-stage
      (pN0-2 vs pN3), pT-stage (pT1-2 vs pT3-4), margin/extracapsular extension (ECE) status (ECE+
      and margin &lt; 5 mm vs ECE- and margin &lt; 5 mm vs ECE+ and margin &gt; 5 mm), biological pre-study
      participation (yes vs no), p16 status (positive vs negative vs indeterminable). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (chemoradiotherapy): Within 4-8 weeks of surgery, patients undergo 3D-conformal or
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week in weeks 1-7. Patients also
           receive concurrent chemotherapy comprising either cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 1,
           22, and 43 (EORTC schedule) OR cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours and fluorouracil IV over 24
           hours on days 1-5 and 29-33 (ARO schedule), in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (chemoradiotherapy plus panitumumab): Within 4-8 weeks of surgery, patients
           undergo 3D-conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy and receive concurrent
           chemotherapy (EORTC schedule or ARO schedule) as in arm I. Patients also receive
           panitumumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for biomarker correlative studies and translational
      research. Patients complete quality-of-life EORTC questionnaires QLQ-C30, QLQ-HN35, and
      PSS-HN periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
