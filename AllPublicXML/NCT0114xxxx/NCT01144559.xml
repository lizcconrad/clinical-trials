  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to determine if the way local anesthetic- or numbing medication- is
      delivered through a tiny tube next to the nerves that go to the thigh affects the strength
      and sensation in the thigh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim: Research study to test the null hypothesis that differing the delivery method
      (continuous basal infusion vs. repeated bolus doses) but providing an equal total dose of
      Ropivacaine has no impact on quadriceps muscle strength. These results will help define the
      optimal delivery method of local anesthetic used for continuous peripheral nerve blocks and
      help guide future research in this clinically relevant area.

    <description>Evaluated in the seated position, using Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation (TES)in the same manner as outlined in the current anesthesia literature. The current will be increased from 0mA until the subject identifies sensation at which time the current is recorded as the TES value and the nerve stimulator is turned off.</description>
