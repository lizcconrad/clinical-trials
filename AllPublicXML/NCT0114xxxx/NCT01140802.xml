    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the gut microbiota in Chinese patients with Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease (IBD) in Hong Kong with that of healthy controls, compare the gut microbiota in
      IBD patients in a developing country (low but increasing IBD incidence, Hong Kong) with those
      in a developed country (high incidence, Australia), compare the gut microbiota in Chinese
      patients with IBD in Hong Kong with the microbiota of their non-IBD affected parents and
      siblings.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gut that
      cause major life-long disability. Afflicting mostly young people at an age when they are most
      active both in their private and professional life, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
      represents an important public health problem affecting both the patients education, working
      abilities, social life and quality of life. Previously a disease predominantly of the West,
      there is now a marked increase in the incidence of IBD in Hong Kong. The cause of this
      dramatic increase over the last decade is unknown. Genetic factors, environmental factors and
      the gut bacteria may play a role in disease development. This study aims to explore the
      factors that may be contributing to, or causing, the rise of IBD in Hong Kong. The
      investigators propose to study the gut bacteria in Chinese patients with IBD compared with
      non-IBD patients, and healthy relatives of IBD patients. IBD patients will be prospectively
      recruited, blood samples will be obtained for serology and genotyping, stool samples and
      biopsies will be collected during routine colonoscopy for microbiota analysis. Bloods, stool
      and tissue gut microbiota from non-IBD patients will be collected for comparison. Studying
      gut microbiota, genetics and environmental factors in populations with changing incidence of
      IBD offers the greatest hope of identifying potentially important causative factors for
      disease.

      Serum DNA will be collected and stored only if patients have provided consent separately. All
      serum DNA blood samples will be anonymised. Genetic results will not be made available to
      individual patients in a future date as there is no evidence to support genetic testing for
      risk prediction in routine practice, but these large scale genetic results will be useful to
      identify relevant future therapeutic targets for treatment of IBD. 10 ml of blood will be
      collected in EDTA tubes and stored at minus 80 degrees C, These samples will be transported
      to China for analysis at a later date.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients aged â‰¥18 with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis defined by
             endoscopy, radiology and histology, patients on stable medication and informed consent
             obtained

        Control group:

        Healthy controls (non-IBD patients) will comprise ethnicity - matched patients undergoing
        colonoscopy for polyp or colorectal cancer screening, or rectal bleeding. Controls will be
        excluded if they have previously been diagnosed with IBD or if they have a first or second
        degree relative with IBD.

        Relatives group:

        Relatives of patients will be aged between 16 and 35 years. They will be a first degree
        relative of a patient. Relatives older than 35 will not be recruited to maximise the chance
        of including some individuals who will develop IBD in the future. Relatives will be
        contacted either via the patient or directly by telephone by the investigators. They will
        be invited to attend for a screening meeting to assess eligibility and to receive the
        information sheets. They will undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy for biopsies
        once fully consented.
