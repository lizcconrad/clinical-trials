  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States alone, each year approximately 5 million children undergo painful
      surgery, many of them experience serious side-effects with opioids and inadequate pain
      relief. Safe and effective analgesia is an important unmet critical medical need in children
      and its continued existence is an important perioperative safety and economic problem.
      Inadequate pain relief and serious side effects from perioperative opioids occur frequently
      in up to 50% of children. Morphine, the most commonly used perioperative opioid, has a narrow
      therapeutic index and large inter-patient variations in analgesic response and serious side
      effects. Frequent inter-individual variations in responses to morphine have significant
      clinical and economic impact with inadequate pain relief at one end of the spectrum of
      responses and serious adverse effects such as respiratory depression at the other end. Much
      of the inter-individual variability in response to a dose of morphine following surgical
      procedures can be explained by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a subset of the
      genes that encode proteins involved in pain mechanisms and opioid pathway.

      Measures and Procedures: Participants will receive standard care, standard anesthetic and an
      intraoperative dose of morphine per the clinical team.

      Research procedures will include:

        1. Blood draws for genotyping candidate genes and exploratory genes

        2. Standardized PACU (post anesthesia care unit) Protocol: Subjective pain assessments:
           Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10. Objective assessment with FLACC (facial
           expression; leg movement; activity; cry; and consolability) scale, 0-10.

        3. Significant postoperative pain will be managed in the PACU with rescue doses of morphine
           and opioids by the clinical team. Analgesic interventions and morphine requirements are
           collected

        4. Effects of opioids on pupil measures

        5. Respiratory response to 5% carbon dioxide preoperatively and postoperatively (first 350
           patients only). Another measure of end tidal carbon dioxide will be implemented when the
           device is clinically available.

        6. Serial blood draws for morphine pharmacokinetic modeling (through subject #351).

        7. Opioid adverse effects in PACU and at home.
