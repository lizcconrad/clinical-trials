  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a French national trial, conducted using a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      randomised design involving 15 centers and 88 patients of both sexes.

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the effect of a selective inhibitor of
      serotonin reuptake, the Fluoxétine, at a higher dose (40 mg/day) than usually recommended for
      depressed patients, after three months in patients suffering from an atypical Parkinson's
      disease called Multiple System Atrophy, compared to the placebo effect.

      Secondary objectives of the trial are the evaluation of the effects of Fluoxétine after six
      weeks at the dose of 20 mg/day, after six months at the dose of 40mg/day, and assess the
      effects on mortality, quality of life, autonomic disorders, particularly orthostatic
      hypotension, mood and others symptoms such as sleep, apathy, pain and fatigue.

      Fluoxetine is first introduced in dose of 20 mg/day and after six weeks the dose is increased
      to 40 mg/day. If patients have side effects at the dose of 40 mg/day, the dose may be reduced
      at 20 mg/day. Assessment visits will be conducted at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months of
      treatment. After 6 months, trial's treatment with fluoxetine is discontinued gradually. A new
      assessment will be conducted one month after the end of treatment. The expected results are
      the demonstration of improved scores of the scale UMSARS after 3 and 6 months in the
      fluoxetine group compared to the placebo group.
