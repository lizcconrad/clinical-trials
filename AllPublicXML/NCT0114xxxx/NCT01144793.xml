    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure, in pilot/observational study, panels of circulating
      proteins in real time at the onset of neutropenic fever/infection in patients with acute or
      chronic leukemias undergoing chemotherapy or other biologic treatment. And to generate
      preliminary trend results in panels of circulating proteins longitudinally during the period
      of neutropenia and to correlate those values to clinical/laboratory data and patient
      outcomes.

      To identify potential biomarkers for the prediction of NF, we performed serial measurements
      of nine biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), protein C, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10,
      IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and intercellular adhesion
      molecule-1] using a multiplex ELISA array platform every 6-8 hours in patients undergoing
      myelosuppressive chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies.

        Inclusion Criteria:- Age &gt;= 18

          -  Pre-admission (ATU, ITA) or inpatient status

          -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;= 1500/mm^3

          -  Patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia who:

               -  are admitted with newly diagnosed disease and have not yet received induction
                  chemotherapy

               -  are admitted with neutropenic fever after receiving post-remission chemotherapy
                  or are admitted for post-remission chemotherapy

          -  Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or a chronic lymphoid leukemia/disorder who
             have received chemotherapy or other disease-specific treatment in the last 30 days
             where the ANC of &lt;=1500/mm3 is considered by the treating physician to be at least
             possibly treatment-related

          -  An intravenous line or catheter (Hickman, port, portacath, or peripherally inserted
             central venous catheter [PICC] line) must be in place at the time of protocol
             participation/study start, but will not be inserted solely for the purposes of the
             study.

          -  Whenever possible, patients will be consented and blood monitoring will be initiated
             before the first dose of antibiotic, but if not possible, at no time will standard of
             care measures will be delayed or interrupted for the purposes of study enrollment.

          -  Patients must be able to understand the nature of the study and give written informed
             consent.

        There are no exclusion criteria. Anyone who does not meet inclusion criteria will be
        excluded.
