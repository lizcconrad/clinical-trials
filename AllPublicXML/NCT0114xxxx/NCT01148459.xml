    <measure>Number of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (from 30 days before Dose 1 up to Month 14)</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with any and Grade 3 solicited local symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose and across doses</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 redness/swelling = redness/swelling spreading beyond 20 millimeters (mm) of injection site.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with any, Grade 3 and related solicited general symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7-day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period following each dose and across doses</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed solicited general symptoms were drowsiness, irritability, loss of appetite and fever [defined as axillary temperature equal to or above (≥) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)]. Any = occurrence of the symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 drowsiness = drowsiness that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 irritability/fussiness = crying that could not be comforted/prevented normal activity. Grade 3 loss of appetite = not eating at all. Grade 3 fever = fever &gt; 39.0 °C. Related = symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>

    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

        All subjects must satisfy ALL the following criteria at study entry:

          -  A male or female infant or child between and including 6 weeks to 17 months of age, at
             the time of first vaccination.

          -  Signed or thumb-printed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the
             infant or child. Where parents/LARs are illiterate, the consent form will be
             countersigned by a witness.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parents/LARs can and will comply
             with the requirements of the protocol should be enrolled in the study.

          -  Subjects who are known to be HIV-infected (documented positive DNA PCR), whether
             taking HIV antiretroviral treatment (ART) or not.

          -  Subjects who are born following a normal gestation period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If ANY exclusion
        criterion applies, the subject must not be included in the study:

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment. However, the presence of an illness listed as
             Grade I or Grade II (WHO pediatric AIDS clinical staging) will not of itself
             constitute an exclusion criterion. Enrolment should be deferred if axillary
             temperature is &gt;=37.5°C.

          -  Grade III or Grade IV abnormality on screening laboratory blood sample.

          -  Grade III or IV AIDS at the time of enrolment (WHO pediatric AIDS clinical staging).

          -  Major congenital defects.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             prior to or within 7 days of study vaccine.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine 30 days preceding Dose°1 of study vaccine, or planned use during the
             study period.

          -  Previous participation in any other malaria vaccine trial.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial including administration of
             experimental treatment.

          -  Same sex twins.

          -  History of allergic reactions (significant IgE-mediated events) or anaphylaxis to
             previous immunizations.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the study vaccine.

          -  Child in care.
