  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major global public health priority is to identify effective methods for preventing deaths
      from pesticide self-poisoning. The aim of this work is to determine whether the provision of
      lockable storage containers to poor households in rural Asia can reduce the incidence of
      intentional pesticide self-poisoning. Secondary questions include the effect of these
      containers on unintentional pesticide poisoning in children and overall self-harm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will set up a large community-based, cluster randomised controlled trial of 162 villages
      (mean adult population 900) in rural Sri Lanka to determine the effectiveness and cost of the
      provision of safe storage containers to prevent pesticide poisoning.

      The study will be based in Anuradhapura District where we have carried out public health
      studies of pesticide poisoning since 2002. 81 intervention and 81 control villages will be
      recruited. Randomisation will be clustered, with villages rather than households randomised.
      A census will be performed at baseline and after 3 years to establish the population
      demographics and number of person-years exposed.

      The primary outcome will be the incidence of pesticide self-poisoning; secondary outcomes
      will be the incidence of all self-poisoning, all self-harm, fatal self-harm, pesticide
      poisoning and unintentional paediatric pesticide poisoning. We will use Poisson regression
      models, taking account of clustering and stratification, for the analysis.

      The study will provide definitive evidence concerning the cost-effectiveness of this approach
      that will determine whether it should be promoted across Asia.
