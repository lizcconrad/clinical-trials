    <measure>Percent Change in Tonic-Atonic Seizure Frequency From Baseline (Per 28 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (28 day observational period) and End of Treatment (28 day treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The sum of the frequencies of tonic seizures and atonic seizures was defined as the &quot;tonic-atonic seizure frequency&quot; and the percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days was assessed. The percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency was calculated using the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days of the Observation Period as the baseline and the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days of the Treatment Period as the post-treatment value. Percentage change in tonic - atonic seizure frequency was calculated as follows: [100 x (post-treatment value - baseline)/ baseline].
The frequency of epileptic seizures was recorded in the seizure diary by the recorder. Seizure frequency was counted based on the classification established by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The diary recorder monitored the participant and recorded the seizure diary in a consistent manner, and continued these practices throughout the study period.</description>

    <description>50% Responder Rate in Tonic-Atonic Seizure Frequency was presented as the number of participants who achieved a 50% reduction in tonic-atonic seizure frequency.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Total Seizure Frequency (Per 28 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (28 day observational period) and End of Treatment (28 day treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in the total seizure frequency (per 28 days) was calculated using the total seizure frequency per 28 days of the Observation Period as the baseline and the total seizure frequency per 28 days of the Treatment Period as the post-treatment value. Percentage change in total seizure frequency was calculated as follows: [100 x (post-treatment value - baseline)/ baseline].</description>

    <measure>Percentage Change in the Frequency of Seizures Other Than Tonic-atonic Seizures (Per 28 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (28 day observational period) and End of Treatment (28 day treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in the frequency of seizures other than tonic-atonic seizures (per 28 days) was calculated using the total seizure frequency per 28 days of the Observation Period as the baseline and the total seizure frequency per 28 days of the Treatment Period as the post-treatment value. Percentage change in total seizure frequency was calculated as follows: [100 x (post-treatment value - baseline)/ baseline].
Seizures analyzed other than tonic-atonic seizures included:
Partial seizure freq. (frequency), Absence seizure, Atyp. (atypical) absence seizure, Myoclonic seizure, Clonic seizure, Tonic seizure, Tonic-clonic seizure, Atonic seizure, &amp; Uncla. (unclassified) epileptic seizure.
The frequency of epileptic seizures was recorded in the diary by the recorder. Seizure frequency was counted based on the classification established by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The diary recorder monitored the participant and recorded the seizure diary in a consistent manner.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 12 of the treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>CGIC in participants with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) relative to placebo was presented as number of participants in each category at the final assessment (last observation carried forward [LOCF]) &amp; at Week 12 of the Treatment Period. The investigator assessed the CGIC by comparing the participants' condition during the 4 weeks immediately before the completion (or discontinuation [d/c]) of the Treatment Period to his/her condition during the 4-week Observation Period (for participants who d/c'd the study during the Treatment Period, the CGIC was assessed by comparing the participant's condition from the start to discontinuation of the study treatment to his/her condition during the 4-week Observation Period).
The CGIC was assessed according to the following 7-grade scale based on the frequency &amp; severity of seizures, AEs, and overall conditions of daily life.
Markedly improved, Improved, Slightly improved, Unchanged, Slightly worsened, Worsened, Markedly worsened.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Tonic-Atonic Seizure Frequency From Baseline (Per 28 Days)</title>
        <description>The sum of the frequencies of tonic seizures and atonic seizures was defined as the “tonic-atonic seizure frequency” and the percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days was assessed. The percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency was calculated using the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days of the Observation Period as the baseline and the tonic-atonic seizure frequency per 28 days of the Treatment Period as the post-treatment value. Percentage change in tonic - atonic seizure frequency was calculated as follows: [100 x (post-treatment value - baseline)/ baseline].
The frequency of epileptic seizures was recorded in the seizure diary by the recorder. Seizure frequency was counted based on the classification established by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The diary recorder monitored the participant and recorded the seizure diary in a consistent manner, and continued these practices throughout the study period.</description>

Percentage change in total seizure frequency was calculated as follows: [100 x (post-treatment value - baseline)/ baseline].
Seizures analyzed other than tonic-atonic seizures included:
Partial seizure freq. (frequency), Absence seizure, Atyp. (atypical) absence seizure, Myoclonic seizure, Clonic seizure, Tonic seizure, Tonic-clonic seizure, Atonic seizure, &amp; Uncla. (unclassified) epileptic seizure.
The frequency of epileptic seizures was recorded in the diary by the recorder. Seizure frequency was counted based on the classification established by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The diary recorder monitored the participant and recorded the seizure diary in a consistent manner.</description>

Treatment was divided into a Dose Titration Period (2 weeks) and a Dose Maintenance Period (10 weeks). As a general rule, the dose was increased by 1 step every 2 days until it reached the target maintenance dose determined by body weight at the start of the Observation Period. Target maintenance dose: 15.0 - 30.0 kg: 1000 mg/day (5 tablets each in the morning and evening) 30.1 - 50.0 kg: 1800 mg/day (4 tablets in the morning and 5 in the evening) 50.1 - 70.0 kg: 2400 mg/day (6 tablets each in the morning and evening) &gt;= 70.1 kg: 3200 mg/day (8 tablets each in the morning and evening)</description>

          <title>Percentage Change in the Frequency of Seizures Other Than Tonic-atonic Seizures (Per 28 Days)</title>
          <description>Percent change in the frequency of seizures other than tonic-atonic seizures (per 28 days) was calculated using the total seizure frequency per 28 days of the Observation Period as the baseline and the total seizure frequency per 28 days of the Treatment Period as the post-treatment value. Percentage change in total seizure frequency was calculated as follows: [100 x (post-treatment value - baseline)/ baseline].
Seizures analyzed other than tonic-atonic seizures included:
Partial seizure freq. (frequency), Absence seizure, Atyp. (atypical) absence seizure, Myoclonic seizure, Clonic seizure, Tonic seizure, Tonic-clonic seizure, Atonic seizure, &amp; Uncla. (unclassified) epileptic seizure.
The frequency of epileptic seizures was recorded in the diary by the recorder. Seizure frequency was counted based on the classification established by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The diary recorder monitored the participant and recorded the seizure diary in a consistent manner.</description>
