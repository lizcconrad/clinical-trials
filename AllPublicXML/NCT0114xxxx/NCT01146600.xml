      The term 'hypersomnia' describes a group of symptoms that includes severe daytime sleepiness
      and sleeping long periods of time (more than 10 hours per night). Sometimes, hypersomnia is
      caused by a problem with the quality of sleep occurring at night, for instance when nighttime
      sleep is disrupted by frequent breathing pauses. In other cases, however, hypersomnia occurs
      even when nighttime sleep is of good quality. These cases of hypersomnia are presumed to be a
      symptom of brain dysfunction, and so are referred to as hypersomnias of central (i.e., brain)
      origin.

      The causes of most of these central hypersomnias are not known. However, our group has
      recently identified a problem with the major brain chemical responsible for sedation, known
      as GABA. In a subset of our hypersomnia patients, there is a naturally-occurring substance
      that causes the GABA receptor to be hyperactive. In essence, it is as though these patients
      are chronically medicated with Valium (or Xanax or alcohol, all substances that act through
      the GABA system), even though they do not take these medications.

      Current treatment of central hypersomnias is limited. For the fraction of cases with
      narcolepsy, there are FDA-approved, available treatments. However, for the remainder of
      patients, there are no treatments approved by the FDA. They are usually treated with
      medications approved for narcolepsy, but sleep experts agree that these medications are often
      not effective for this group of patients.

      Based on our understanding of the GABA abnormality in these patients, we evaluated whether
      clarithromycin (an antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of infections) would
      reverse the GABA abnormality. In a test tube model of this disease, clarithromycin does in
      fact return the function of the GABA system to normal. The investigators have treated a few
      patients with clarithromycin and most have felt that their hypersomnia symptoms improved with
      this treatment.

      To determine whether clarithromycin is truly beneficial for central hypersomnia, this study
      will compare clarithromycin to an inactive pill (the placebo). All subjects will receive both
      clarithromycin and the placebo at different times, and their reaction times and symptoms will
      be compared on these two treatments to determine if one is superior. If this study shows that
      clarithromycin is more effective than placebo in the treatment of hypersomnia, it will
      identify a potential new therapy for this difficult-to-treat disorder.

      Central hypersomnias are characterized by severe excessive daytime sleepiness despite long
      sleep periods (&gt;10 hours/night) and the absence of nocturnal sleep pathology. They
      preferentially affect young adults, may result in loss of employment, and can lead to motor
      vehicle accidents (1). Despite these health, safety, and quality of life consequences, there
      are no FDA-approved therapies for several forms of central hypersomnia, including idiopathic
      hypersomnia (IH). Currently, IH is treated using therapies approved for narcolepsy, despite a
      lack of clinical trial data and a consensus that treatment response is poor (2). Treatments
      include traditional psychostimulants (e.g., amphetamine derivatives) as well as
      wake-promoting agents with unknown mechanisms of action such as modafinil and sodium oxybate.
      In addition to side effects including high abuse potential, tachycardia, and altered mental
      status, treatments are often ineffective and substantial residual sleepiness frequently
      persists despite poly-therapy.

      The investigators hypothesize that pathology in the GABA neurotransmitter system, the brain's
      major inhibitory system, underlies these central hypersomnias. Currently, there are no
      hypersomnia therapies that are GABA-antagonists. However, the macrolide antibiotic
      clarithromycin has been shown to have GABA-modulating properties, resulting in the
      development of insomnia or mania in a subset of patients. Clarithromycin is therefore a
      potentially viable, promising therapeutic agent for hypersomnia related to positive
      modulation of the GABAA receptor. Open-label use of clarithromycin in six hypersomnia
      patients with known (n = 4) or suspected (n = 2) excess GABAA potentiation resulted in marked
      improvements in vigilance, as measured on the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) (unpublished
      data). The investigators therefore propose a pilot, crossover trial comparing clarithromycin
      to placebo for the treatment of hypersomnia in patients with excess GABAA potentiation. The
      primary endpoint will be a decrease in PVT reaction time. Secondary endpoints will include a
      decrease in PVT lapses and changes in Epworth, Stanford, and FOSQ sleep scales. Successful
      results from this trial would provide early evidence for a more rational and efficacious
      treatment for hypersomnia that could avoid the potential abuse, toxicities, and treatment
      failures associated with traditional treatments.

      This will be a pilot crossover trial of clarithromycin and placebo to treat central
      hypersomnia. Subjects who are untreated for hypersomnia or who experience persistent symptoms
      despite traditional therapies will be eligible. Subjects who are on medication for
      hypersomnia at the beginning of the study will be asked to maintain stable doses of these
      medications for one month before and throughout the study period. Twenty subjects will be
      assessed at baseline and one and two weeks after being on each study drug (clarithromycin 500
      mg bid and matched placebo bid). After two weeks on study drug, they will undergo a one week
      washout period, then change to the other study drug for an additional two weeks. Patients
      will be randomized to order of presentation of study drugs such that ten subjects will be
      randomized to each group. Random sequence generation will be performed our pharmacy. All
      study investigators and subjects will remain blinded to group assignment.

    <description>Median reaction time on the PVT at the end of the second week of treatment. Lower values reflect faster reaction times (I.e., greater vigilance).
Note that the PVT provides a median of reaction times to all stimuli (~100) presented during the 10 minute PVT test. Each subject had two PVT tests at each visit, resulting in two median values. These were averaged, and then, for the purposes of this outcome, we then obtained the MEAN across multiple subjects for each condition (baseline, clarithromycin week 2, placebo week 2)</description>

Note that the PVT provides a median of reaction times to all stimuli (~100) presented during the 10 minute PVT test. Each subject had two PVT tests at each visit, resulting in two median values. These were averaged, and then, for the purposes of this outcome, we then obtained the MEAN across multiple subjects for each condition (baseline, clarithromycin week 2, placebo week 2)</description>

        <description>Scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) were averaged by subject across all administrations for a given drug condition (i.e. administered twice on clarithromycin (once during week 1 and once during week 2) and twice on placebo (once during week 1 and once during week 2)).
ESS scores can range from 0 to 24. Higher scores indicate higher levels of sleepiness.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a health outcome scale with multiple subsections. Subjects were administered the entire SF-36; this analysis is of the vitality subscore provided by this scale. Scores were averaged by subject across all administrations for a given drug condition (i.e. administered once at baseline, twice on clarithromycin (once during week 1 and once during week 2) and twice on placebo (once during week 1 and once during week 2)).
The vitality subscore is calculated using four questions from the SF-36, and can range from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect more vitality.</description>
