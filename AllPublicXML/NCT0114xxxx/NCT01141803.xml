  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the protective and antiinflammatory effects of processed fruit
      and fruit fibre in overweight subjects with signs of metabolic syndrome. A single-blinded
      parallel study is conducted to investigate the protective effects of fruit fibre on colonic
      epithelium. Relevant signalling pathways related to cholesterol metabolism, vascular
      inflammation, oxidative defence, apoptosis and sterol metabolism will be targeted. Volunteers
      are randomly assigned one of three groups. They are instructed to follow a polyphenol and
      pectin restricted diet for six weeks. The last four weeks in this six week period, the
      restricted diet is supplemented with whole apples (550g/day), apple pomace (22g/day) or
      nothing. Blood, urine, faecal samples and colon biopsies are collected before and after the
      four weeks intervention period.
