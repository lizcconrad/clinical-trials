  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different strategies exist in the treatment of chronic long occlusion of the superficial
      femoral artery. Traditionally, these patients should be treated with bypass. If the great
      saphenous vein is unavailable, doctor has to choose artificial vessel as graft. Now, the
      skill of endovascular treatment is developing rapidly, and lots of doctors think most of such
      patients could be treated with stent. The purpose of this trial is to compare stent and
      artificial blood vessel bypass in the treatment of long occlusion of the superficial femoral
      artery. The study hypothesis is that patency rates are comparable and therefore the minimal
      invasive treatment of stent can be considered in such patients.

      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial to compare the therapeutic
      effect of stent and artificial blood vessel bypass to chronic long occlusion of the
      superficial femoral artery. Totally 200 patients will be entered into the trial. The study
      population will consist of patients with long superficial femoral stenosis and occlusion
      lesion (≥15 cm), presenting symptomatic ischemia（Rutherford 3-6）. The lesion does not extend
      beyond the aortoiliac artery or blow-knee popliteal artery, with at least 1 vessel
      infra-popliteal runoff to the foot.

      Trial participants will be randomized to either stent group or artificial blood vessel bypass
      group.

      Patients will be followed up for 3 years. Study examinations will be done at screening,
      procedure time, 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after procedure.

      This study will be conducted at 3 centers in Beijing, China.
