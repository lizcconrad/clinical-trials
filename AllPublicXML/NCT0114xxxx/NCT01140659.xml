      Compare the results obtained with video-assisted sympathectomy performed in two distinct
      levels ganglionic (third versus fourth thoracic ganglion) for the treatment of palmar
      hyperhidrosis, through a blind randomized clinical trial using an objective method to measure
      the sweat before and after the operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the treatment of choice for treating palmar hyperhidrosis (PH) is video-assisted
      thoracic sympathectomy (VATS) . This minimally invasive technique has been well standardized
      and provides adequate results with low morbidity.

      The main side effect of VATS is compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH). This is present in most
      cases and is considered the greatest cause of dissatisfaction. To reduce the risk of CH,
      various studies have been conducted to compare different levels of ganglion resection. These
      studies have been based on subjective quantification of sweating (assessment of sweating
      reported by patients) and on the application of quality-of-life questionnaires.

      Recently, tests for the objective evaluation of sweating have been developed to quantify
      sweating among patients with various diseases, including PH. So far, there have not been any
      studies comparing the long-term results of thoracic sympathectomy on the third ganglion (G3)
      versus the fourth ganglion (G4)with objective evaluation to quantify sweating.

      The present study was prospective, randomized and blinded, with the objective of comparing
      the results from VATS at two different resection levels: G3 versus G4. All the patients were
      followed over a one-year period, and their palmar sweating was quantified using a portable
      device (VapoMeter) to measure transepidermal water loss (TEWL). In addition, CH was evaluated
      by applying a specific quality-of-life questionnaire.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used an objective method for measuring sweat, checking the &quot;TEWL (transepidermal water loss) measured by the&quot;VapoMeter&quot;. This is a portable instrument that functions noninvasively. It has a closed measurement chamber that eliminates external interference from air currents and enables precise metering of transepidermal water loss (TEWL). The evaporation rate is calculated from the rise in relative air humidity inside the closed chamber of the device, and this value is quantified in g/m²/h (increase in the water mass per unit time per unit of evaporation area).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We evaluated the quality of life before and after operation by questionnaire supplied to patients.
Quality of life before the treatment was classified into five different levels and calculated as the summed total score from the protocol (range from 20 to 100). When the total was greater than 84, the QOL was considered very poor; from 68 to 83 was considered poor; from 52 to 67 was good; from 36 to 51 was very good; and from 20 to 35 was excellent.
After the treatment, the patients were asked to grade the improvement in each item of the same QOL questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of the compensatory hyperhidrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of compensatory sweating was reported spontaneously by patients during the postoperative evaluation (1 week, 1 month, 6 months and 12th month).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intensity of the compensatory hyperhidrosis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) reported spontaneously by patients was graded as severe or non-severe. CH was considered severe when the sweat was visible, thereby causing embarrassment and leading to the need to change clothes every day</description>

    <description>We selected 40 patients from February 2007 to May 2009. All participants were randomized into two groups of 20 patients (G3 and G4) and underwent the sympathectomy, being followed for 12 months. We used an objective method for measuring sweat, checking the &quot;TEWL (transepidermal water loss) measured by the &quot;VapoMeter&quot;, and evaluated the quality of life before and after the operation. Also studied were: incidence and intensity of the compensatory hyperhidrosis.</description>
