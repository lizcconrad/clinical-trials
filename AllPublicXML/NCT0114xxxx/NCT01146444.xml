      Part I: to investigate the efficacy of different sunscreens in the prevention of skin lesions
      following standardized photoprovocation with Ultraviolet A/Ultraviolet B (UVA/UVB) light in
      patients with CLE.

      Part II: to evaluate the influence of different sunscreens on the expression of biomarkers in
      the skin of patients with CLE and of Healthy Controls following UV irradiation.

      Part I

      Part I-interventions will be:

        -  Experimental intervention: Application of broad-spectrum sunscreens with a low, medium,
           and high Sun Protection Factor (SPF) in random order to uninvolved skin areas prior to
           standardized photoprovocation.

        -  Control intervention: Intra-individual application of vehicle in random order;
           standardized photoprovocation of vehicle treated and untreated areas.

      Part II

      Part II-interventions will be:

        -  Experimental intervention: Application of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF to
           uninvolved skin areas prior to UV irradiation.

        -  Control intervention: UV irradiation of untreated areas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), discoid lupus
             erythematosus (DLE), or lupus erythematosus tumidus (LET) according to the Düsseldorf
             Classification 2004 (Kuhn and Ruzicka 2004) confirmed by histological analysis.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at screening (urine
             test) and using a medically accepted contraceptive regimen (intra-uterine device,
             partner's vasectomy, &gt;3 months previous hormonal contraception (oestrogen plus
             gestagen pill, depot injections, or subcutaneous depot) combined with a barrier method
             (preservative, vaginal diaphragm, cervical cap, spermicide) during the study and for 8
             weeks after the last UV exposure.

          -  Women clinically sterile (post-menopausal, undergone hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

          -  Actively cooperating to participate in the study, to follow the instructions of the
             investigator and to attend the centre at the agreed times.

          -  Development of skin lesions any time under current systemic treatment if patient is
             receiving systemic medication for the treatment of CLE.

          -  Signed informed consent form after the nature of the study has been fully explained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactation and women with positive pregnancy test.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergic contact reactions to components of the study
             agents.

          -  Treatment with photosensitizing drugs.

          -  Exposure to direct natural (sunlight) or artificial UV radiation on the back within 4
             weeks prior to entering the study.

          -  History of another photodermatosis, except polymorph light eruption (PLE).

          -  Any current known skin malignancy or any history of skin malignancy within the
             previous 5 years or Xeroderma pigmentosum.

          -  Initiation or change in the dose of any current systemic medication for the treatment
             of CLE within 8 weeks prior to standardized photoprovocation.
