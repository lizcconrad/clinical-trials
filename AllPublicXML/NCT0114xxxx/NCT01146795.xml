      This study is designed to determine the feasibility of administering neoadjuvant carboplatin,
      paclitaxel, and bevacizumab without excessive dose modification or cycle delay in patients
      with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. This
      study will also investigate the rate of optimal cytoreduction, response rate and progression
      free and overall survival, and to assess the quality of life for patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer treated with neoadjuvant
      carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab.

    <description>Carboplatin will be administered at an AUC of 5-6 (at the discretion of the physician) day 1 every 3 weeks, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours day 1 every 3 weeks and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg day 1 every 3 weeks.
After 3 cycles of chemotherapy patients will be considered for surgical cytoreduction. Patients must fulfill ALL of the following criteria to be considered eligible for surgical exploration. 1) ≥50% reduction in pretreatment CA-125 and 2) No medical contraindications to surgery.
After surgical cytoreduction all patients will receive an additional 6 cycles of chemotherapy (cycles 4-9) regardless of disease status at the time of exploration. Chemotherapy should be re-instituted within 6 weeks of the surgical procedure. Bevacizumab will be omitted from cycle 4 of chemotherapy. Patients who do NOT undergo surgical resection should receive cycles 4-9 of therapy. In this instance bevacizumab may be included in cycle 4.</description>

             reconstruction.

          -  Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including
             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain
             metastases, or history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA, stroke), transient ischemic
             attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within six months of the first date of

          -  Patients with clinically significant proteinuria. Urine protein should be screened by
             urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR). The UPCR has been found to correlate directly
             with the amount of protein excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a
             UPCR of 1.0 is equivalent to 1.0 grams of protein in a 24 hour urine collection.
             Obtain at least 4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to
             be a 24 hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine
             levels (separate requests). The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL) and
             creatinine concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein
             concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL). Patients must have a UPCR &lt; 1.0 to allow
             participation in the study.

                  days prior to the first date of bevacizumab.

               -  Major non-study related surgical procedure anticipated during the course of the
                  study.

               -  Core biopsy within 7 days prior to first date of bevacizumab.

          -  Patients with a GOG Performance Status of Grade 3 or 4 are not eligible.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing. Subjects of child-bearing age have to use
             effective means of contraception.

          -  Patients with medical history or conditions not otherwise previously specified which
             in the opinion of the investigator should exclude participation in this study. The
             investigator should consult the Study Chair.
