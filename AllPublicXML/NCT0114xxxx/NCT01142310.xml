  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress and corticosteroid exposure are associated with changes in both the human and animal
      hippocampus. An extensive literature suggests that corticosteroid-induced changes in the
      hippocampus are, in part, mediated through increases in extracellular glutamate. In animals,
      agents that decrease glutamate release prevent dendritic changes in the hippocampus secondary
      to stress or corticosterone. We have developed a research program using patients receiving
      prescription corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to explore the effects of corticosteroids on
      the human hippocampus. Our research program is translational in focus, with a goal of
      exploring whether the reported effects of corticosteroids on the animal hippocampus are also
      found in humans. A current focus of our research is examining glutamate release inhibitors in
      patients taking corticosteroids. We have both open-label and placebo-controlled pilot data
      suggesting that the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine is associated with significant
      improvement in declarative memory (a measure of hippocampal performance) in this population.
      A definitive study examining declarative memory in corticosteroid-dependent patients
      receiving lamotrigine vs. placebo is proposed. Neuroimaging and mood will also be assessed.

    <description>Lamotrigine has a complex mechanism of action that appears to involve the inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels resulting in a stabilization of membranes and inhibition of presynaptic glutamate release. Lamotrigine attenuates cerebral release of glutamate associated with cerebral ischemia in vitro and in vivo. Lamotrigine prevents cognitive and histologic changes in the hippocampus in animal models of ischemia. In patients with seizure disorders, decreases in plasma glutamate levels with lamotrigine are associated with a reduction in seizures</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18-70 years old

          -  English-speaking men and women

          -  Physician diagnosis of any chronic medical condition requiring treatment with oral
             corticosteroids confirmed by chart review and/or patients assessment by the PI or
             co-I.s.

          -  Receiving prednisone therapy of at least 5 mg of prednisone daily for at least 6
             months with anticipated treatment for ≥ 15 additional months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline RAVLT total T-Score ≥ 60

          -  Illnesses associated with CNS involvement (e.g., multiple sclerosis, lupus, seizures,
             brain tumors, head injury with loss of consciousness of more than 30 minutes) or
             cognitive impairment (e.g., lifetime drug or alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, and
             mood disorders — e.g., bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder) that appear to be
             unrelated to corticosteroid use or history of ventilator use that suggests hypoxia. We
             will include patients with lupus if they do not appear, based on medical history and
             discussion with treating physician, have significant CNS involvement. We will include
             participants with brief loss of consciousness. In prior studies we have found that
             many otherwise eligible participants were excluded due to very brief LOC in childhood
             or in a motor vehicle accident.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

             requiring frequent hospitalization)

          -  Contraindications to lamotrigine therapy (severe side effects in the past, taking
             medications such as some anticonvulsants with drug-drug interactions with
             lamotrigine).

             phenobarbital) that alter the metabolism of lamotrigine

          -  Metal implants, claustrophobia, or other contraindications to MRI
