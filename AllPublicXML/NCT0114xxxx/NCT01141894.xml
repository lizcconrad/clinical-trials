  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to compare the costs and consequences of 'routine perioperative fluid
      therapy' and 'GDHT in terms of morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, activity of
      daily living, health related quality of life, cognitive functions and need of social services
      and up till 12 months following operations of proximal femoral fracture at elderly. The
      primary hypothesis is that 'GDHT is a better strategy than 'routine fluid therapy' in terms
      of reduced frequency of postoperative complications.

      The investigation is an open, randomized clinical study of individuals suffering from a
      proximal femoral fracture. The total study duration for each subject is approximately 12
      months (+- 1 month); each patient will have 4'visits' (i.e. when PI extracts data to
      database) including regular praxis total: at registration; at discharge; 4 months and finally
      at 12 months after the surgery. For practical and logistic reasons, an interim-analysis will
      be conducted after approximately 100 patients whose data are completed.
