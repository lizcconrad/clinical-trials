      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of injecting mesenchymal stem cells
      through intraspinal delivery for the treatment of ALS.

    <textblock>
      A single patient safety study for harvesting, expanding ex vivo and injecting autologous
      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's) into the subarachnoid space of a patient with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated from adipose tissue by subcutaneous biopsy
      and expanded using an FDA-approved protocol. They will then be injected by lumbar puncture
      into the cerebrospinal fluid. Injection will be completed in the in- patient clinical
      research unit (CRU). the patient will be followed for two years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age greater than 18 years, if female, must be menopausal or had hysterectomy

          -  history of a chronic onset of a progressive motor weakness

          -  able to comply with protocol requirements

          -  can provide written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  does not have renal disease (Creatine &gt; 2.0)

          -  does not have any clinically significant abnormalities on prestudy laboratory
             evaluation

          -  does not have any clinically significant medical condition (e.g.,within 6 months of
             baseline, had a myocardial infarct, angina pectoris, and/or congestive heart failure),
