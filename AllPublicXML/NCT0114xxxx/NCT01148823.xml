  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial was designed to assess the influence of time of dressing after
      breast reconstruction procedures on surgical site infections rates and skin colonization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rates of surgical site infections (SSI) after clean operations range from 1 to 2%.
      However, infection rates in the breast surgical literature tend to be higher, with reported
      rates ranging from 2 to 30%. In plastic surgery operations, to minimize the risk of SSI is
      imperative, since even minor infections are able to complicate the healing process and harm
      the cosmetic result.

      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established guidelines for postoperative
      incision care. However, there is no recommendation to cover an incision closed primarily
      beyond 48 hours, nor on the appropriate time to shower or bathe with an uncovered incision.
      This remains an unresolved issue.
