  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several subjects included in a Pilot study (CTN 31GB0106) during 2002-2003 still had
      Macrolane deposits in the breast when the last study visit was performed. An additional
      follow up visit is planned to follow duration and safety of the former formulation of
      Macrolane that was used in the Pilot study (CTN 31GB0106).

      All subjects included in a Pilot study between 2002-2003 (CTN 31GB0106) are offered to take
      part in a seven year safety follow up after the initial injection of the former formulation
      of Macrolane into the breasts. The study will not involve any additional treatments.

      The follow up will include relevant medical history, weight, breast examination, ultrasound
      and mammography to determine if there are/have been any safety issues since the final study
      visit in the Pilot study (CTN 31GB0106), as well as a comprehensive MRI investigation to
      assess the breast structure and determine if there are still deposits of Macrolane in the
      breast.
