      This study is looking at the advantage of establishing surgical drainage for Crohn's fistulas
      and abscesses prior to starting medical therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently the importance of surgically established drainage of Crohn's perianal fistulas
      prior to medical therapy is controversial. Several retrospective studies have suggested a
      benefit to this approach. (1, 2) However, there have been no prospective studies performed to
      answer this important question. This study aims to definitively answer this question. Our
      hypothesis is that by establishing surgical drainage of all perianal fistulas and abscesses
      prior to initiation of medical therapy, further abscess formation will be prevented and the
      rate of durable fistula healing will improve.

             fistulas;

          -  Patient's standard of care treatment plan includes the following options: a) surgical
             intervention with an exam under anesthesia (EUA) by colorectal surgeon, seton
             placement and drainage of fistula prior to initiating Certolizumab or b) initiating
             Certolizumab without surgical intervention;

          -  Patient has had recent colonoscopy to determine disease activity and extent; and

          -  Patient has had either rectal EUS or pelvic MRI (type of test based on investigator
             site preference) which has identified one or more perianal fistulas.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of Inclusion Criteria is not met;

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast feeding;

          -  Patients with active or latent tuberculosis;

          -  Patients who have had systemic antibiotic, antiviral or antifungal treatment(s) within
             3 weeks prior to Screening for all non-Crohn's related infections;

          -  Patients concurrently taking anakinra (Kineret);

          -  Patients with a history of cancer or lymphoproliferative disease other than a
