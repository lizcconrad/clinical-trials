    <textblock>
      Major Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in adolescence and is
      associated with significant impairments in development and functioning. This project will
      rigorously test the Adolescent Collaborative Care Treatment intervention, a health services
      intervention designed to improve management for depressive disorders among adolescents, via a
      randomized controlled trial comparing the intervention to usual care. Key components of the
      trial include enhanced education for youth and parents, youth involvement in choice of
      evidence-based treatments, care management by an allied health professional with regular
      supervision by a mental health specialist and pediatrician, and stepped care to advance
      treatment when youth are not improving. Additional features have been added to engage
      adolescents and parents including a moderated message board for youth to share with and learn
      from one another, formalized involvement of the parent, and availability of the care manager
      during after school hours. Our findings will provide key information on the effectiveness of
      a developmentally-sensitive adapted collaborative care intervention for the treatment of
      adolescent depression.
