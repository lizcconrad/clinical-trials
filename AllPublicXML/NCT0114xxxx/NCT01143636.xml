  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) is effective in reducing pain in subjects with chronic pelvic pain. Our hypothesis is
      that tDCS will decrease pain significantly when compared to sham stimulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study encompasses two experiments: The first one involves patients with chronic pain,
      receiving 10 sessions of stimulation, active or sham (parallel design).

      The second experiment involves involves healthy subjects, receiving active or sham tDCS over
      the primary motor cortex (crossover design).

    <measure>Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We use the Visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure pain. The VAS is ranged from 0 to 10, with 0 reffering to no pain and 10 reffering the the worst possible pain. We used the difference between post treatment minus baseline to compare the two treatments (active versus sham tDCS).</description>

    <description>Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is defined as the minimum force applied which induces pain.
The change in pressure pain threshold (post minus pre intervention) is use for the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Scale (QOLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire on quality of life was performed at the end of the treatment session and compared between the two groups (active and sham) in patients with pelvic pain (Exp. 1).

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - CGI</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures illness severity and was performed on patients with pelvic pain (Exp. 1). The scale was performed at end of the treatment and compared between the two groups (real and sham). The scale is divided in 3 sub-scales: Severity of illness (0-7), global improvement (0-7) and efficacy index (0-16), total scores ranging from 0 to 30. The highest scores corresponding to lowest clinical improvement.</description>

    <description>This scale measures patient's assessment of general health. It was performed at the end of the treatment and compared between the 2 groups (real and sham) in patients with pelvic pain (Exp 1). The patient has to answer the question &quot;how is your health overall&quot; on a scale going from 0 to 10 (0 being the worst, 10 being the best).</description>

    <description>This test is used to test subjects' sensitivity to a mechanical stimulus. It was performed before and and after the treatment and the difference (post minus pre) was compared between the 2 groups (real and sham) in patients with pelvic pain (Exp. 1). A set of filaments, typically from 0.008 grams force up to 300 grams force, is applied on the patients' skin. The mechanical threshold is defined as the moment when the patient detects the stimulus.</description>

    <description>Chronic pain subjects will be randomized to receive either active or sham stimulation for the duration of the trial. The subject will receive 10 consecutive sessions at an intensity of 2mA with each session lasting 20 minutes. If the subject receives active stimulation the current will be applied for the full 20 minutes, while in the sham group current will only be applied for 30 seconds. In the healthy cohort, subjects will receive one session of active stimulation and one session of sham stimulation. The parameters will be the same as the pain subjects, at an intensity of 2mA for 20 minutes.</description>

It is a 30 points scale (total scores ranging from 0 to 30), the highest score corresponds to the highest cognitive status.</description>

        <description>This test is used to test subjects' sensitivity to a mechanical stimulus. It was performed before and and after the treatment and the difference (post minus pre) was compared between the 2 groups (real and sham) in patients with pelvic pain (Exp. 1). A set of filaments, typically from 0.008 grams force up to 300 grams force, is applied on the patients' skin. The mechanical threshold is defined as the moment when the patient detects the stimulus.</description>
