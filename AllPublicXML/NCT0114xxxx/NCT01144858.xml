  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether left atrial appendage flow velocity, as
      determined using trans esophageal echocardiography (TEE), predicts the outcome after catheter
      ablation of persistent Atrial fibrillation( pAF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 PAF patients underwent 3D mapping and ablation. A stepwise approach including
      circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation, continuous complex-fractionated electrogram
      (CFE) ablation and linear ablation was performed by the same operator. The procedural end
      point was termination of persistent AF by catheter ablation, either by conversion directly to
      sinus rhythm or to atrial tachycardia. Left atrial appendage (LAA) peak flow velocities were
      measured with transesophageal echography and averaged within each RR interval of 10
      consecutive cardiac cycles.

    <description>All patients were evaluated by a complete transesophageal echocardiography with multiplane probes with a 7-MHz transducer before catheter ablation .LA appendage flow was obtained by placing the pulsed Doppler sample volume at the orifice of the LA appendage, after which peak flow velocities were measured and averaged within each RR interval of 10 consecutive cardiac cycles</description>
