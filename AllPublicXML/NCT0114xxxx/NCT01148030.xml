    <textblock>
      Patients presenting in the Emergency Department or admitted to the hospital with displaced
      hip fractures who require hemiarthroplasty or open reduction internal fixation or with spinal
      instability/fractures in need of urgent surgical intervention will receive treatment to
      reduce the number of microorganisms in their nose prior to surgery. After surgery, the
      subjects will be observed for any surgical site infections.
