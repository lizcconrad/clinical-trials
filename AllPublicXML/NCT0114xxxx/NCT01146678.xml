      Primary Objective:

        -  to assess the relative bioavailability of a single dose of insulin glargine (Lantus) and
           lixisenatide given subcutaneously as on-site mix versus separate and simultaneous
           injections of each drug

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  to compare the activity of a single dose of insulin glargine and lixisenatide given
           subcutaneously as on-site mix versus separate and simultaneous injections of each drug

        -  to assess the safety and tolerability of insulin glargine and lixisenatide given
           subcutaneously as on-site mix

             than insulins in the last month before study start with the exception of thyroid
             hormones, lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs, and, if female, with the
             exception of hormonal contraception or menopausal hormone replacement therapy, any
             vaccination within the last 28 days.

          -  Positive reaction to any of the following tests: hepatitis B surface (HBs Ag) antigen,
             antihepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc Ab) if compound having possible immune
             activities, anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV2) antibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency
             virus 1 and 2 antibodies (anti-HIV1 and anti HIV2 Ab)
