    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to test the effectiveness of a talk-therapy intervention designed to
      better meet the needs of chronically ill Veterans. This project looks to recruit 450 Veterans
      with either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart failure (HF) who also have
      symptoms of worry, stress, anxiety, or sadness. Participants will be randomly put into either
      the talk-therapy intervention or enhanced usual care.

      The talk therapy intervention will be provided by VA clinicians in the primary care setting
      and will consist of 6 core meetings (30-45 minutes in duration) and 2 follow-up telephone
      meetings. Enhanced usual care participants will receive feedback regarding the assessment
      findings and educational materials on COPD and/or HF, depression and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diseases of the heart and circulatory system, namely, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) and Heart Failure (HF), are two of the most common and disabling chronic diseases.
      Both COPD and HF account for significant disability, mortality, and healthcare costs and are
      associated with lower health status and more functional and social limitations than other
      chronic illnesses, such as hypertension and diabetes. As our population ages and life span
      increases, the numbers of patients with these conditions and the subsequent healthcare costs
      will increase dramatically.

      The symptoms associated with COPD and HF can significantly affect daily functioning. Physical
      symptoms are often linked to increased levels of psychological distress, namely, anxiety and
      depression, which significantly affect quality of life and functioning above and beyond the
      impact of the medical disease. As depression and anxiety are modifiable clinical factors,
      there is a potential to significantly alter patient outcomes, as well as use of healthcare
      services. However, focused interventions are needed, given the high risk for poor mental
      health treatment and underuse of mental health services in persons with COPD and HF.
      Unfortunately, few intervention studies have been conducted in medically ill patients with
      these conditions. The current project will examine whether existing VA clinicians in the
      primary care setting, with training and support, can effectively administer a structured
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention for depressed and anxious Veterans with COPD
      and HF.

    <description>Medically ill patients received six-sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy tailored to their unique needs. Patients received 2 core modules and 3 elective modules. Elective modules focused on physical health, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and relaxation. The six session was a wrap up that everyone received. Patients also had the option to receive 2 follow-up booster sessions to aid in maintenance of skills learned.</description>

    <description>Participants received 6 treatment sessions (2 core and 4 electives). The two core modules are increasing awareness and controlling physical and emotional symptoms. After completion of the core modules the participant was able to choose elective modules from Managing Physical Health, The Power of Thoughts, Increasing Pleasant Activities, and Relaxation. Participants were required to complete the first session in person and subsequent sessions participants had the option to complete in-person or over the phone. Participants also had the option to receive 2 brief follow-up booster calls to aid in reinforcing the changes made.</description>

The two core modules are increasing awareness and controlling physical and emotional symptoms. After completion of the core modules the participant will be able to choose elective modules from Managing your Physical Health, The Power of Thoughts, Increasing Pleasant Activities, and Learning How to Relax. Participants are required to complete the first session in person Subsequent sessions participants have the option to complete in-person or over the phone. After completion of the active treatment sessions, the participant can receive 2 brief follow-up booster calls. The follow up calls provide the opportunity for the participant to review skills learned, address any questions or difficulties, and reinforce changes made.</description>
