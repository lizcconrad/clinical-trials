  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare the efficiency of respiratory therapy with cough assist and
      the efficiency of usual respiratory therapy in intensive care patients suffering of
      neurologic disorder and cough ineffectiveness. The investigators hypothesis is that cough
      assist is more efficient than usual respiratory care in this group of patients.
