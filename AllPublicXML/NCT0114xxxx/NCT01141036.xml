      Background : Upper GI endoscopy is often performed in patients with chronic liver disease to
      screen for esophageal and gastric varices. AIM: The purpose of this study is to compare
      propofol to midazolam for sedation in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing
      diagnostic upper GI endoscopy. Methods: 60 outpatients who has known chronic liver disease
      (Child-Pugh class A or B) (cirrhosis) and are undergoing variceal screening will be
      randomized to receive propofol or midazolam for sedation. Administration of sedation was
      performed by a anesthesist. Outcome measures studied are induction and recovery times,
      efficacy and safety of sedation, patient satisfaction, and return to baseline function and
      subclinical hepatic encephalopathy (number connection test), and saturation of oxygen.
      expected results: The mean time to achieve adequate sedation will be shorter for for the
      propofol group in comparison to midazolam group. The level of sedation achieved by the
      propofol group will be greater. Time to full recovery will be faster in the propofol group.
      Propofol do not exacerbate subclinical hepatic encephalopathy as compared to midazolam.
      patients receiving propofol will express greater overall mean satisfaction with the quality
      of their sedation at the time of discharge. Conclusions: Propofol sedation is expected not to
      exacerbate subclinical hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Known chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh class A or B) who presented for upper GI
             endoscopy for routine variceal screening.

          -  The diagnosis of liver disease will be based on available past history, serological
             testing, radiological imaging, and liver histology when available.

          -  Staging of cirrhosis will be determined by MELD score and by Child-Pugh score . All
             patients will complete a standard preprocedure history and physical examination to
             establish current degree of encephalopathy and ascites.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria will include the following:

               -  known allergy or adverse reaction to sedative or component thereof

               -  patients with known significant respiratory disease or airway abnormality)

               -  active neurological impairment including clinically detectable hepatic
                  encephalopathy

               -  advanced or decompensated liver disease ( CP score &gt;10, MELD &gt;24) (Child-Pugh
                  class C)

               -  active alcohol consumption or illicit drug abuse

               -  active prescription for sedation or narcotics
