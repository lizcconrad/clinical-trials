  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding, open-label, uncontrolled, dose-escalation trial to determine the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Dose (RD) of the combination RAD001
      (escalating daily dose) and CaelyxTM (fixed dose) to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Other purposes of the study are:

        1. define the safety profile of the combination after repeated administrations

        2. define hints of antitumor activity, to be confirmed in subsequent disease-oriented
           expansion phases at the RD.

        3. define the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      mTOR inhibitors are a new class of targeted antitumor agents which showed interesting
      antitumor activity in a variety of solid tumors, including prostate, soft tissue sarcomas ,
      ovarian, endometrial, kidney, and breast cancer. They also exert an antiangiogenic effect and
      are almost devoid of bone marrow toxicity as single agents which makes them suitable for
      combination with cytotoxic drugs.

      Anthracyclines are among the most used and effective cytotoxic agents, and in solid tumors
      their indications include, among others, breast, ovary, endometrial, prostate cancer.
      Liposomal Doxorubicin (CaelyxTM) could be an adequate replacement of doxorubicin to avoid
      potential side effects such as cardiotoxicity, alopecia, GI toxicity.

      Testing a combination regimen including mTOR inhibitors and anthracyclines in those tumors
      which are known to be sensitive to both compounds is of high clinical interest and
      worthwhile.

    <description>RAD001 will be given p.o. at increasing doses (no intra-patient)and CaelyxTM will be administered i.v. at a fixed dose.
At each dose level 3 to 6 patients will be entered, according to toxicities observed; the first 3 patients can be treated simultaneously; subsequent patients can be treated after the first 3 have been observed for at least one cycle (4 weeks).
The dose escalation process will be discontinued once the MTD has been achieved and the RD will be evaluated in a subsequent expansion part of the study.</description>
