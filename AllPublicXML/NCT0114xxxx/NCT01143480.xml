  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Innate immunity is the process by which white blood cells and other parts of the immune
      system sense and respond to potential infections by causing an inflammation. Researchers are
      interested in studying how the body responds to certain environmental factors, and whether
      the body s response can contribute to chronic illnesses or diseases such as asthma and
      certain types of cancers.

      Objectives:

      - To examine how specific genes and proteins in blood cells respond to environmental
      exposures.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age.

      Design:

        -  The study will involve one visit of 45 to 60 minutes.

        -  Participants will be screened with a brief physical examination and finger stick to
           determine if they are eligible to donate blood for the study, and will complete a
           questionnaire about any medications or other drugs (e.g., cigarettes) they may be
           taking.

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for research purposes.

      This research study will examine the role of innate immunity on the Inflammatory response of
      monocytes and macrophages to endotoxin. Approximately 1450 healthy participants aged 18 years
      and older will be identified and recruited from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry
      (EPR). The EPR is a long-term project to collect and store up to 15,000 DNA samples for use
      in research studies from individuals in the greater North Carolina Triangle Region. It is
      anticipated that approximately 50% of the participants contacted will enroll and about 15% of
      participants enrolled will withdraw.

      This controlled, observational gene association study will recruit participants on the basis
      of genotype and then observe the phenotype of each participant. There are several SNPs of
      interest in the genes TIRAP, MyD88, ABCA1, CD14, CD44, ITIH3, ITIH4, TLR4, TNFa, TLR5 and
      IRGM. In addition there are alleles of interest in the gene ApoE. These alleles taken
      together are considered a polymorphism. For each polymorphism of interest a separate group of
      participants will be recruited (including heterozygous and homozygous for both the minor and
      major alleles for each SNP). A maximum of 200 mLs of blood will be obtained from each
      participant during one visit lasting approximately 1.5 hours. Blood monocytes will be
      isolated from the donated blood samples and cultured to obtain macrophages. The macrophages
      will be exposed ex vivo to an endotoxin (LPS) and to PAM3CSK4 to determine cell response
      depending on genotype.

      The primary objective is to determine associations between select polymorphisms in four genes
      [TIRAP (TIR Associated Protein), MyD88 (Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response Protein 88),
      ApoE (Apolipoprotein E), ABCA1 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A1, CD14, CD44, ITIH3,
      ITIH4, TLR4, TNFa, TLR5 and IRGM and quantitative in vitro inflammatory functions of two cell
      types, the macrophage and neutrophil. The primary endpoints of this study for both cell types
      will be levels of 6 cytokines TNF alpha, IL-6, MIP-2, IL-8, MCP-1, and IFN-beta (ELISA)
      induced by LPS and by PAM3CSK4 plus baseline cytokine levels (no exposure to LPS or
      PAM3CSK4).

      We hope the results of this study may lead to discovery of important information regarding
      the role of MDC1 (Mediator of DNA damage Checkpoint protein 1) in human disease, potentially
      identifying new targets for future studies.
