  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, multicentric, prospective, post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study to
      investigate whether baseline treatment with high-dose interferon beta 1a (Rebif 44 μg x 3 ),
      administered at a high frequency, leads to maintenance of stabilisation of the course of the
      disease in MS subjects previously treated with mitoxantrone. The previous mitoxantrone
      treatment of the included MS subjects was conducted in the course of a so-called escalation
      according to the immunomodulatory escalation treatment plan. An additional important aspect
      of the problem was the collection of safety and tolerance data during the observation phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of relapsing-remitting MS with interferon-beta has established itself as
      first-choice treatment. In previous clinical studies, the interferon-beta 1a (Rebif) used
      within the scope of this PMS study has demonstrated significant efficacy in all aspects of
      treatment - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, relapse rate, progression of disability of
      MS. The PRISMS-4 study demonstrated that treatment with Rebif reduces the frequency and
      severity of clinical relapses over 4 years and slows the progression of disability.

      In the course of treatment escalation according to the Multiple Sklerose Therapie Konsensus
      Gruppe (MSTKG) guidelines, MS subjects with correspondingly high disease activity were
      predominantly put on mitoxantrone. The duration of treatment is on principle limited by a
      cumulative lifelong total dose of 140 mg/m2 body surface area, which may not be exceeded due
      to the known cardiologic adverse effects. If the cumulative mitoxantrone maximum dose is
      reached and if the subject is in a stable condition, the question of further treatment
      options presents itself. One possibility is the so-called 'deescalation', that is, the return
      to immunomodulating baseline treatment.

      Currently there is an increasing number of subjects who are in this phase of the disease and
      are eligible for corresponding treatment decisions.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To systematically investigate the safety, benefit and course of Rebif (44 μg x 3
           ),treatment in a larger number of subjects and to subject these data to standardized
           analysis

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a clinically demonstrated diagnosis of MS and present relapses

          -  Subjects who were relapse-free for the past 6 months with an Expanded Disability
             Status Scale (EDSS) range between 2 and 6

          -  Subjects who had a stable disease status during the past few months

          -  The last administration of mitoxantrone had been more than 3 months previously. In
             addition, the mitoxantrone treatment was given for at least a 12-month period, but for
             not more than 24 months, within a total dosage of 60-120 mg/m2 body surface area

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with MS with secondary progression (SPMS) without relapse activity, pregnant
             or breast-feeding patients, as well as subjects with contraindications

          -  Subjects with existing systemic concomitant diseases (e.g. diabetes, heart, liver or
             kidney diseases)
