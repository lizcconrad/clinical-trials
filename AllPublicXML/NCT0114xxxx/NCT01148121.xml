      This study may provide information that may serve as the foundation for a larger research
      study to address issues regarding the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis in the
      Down syndrome patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is responsible for more than 1.5 million fractures and $14 billion in medical
      care costs annually (U.S Dept of Health and Human Services data, 2006). Down syndrome is an
      independent risk factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis. Increases in life expectancy as well as
      costly morbidity following fracture are reasons for further investigation of osteoporosis and
      prevention in this population. Etiology for low bone density is presently unknown in this
      population but may be related to unique genes on chromosome 21 which alter the biochemistry
      of bone metabolism or change the gonadal, thyroid and parathyroid function to alter bone
      formation and/or resorption. There are no published data on the measurement of bone turnover
      markers in the Down syndrome population; therefore we will measure and accrue this
      information and compare to our Ts65Dn data, as described later in this protocol.

      This pilot study will serve as the foundation for a larger translational research grant which
      will address multiple issues regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of
      osteoporosis in the Down syndrome patient population and the Down syndrome mouse model
      (Ts65Dn). The data has the potential to improve our fundamental understanding of osteoporosis
      pathogenesis and treatment in the Down syndrome patient with potential applications to
      treatment in the general population.

    <description>The bone turnover markers, Complete Blood Count (CBC) and the Duel Energy X-ray (DXA) scan results will be used to assess the skeletal status of the Down syndrome patients. This data will form the basis to establish the Ts65Dn as a reasonable proxy for pathogenesis and treatment in humans.</description>

    <description>The investigators hypothesize that the bone deficits seen in Down Syndrome patients are similar to the phenotype seen in the down syndrome mouse model (Ts65Dn).The bone turnover markers, CBC, and DXA scan results will be used to assess the skeletal status of the down syndrome patients. This data will form the basis to establish the Ts65Dn as a reasonable proxy for pathogenesis and treatment in humans.</description>
