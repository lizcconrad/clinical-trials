  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are interested in learning how appetite responds to pasta containing different
      amounts of protein and fiber. In this research study, subjects will be asked to eat as much
      as they want of pasta containing different amounts of protein and fiber mixtures, thereafter
      subjects will describe their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat for 3 hours
      afterwards. Subjects will be asked to do this on three separate occasions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, 3-arm, treatment-controlled, within-subjects, 3-hour postprandial
      crossover study to evaluate the satiation effects of pasta formulations on lunch intake in
      healthy weight women. The study design will test 3 varying pasta formulations (2 experimental
      and 1 standard control) in a lunch setting in relatively healthy unrestrained women.

      This study will require one initial screening visit (approximately 1 hour) and three study
      visits each lasting approximately 4 hours. All visits should be done in 1 month. We are
      looking for healthy, non-smoking women older than 18 years of age with no significant medical
      history.

      The initial screening visit will determine subject eligibility through height, weight and
      waist circumference measurements, blood glucose test (finger prick) and eating, health,
      exercise and mood surveys.

      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will have 3 study visits. At each visits,
      subjects will be asked to consume as much as they would like of the pasta meal and beverage
      in a lunch setting and thereafter will be followed for 3 hours assessing subjective feelings
      of satiety. The lunch meal will be provided 5 hours after a standardized breakfast (usual
      breakfast for each subject at the same time of day on each study visit day). During the
      course of the study, subjects will be instructed to maintain their usual level of activity
      and diet. Four day food records will be maintained throughout the course of the study.

    <description>Meals will be provided 4 1/2 hours after a standardized breakfast (subject's own usual breakfast in the same quantity at the same time before each study visit) and subjects will be able to eat as much of the pasta as they would like and may request more if desired. Immediately thereafter, subjects will record satiety responses at 0 min (immediately post consumption), 20, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 on a visual analog scale (VAS). The subject will answer a series of questions on the VAS at each respective time point describing their feelings of hunger, fullness and desire to eat.</description>
