      Background:

      - Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is a disorder in which nerve cells in the brain that
      control movement degenerate. The cause of PLS is not known, but some research has suggested
      that environmental factors that produce oxidative stress trigger PLS in people who carry
      certain genes. Oxidative stress is caused when the body makes chemicals called &quot;free
      radicals&quot; faster than its natural systems can break them down. Oxidative stress can be
      triggered by exposures to chemicals related to the bodily effects of lead, smoking, alcohol
      consumption, physical activity, and psychological stress. Chemicals produced by the body
      during oxidative stress can be measured in the blood and urine. Researchers are interested in
      studying the physical, neurological, and chemical effects of PLS to better understand the
      effects of oxidative stress on the disorder.

      Objectives:

      - To study the relation of oxidative stress to the diagnosis and progression of motor neuron
      disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 20 years of age or older who have been diagnosed with PLS, and have had
      symptoms of PLS for at least 5 but not more than 8 years and been previously enrolled in
      01-N-0145 Screening: Neurologic Disorders with Muscle Stiffness

      Design:

        -  Participants will have an initial study visit and three follow-up visits. Each visit
           will require approximately 3 days of testing at the National Institutes of Health
           Clinical Center.

        -  As part of this study, participants will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  Neurological examination to test muscle strength, sensation, coordination, and reflexes,
           as well as clarity of speech

        -  Tests of memory, attention, concentration, and thinking

        -  Surveys on oxidative stress, including questions on life, mood, jobs held, and habit

        -  Electromyography to record the electrical activity of muscles

        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation to measure electrical activity translated from their
           brain to the muscles

        -  Blood, urine, and skin biopsy samples for testing and sample collection

        -  After the initial visit, participants will have three more visits, once each in the
           following 3 years.

      Objective

      Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are motor neuron
      disorders with different phenotypes that progress at very different rates. ALS is a rapidly
      progressive disease with a median survival less than 5 years. Patients with PLS have a slowly
      progressive course with a normal lifespan. One hypothesis is that oxidative stress affects
      the way in which different motor neuron disorders progress. To test this hypothesis,
      exposures to putative triggers of oxidative stress and biomarkers that may reflect oxidative
      stress will be assessed in patients with motor neuron disorders. A multicenter effort (the
      COSMOS study) has been initiated to accumulate sufficient numbers of ALS patients to address
      this hypothesis. As an add-on study, PLS patients will also be assessed in the multicenter
      effort. The objective of this protocol is to enroll PLS patients in this multicenter effort.
      The goal is to assess environmental factors and markers of oxidative stress in patients with
      established PLS.

      Study Population

      15 adult patients with PLS who have symptoms of pure upper motor neuron dysfunction for at
      least 5 but not more than 15 years.

      Design

      Patients will undergo a standard battery of clinical, physiological, and cognitive screening
      tests at enrollment, with scheduled follow-up evaluation visits every 12 months for 36
      months. Blood and urine samples will be sent to collaborators at Columbia University for
      analysis of markers of oxidative injury and genetic risk factors. Patients will complete a
      self-administered nutritional survey and will be interviewed by phone by Columbia University
      investigators using questionnaires to assess environmental, occupational, lifestyle and
      psychosocial factors thought to be triggers of oxidative stress.

      Outcome Measures

      The Columbia University collaborators will combine data from several centers in a regression
      model correlating the slope of decline of the ALS-FRS score with an index of oxidative
      stress.
