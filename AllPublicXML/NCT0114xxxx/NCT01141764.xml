  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the brain circuits function and circuits
      involved in the mechanism of thalamic DBS in patients with medically refractory epilepsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus in patients with
      medically refractory epilepsy has been shown to be efficacious. Studies have estimated a
      46-76% reduction in seizures relative to the baseline. However, the exact anatomic circuitry
      involved in the mechanism of DBS in epilepsy remains unknown. Positron emission tomography
      (PET) studies can provide clues to the metabolic activity associated with DBS activation. In
      our study, patients will be scanned with their DBS electrodes turned &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;. PET data
      captured during these two distinct states may show characteristic differences in cerebral
      glucose metabolism and modulatory effects of surrounding cerebral structures, thus providing
      clues to how DBS works to prevent seizures.

    <description>In our study, patients will be scanned with their DBS electrodes turned &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;.
Participation involves undergoing 2 separate PET scans on 2 separate days. The MRI and neuropsychological tests will either be performed on the same day as one of the PET scans or on a separate day.
Procedures performed in this study are not part of the standard management of epilepsy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan</intervention_name>
    <description>The PET procedure consists of an intravenous injection of 18F-FDG followed by a 45-minute period of quiet resting. PET images will be acquired on an integrated PET/CT scanner.
This process will be repeated with the stimulator &quot;on&quot; during the first PET image acquisition and &quot;off&quot; during the second PET image acquisition. &quot;On&quot; and &quot;off&quot; PET image acquisitions will be performed on two separate days.</description>

    <description>On the same day or separate visit, depending on the timing of the PET imaging, they will be required to attend one half-day session for neuropsychological testing. Patients will arrive at the Toronto Western Hospital, the stimulator will be turned &quot;off&quot; for 30 minutes prior to neuropsychological testing with testing repeated with the stimulator on.</description>
