  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple factors are associated with a large variability in voriconazole exposure following
      standard dose administration, such as non-linear saturable pharmacokinetics, drug-drug
      interactions, liver disease, patient age, and genetic polymorphism of the metabolic enzymes.

      Voriconazole is extensively metabolized by the human hepatic enzymes, primarily mediated by
      CYP2C19. The polymorphisms account for a relatively large portion of inter-individual
      variance observed in voriconazole plasma concentrations.

      However, there are limited data on the relationships between voriconazole blood levels and
      clinical outcomes or safety in Asian populations.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships of voriconazole blood levels
      with genetic polymorphism, safety, and clinical outcomes in immunocompromised patients with
      invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

      The investigators are trying to establish that routine clinical practice for voriconazole
      therapeutic drug monitoring can improve the efficacy and safety outcomes.

      In Korean patients with hematologic malignancy, the investigators also want to propose the
      optimal dosing guideline of voriconazole with different genetic polymorphisms.
