    <textblock>
      This work will focus on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways in lung diseases by
      measuring HO-1 in induced sputum and CO in exhaled air in cases of four respiratory diseases,
      asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), occupational lung diseases (OLD) and
      interstitial lung disease (ILD).
