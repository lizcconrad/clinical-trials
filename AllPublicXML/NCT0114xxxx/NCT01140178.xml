  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent literature suggests that certain patients with squamous cell cancers of the head and
      neck region may benefit from photodynamic therapy whether or not they may have received prior
      therapy, e.g. radiation therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to initiate a Phase 1 a clinical trial using HPPH and 665 nm light in patients
      with cancer of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx, including lesions of moderate to severe
      dysplasia, squamous carcinoma in situ and T1 squamous cells carcinoma. The study will employ
      a fixed HPPH dose of 4 mg/m2 infused over 1 hour, and 24 hours later light doses escalating
      from 100 J/cm2 to 125 and 140 J/cm2, respectively. The primary goal is the determination of
      the maximally tolerated PDT dose. Preliminary evidence for PDT efficacy wil also be obtained.

             oral cavity and/or oropharynx.

          -  Patients with T1 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and/or oropharynx.

          -  Patient may have primary and/or recurrent lesions to be treated.

          -  Diagnosis must confirmed by biopsy.

          -  Prior therapy of any type is allowed.

             control or be sterile.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG score of 0-2 (Appendix A 1 ).

          -  Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with T2 or greater squamous cell carcinoma.

          -  True tongue base lesions (as determined by the treating physician).

          -  Patients with severe trismus that prevents adequate access to the lesion for treatment
             light delivery (as determined by the treating physician).
