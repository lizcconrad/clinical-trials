      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of balloon dilatation
      (Foley) with vaginal misoprostol for cervical ripening and induction of labor.

      METHOD: a randomized clinical assay has been performed with 160 women with indication of
      induction of labor, randomly divided in two groups, 80 for Foley catheter and 80 for
      misoprostol.

    <textblock>
      The cesarean delivery rate has risen dramatically in almost all world. Brazil shows the
      highest rate in the world so we need urgently efforts to reduce this fact. Several studies
      have shown that maternal morbidity and mortality rates are higher in cesarean deliveries. On
      the other hand an abdominal delivery cost much more than a vaginal delivery.

      A clinical trial to assess the performance of two simple and sheep methods can provide
      evidence based on local experience. Our results alow us to recommend both methods for
      clinical practice with a good possibility to reduce cesarean rates and without adverse
      events.

    <description>Foley Group: catheter stay no more that 48 hours. Every 6 hours vaginal exam was performed. The cases on Bishop score increase or occurred spontaneous exit of catheter or spontaneous labour had been initiated are considered success.The failure was adopted if after48 hours occurred no cervical modifications.
Misoprostol group: was introduced 25 microgram every 6 hour (max 200microg)if cervical conditions were unchanged. In the case of cervical evolution or start of labour the method was considered success.The failure was adopted if after 48 there was no cervical modifications.</description>
