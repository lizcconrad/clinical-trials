  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Miralax results in a more
      efficacious preparation as compared to senna for pediatric colonoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be randomized in two groups: Group one will receive 1.5 g/kg of Miralax
      orally the day before procedure and one day of clear liquid diet, while subjects in Group 2
      will receive two doses of senna the day before procedure with two days of liquid diet (one
      day full liquid and one day clear liquid diet). On the day of the procedure parents/subjects
      will complete a questionnaire regarding prep compliance and adverse events. Electrolytes will
      be obtained prior to colonoscopy to monitor for electrolyte imbalance. Endoscopists will
      assess preparation for colonoscopy using validated cleanliness scale (Aronchick scale).

    <description>Percentage of patients with excellent or good colonoscopy preparation. The efficacy of preparation is measured by using a validated colon cleanliness scale which has 5 different levels (Aronchik scale). Levels 1 and 2, which encompass excellent and good colonoscopy preparation, are routinely recognized as adequate preparation allowing for successful completion of colonoscopy. Levels 3-5 describe incomplete or poor preparation. These levels are associated with significant residual stool encountered at the time of colonoscopy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Abnormal Electrolyte Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed once one day after the completion of colonoscopy preparation</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure was comparison of the proportions of patients who had abnormal electrolyte levels between two groups of patients, Miralax and senna.
Sodium, potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide levels were measured in mmol/L while urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were measured in mg/dL. Each of these values has a reference range which varies with patients' age and sex. Minimal change of one point above or below normal reference range was dismissed as clinically insignificant. Abnormal creatinine levels were rechecked through glomerular filtration rate calculation to determine if there was any compromise in renal function since abnormal creatinine level does not mean there is renal dysfunction nor that the level is clinically significant.</description>

          <title>Efficacy of Colon Preparation</title>
          <description>Percentage of patients with excellent or good colonoscopy preparation. The efficacy of preparation is measured by using a validated colon cleanliness scale which has 5 different levels (Aronchik scale). Levels 1 and 2, which encompass excellent and good colonoscopy preparation, are routinely recognized as adequate preparation allowing for successful completion of colonoscopy. Levels 3-5 describe incomplete or poor preparation. These levels are associated with significant residual stool encountered at the time of colonoscopy.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Patients With Abnormal Electrolyte Levels</title>
        <description>The outcome measure was comparison of the proportions of patients who had abnormal electrolyte levels between two groups of patients, Miralax and senna.
Sodium, potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide levels were measured in mmol/L while urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus were measured in mg/dL. Each of these values has a reference range which varies with patients' age and sex. Minimal change of one point above or below normal reference range was dismissed as clinically insignificant. Abnormal creatinine levels were rechecked through glomerular filtration rate calculation to determine if there was any compromise in renal function since abnormal creatinine level does not mean there is renal dysfunction nor that the level is clinically significant.</description>
        <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed once one day after the completion of colonoscopy preparation</time_frame>
