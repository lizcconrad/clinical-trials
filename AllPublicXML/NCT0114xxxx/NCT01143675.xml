  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if poor bone quality increases the risk of specific
      types of treatment complications in patients with proximal humerus fractures treated with
      open reduction and angle-stable plates (Proximal Humeral Internal Locking System - PHILOS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 70% of patients with a proximal humerus fracture are older than 60 years, up to
      three quarters are women and the incidence of low-energy fractures increases exponentially
      with age. The standard diagnostic method for classifying osteoporosis is the measurement of
      Bone Mineral Density at specific body sites - hip, vertebra or distal radius. Despite the
      fact that osteoporotic fractures are very frequent at the shoulder, no study investigated the
      correlation between local bone quality and fracture treatment at the proximal humerus.

      There is a concern among the clinicians that osteoporotic bone in proximal humerus fractures
      increases the risk of treatment complications. However, to our knowledge this has not yet
      been evaluated in clinical studies. One major reason for this lack of studies is the fact
      that no standardized method exists for the determination of bone density at the proximal
      humerus.

    <measure>Validation of a Computed Tomography (CT)-based method for BMD-measurement at the proximal humerus</measure>
    <time_frame>preoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The BMD (mg/cm3) at the proximal humerus will be determined preoperatively for the contralateral side of the fracture with a general purpose CT scanner, according to the protocol. Briefly, a CT of the contralateral humerus is performed measuring simultaneously the European Forearm Phantom (EFP) applied on the patient's midthorax. The measured CT Hounsfield Units (HU) of user-defined ROIs can then be quantified with the EFPbased calibration curve, resulting in BMD-values.</description>

    <measure>Association between the BMD at the proximal humerus (measured by CT) and the BMD at the distal radius (measured by DXA)</measure>
    <time_frame>until 6 weeks postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Bone density measurements at the left and right proximal and distal humerus have been correlated by Diederichs and colleagues. BMD comparison between left and right humeri revealed higher correlations for the distal (R2 = 0.9) and the proximal humerus (R2 = 0.74) than comparison between proximal and distal humerus (R2 = 0.4) (97). These date suggest that the contralateral should be favored to the ipsilateral location when estimating the bone density of a fractured site.</description>
