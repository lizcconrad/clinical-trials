  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The STIM-EHPAD study (for stimulation in nursing home) aims to evaluate the short and medium
      term effectiveness of staff education as a non-pharmacological intervention to manage apathy
      in older people with a diagnosis of dementia.

        -  Primary efficacy criteria: Apathy Inventory clinician score changes

        -  Secondary efficacy criteria: Apathy Inventory patient and caregiver version changes,
           Observation scale changes, frequency and severity of the other BPSD using the NPI,
           qualitative analysis of the nursing home staff behavioural changes
