  <brief_title>Study of the Fed-Fast Pharmocokinetics and Bioequivalance of 300mg Capsules of Droxidopa</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized, Open-Label, Three-Period, Three-Sequence, Single-Dose Crossover and Separate Three-Daily-Dose Treatment Period Study Comparing the Pharmacokinetic Profiles Following Oral Dosing of 300 mg of Droxidopa in the Fed Versus Fasted State, the Bioequivalence of Three 100 mg Capsules of Droxidopa Versus a Single 300 mg Capsule of Droxidopa, and 300 mg of Droxidopa Given Three Times at Four Hour Intervals in Healthy, Elderly Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One purpose of this study is to determine if taking droxidopa after eating will have an
      effect on how the body processes (absorbs and eliminates) the drug in healthy elderly
      subjects. Another purpose of this study is to see how the body processes (absorbs and
      eliminates) one 300mg capsule compared to three 100mg capsules. This study will also evaluate
      how well the body processes (absorbs and eliminates) and tolerates droxidopa when a 300 mg
      capsule is given 3 times a day for a total dose of 900 mg over the course of one day.

      Droxidopa is used to treat low blood pressure upon standing in patients with diseases of the
      nervous system, to prevent low blood pressure in patients with kidney disease during
      hemodialysis (removal of waste products of the blood), and to treat frozen gait (walking,
      stepping or running) and dizziness upon standing in patients with Parkinson's disease.

      This is a two-part study. Part I is a randomized, open-label, three-period crossover study in
      24 healthy, elderly, male or female subjects. Subjects will be allocated to one of three
      treatment sequences according to a randomization schedule prepared prior to the start of the
      study. Each subject will receive a single, oral dose of three 100 mg capsules of droxidopa
      with 240 mL of water either in the fasted state (Treatment A) or immediately following the
      consumption of a standardized high-fat meal (Treatment B) and a single, oral dose of one 300
      mg capsule of droxidopa with 240 mL of water in the fasted state (Treatment C) on Days 1, 4,
      and 7. Subjects will be discharged from the research clinic on Day 8 after completing all
      posttreatment follow-up assessments and will return to the research clinic approximately 1
      week later for Part II of the study. Part II of the study is an open-label design where all
      subjects will receive three doses of 300 mg droxidopa (three 100 mg capsules/dose) at 4 hour
      intervals and will be followed for a concurrent 24 h period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of active or recurring clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary,

             evaluation, such as medications that affect GI function (including proton pump
             inhibitors or metoclopramide) or vasoconstricting agents (e.g., ephedrine,
             dihydroergotamine, or midodrine), -triptans (e.g., sumatriptan, naratriptan,
             zolmitriptan, rizatriptan), halogen-containing anesthetics (e.g., cyclopropane, or
             halothane), catecholaminecontaining preparations (e.g., isoprenaline), non-selective
             MAOIs, ergotamine derivatives (except for anti-Parkinson medications), or any drugs
             with anti-hypertensive properties that in the investigator's opinion, could
             significantly contribute to the subject's orthostatic hypotension.
