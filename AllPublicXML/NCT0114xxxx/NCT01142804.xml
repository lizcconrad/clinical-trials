  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial based on the Social Networks for
      Activity (SNAP) Model to evaluate: (1) the effectiveness of an internet-based fitness walking
      program delivered to patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke; and
      (2) the contribution of social support networks to enhancing the effectiveness of the
      internet-based fitness walking program. The investigators will recruit 308 patients who are
      sedentary and have risk factors for cardiovascular disease and randomly assign them to one of
      the following groups: 1. Internet-based fitness walking program (WalkLink); 2. Internet-based
      fitness walking program plus additional social network intervention (WalkLink+); and 3.
      Minimal treatment control.

      The primary specific aims of this study are to:

        1. Evaluate the effects of WalkLink and WalkLink+ relative to a minimal treatment control
           group on change in: physical activity, aerobic fitness, blood pressure, body
           composition, and body mass index (BMI), from baseline to posttest, and at 6-month
           follow-up.

        2. Compare the differential effectiveness of WalkLink+ to WalkLink on change in: physical
           activity, aerobic fitness, blood pressure, body composition and BMI from baseline to
           posttest, and at 6-month follow-up.

        3. Evaluate the mediator and moderator effects of selected individual-level self-management
           skills (goal setting, planning, self-monitoring), social support variables (number of
           activity partners, social cues for walking, social praise/reinforcement), and
           physical-ecological variables (neighborhood walkability, physical cues for walking) on
           WalkLink and WalkLink+ treatment outcomes.
