      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective
      immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in
      treating patients with Epstein-Barr virus and cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine safety and to characterize the toxicity profile of EBNA1 C-terminal/LMP2
           chimeric protein-expressing recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine in patients in
           remission having been treated conventionally for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and
           malignancy.

        -  To describe changes in the frequency of functional T-cell responses to major
           histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II-restricted epitopes within EBNA1 and
           LMP2 in peripheral blood at sequential time-points before, during, and up to nine months
           after the vaccination course in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To assess changes in levels of EBV genome in plasma in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive EBNA1 C-terminal/LMP2 chimeric protein-expressing recombinant modified
      vaccinia Ankara vaccine intradermally on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for immune function, biomarker, and pharmacological
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at weeks 11 and 14, and at 6
      months and 1 year.
