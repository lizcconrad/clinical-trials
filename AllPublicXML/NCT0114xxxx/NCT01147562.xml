  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is responsible for the most deaths due to cancer each year in both men and women
      worldwide and once diagnosed, the 10 year survival rate is poor (&lt;15%). This poor prognosis
      is based in large part on the absence of an effective diagnostic test for the disease. The
      chief objective of this study is to develop a molecular-based diagnostic test specific for
      lung cancer. Subjects suspected or diagnosed with lung cancers, who are either undergoing
      thoracentesis, biopsy of a suspicious lesion or surgical resection of their tumor will be
      asked to participate in this study. Those subjects, who will undergo surgical resection, will
      donate both lung tumor tissue and adjacent normal lung tissue (potentially including lymph
      nodes), while non-surgical candidates will donate a portion of their excess biopsy sample, if
      available, after diagnosis has been confirmed. Subjects undergoing thoracentesis for pleural
      effusion will donate a portion of their fluid sample, if the fluid volume collected is in
      excess of that needed for clinical care purposes. Blood samples and optionally saliva will
      also be collected from all subjects, whether undergoing surgery or not. In addition to
      biosample collection, detailed annotated demographic and clinical information will be
      collected from subjects. Subjects will be followed for outcome analysis, specifically for
      tumor recurrence, every 6 months, during 5 years. In case of change in chemotherapy
      treatment, biosamples and clinical information will also be collected. Collected biosamples
      will be analyzed using a series of molecular and proteomic technologies for developing
      biomarkers of the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to discover and validate molecular biomarkers for lung
      cancer.

      Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in industrialized countries. Most
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with advanced disease, and despite
      recent advances in multi-modality therapy, the overall 10-year survival rate is less than
      10%. A significant minority of patients (25−30%) with NSCLC have stage I disease and receive
      surgical intervention alone. Although 35−50% of patients with stage I disease will relapse
      within 5 years, it is not currently possible to identify specific high-risk patients. In
      addition, for patients with metastatic disease, standard chemotherapeutic approaches result
      in less than 50% response rate, meaning that more than half of patients do not benefit and
      only suffer from side effects.

      Only very limited data exists on markers capable of predicting response to chemotherapy.

      This population would certainly also benefit from more of those markers. Another situation
      where a biomarker could be potentially very useful is the situation where a pulmonary nodule
      is diagnosed and has to be characterized. In this situation a biomarker could predict whether
      the nodule is or is not cancerous and thus, make CT Scan follow up unnecessary.
