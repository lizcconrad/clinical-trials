      The primary objective for this study is to assess the impact of a measurement based treatment
      program (MBT) on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remission rates in patients whose primary
      care provider (PCP) receives monthly patient-reported depression severity reports compared to
      patients whose PCP does not receive monthly reports.
