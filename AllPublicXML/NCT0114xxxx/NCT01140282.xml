      Rationale: Exercise therapy may improve the quality of life of breast cancer survivors.

      Purpose: This randomized clinical trial studies exercise therapy and quality of life in
      postmenopausal early breast cancer survivors receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention will improve components of metastasis
      (MetS) in breast cancer survivors soon after completion of cancer-related treatments by
      measuring changes in body composition, waist circumference, blood pressure, and serum levels
      of insulin, glucose, lipids, C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

      II. To determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention will improve physical fitness in
      breast cancer survivors soon after completion of cancer-related treatments by measuring
      cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength.

      III. To assesses the feasibility of a supervised exercise intervention in early breast cancer
      survivors.

      IV. To determine whether a 16-week exercise intervention will result in a reduction in
      adipose tissue inflammation in obese breast cancer survivors soon after completion of
      cancer-related treatments by measuring ATM phenotype and ATM cytokine expression.

      V. To determine whether breast cancer survivors can maintain positive benefits of an exercise
      intervention following a 12-week follow-up period by measuring changes in body composition,
      waist circumference, blood pressure, and serum levels of insulin, glucose, lipids, C-reactive
      protein, and HbA1c, cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      Arm I (Control): Patients refrain from increasing physical activity levels for 16 weeks.

      Arm II (Exercise): Patients participate in supervised exercise sessions over 60 minutes
      thrice weekly and are encouraged to participate in a home-based exercise session over 30-45
      minutes once weekly for 16 weeks.
