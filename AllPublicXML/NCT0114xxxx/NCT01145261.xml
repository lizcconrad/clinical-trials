      The current study will focus on two phases of anxiety process: Generating Anxiety (reported,
      direct and physiological) and Emotional Regulation Strategies (Reappraisal, Mindfulness,
      Expressive Suppression and Rumination). The claim is that better understanding of these
      phases in relation to CBT treatment will lead to better understanding of remission in anxiety
      and to better treatments in the future. Objectives: To understand the relations between the
      four strategies of emotional regulation to anxiety disorder hence to understand the relation
      between these strategies to treatment effectiveness of children with anxiety disorder.
      Methods: In phase one, clinically anxious adolescence before treatment (N=40) and healthy
      controls (N=40) will be compared. Anxious adolescence are expected to have significantly
      higher levels of physical arousal and will use spontaneously more expressive suppression and
      rumination and less reappraisal and mindfulness then the healthy controls. In phase two,
      clinically anxious adolescence (N=40) before and after 8-12 weeks of CBT treatment will be
      compared. More specifically remitted patients will be compared with partially remitted
      patients. Remitted patients are expected to show better improvement in the physical arousal,
      then partially remitted. More, Decrease in levels of anxiety will be mediated by the four
      emotional regulation strategies, and the efficiency of using the Reappraisal will be higher.
