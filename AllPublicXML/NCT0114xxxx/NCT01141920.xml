  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New admissions (n = 120) to the Addiction Treatment Services (ATS) will be stabilized on
      methadone and randomly assigned to one of two induction conditions: 1) routine stepped care,
      or 2) low threshold stepped care. All participants will continue with routine stepped care in
      month 4. Treatment retention is the primary outcome measure, while drug use (measured via
      weekly urinalysis testing) is the major secondary outcome.

    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial will evaluate two induction strategies for helping
      out-of-treatment opioid abusers transition to methadone maintenance treatment. All study
      participants (n = 120) will be new admissions to the Addiction Treatment Services at Hopkins
      Bayview (ATS), stabilized on 80 mg of methadone, and randomly assigned to one of two study
      conditions. The experimental induction condition will receive low threshold stepped care
      (LTSC) for the first 3-month of treatment that reduces the counseling demands of maintenance
      treatment (i.e., one counseling session / month). This condition will be compared to routine
      stepped care (RSC) for the first 3-months, which provides escalating intensity of counseling
      schedules contingent on drug use or poor adherence. RSC is routine treatment at ATS. All
      participants will receive routine stepped care following the 3-month induction phase, and
      will have the opportunity to remain in treatment at ATS following study participation.
      Participation is for 4-months. Retention is the primary outcome. Participants will also
      submit urine samples weekly on a random schedule each month. We hypothesize that LTSC
      participants will exhibit better retention than RSC participants, and that both conditions
      will exhibit reductions in drug use compared to baseline.

    <description>Participants assigned to this condition will receive routine stepped-care treatment at ATS. Participants will begin in Step 2 (one counseling session per week), and be advanced to higher intensity care based on missed counseling sessions and drug-positive urine samples. Participants advanced to Step 3 will be scheduled to attend 2 group counseling sessions per week (in addition to individual counseling), and those advanced to Step 4 will be scheduled to attend 8 group counseling sessions per week (in addition to individual counseling). Time of methadone dosing will be based on step of care.</description>

    <arm_group_label>3-month counseling induction: low threshold</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants assigned to this treatment arm will receive low threshold counseling. These participants will be scheduled to attend one counseling session per month with their individual counselor for the first 3-months. Participants can attend more counseling sessions if they desire, and they can meet with program supervisors to address crisis situations. They can receive methadone dosing any time during the clinic hours (7:30 am-1:15 pm and 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm)</description>

    <intervention_name>low threshold care</intervention_name>
    <description>Low threshold care refers to a service delivery method that reduces the treatment demands for new admissions to substance abuse treatment. In the present study, participants will be scheduled to attend less counseling sessions, and will have greater access to methadone.</description>
