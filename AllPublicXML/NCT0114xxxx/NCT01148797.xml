  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study designed to evaluate the role of treatment with a biological agent - Canakinumab in
      pediatric (age 4-20) Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) patients that are intolerant or
      resistant for colchicine treatment.

      The study hypothesis is that Canakinumab will reduce attack frequency and severity.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects between 4 and 20 years of age with active type 1 FMF disease
             (according to Tel-Hashomer Long criteria for diagnosis of FMF) and genetic
             confirmation of diagnosis (for the study - genetic confirmation is defined as either
             homozygous or compound heterozygous).

          2. Subjects must have type 1 disease characterized by recurrent and short episodes of
             inflammation and serositis, with an average of at least 3 well documented acute FMF
             attacks during the previous 3 months that are confirmed by the treating physician,
             lasting less then a week, and a minimum 14 day- attack free interval between attacks.

          3. Subjects must have received an adequate trial of colchicine, defined as treatment of
             at least 1-2 mg/d (based on subjects age) for at least 3 months, or an inability to
             tolerate colchicine due to adverse effects in a dose that controls acute attacks in
             the frequency of less than one attack per month.

          4. Subjects treated with anti-IL-1 therapies must complete washout and have experienced
             at least 2 attacks since (e.g. Anakinra: 3 day washout; Rilonacept: 4 week washout)

          5. Subjects treated with anti-TNF drugs must undergo appropriate washout. Prior to
             randomization, use of Etanercept must be discontinued for 4 weeks or use of Adalimumab
             or Infliximab must be discontinued for 8 weeks - a full list of washout periods for
             current treatments will be supplied

          6. If subject is a female of childbearing potential, she must agree to use adequate
             contraception (adequate contraception can include abstinence) for the duration of the
             trial and 3 months after, and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior
             to administration of each dose of study medication.

          7. Subject's parent or legal guardian has provided written informed consent prior to
             screening for this study, or if subject is older than 18 years has provided informed
             consent him/herself.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with end-organ dysfunction due to amyloidosis (e.g. existing biopsy proven
             amyloidosis or proteinuria &gt; 0.5 gram per day)

          2. Subjects taking oral or IV steroids within 1 month prior to baseline. Subjects taking
             steroids for reasons other than FMF - may be enrolled into the study based on
             discussion with the investigator and sponsor.

          3. Presence or history of any other inflammatory rheumatic disease

          4. The subject has active non-infective GI disease (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), a
             chronic or acute renal or hepatic disorder, or a significant coagulation defect.

          5. The subject has an AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT) or BUN &gt;2 x ULN or creatinine &gt;1.5 mg/dL,
             and any other laboratory abnormality considered by the examining physician to be
             clinically significant within 28 days before the Baseline visit.

          6. Positive PPD test (according to local guidance) where a latent or active TB infection
             cannot be excluded via QuantiFERON (T-Spot or radiographic imaging if needed) or via
             Chest x-ray.

          7. The subject has positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status or current (acute
             or chronic) hepatitis B or C

          8. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          9. Presence of any active or chronic infection or any major episode of infection
             requiring hospitalization or treatment with i.v. antibiotics within 30 days or oral
             antibiotics within 14 days prior to screening

         10. Malignancy, except for successfully excised squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin

         11. The subject has received any investigational medication within 30 days before the
             first dose of study medication or is scheduled to receive an investigational drug,
             other than study medications described in this protocol, during the course of the
             study.

         12. The subject has received a live virus vaccine within 3 months prior to the baseline
             visit.

         13. Any concurrent medical condition which would, in the investigator's opinion,
             compromise the subject's ability to tolerate the study drug or would make the subject
             unable to follow with the protocol.

         14. History of/or current psychiatric illness that would interfere with ability to comply
             with protocol requirements or provide informed consent.

         15. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 6 months that would
             interfere with ability to comply with protocol requirements.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
