      A Study of Bafetinib as Treatment for Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bafetinib is a dual protein kinase inhibitor, targeting both bcr/abl and Lyn kinases. B-cell
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells overexpress Lyn kinase compared to normal B lymphocytes as
      well as acute leukemias (ALL and AML), and inhibition of Lyn kinase induces apoptosis in
      cultures of B-CLL cells. Thus, bafetinib may stop the growth of B-CLL cells by inhibiting Lyn
      kinase, the molecule that couples the B cell receptor to downstream signaling.

             phosphate, cladribine, pentostatin)

               -  progression after at least one course of an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide or
                  chlorambucil)

               -  relapse within 12 months after at least one course of either a purine nucleoside
                  or an alkylating agent.

               -  measurable and progressive lymphocytosis

               -  measurable and progressive lymphadenopathy (lymph node ≥2 cm in a single
                  diameter)
