    <textblock>
      Pain that persists after the healing of a surgical wound has previously been described as an
      important, but often unrecognized clinical problem. Persistent postsurgical (chronic
      postoperative pain) is the consequence of either ongoing inflammation or more common
      neuropathic pain as a result of surgical damage to peripheral nerves.

      Previous studies have shown that chronic pain is a frequent and serious complication
      following thoracic surgery. However, the prevalence of chronic pain following both
      thoracoscopy and anterior thoracotomy in patients with pulmonary malignancies is poorly
      characterized and the impact of this pain on patients' lives remains unclear. Thus, this
      study aims to investigate the prevalence of chronic pain following thoracoscopy or anterior
      thoracotomy, and the severity and impact of persistent post-surgical pain on daily life.

      This study is working with several hypotheses: 1.) persistent postsurgical pain following
      lung cancer surgery is predominantly of neuropathic nature and the presence of neuropathic
      symptoms increases the severity of postsurgical pain and reduces the patient's quality of
      life, 2.) the prevalence of chronic pain is reduced over time, and 3.) less invasive thoracic
      surgical interventions reduces the risk of the development of chronic pain.
