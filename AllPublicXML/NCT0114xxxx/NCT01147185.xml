      The purpose of this study is to determine whether longer locomotor training results in a mor
      favorable outcome in patients with incomplete spinal cord injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About half of patients who experience a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) have still motor
      and/or sensory function below the level of the lesion. A large proportion of these patients
      become ambulatory within the first six months after the SCI. In order to optimally train the
      walking function patients are partially unloaded from their body weight while they walk on a
      moving treadmill. In severe cases therapists have to assist the leg movements which is an
      exhaustive work limiting training time. In the last few years robotic devices have been
      developed which enable longer training time. Studies evaluating the training of patients with
      hemiparesis showed that longer training time is associated with a better outcome. The present
      study aims at evaluating the effect of training time within the robotic device on the
      recovery of ambulatory function. Subject with an acute incomplete SCI will be included. The
      intervention consist of a walking training which lasts at least 50min, the training of the
      control group last at maximum 25min. Both groups will undergo 3-5 trainings per week. Group
      assignment will be performed at random. The study lasts for 8 weeks. The primary outcome will
      be the self selected walking speed which will be assessed bi-weekly during the training
      period and 4 months later.
