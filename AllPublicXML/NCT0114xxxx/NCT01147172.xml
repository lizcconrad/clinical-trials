  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevess is intended for all skin types. However, further study of all soft tissue fillers is
      needed in people of color because of the increasing use of cosmetic dermal filler products.

      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of an injectable hyaluronic acid based dermal
      filler Elevess (Anika Therapeutics, Inc., Bedford, MA). Safety will be evaluated by incidence
      and severity of keloid formation and pigmentation changes, and other potential adverse events
      in people with Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V and VI who have elected to undergo nasolabial
      fold (NLF) treatment with Elevess.

      1. Fitzpatrick Classification of Skin Type as: IV - Burns minimally, always tans well
      (moderate/light brown skin; Mediterranean, Asian, Hispanic. V - Rarely burns, tans profusely
      (dark brown/brown skin: Middle eastern, Latin, light skinned Black, Indian) VI - Never burns,
      (deeply pigmented dark brown to black skin;Black)

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to be an open-label, longitudinal, uncontrolled study in a minimum of
      100 subjects with Fitzpatrick scale skin type of IV, V or VI at 10 or more U.S. centers who
      have elected to undergo NLF treatment with intradermal (deep dermal) injection of Elevess.
      Subjects will be followed for a minimum of 24 weeks with visit assessments at 2, 6, 12 and 24
      weeks after the last injection.

      Safety: Primary Safety Endpoint assessments will be: 1) keloid formation at the site of
      injection at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks, 2) pigmentation changes at the site of injection compared
      to adjacent skin at 2, 6, 12 and 24 weeks, and 3) overall adverse events. A subject diary
      will also be collected.

      Effectiveness: No formal effectiveness evaluation will be performed.

      <pre_assignment_details>Elevess was injected into the mid to deep dermis of each nasolabial fold. Subjects were telephoned at 72 (±24) hours to assess the subjects for possible AEs and injection site reactions. All subjects returned 14 ± 3 days after initial treatment for evaluation of AEs and to assess whether a Touch-up was needed.</pre_assignment_details>
