      <pre_assignment_details>During the initial screening visit, subjects were assessed for study eligibility through medical history, physical examination, vital signs, oxygen saturation, conventional 12-lead ECG, and laboratory tests. The investigator at the site examined the ECG telemetry to determine the subjects’ eligibility.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Buprenorphine transdermal patches 5, 10, 20, and 2 * 20 mcg/h. Randomization was from predose on day 1 to predose on day 14. There were 3 treatment groups: BTDS, placebo, and moxifloxacin as the positive control. The treatment groups between placebo and BTDS were double-blinded. Moxifloxacin treatment was open label to subjects, to the investigator, and the staff at the study site.
BTDS or placebo TDS was applied on day 1 for 3 days (BTDS 5), on day 4 for 3 days (BTDS 10), on day 7 for 3 days (BTDS 20), and on day 10 for 4 days (2 * BTDS 20). On day 6 and day 13, subjects in the positive control group received one 400 mg tablet of moxifloxacin.</description>

        <description>QT and RR data were determined for each of 4 ECGs over an approximate 10-minute interval at each nominal time point. The average QT and QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) data from the replicate ECGs at each nominal time point were calculated. The average QT and QTc data over the 2 pretreatment days were used as the baseline QT and QTc values.

          <title>The Average Differences From Baseline Between Moxifloxacin and Placebo by Fridericia’s Corrected Interval (QTcF) on Day 6 and Day 13</title>
          <description>QT and RR data were determined for each of 4 ECGs over an approximate 10-minute interval at each nominal time point. The average QT and QTc (interval corrected for heart rate) data from the replicate ECGs at each nominal time point were calculated. The average QT and QTc data over the 2 pretreatment days were used as the baseline QT and QTc values.
Observed time from start of the QRS complex to end of the T wave (QT); interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) msec; interval corrected by Fridericia’s method (QTcF) msec.</description>
          <population>The full analysis population for ECGs (N = 131) was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postdose digital QT/QTc evaluation.
For the comparison of moxifloxacin to placebo (N = 88), the subjects randomized to BTDS were excluded.</population>
