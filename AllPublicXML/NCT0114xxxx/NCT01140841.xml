      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Fipamezole
      in adult patients with Parkinson's disease who are receiving levodopa.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. While
      treatment with dopaminergic agents like levodopa, the mainstay of treatment, is effective in
      the early phases of the disease, their benefits decrease with disease progression, and
      problems such as dyskinesia and on-off phenomenon begin to manifest. In this study,
      fipamezole, a new antagonist of an adrenergic receptor, is being investigated to better
      understand the safety and side-effect profile in patients with Parkinson's Disease.

      The sampling method used was simple random sampling.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is a man or woman between 30 and 75 years of age, inclusive, with intact oral
             mucosa at Screening (Visit 1) and Randomization (Visit 2).

          2. Subject has a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease defined according to the UK
             Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnosis criteria.

          3. Subject has been receiving a stable regimen of at least three daily administrations of
             levodopa (with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor), with no dose changes for at
             least 4 weeks prior to Randomization (Visit 2).

          4. Subject is rated at stage 2 to 4 on the Hoehn and Yahr scale.

          5. If currently taking other medications (other than levodopa), subject must be on a
             stable regimen, defined as no dose changes for at least 1 month prior to Randomization
             (Visit 2).

          6. Subject demonstrates the ability to comprehend the study procedures and provide
             informed consent.

          7. Female subjects must be either postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically
             sterilized at least 3 months prior to Randomization (Visit 2). Male subjects must
             either be sterile or willing to use 2 approved methods of contraception when engaged
             in sexual intercourse with a female partner from Randomization (Visit 2) until 30 days
             after the last dose of study drug.
