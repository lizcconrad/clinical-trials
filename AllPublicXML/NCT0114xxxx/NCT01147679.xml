    <textblock>
      This study is designed to document the loss of sociomoral emotions (like empathy, guilt, and
      embarrassment) in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. The loss of these
      emotions, which function as the motivators for social behavior, will manifest in specific
      interpersonal behaviors. These behaviors will correlate with regional changes in regional
      changes in medial frontal and anterior temporal lobes. These social and emotional changes
      will be compared with a young-onset Alzheimer's disease comparison group.

    <textblock>
      Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a devastating disorder and one the most common
      neurodegenerative diseases in middle age. The most prominent early manifestations of bvFTD
      (&quot;behavior variant&quot; FTD) are not the memory and other cognitive deficits typical of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) but, rather, disturbance in social or interpersonal behavior. A
      basic manifestation of this disorder is a disturbance in the emotions and motives that drive
      social and moral behavior. In fact, bvFTD is an incredible window to the neuroscience of
      social behavior. This study will help clarify the neurobiological substrates of sociomoral
      emotions and their associated clinical features. The findings of this proposal can have major
      implications for understanding the interaction between brain and social behavior and for
      designing future research on the basic mechanisms of social neuroscience. This research aims
      to document the loss of sociomoral emotions (SME) compared to primary emotions in patients
      with bvFTD vs. patients with AD and normal controls. We need to show that these findings are
      specific to bvFTD and not present in Alzheimer's disease or normal controls. The project
      consists of three integrated parts: 1) behavioral measures that include observations in
      naturalistic settings, behavioral experiments, and behavioral scales; 2) psychophysiological
      reactivity (i.e., measures of heart rate, blood pressure changes, galvanic skin response,
      facial electromyography, and facial temperature) to social and emotional stimuli; and 3)
      brain localization of changes in sociomoral emotions with magnetic resonance imaging
      technology.

    <description>We will evaluate autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) nervous system reactivity to sociomoral vs. non-social stimuli using measures of heart rate (and heart rate variability), blood pressure (and baroreflex sensitivity), finger pulse volume, and skin conductance changes. Investigators present social and non-social pictures, videos, and written scenarios to all three groups while recording these psychophysiologic measures.</description>

    <description>This proposal will use methods of ethnography to classify the social behavior of bvFTD and AD patients and their caregivers in their homes and during research visits. Four social behavioral experiments or vignettes will be used to cross-validate the results of augmented participant observation. Behavioral scales will record differences between caregiver and patient assessments of behavior and further validate the results of the participant observation.</description>
