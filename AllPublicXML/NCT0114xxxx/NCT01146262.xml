    <textblock>
      Dendritic cells vaccinations are increasingly used in order to develop antitumoral immune
      response. This will be a Phase 2 trial using autologous dendritic cells pulsed with leukemic
      apoptotic corpse in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients in first or second Complete
      remission (CR).
