  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to administering PF-04427429 to patients we wish to increase the understanding of
      functional effects associated with calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) pathways. This
      study will examine whether it is possible for a single dose of PF-04427429 to acutely
      attenuate a capsaicin induced flare response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects between the ages of 18 and 50 years inclusive. Healthy is
             defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical
             history, full physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the trial.

          -  Skintype I-III with a distance from base of scaphoid to antecubital fossa &gt;26cm on
             their forearms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, genitourinary, psychiatric, neurologic,
             or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, symptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Use of biologics including any live vaccines within 3 months prior to screening or
             prior treatment with an antibody in a previous clinical trial or treatment with an
             immunoglobulin in the past 6 months.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF &gt;450 msec at screening.

          -  Subjects with scars or tattoos on the forearms, or with evidence of sunburn, or
             excessive hairy volar forearms.
