  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of a
      dTpa (Boostrix™ vaccine) booster dose given 10 years after the previous vaccination with dTpa
      in GSK 263855/029 study. Only subjects who were part of the primary study will be invited to
      participate in this study.This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of
      the booster phase. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a
      separate study (see reference).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a booster dose of the vaccine that they received in their primary
      study. Subjects who received the investigational vaccine formulation, will receive Boostrix™
      in the present study.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects consisted of those previously vaccinated &amp; boosted in GSK263855/029 study and contacted for participation in this booster (BST) study. Duration of this study was about 19 months, from Year 8.5 (8.5 years post BST in GSK263855/029 study) to one month post BST in this study (Year 10 [10 years post BST in GSK263855/029 study] + one month).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At Year 8.5, a total of 180 subjects (out of the 478 planned) were enrolled: 54, 60 and 66 subjects in the Boostrix-REF, Boostrix-US, and Boostrix-INV groups, respectively. At Year 10, a total of 177 subjects (out of the 180 planned) were enrolled: 55, 60 and 62 in the Boostrix-REF, Boostrix-US, and Boostrix-INV groups, respectively.</pre_assignment_details>
