  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First line chemotherapy treatment regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) present
      disease-free survival of more than 10 months, and as much as 12 and 15 months for many
      patients.

      It is evident that there are 2 groups of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC):
      those who progress during first line treatment or in the 6 months following the last
      chemotherapy infusion and those who progress after this first 6-month period.

      There are currently no studies evaluating the efficacy of second line chemotherapy regimens
      according to the duration of response to first line treatment. It seems logical that patients
      with less aggressive tumours will benefit more from treatments targeting specific proteins,
      such as panitumumab, due to the shorter duration of these tumours cell cycle, which makes
      them less sensitive to chemotherapy.

      This study is therefore justified to determine an increase in activity and control of the
      disease in patients who progressed after 6 months of the last first line chemotherapy
      infusion for metastatic colorectal cancer(mCRC) in subjects expressing wild-type KRAS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-arm, multi-centre study. Patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer expressing wild type KRAS will be screened for this trial. KRAS mutation status will
      be assessed before inclusion and only WILD-TYPE-KRAS subjects will be included. Eligible
      subjects will be enrolled and treated with combination therapy consisting of Panitumumab and
      FOLFIRI as second line treatment.

      Eligible patients must not have progressed on or within 6 months after receiving first line
      chemotherapy based on fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin (prior adjuvant chemotherapy based on
      fluoropyrimidine is permitted). Only one previous chemotherapy regimen is permitted.
      Progression after 6 months receiving first line chemotherapy regimen, should be
      imaging-based.

      Tumor response assessment will be performed by the investigator per the modified Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (m-RECIST). Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response
      every 6 weeks ± 1 week the first 24 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter (per the
      modified-RECIST criteria) until progression disease (PD) or withdrawal from the trial.
      Responding disease will be confirmed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response are
      first met. Subjects with symptoms suggestive of progression disease(PD) should be evaluated
      for tumor progression at the time the symptoms occur.

      All subjects who permanently discontinue the treatment for any reason, will undergo a safety
      follow-up assessment 30 days ± 7 days after the last treatment dose Subjects will be followed
      for disease status and subsequent cancer therapy. All subjects who discontinue all the
      treatment before disease progression (eg, due to unacceptable toxicities) are followed for
      progression free survival (PFS) (eg, radiographic tumor assessments) every 12 weeks ± 14 days
      until disease progression or the end of study (unless the reason for study discontinuation is
      fully withdrawn consent). After disease progression, all subjects are followed every 12 weeks
      ± 14 days from the safety follow-up visit until the end of study (approximately 52 weeks
      after the last subject is enrolled).
