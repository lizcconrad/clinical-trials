  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most frequently investigated hypothesis of the pathophysiology underlying Seasonal
      Affective Disorder(SAD) or so called winter depression is a disturbance of circadian rhythms.
      Since the circadian system is especially sensitive for the blue portion of the light
      spectrum, a new light therapy device with more blue light (blue enriched polychromatic light)
      was tested for its efficacy to treat SAD. In chronobiological terms this light is
      hypothesized to be more potent in inducing non-visual effects. In the present study
      fluorescent tubes that emit a high portion of short wavelength light on top of the normal
      wavelengths are tested for its superiority in treating SAD. This blue-enriched light (colour
      temperature 17000 ยบK) is compared to standard light treatment (5000 ยบ K) in SAD patients.,In
      a earlier study it was shown that the therapeutic effect of blue enriched light were equal to
      standard light treatment using light in both conditions with an intensity of 10 000 lux. In
      the present study, blue enriched light with an intensity of 750 lux was used, because of the
      possible saturation effect in the former study. The investigators hypothesise that blue-
      enriched light with a low intensity improve the therapeutic effects of light treatment
      leading to a higher response or the same response in a shorter time schedule compared to
      standard light treatment.
