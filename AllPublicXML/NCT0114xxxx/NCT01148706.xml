      The ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System is an optical navigation system designed to assist
      physicians performing percutaneous interventions under CT guidance. The system allows the
      user to select an obstacle free path to a target lesion based on pre-procedure CT images, and
      then provides real-time information for guiding the interventional tool towards the target
      along the selected path.

      The ActiSight™ Needle Guidance System employs a miniature video camera mounted on the needle
      and a reference pad attached to the skin to register the needle into the CT image space, and
      thus, track the needle advance towards the target. CT scans are used as needed to verify the
      location of the needle.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the ActiSight™
      Needle Guidance System in assisting in CT-guided percutaneous procedures.
