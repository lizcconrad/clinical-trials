      This is a multi-center observational study to assess addition of Rituximab in the treatment
      of previously untreated patients with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas(DLBCL) over an
      enrollment period of 60 months. Patients in this study are enrolling for the collection of
      their data on observations made during normal clinical practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously untreated patients with DLBCL of the breast.

          -  Patients must have CD20 positive tumors.

          -  Stage IE or IIE.

          -  Must have at least one objective measurable or evaluable disease. Baseline
             measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration to the
             study.

          -  Patients must not have historical or radiographic evidence of CNS metastasis including
             previously treated, resected or asymptomatic brain lesions or leptomeningeal
             involvement.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory
             studies (within 2 weeks prior to registration):

               -  Creatinine Clearance &gt;= 50 ml/min

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl and AST &lt;= 2 x upper limit of normal. If documented
                  hepatic involvement with lymphoma, total bilirubin can be &lt;= 3 x *ULN, and AST &lt;=
                  5 x ULN.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1500/mm3 and platelet count &gt;= 100,000/mm3. If
                  documented bone marrow involvement with lymphoma, absolute neutrophil count &gt;=
                  500/mm^3 and platelet count &gt;= 50,000/mm^3.

          -  Patients must be age &gt;= 18 years.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast feeding due to potential harmful effects to the
             fetus/baby. Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly
             advised to use an accepted and effective method of contraception.

          -  Patients must not have an active infection requiring parental antibiotics.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection are excluded.

          -  Patients must have a normal left ventricular ejection fraction to be eligible.
