      The proposed study will test the following hypotheses:

        1. Pre-operative daily dual supplementation with Juice Plus+ (fruit &amp; vegetable) for 11
           weeks will result in reduced post-operative morbidity in terms of quality of life, pain
           and trismus after 1 week following surgical removal of lower third molars, when compared
           to placebo.

        2. Pre-operative daily dual supplementation with Juice Plus+ (fruit &amp; vegetable) for 11
           weeks will reduce serum markers of oxidative stress, following surgical removal of lower
           third molars, when compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In general antioxidant status appears to influence wound healing in humans and in animal
      models of acute trauma, with low antioxidant concentrations and excessive oxidative stress
      being associated with impaired healing. Whilst antioxidant supplementation has been reported
      to improve plasma antioxidant status and wound healing in animal models of acute trauma,
      there is remarkably little data from human studies.

      The use of Juice Plus+ has been reported to increase serum concentrations of important
      antioxidants and reduce serum markers of oxidative stress. However, to date there are no
      reported studies concerning the potential for Juice Plus+ to improve patient-based outcome
      measures following the surgical removal of lower third molars. This study therefore proposes
      to investigate the impact of daily supplementation with Juice Plus+, in improving outcomes
      following surgical trauma. While the rationale for the proposed study is primarily predicated
      on the established role of oxidative stress and antioxidant micronutrients in chronic
      inflammatory diseases, the proposed randomized controlled clinical study represents an
      efficient way of evaluating the potential for adjunctive Juice Plus+ use in improving wound
      healing and reducing post-operative morbidity following surgical procedures on humans.
