      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare clinical outcomes from two
      different patient position(prone vs left decubitus)with thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization
      in the procedure of Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy (MIE).

        -  Comparing morbidities from the two groups

        -  Comparing short-term quality of life from the two groups

        -  Comparing oncological results (3,5 year survival) from the two groups

      Thoracoscopic esophagectomy is routinely performed in two positions. The left decubitus
      position is the most commonly used position at most centers. However prone position is
      another alternative.

      The left decubitus position is advocated for its the same position as the open procedure and
      easy to learn, as well as easy to emergent conversion to open thoracotomy .However, the
      disadvantage of this position is the need of lung retraction for better exposure and
      definitely one lung ventilation. They are regarded as potential causes leading lung injury.

      Prone thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization has been advocated for its potential benefits of
      increased operative exposure, no lung retraction, avoid one lung ventilation, improved
      surgeon ergonomics. But it is difficult to make emergent conversion under this positon and
      not familiar with most thoracic or digestive surgeons. A longer learning curve may be needed.

      A few publications have compared the two position with thoracoscopic mobilization of the
      esophagus in retrospective study of a small cohort. Until now, no prospective randomized
      study has been carried out in this field.

    <description>In prone position group, patients are intubated with single lumen endotracheal tube. Surgeon and assistant stand on the right of the patient. A 10 mm camera port is placed 7th intercostals space in posterior axillary line, CO2 pneumothorax is created with pressure of 8mmHg. A 5 mm port is placed just posterior to the scapular tip. The last 10mm port is placed at 9th intercostals space in the scapular line for. The tumor and esophagus are dissected with cleaning of the lymph nodes along bilateral recurrent nerve.
In controlling group, The four chest ports were similar to that described by the University of Pittsburgh group. The left two ports are used for surgical exposure, the right two ports is to divide and dissect the esophagus. The dissection is similar to that of the prone position.</description>
