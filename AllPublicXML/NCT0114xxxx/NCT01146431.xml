  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is 1) to investigate whether the use of BIS as a guide to the
      administration of inhaled anesthetic (sevoflurane or desflurane) compared with the use of
      hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) would affect the occurrence of
      implicit memory and /or dreams recall and 2) to check whether the occurrence of implicit
      memory and/or dreams recall is related with MAC (Minimal Alveolar Concentration) of
      inhalational anesthetics and/or preoperative anxiety levels.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Implicit memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Implicit memory will be investigated using free association test: patients, during maintenance of anesthesia, will listen a piece of one of two stories, &quot;Puss in Boots&quot; or &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, each followed by four keywords. Approximately 24 hours after surgery, patients will be asked to associate the first thing that comes to mind with these keywords in order to highlight the presence of implicit memory. The test will be repeated twice and will be positive if the patient will reply with the title of the story or a word of it.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dreams recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 5 minutes after awakening from anesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>A first interview about dreams recall will be carried out 5 minutes after awakening from anesthesia. Patients will be asked about dream content.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Explicit memory</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked about the last thing they remembered before going to sleep; the first thing they remember when they woke up; and anything which happen in between, including sounds, dreams and imagination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dreams recall</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 hours after anaesthesia</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked again about dreams recall. The content of dreams will be analyzed using the 5-point Likert scales which contains the following dreams characteristics: memory content, emotional content, emotional intensity, vivid description, amount of sounds, meaning, how much movement, strange, episodic content, references to episodes of life.</description>
