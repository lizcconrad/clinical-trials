  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that presents
      during childhood, and is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention
      and/or hyperactive-impulsive behavior. It is proposed that classical homeopathic treatment
      can reduce the symptoms of ADHD without serious side effects. This is an open label pilot
      feasibility study (36 participants). Participants, age 6-16, will consult with a homeopathic
      practitioner who will select treatments based on classical homeopathy principles. All
      participants will be assessed on a 4-weekly basis for a total of 36 weeks. The purpose of the
      study is to assess feasibility of recruitment and patient retention, to obtain pilot data on
      which to base a sample size calculation for future study, and to identify major safety
      concerns. The study will use single homeopathic medicines approved for over-the-counter use
      in Canada. The primary outcome measure will be the validated Conners 3rd Edition - Parent.
