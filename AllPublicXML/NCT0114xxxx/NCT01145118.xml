  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar Fasciitis (PF) is the most common foot condition treated by healthcare providers,
      striking approximately 2 million Americans each year. Nevertheless its causes are still not
      known. The risk factors for PF are known and the diagnosis, which is based on clinical
      assessment, is relatively simple. Still most of the treatments for PF focus on short term
      symptoms relief instead of prevention or reduction of recurrence.

      Physical therapy treatment that focuses on reducing the symptoms for the long run and
      prevention, should include outcome measures, which if found to be reliable, will make the
      diagnosis clearer. Diagnosis based on reliable clinical and functional measures will assist
      the physical therapist to understand the major deficiencies of the patient, and accordingly
      to help him to make the right decision in choosing treatment. Also comprehensive knowledge of
      the characteristics of PF may enable selection of appropriate preventive measures.

      Objectives:

      Characterize the unilateral PF syndrome using functional outcome measures, while comparing
      them to the healthy foot of the same patient. In addition the study will investigate the
      reliability of these functional outcome measures in PF patients.

      Methodology:

      Individuals referred to physiotherapy for PF will be assessed for eligibility and consent for
      the study. They will undergo two evaluations on the same week to evaluate the test- retest
      reliability of the functional measurements.
