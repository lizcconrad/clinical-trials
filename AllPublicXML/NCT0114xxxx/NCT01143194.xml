  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the dietary supplement oréVida™
      (active ingredient on the basis of a culinary herb)administered twice daily in an acute study
      on an improvement in vigilance, attention, concentration, memory and mood in 45 healthy men
      and pre-menopausal women, aged 35-50 years, inclusive.

      oréVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. We do not claim that
      this supplement is meant to treat any ailment.

          -  Subject is willing to refrain from vigorous physical activity 12 h prior to test days.

          -  Subject is a non-smoker.

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms providing informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a positive drug screening of amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             cannabis, cocaine, methamphetamines, methadone, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
             opiates or tricyclic antidepressants at screening.

          -  Subject has abnormal laboratory test results of clinical significance, including, but
             not limited to: creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL, or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) ≥1.5X the upper limit of normal at screening.
