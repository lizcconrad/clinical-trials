  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-man study of a novel investigational botanical drug complex, PUR 0110
      rectal enema, that has been shown to have potent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
      immunomodulatory effects following in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies, to assess the
      safety and tolerability of sequential single-ascending doses in normal healthy volunteers and
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). As a tertiary objective, the study will also
      investigate the presence of specific pharmacokinetic markers following the administration of
      single-dose PUR 0110 at each dose level.

      The study is designed as a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      sequential single-ascending dose, placebo-controlled safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic
      study of PUR 0110 rectal enema in 24 normal healthy male volunteers. Eligible subjects will
      be randomly assigned to 4 Cohorts of 6 subjects each to receive active drug (PUR 0110 Enema)
      or placebo enema as follows: 187.5 mg/60 g - Cohort 1, 375 mg/60 g - Cohort 2, 750 mg/60 g -
      Cohort 3 or 1500 mg/60 g - Cohort 4. Within each Cohort, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1
      ratio to receive either active treatment (PUR 0110 enema; n = 4) or placebo enema (n = 2).
      Each subject will receive only 1 dose of assigned study medication and dosing of subjects
      within each cohort will also be by sequential inclusion.

      Flexible sigmoidoscopy will be performed during the Screening Period within 72 to 48 hours
      pre-dose and within 9 +/- 1 hours post-dosing to visually examine the colonic mucosa for any
      signs of local toxicity and grade it as normal/abnormal; and 3 pinch biopsies will be
      obtained at each endoscopy at about the same level in the colon (&lt;50 cm from the anal verge)
      for histology. At the baseline flexible sigmoidoscopy, subjects must have normal colonic and
      rectal mucosa (i.e., no bleeding, inflammation, edema, ulceration or other abnormal finding)
      to be included in the study.
