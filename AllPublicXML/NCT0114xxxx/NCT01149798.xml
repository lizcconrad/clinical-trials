      This phase II trial on the assumption that abraxane and cisplatin combination therapy is
      efficacy in metastatic breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationales for the combination of Abraxane and cisplatin include that either drug has
      antitumor activity; they have different mechanisms; no cross-resistance are documented
      between them, and there have been some preclinical evidences indicating synergistic effects
      between the two agents. This phase II study will be undertaken to evaluate combination of
      cisplatin and weekly abraxane in terms of efficacy and safety in MBC patients.

             considered for study enrollment:

               1. Written informed consent prior to study specific screening procedures, with the
                  understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any
                  time without prejudice.

               2. At least one measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
                  (RECIST).

               3. Histopathologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer.

               4. Female at an age of ≥18 years.

               5. Prior taxane or platinum treatment allowed. However, the drug interval should be
                  longer than 12 months in adjuvant/neo-adjuvant setting and three months in MBC
                  patients who have obtained ORR with taxane- or platinum-containing regimens.

               6. The lab values within 2 weeks prior to trial should meet:

                    -  PLT ≥100,000/mm3

                    -  ANC≥2000/mm3

                    -  HB≥80g/L

                    -  Total bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal level（UNL, &lt; 1.5 x UNL for patients
                       with liver metastasis)

                    -  ALT/AST &lt; 1.5 x UNL (&lt; 2.5 x UNL for patients with liver metastasis)

                    -  AKP &lt; 5 x UNL (except for patients with bone metastasis)

                    -  Serum creatinine &lt; UNL

               7. ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

             prior to study treatment start.

         11. Significant medical condition that would make treatment or follow-up on this protocol
             difficult or problematic in the opinion of the treating oncologist.

         12. Concurrent other malignancy at other sites or previous other cancer within the last 5
