  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an observational, single arm, multicentric study conducted for the adjustment of
      treatment strategy and its monitoring using high-frequency and high-dosage administration of
      interferon-beta (Rebif) in MS subjects. Study focussed on assessment of the effectiveness and
      safety of existing immunomodulatory basis therapy in MS subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of MS, which progresses to attacks or episodes, with interferon-beta has
      established itself as therapy of the first choice. On the basis of different studies, the
      hypothesis was substantiated that the effectiveness is dependent on dose and application
      frequency. These realizations justify the use of high-dose interferon-beta not only in
      subjects in the initial stages of disease, but also in those subjects, who have a progressing
      disease activity even in the advanced stage, if other therapies fail. For achieving maximum
      benefit for the subject, an optimum therapy is imperative. The therapy plan (Immunomodulatory
      Therapy) of &quot;MS Therapy Consensus Group&quot; (MSTKG) is being widely used. In the article:
      &quot;Optimising lmmunomodulatory Therapy for MS Patients&quot; that appeared in the &quot;International
      Journal of MS care&quot; in the year 2002, a simple 9-scale model&quot; is proposed that defines four
      areas respectively: not conspicuous, conspicuous, alarming and measures are necessary, in the
      three areas: attacks/episodes, disease progression and magnetic resonance tomography (MRT).
      The modification of an existing therapy, such as modifying the application plan, increasing
      the dosage, or substance change is recommended, if 'conspicuousness' is shown in all three
      areas, two areas are shown as 'alarming' or an area is shown as 'action necessary'. The
      decision for a therapy adjustment with the help of the &quot;three scale model&quot; should not happen
      solely on the results of the MRT. The model in the study involved attack or episode
      pertaining to: frequency, degree of severity, ability of involution and the response to a
      cortisone pulse therapy.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess the effectiveness and safety of existing immunomodulatory basis therapy in MS
           subjects

        -  To identify candidates suitable for possible therapy adjustment
