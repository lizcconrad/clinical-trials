  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive
      predictive value of the OSNA Breast Cancer System for patients receiving Sentinel Lymph Node
      biopsies after receiving neoadjuvant hormonal/chemotherapy as compared to permanent section
      Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and Immuno-histochemistry (IHC) staining.

    <description>For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The OSNA Breast Cancer System is an automated semi-quantitative, in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid detection of greater than (&gt;) 0.2 mm metastases in nodal tissue removed from sentinel lymph node biopsies of breast cancer patients. Results from the assay can be used to guide the intra-operative or post-operative decision to remove additional lymph nodes and to aid in patient staging. An assay positive + or ++ result indicates the presence of metastasis (&gt; 0.2 mm). An assay positive ++ result predicts the presence of macrometastasis (&gt; 2 mm).
Post-operative histological evaluation of permanent sections of the tissue specimen, in accordance with usual diagnostic practice and using the Sysmex lymph node cutting scheme, is required.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Diagnosed pre‐surgically with T1‐T3 or T4 non‐inflammatory breast cancer, clinically
             node positive or node negative upon clinical examination

          -  Scheduled for SLN biopsy after receiving neoadjuvant hormonal or chemotherapy

          -  Subjects (or the subjects' legal representatives) who have read, understood (to the
             best of their ability) and signed the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant subjects, confirmed by interview with either subject or treating physician

          -  Subjects previously diagnosed with other invasive cancer. Subjects with skin cancer
             (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) may be included, except for subjects
             diagnosed with melanoma

          -  Participation in other neoadjuvant protocols specifically requiring SLN biopsy prior
             to administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy

          -  Subjects who have been judged to be an inappropriate candidate by any medical care
             provider (e.g., surgeon, oncologist or pathologist).
