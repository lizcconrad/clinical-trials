  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether noninvasive brain stimulation associated
      with motor learning offers an additional benefit than motor learning alone in patients with
      stroke.

      The investigators hypothesis is that active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      combined with constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) will induce a greater motor function
      improvement as compared with sham tDCS combined with CIMT.

      In this 3 experiments study we will evaluate the effect of tDCS and constraint induced
      movement therapy (CIMT) in stroke patients (exp 1) as well as in healthy subjects (control
      population - exp 2). Finally we will investigate the effect of tACS - transcranial
      alternating current stimulation - as an alternative to tDCS, on motor function in healthy
      subjects (exp 3). The two experiments on tDCS are parallels (exp 1 &amp; 2), while the experiment
      on tACS uses a crossover design (exp 3).

      For stroke patients (Exp1), our primary outcome measure is a clinical scale (Jebsen-Taylor
      Hand Function Test), while for healthy subjects (Exp 2) we investigate the effect of tDCS and
      CIMIT on cortico-spinal excitability using TMS - transcranial magnetic stimulation. Finally,
      for the third experiment using tACS, our primary outcome is cortical oscillation, as measured
      by EEG - electroencephalogram.

    <description>Motor evoked potential (MEP) Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), MEP were recorded before and after tDCS (both active and sham).
The percentage of change in MEP (post versus pre intervention) between the two groups (active and sham) were used for the comparison.</description>

    <measure>Cortical Oscillations - EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Recording took place in a dim-lighted room set up with acoustic and electric isolation. EEG was acquired from 64-channels HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesic Inc., Eugene, OH) and recorded using Net Station running on a MacIntosh G4 computer. Alpha power were used as the main outcome measure. The difference values (e.g., post minus pre tACS) were used for the analysis. The alpha frequency is a brain oscillation that takes place especially when subjects are in a relaxed state, especially eyes closed. In the motor cortex, a decrease in alpha power has been seen during motor performance. Therefore, it could be speculated that a decrease in power in this study would indicate more engagement in motor cortex during the motor performance.</description>

        <title>Cortical Oscillations - EEG</title>
        <description>Recording took place in a dim-lighted room set up with acoustic and electric isolation. EEG was acquired from 64-channels HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (Electrical Geodesic Inc., Eugene, OH) and recorded using Net Station running on a MacIntosh G4 computer. Alpha power were used as the main outcome measure. The difference values (e.g., post minus pre tACS) were used for the analysis. The alpha frequency is a brain oscillation that takes place especially when subjects are in a relaxed state, especially eyes closed. In the motor cortex, a decrease in alpha power has been seen during motor performance. Therefore, it could be speculated that a decrease in power in this study would indicate more engagement in motor cortex during the motor performance.</description>
