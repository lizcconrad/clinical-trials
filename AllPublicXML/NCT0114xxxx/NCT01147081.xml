      At enrolment, subjects were stratified into two age strata (18 to 60 years, over 60 years).
      Total duration of the study is three weeks. Vaccinations were to be administered on day 1.
      Blood samples were collected at day 1 (baseline, before the vaccination) and at day 22 (three
      weeks after the vaccination). Sera were tested by Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay.
      Safety was assessed until 3 weeks after the vaccination.

             clinical judgment of the investigator.

        Written informed consent must be obtained for all the subjects before enrollment into the
        study after the nature of the study has been explained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals with behavioral or cognitive impairment or psychiatric disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to
             participate in the study;

          2. Individuals with any serious chronic or acute disease (in the judgment of the
             investigator), including but not limited to:

               1. Cancer, except for localized skin cancer;

               2. Advanced congestive heart failure;

               3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);

               4. Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis);

               5. Acute or progressive hepatic disease;

               6. Acute or progressive renal disease;

          3. Individuals with history of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction
             following a vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study
             vaccine (e.g. to ovalbumin, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral
             protein, Polymyxin B;

          4. Individuals with known or suspected (or have a high risk of developing)
             impairment/alteration of immune function (excluding that normally associated with
             advanced age) resulting, for example, from:

               1. receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any parenteral or oral corticosteroid or
                  cancer chemotherapy/radiotherapy) within the past 60 days and for the full length
                  of the study;
