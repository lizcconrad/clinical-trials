    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, also work in different ways to kill tumor cells or stop them from growing.
      Giving bevacizumab together with temozolomide may be a better way to block tumor growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab and temozolomide
      together works in treating older patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme or
      gliosarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate overall survival in elderly subjects treated with bevacizumab and temozolomide
      for newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate 12-months survival. II. To estimate progression free survival for 2 years or
      until progression is detected.

      III. To investigate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab/temozolomide in elderly
      patient with glioblastoma.

      IV. To isolate DNA, RNA, and protein isolated from frozen and paraffinized archival tumor
      samples for evaluations such as immunohistochemical pathway profiling of VEGF-dependent
      angiogenic pathways, gene expression microarray, and MGMT promoter methylation status to
      define important molecule features of treatment response and especially age-related molecular
      expression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes every 2 weeks and oral temozolomide on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at least every 4 months.
