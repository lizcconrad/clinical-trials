      The primary objective is to determine the compared clinical efficacy of Lactase Eurofarma
      (test drug), showing non-inferiority to Lactaid® (comparative drug) in the supportive
      treatment of lactose intolerance and to assess the safety and tolerance of Lactase Eurofarma
      (test drug) in the supportive treatment of lactose intolerance.
