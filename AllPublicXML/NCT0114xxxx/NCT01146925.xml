  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the impact of CRMD-001 on markers of
      contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) in high-risk patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) undergoing coronary angiography and PCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate whether treatment with CRMD-001 (unique formulations of the iron
      chelator, Deferiprone) will reduce the incidence of AKI in subjects with CKD and additional
      risk factors. Adult subjects with moderate to severe CKD who are undergoing coronary
      angiography and PCI will be randomized to either placebo or CRMD-001 and followed for 90
      days. Subjects will receive 8 days of randomized therapy starting 1-3 hours prior to
      angiography. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the difference in mean paired change
      of a panel of sensitive renal biomarkers between the groups. Differences in renal or
      cardiovascular clinical events will also be evaluated.
