      This study will investigate the prevalence and extent of both metabolic and psychosocial
      changes associated with the menopause transition over 1 year among women with HIV compared to
      women without HIV of similar age, weight, menstrual status, and ethnic background. It is
      hypothesized that HIV positive women will demonstrate increased abdominal fat, abnormal
      cholesterol and blood sugar levels, reduced bone density, and greater psychosocial challenges
      than HIV negative women during the menopause transition.

      Treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in substantial
      improvement in survival among women living with HIV in the United States, many of whom have
      entered or will soon enter the menopause transition. Significant changes are seen across the
      menopause transition among women without HIV including increased abdominal fat and waist
      circumference, reduced muscle mass, and changes in lipids, glucose metabolism and bone
      density. HIV and potentially ART use have been associated with similar manifestations such as
      reduced bone density, changes in lipid and glucose metabolism, and body composition, though
      little is known regarding how the virus may influence or exacerbate such changes across the
      menopause transition. In addition to metabolic factors, menopause has been associated with
      changes in mood state, decreased quality of life, and presence of vasomotor symptoms among
      women without HIV. Psychosocial indices, such as depression and decreased quality of life are
      common among women with HIV, and may manifest or worsen during the menopause transition.
      However, research investigating the presence and acuity of these symptoms among women with
      HIV during menopause is limited.

        Female subjects in the perimenopausal transition will be recruited via referral by
        infectious disease providers, newspaper advertisement, posted flyers, community based
        programs at local AIDS Service Organizations and Partners subject recruitment broadcast at
        Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The HIV negative control subjects will be recruited
        through advertisements, flyers, and email announcements. Both HIV positive and negative
        subjects will be recruited from the same neighborhoods to ensure similar demographic
        characteristics.
