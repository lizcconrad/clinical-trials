      The purpose of this phase 1 study is to determine the relative bioavailability following
      single oral dose administration of LEO 27847 solution compared to LEO 27847 tablets in
      healthy male subjects as well as to determine the effect of food on the single oral dose
      pharmacokinetics of LEO 27847 tablets in healthy male subjects.
