    <textblock>
      The Smoking Termination Opportunity for inPatients, (STOP) project is designed to capture the
      opportunity that is provided by admission for acute smoking related illness, to assist
      patients through withdrawal by use of a combination of:

        -  the new medication Champix with

        -  best practice counselling

        -  initiated in an inpatient setting

      to achieve:

        -  sustained smoking abstinence

        -  reduced hospital bed and health service utilisation

        -  reduced inpatient smoking and craving prior to discharge

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A national standard in public hospitals for the management of smoking in patients admitted
      with smoking related acute illnesses is lacking. Where such patients have continued to smoke
      up until the time of admission, it can be assumed that &quot;primary&quot; prevention has failed.

      Once admitted, there is a vastly under-utilised opportunity, by use of a structured and
      systematic approach, to intervene with a secondary prevention attempt. This takes advantage
      of the synergy of:

        1. the smoker is a &quot;captive audience&quot; and may be receptive to considering lifestyle factors
           that have lead to the admission, and

        2. best practice medication and counselling can be initiated prior to discharge. If proven
           to be cost-effective in our analysis, a systematic roll-out of this secondary prevention
           initiative would be advocated. ie translation of research into practice.

    <description>Reduced health care costs with greater economic value will be relative to other health interventions. Four seperate economic models will be built for vascular diseases: cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular diseases and airways diseases: asthma and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Each model will compare outcomes and costs for varenicline and counselling compared to counselling alone, and will incorporate epidemiological data on natural disease progression of smokers and previous smokers from the four disease profiles split by gender if indicated.</description>
