  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare the effectiveness of standard on-site, in-person
      counseling with Internet web-based videoconferencing (e-therapy) in drug-dependent patients
      in opioid-agonist treatment programs. The study is looking to see if there are any
      differences in satisfaction or in treatment outcome if counseling sessions are given by
      e-therapy compared to standard, in-person counseling given in the clinic. The e-therapy
      happens in real time- it works very much like standard therapy in the clinic except that the
      patient is in his or her own home (or other convenient location outside the clinic) and talks
      to and sees the therapist through an Internet connection on the computer (the therapist will
      usually be at the clinic).

      This study will be the first to evaluate the efficacy of an accredited and currently
      available, Internet web-based videoconferencing platform to deliver routine schedules of
      counseling in an opioid agonist treatment program. It has outstanding potential to help
      determine transportability of this technology to other treatment programs by demonstrating
      the benefits of integration of web-based therapy with on-site services to expand the
      continuum of care.
