  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women between the ages of 18 and 45 are needed for a study that looks at the effect of
      calcium supplementation on bone health during pregnancy in black and white women. Study
      subjects will be divided into two groups. Each group will take 2 study supplements each day,
      the supplement will be calcium or placebo (a pill without calcium). The study involves five
      visits to the Children's Hospital of Oakland Research Institute; each visit will be 1-2 hours
      in length. There are 3 study visits during pregnancy and 2 in the first year after delivery.
      At each visit you will have your blood drawn and be asked questions about what you eat and
      what type of activities you do. At visit 16 and 36 weeks and 4 and 12 months postpartum you
      will have your bone density measured. You will be paid $240 for completing the study.
