  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the diagnosis of celiac disease on
      general health, healthcare resource utilization, quality of life and lifestyle. We
      hypothesize that diagnosis and subsequent dietary treatment may have positive impact on these
      variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All new members with biopsy-proven celiac disease joining the Finnish Celiac Society will be
      categorized in three groups according to symptoms and signs leading to the diagnosis as
      classical symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms and screen-detected, the latest being further
      divided to those presenting with symptoms and those who are totally asymptomatic. Several
      parameters assessing general health and well-being, quality of life and healthcare resource
      utilization are evaluated at baseline and after one and five years on trial. Quality of life
      is compared to that of non-celiac controls.
