      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of Cabazitaxel when
           administered to advanced solid tumor patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of Cabazitaxel in patients with varying degrees
           of hepatic impairment

        -  To correlate PK variables with pharmacodynamic (PD) safety parameters in order to guide
           prescribers with regard to dosing in this patient population

        -  To assess the effect of cabazitaxel at recommended dose of 25mg/m^2 on CYP3A enzyme
           activity using midazolam as probe in an additional cohort of cancer patients with normal
           hepatic function.

  <detailed_description>

      The study consists of:

        -  a screening phase (maximum length of 21-day).

        -  a treatment phase with 21-day study treatment cycles. Cycle lengths may be extended up
           to maximum of 12 additional days in case of unresolved toxicity.

      Patients continue to receive treatment until they experience, unacceptable toxicities/AEs,
      disease progression ,withdraw their consent, or the investigator decides to discontinue the
      patient, or study cut-off, whichever comes first.

        -  a 30-day follow-up visit after the last dose of study medication.

      The cut off date is when the last patient treated has completed cycle 1 and the subsequent 30
      days follow-up.

      Patients may continue to be treated as long as they are benefiting from study treatment and
      have not met study withdrawal criteria.
