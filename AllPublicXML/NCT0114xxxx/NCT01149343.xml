  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to examine the safety, immunogenicity and clinical
      activity of the immunotherapeutic product GSK2302025A (also referred to as recPRAME + AS15
      Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic [ASCI]) administered as a first line treatment in
      patients with unresectable and progressive metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, patients were to receive a maximum of 24 doses of recMAGE-A3 + AS15 according
      to four cycles over a period of four years. An active follow-phase (up to five years after
      registration into the study) was planned for all patients.

      This protocol summary has been impacted by protocol amendment 3, so there will no longer be
      an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion of the study treatment.
      The study will end approximately 30 days after the last dose will be administered.

      In addition, no more biological samples will be collected for protocol research purposes. For
      each biological sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet,
      testing will not be performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant.

      Sampling for safety monitoring as per protocol will continue.

             CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies for metastatic disease.

          2. The patient is scheduled to receive any other anticancer treatment, including but not
             limited to (bio)-chemotherapeutic or immunomodulating agents and radiotherapy.

          3. The patient has received any cancer immunotherapy containing the PRAME antigen or any
             cancer immunotherapy for his/her metastatic disease.

          4. The patient requires concomitant treatment (more than 7 consecutive days) with
             systemic corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive agents.

          5. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study product within the 30 days preceding the first ASCI dose injection or planned
             use during the study period

          6. The patient has (had) previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites (including
             carcinoma in situ), except effectively treated non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma
             in situ of the cervix or effectively treated malignancy that has been in remission for
             over 5 years and is highly likely to have been cured.

          7. The patient has an allergy to any component of the study investigational product or
             has a history of previous allergic reactions to vaccinations.

          8. The patient has a history of confirmed adrenal dysfunction.

          9. The patient has an autoimmune disease such as, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis,
             lupus, and inflammatory bowel disease.

         10. The patient is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

         11. The patient has an uncontrolled bleeding disorder.

         12. The patient has a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

         13. The patient has psychiatric or addictive disorders that may compromise his/her ability
             to give informed consent or to comply with the trial procedures.

         14. The patient has other concurrent severe medical problems, unrelated to the malignancy,
             that would significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to
             unacceptable risk.

         15. For female patients: the patient is pregnant or lactating.
