  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists in only one treatment group, which will receive the first-line therapy for
      the disease - standard radiotherapy and a 150 mg/m2 dose of the investigational product
      (nimotuzumab)

      General Purpose

      1. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment with nimotuzumab in combination
      with radiotherapy in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic astrocytic of the brainstem
      glioma

      Specific Purposes

        1. To determine the efficacy regarding the event-free survival (EFS) rate by 6 months of
           treatment.

        2. To determine the overall survival time of the patients with diffuse intrinsic astrocytic
           tumors of the cerebral trunk treated with combined radiotherapy and nimotuzumab.

        3. To determine the antitumoral objective response of the patients treated with combined
           radiotherapy and nimotuzumab.

        4. To determine the duration time of the response in the cases of objective response
           reached (CR or PR) or disease stabilization.

        5. To assess the toxicity of the combination AcM h-R3-nimotuzumab and radiotherapy in the
           patients enrolled in the clinical study.

    <description>A Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used for measuring the tumor volume and it will be performed before the enrollment in the clinical study and every 12 weeks. The patient follow-up will be performed for 2 years after his/her inclusion in the investigation. The final evaluation will be performed 2 years after the inclusion of the last patient.
The main response variable will be the progression-free survival by 6 months.</description>

    <description>The patients will receive the induction therapy for 12 weeks. If the patient reaches a complete, partial response (CR, PR) to the treatment or is at least evaluated as stable disease (SD) on week 12, the consolidation therapy should be initiated. The consolidation therapy will consist of the nimotuzumab administration, every 2 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas, documented by standard
             imaging techniques (MRI). Note: Tumor biopsy and histological confirmation are not
             required in this study.

          2. Patients eligible for radiotherapy with Cobalt60. The patients should not have
             received a previous specific oncological treatment.

          3. Aged &gt; 3 years old &lt; 18 years old

          4. Patients with measurable lesions, defined as those that can be accurately measured in
             at least 2 dimensions (the 2 largest perpendicular diameters), using standard
             techniques (MRI).

          5. Female patients with childbearing potential should present a negative pregnancy test
             and adopt effective birth control methods, in case they are sexually active.

          6. Male patients who can father a child should adopt effective birth control methods, in
             case they are sexually active.

          7. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks
