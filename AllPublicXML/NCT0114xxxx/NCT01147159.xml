  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allergen extracts are complex mixtures of proteins and contain varying amounts of allergenic
      and non-allergenic components. Many factors such as the biovariability, differences in
      extraction process and subsequent handling of allergens can affect the final composition,
      potency, and stability of allergen preparations. Genetic diversity of affected people adds
      another level of complexity. In order to control variability and to achieve consistency and
      reproducibility for optimal safety and sensitivity/specificity, it is essential to
      standardize the amount of allergen used in prick tests. Therefore, the system for biological
      standardization mainly used in Europe still is the biological calibration of in-House
      Reference Preparations (IHRP). The method has been adopted by the Nordic Council on Medicines
      as the Nordic Biological Unit, Histamine Equivalent Potency (HEP) or Skin Prick Test (SPT)
      value. The aim of this procedure is to estimate the biological activity of allergen extracts.
      The activity of an allergen extract is defined as 10,000 Diagnostic Biological Units (DBU)
      per ml (1 SPT per ml), when the extract provokes a specific skin reaction with a wheal of the
      same size as a wheal provoked by reference histamine at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, when
      both solutions are administrated using the same technique (prick testing) on at least 20
      individuals who are clinically allergic and cutaneously reactive to the allergen concerned.

      The present study aims to standardize the allergen extracts of Betula pendula, Phleum
      pratense and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus by using this method.
