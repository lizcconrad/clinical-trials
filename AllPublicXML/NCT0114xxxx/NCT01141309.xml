  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of
      sorafenib and everolimus will have on your thyroid cancer. Treatment guidelines from the
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network include sorafenib as a treatment option for thyroid
      cancer. Sorafenib is pill that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of kidney and liver
      cancers. Sorafenib may work in many different ways. It helps decrease the blood supply to
      tumors. By doing so, it may limit the tumor's source of oxygen and nutrients and prevent the
      tumor from growing. Everolimus is an oral medication that is FDA approved for the treatment
      of kidney cancer. It inhibits a protein kinase called mTOR (&quot;mammalian Target of Rapamycin&quot;).
      In laboratory studies, the addition of everolimus to sorafenib works better than sorafenib
      alone. These two drugs are being used together to treat other types of cancer in other
      clinical studies. In addition, the cancer will be evaluated to help us find factors that can
      help predict who would benefit most from this combination of drugs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histopathologically confirmed at MSKCC thyroid carcinoma.

          -  Patient must agree to allow 2 biopsies of any malignant lesion that can be accessed by
             ultrasound (e.g., cervical lymph node, peripheral nodule) or without the aid of
             radiology (i.e., skin lesion)

             progressed by RECIST criteria after the completion of radiation therapy and is still
             FDG-avid). FDG-avidity will be defined as any focus of increased FDG uptake greater
             than normal activity with SUV maximum levels greater than or equal to 3. PET scan can
             have been done at any time prior to the start of therapy, although it is recommended
             that it be done within 3 months prior to the start of therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria, defined as at least one
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to

             scan; performed ≤ 4 weeks of protocol start date.

          -  Patients must have progressive disease defined by at least one of the following

          -  Patients may have received prior external beam radiation therapy to index lesions ≥ 4
             weeks prior to initiation of therapy on this protocol if there has been documented
