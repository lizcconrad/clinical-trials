    <textblock>
      This is an evaluative, monocentric study in patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and
      left bundle branch block who received an ICD-CRT. It is an early investigation on the safety
      and effects of a single administration of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells after
      implantation of an ICD-CRT device as an adjunct to CRT and usual drug treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt;35 %) in chronic ischemic
             heart disease and asynchronic contraction with indication for a biventricular
             stimulation (CRT, chronic resynchronization therapy), who do not have an improvement
             of &gt;15% of LVEF 3 months after CRT-device implantation

          -  wall motion dysfunction of any territory

          -  left bundle branch block

          -  Patients were on individual optimal treatment for chronic ischemic heart disease with
             one or a combination of the following drug types: diuretics, ÃŸ-blockers,
             ACE-inhibitors, AT1 blockers and/or lipid lowering agents for at least 30 days before
             CRT Implantation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with left ventricular dysfunction due to other reasons than ischemic
             cardiomyopathy, e.g. hypertension, dilatative cardiomyopathy

          -  with relevant valvular disease;

          -  Aneurysma of the anterior myocardial wall or myocardial wall thickness of &lt; 5 mm,

          -  with overt heart failure, other than ischemic cardiomyopathy,

          -  with history of stroke and/or transient ischemic attack (TIA),

          -  with history of thromboembolic event (e.g. phlebothrombosis, pulmonary embolism),
             bleeding disorders and known disease of the coagulation system;

          -  with extensive deviations of baseline laboratory values and significant findings at
             physical examination which in the opinion of the investigator may worsen under
             treatment;

          -  with severe systemic disease - (e.g. known or suspected anaphylaxia, intolerance
             against X-ray or contrast agent and, pre-malignant and malignant disease)

          -  atrial fibrillation with average heart rate &gt;70 bpm

          -  pregnant women and women of childbearing potential who have not had a negative
             pregnancy test within 48 hours before treatment;

          -  with any disease or condition that seriously compromises the function of other body
             systems than the heart and/or might interfere with conduct of the study and
             interpretation of the results;

          -  patients with a chronic or acute HIV-, HBV-, HCV-infection;

          -  improvement of more than 15% of LVEF 3 months after CRT-device implantation

          -  patients who have a ICD Implantation for secondary prophylactic indication. These
             patients show a history of resuscitation, VT or syncope.

          -  patients who are currently participating in another investigational drug or device
             study
