    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well paclitaxel with or without cixutumumab works
      in treating patients with esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer that has
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cixutumumab may
      kill cancer cells by blocking the action of a protein needed for cancer cell growth. Giving
      paclitaxel with or without cixutumumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of paclitaxel plus cixutumumab (IMC-A12) versus
      paclitaxel alone as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic esophagus or
      gastroesophageal (GE) junction cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall survival of paclitaxel plus cixutumumab (IMC-A12) versus
      paclitaxel alone in this patient population.

      II. To evaluate the response rate of paclitaxel plus cixutumumab (IMC-A12) versus paclitaxel
      alone in this patient population.

      III. To evaluate the toxicity of cixutumumab (IMC-A12) plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel
      alone in this patient population.

      IV. Exploratory analyses will assess potentially relevant cixutumumab (IMC-A12)
      pharmacodynamic biomarkers obtained from serum samples, including but not limited to,
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein
      (IGFBP)-2, and IGFBP-3.

      OUTLINE: Patients are equally randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour at a dose of 80 mg/m^2 on
      days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 day cycle.

      ARM II: Patients receive cixutumumab IV over 1 hour at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of
      every 28 day cycle and paclitaxel as in Arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.

    <time_frame>assessed every 3 months for 2 years after registration</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death without evidence of progression. For cases without documentation of progression, follow-up was censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurred within a short period of time (4 months) following the date last known progression-free, in which case the death was counted as an event, or in the case of death within 4 months of randomization in the absence of disease evaluation before that time. PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 90% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula, and compared by the log rank test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed every 3 months for 2 years after registration</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization until death (event), or censored at last date known alive. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 90% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula, and compared by the log rank test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed every 8 weeks while on treatment and every 3 months after treatment for 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as number of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by all eligible patients. Responses are evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline. CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is defined as disappearance of target lesions or at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>

             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients must have measurable disease

          -  Patients must have metastatic disease of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction

               -  Histologic, cytologic or radiologic documentation of metastatic squamous cell
                  carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction;

                  locally residual (post-resection) disease is also permitted

               -  For the purposes of this study, undifferentiated adenocarcinomas and
                  adenosquamous tumors will be considered as adenocarcinomas; in addition, tumors
                  involving the gastroesophageal junction will be defined by the Siewert
                  classification

          -  Patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors who are eligible:

               -  Adenocarcinoma of the esophageal junction (AEG) Type I: adenocarcinoma of the
                  distal esophagus which usually arises from an area with specialized intestinal
                  metaplasia of the esophagus, i.e., Barrett's esophagus, and may infiltrate the
                  esophagogastric junction from above

               -  AEG Type II: true carcinoma of the cardia arising from the cardiac epithelium or

          -  Patients must have received and progressed on one and only one line of prior systemic
             therapy for esophagus or esophagogastric cancer; this could have included one regimen
             for metastatic disease, or one regimen with radiotherapy for initially locally
             advanced disease; prior radiation therapy is permitted

               -  If patients progress or recur within 6 months of neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy,
                  this will be considered one line of therapy; for patients progressing or
                  recurring more than 6 months after neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, they will need
                  to receive one line of therapy for recurrent disease to be eligible

               -  If patients receive one regimen in which a chemotherapy agent is dropped for
                  toxicity without progression, this treatment will be considered one line of
                  therapy; however, substitution or addition of a new agent will be considered a
                  second line of therapy

        <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death without evidence of progression. For cases without documentation of progression, follow-up was censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurred within a short period of time (4 months) following the date last known progression-free, in which case the death was counted as an event, or in the case of death within 4 months of randomization in the absence of disease evaluation before that time. PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with 90% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood’s formula, and compared by the log rank test.</description>

Responses are evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline.

PR is defined as disappearance of target lesions or at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), and persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</description>
