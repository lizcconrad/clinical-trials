  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is characterizing the pharmacokinetics of vincristine using two different cohorts
      of patients. The first cohort includes patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that
      are Bcr-Abl positive. This cohort of patients will receive vincristine along with imatinib in
      the induction chemotherapy regimen. The second cohort includes patients with ALL that are
      Bcr-Abl negative. This cohort of patients will receive vincristine without imatinib in the
      induction chemotherapy regimen. This study involves blood draws beginning on day 7 of the
      treatment protocol and these samples will be analyzed for pharmacokinetic parameters.

      Imatinib and vincristine are both metabolized by the hepatic CYP 450 enzyme system. Imatinib
      is an inhibitor of the system and co-administration of imatinib and vincristine has the
      potential to increase the blood level of vincristine. This could explain the increased level
      of neurotoxicity that is currently being seen with the co-administration of these two agents
      in the treatment of Bcr-Abl positive ALL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years

          -  New Diagnosis of Bcr-Abl positive ALL or Bcr-Abl negative ALL

          -  Receiving induction chemotherapy with the standard Princess Margaret Hospital modified
             DFCI protocol
