      The purpose of this study is to

        1. better characterize the short term and long term natural history of hereditary
           spherocytosis (HS) including diagnosis, complications, and indications for and response
           to splenectomy

        2. evaluate and describe the health-related quality of life in children with HS.

    <textblock>
      Patients with a new or established diagnosis of HS seen at Children's Medical Center will be
      asked to enroll in the study. Previous and current medical records will be reviewed to
      systematically catalogue their history of HS, including diagnosis, complications,
      hospitalizations, medications and laboratory data. Health-related quality of life
      questionnaires will be given to the patients and their parents at enrollment and periodically
      during the follow-up. Those who agree will have up to three small samples of blood collected
      and frozen for future laboratory studies of complications associated with HS and/or
      splenectomy.

      We anticipate enrolling approximately 200 children and young adults with HS in this study and
      following them until adulthood (age 18-21 years).
