    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of home-based measurement of walking
      capacity in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) patients, uing the Global Positioning System
      (GPS). This study should state if the GPS technique could be used in clinical routine in
      order to assess walking capacity in PAD patients. Patients will be assessed a first time
      (test 1) and six months later (test 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of walking capacity in PAD patients is an important step in the management of
      such patients. The gold standard method to assess this walking capacity is the measurement of
      the maximal walking distance on a treadmill. However, treadmill measurement are not readily
      accessible and the relationship with free-living walking capacity is, although not well
      known, weak. A novel approach was developed using a Global Positioning System in order to
      assess community-based walking capacity. This method showed interesting results, validating
      the technique, but was limited to one laboratory and to the place where the measurements were
      performed. The next step is therefore to assess the feasibility of home-based measurement of
      walking capacity using the GPS technique, through a multicenter study regrouping university
      hospitals, independent vascular specialists (angiologists) and private clinic(s).

    <description>Home-based GPS recording(s) of walking capacity in PAD patients. Two evaluations will be performed. The second evaluation will be performed six months after the initial assessment (test 1) and only for patients with GPS maximal walking distance below 2000 meters at test 1. It is expected that some patients at test 2 will have undergo surgery or endovascular treatment.</description>
