  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to compare 2 treatment regimens for patients suffering from
      choroidal neovascularisation secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The first
      treatment regimen was the approved AMD treatment of 1 injection each month for 3 months and
      than re-treatment of patients who have a visual loss of more than 5 letters with monthly
      control (Treat and Observe). The second treatment regimen was 1 injection each month for 3
      months and than extending the control period if the macula is dry during the monthly control
      (Treat and Extend). If the &quot;Treat and Extend&quot; regimen is found effective and safe, the number
      of ranibizumab injections, the number of patient visits, the risk of adverse events due to
      the intravitreal injections, and policlinic occupation number could all be reduced.

    <measure>Change in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (logMAR) From Baseline to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed in the study eye. BCVA measurements were made using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity testing charts. Each letter on the chart has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there are 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR chart represents a change of 0.1 log units. The formula for calculating the logMAR BCVA score is: 0.1 + logMAR value of the best line read - 0.02 x number of letters read. A lower BCVA score indicates better vision. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Visits 2, 6, 9, 12, and 15 (up to 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) was used to measure a patient's subjective assessment of vision-related quality of life at Visits 2, 6, 9, 12, and 15. The 12 subscales in the VFQ-25 are general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social function, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The scores on the subscales were added together for a total score, which ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score indicated poorer function.</description>

        <title>Change in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (logMAR) From Baseline to Month 12</title>
        <description>Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assessed in the study eye. BCVA measurements were made using the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity testing charts. Each letter on the chart has a score value of 0.02 log units. Since there are 5 letters per line, the total score for a line on the logMAR chart represents a change of 0.1 log units. The formula for calculating the logMAR BCVA score is: 0.1 + logMAR value of the best line read - 0.02 x number of letters read. A lower BCVA score indicates better vision. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life</title>
        <description>The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI-VFQ-25) was used to measure a patient’s subjective assessment of vision-related quality of life at Visits 2, 6, 9, 12, and 15. The 12 subscales in the VFQ-25 are general health, general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social function, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, and peripheral vision. The scores on the subscales were added together for a total score, which ranged from 0 to 100. A higher score indicated poorer function.</description>
