  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether magnesium sulfate has a
      clinically important effect on the amplitude and latency of somatosensory and motor evoked
      potentials in patients undergoing surgical correction of idiopathic scoliosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor and somatosensory evoked potentials are continuously monitored in the setting of
      scoliosis surgery to evaluate the integrity of spinal cord pathways. Detection of neural
      irritation or injury using motor or somatosensory evoked potentials allows the surgeon to
      modify technique to reverse the insult and proceed without spinal cord compromise. To
      facilitate evoked potential monitoring, anesthetic agents that attenuate the evoked responses
      must be avoided.Several different agents have been studied to try to diminish the acute
      opioid tolerance and/or hyperalgesia seen with remifentanil.

      Two studies investigated the effect of magnesium sulfate on intraoperative
      remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia. In both studies, post-operative pain scores and opioid
      consumption were decreased in those patients who received magnesium.

      Our aim is to establish that magnesium sulfate does not adversely affect somatosensory evoked
      potentials (SEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in patients undergoing correction of
      idiopathic scoliosis. Future clinical trials can then be performed investigating the effect
      of magnesium sulfate on remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia in the same population.

    <description>Cortical SEPs will be measured from Cz-Fpz or Ci-Cc (10-20 system of head measurement) and the amplitudes will be taken from the first positive deflection to first negative deflection (P1-N1) after supramaximal stimulation of the posterior tibial nerves at the medial malleolus. The MEP peak-to-peak amplitudes will be measured from left and right tibialis anterior and abductor hallucis muscles. Stimulation parameters will be varied in order to achieve the maximum amplitude values. Evoked potentials will be measured before and at 10 and 30 minutes after the start of the magnesium infusion.</description>

    <description>The study will be conducted in the 45 minute interval between the completion of spinal instrumentation and the completion of skin closure. Once the spinal instrumentation is complete and the integrity of the spinal cord pathways is confirmed using SEPs and MEPs, magnesium will be administered for the remainder of surgery.</description>
