      This research proposal is intended to elucidate the efficacy and mechanisms underlying
      Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) in a population in remission from recurrent Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD). The first objective of the study is to replicate previous studies'
      findings of MBCT's effects on decreasing depressive symptoms and depression relapse rates.
      However, this proposal aims to make a novel contribution to the literature by using a
      randomized, controlled design, and comparing the effects of MBCT to an active control
      condition (ACC). The use of a well-designed ACC will enable us to control for confounding
      variables such as social support and expected outcomes, thus allowing us to determine whether
      elements specific to MBCT lead to its salutary effects (Aim 1). Previous MBCT studies have
      largely relied on self-report measurement methodologies, limiting valid conclusions about the
      nature of MBCT. Further, few studies have examined the mechanisms underlying effects of MBCT
      on depressive symptoms and relapse. Theoretical considerations and preliminary empirical
      evidence suggest emotional, physiological, and cognitive functioning to be promising
      mechanisms of MBCT. Therefore, the investigators propose to assess each of these potential
      mechanisms of MBCT using self-report, autonomic physiological, and reaction time tasks (Aim
      2). Collectively, these aims are expected to strengthen the evidence base for MBCT while
      cultivating a scientific model for its effects and mechanisms on decreasing depressive
      symptoms and depression relapse rates.
