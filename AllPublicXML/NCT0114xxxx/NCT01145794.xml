  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high prevalence of smoking in adults in many developing countries (e.g. in China, 61%
      among men and 7% among women) results in many children being exposed to secondhand smoke
      (SHS). Although in 2001 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended the promotion of
      proper smoking hygiene, (i.e. smoking away from the immediate environment of infants and
      children), similar recommendations in many developing countries are either scarce or
      non-existent. We hypothesize that implementation of a package of smoking hygiene intervention
      measures delivered by community health workers (CHWs) will reduce Chinese children's exposure
      to SHS and improve their respiratory health.

    <description>The main outcome measures are: improvement of smoking hygiene practices within the household as reported by the subjects (i.e. reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked indoors at home while a child was present during the previous week) and reduction in children's cotinine concentrations in urine at 6- month follow up.</description>

    <description>The intervention, SHI, will address SHS and quitting. It will include behavioral counseling to address health hazards of SHS for children, brief advice to quit and to adopt a no smoking policy around children and self-help materials (related to second hand smoking).</description>
