  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized fixed-flexible dose long-term study of asenapine in
      participants with schizophrenia. The first six weeks of the study will be double-blind and
      the remainder of the study will be open label. Participants in this study consist of
      participants who have completed the preceding short-term study (P06124 [NCT01098110]), who
      meet the inclusion criteria and wish to continue receiving study drug, and whom the
      investigators have deemed eligible for study participation. Participants who were on placebo
      twice daily (BID) in core trial P06124 will get placebo for the first 2 weeks then 5 mg
      asenapine BID for the next 4 weeks of double blind treatment, and will be re-randomized after
      week 6 to asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg BID. Participants who were on asenapine 5 mg
      BID in core trial P06124 will be re-randomized after Week 6 to asenapine 5 mg BID or
      asenapine 10 mg BID. Participants who were on asenapine 10 mg BID in core trial P06124 will
      be re-randomized after Week 6 to asenapine 5 mg BID or asenapine 10 mg BID. After
      re-randomization, drug will be administered open-label for 46 weeks. During this period dose
      is flexible can be adjusted using dose options of 5 and 10 mg BID for efficacy and
      tolerability.

    <description>This measure reports the overall number of participants with any of a group of adverse events that were defined to represent extrapyramidal symptoms. The number of participants with each of the individual adverse events within this definition is also presented, for terms that occurred in at least one participant. For this measure, all adverse event terms within the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) for &quot;extrapyramidal syndrome&quot; were treated as extrapyramidal symptoms.</description>

    <description>Change in DIEPSS Total Score from preceding 6-week double-blind Study P06124 baseline to endpoint assessment of extension study P06125 was determined (calculated as endpoint value minus baseline value). Endpoint assessment was last evaluation of participant for this measure in study, whether participant completed or did not complete study. DIEPSS is a scale, rated by the investigator or rater appointed by the investigator, used to evaluate the severity of drug induced extrapyramidal symptoms occurring during antipsychotic drug treatment. It consists of 9 items: Items 1 through 8 assess individual symptoms; Item 9 is an assessment of global severity. Items 1 through 8 are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia. Each item is rated from 0 (none, normal) to 4 (severe). The Total Score is the sum of scores on Items 1 through 8, with a range from 0 (normal) to 32 (severe). Negative values of change from baseline represent improvement in symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 56 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious AE (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in death, is life-threatening, results in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. In addition, an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

        <title>Change From Study P06124 Baseline in Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) Total Score at Endpoint</title>
        <description>Change in DIEPSS Total Score from preceding 6-week double-blind Study P06124 baseline to endpoint assessment of extension study P06125 was determined (calculated as endpoint value minus baseline value). Endpoint assessment was last evaluation of participant for this measure in study, whether participant completed or did not complete study. DIEPSS is a scale, rated by the investigator or rater appointed by the investigator, used to evaluate the severity of drug induced extrapyramidal symptoms occurring during antipsychotic drug treatment. It consists of 9 items: Items 1 through 8 assess individual symptoms; Item 9 is an assessment of global severity. Items 1 through 8 are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia. Each item is rated from 0 (none, normal) to 4 (severe). The Total Score is the sum of scores on Items 1 through 8, with a range from 0 (normal) to 32 (severe). Negative values of change from baseline represent improvement in symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to study drug. A serious AE (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in death, is life-threatening, results in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. In addition, an important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.</description>

        <title>Median Time to Loss of Effect in Responders</title>
        <description>Median time to loss of effect from P06125 extension study baseline was estimated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Result reported in Responders, participants with ≥30% decrease from study P06124 baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS, schizophrenia symptom scale) Total Score at the end of study P06124. Investigator or subinvestigator was to determine whether the study drug failed to maintain effect based on occurrence of any of the following: 1) Increase in PANSS Total Score ≥30% from P06125 extension study baseline, 2) Determination that participant’s schizophrenic symptomatology had deteriorated requiring one or more of defined interventions (add new antipsychotic drug, increase in level of psychiatric outpatient care, or hospitalization/increase in level of hospitalization for psychiatric need), 3) Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) score ≥6, 4) Discontinuation from study because of lack of efficacy, 5) AE/SAE of worsening of schizophrenia.</description>
