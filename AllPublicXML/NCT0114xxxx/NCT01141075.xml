  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methylmalonic acidemia is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene for
      mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) or in one of the genes for
      adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl). Lack of these proteins causes toxic elevations of methylmalonic
      acid (MMacid) in blood, urine, and other tissues. A specific type of mutation, called a
      nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation, is the cause of the disease in approximately 5 to
      20% of patients with mutations in the MCM gene, and approximately 20 to &gt;50% of patients with
      mutations in one of the AdoCbl genes. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally delivered,
      investigational drug that acts to overcome the effects of the premature stop codon,
      potentially enabling the production of functional MCM/AdoCbl. This study is a Phase 2a trial
      evaluating the safety and activity of ataluren in patients with methylmalonic acidemia due to
      a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether ataluren can
      safely decrease MMacid levels.

      In this study, patients with methylmalonic acidemia due to a nonsense mutation will be
      administered an investigational drug called ataluren (PTC124). Evaluation procedures to
      determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within 14 days prior to the
      start of drug administration. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will then
      participate in 2 drug administration and follow-up periods. Within the first period, ataluren
      (PTC124) will be taken 3 times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 5 mg/kg (morning),
      5 mg/kg (midday) and 10 mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of approximately 21
      days without ataluren (PTC124). Within the second period, ataluren (PTC124) will be taken 3
      times per day with meals for 28 days at doses of 10 mg/kg (morning), 10 mg/kg (midday) and 20
      mg/kg (evening); there will then be an interval of approximately 14 days without ataluren
      (PTC124). During the study, ataluren (PTC124) activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be
      evaluated, and MMacid levels in blood and urine will be measured periodically.

    <description>Ataluren (PTC124) will be provided as a vanilla-flavored powder to be mixed with water. Ataluren (PTC124) will be taken 3 times per day, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. Ataluren (PTC124) will be taken at two different dose levels. In Cycle 1, the dose level is 5 mg/kg in the morning, 5 mg/kg at midday, and 10 mg/kg in the evening for 28 days. In Cycle 2, the dose level is 10 mg/kg in the morning, 10 mg/kg at midday, and 20 mg/kg in the evening for 28 days.</description>
