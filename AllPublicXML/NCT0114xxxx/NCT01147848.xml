    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted-mean 24 Hour Serial FEV1 on Day 168/Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 168/Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, and 30 minutes (min) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours, respectively, on Day 168/Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24-hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 168/Week 24 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was the pre-dose measurement on Day 1. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Time to Onset of Bronchodilator Effect at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of bronchodilator effect at Day 1 is defined as the actual time during the 4-hour serial FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) measurements that the participant first meets or exceeds a 12% and 200 mL increase over Baseline and was derived at Day 1 only. Time to onset was calculated over 0 to 4 hours (5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours) post-dose. Participants who never exceeded a 12% and 200 mL increase over Baseline were censored at the actual time of their last FEV1 measurement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Scores at Day 168</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The ACT is a 5-item questionnaire developed as a measure of the participant's asthma control. Questions are designed to be self-completed by the participant and include the following: In the past 4 weeks, &quot;How much of the time did your asthma keep you from getting as much done at work, school or at home?&quot;, &quot;How often have you had shortness of breath?&quot;, &quot;How often did your asthma symptoms wake you up at night or earlier than usual in the morning?&quot;, &quot;How often have you used your rescue inhaler or nebulizer medication (such as albuterol)?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your asthma control&quot;? The ACT total score is defined as the sum of the scores from all 5 questions, provided all questions have been answered; thus, the total score ranges from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma). A score of 20 or higher indicates well-controlled asthma. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 168 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Healthcare Contacts Related to Asthma or the Treatment of Asthma From Baseline to Day 168</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>All unscheduled asthma-related visits to a physician's office, visits to urgent care, visits to the emergency department, and hospitalizations (to the general ward [GW] or the intensive care unit [ICU]) that were associated with asthma exacerbations were recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Total Score for Participants 12 Years of Age and Older (AQLQ + 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life (QOL) questionnaire developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the QOL of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in four domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). The response format consists of a 7-point scale: a value of 1 indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;; a value of 7 indicates &quot;no impairment.&quot; The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions, provided at least 90% of the questions have been answered; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;) to 7 (indicates &quot;no impairment&quot;). Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 168 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline total AQLQ score, country, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With &quot;No Problems&quot; in the EQ-5D Descriptive System Dimensions at Day 168/Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168/Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, 2-part, self-assessment instrument, designed for self-completion, used to measure health outcome. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured by a three-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems and 3=severe problems). Respondents are asked to choose one level that reflects their &quot;own health state today&quot; for each of the five dimensions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Day 168</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, 2-part, self-assessment instrument, designed for self-completion, used to measure health outcome. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The second part is a 20 centimeter VAS that has endpoints labelled &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; anchored at 100 and 0, respectively. Participants were asked to indicate how they rate their own health by drawing a line from an anchor box to that point on the EQ-VAS that best represents their own health on that day. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline VAS score, country, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted-mean 24 Hour Serial FEV1 on Day 168/Week 24</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. The weighted mean was calculated from the pre-dose FEV1 and post-dose FEV1 measurements at 5, 15, and 30 minutes (min) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 12.5, 13, 14, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours, respectively, on Day 168/Week 24. Change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 24-hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 168/Week 24 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was the pre-dose measurement on Day 1. Analysis was performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <description>Time to onset of bronchodilator effect at Day 1 is defined as the actual time during the 4-hour serial FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) measurements that the participant first meets or exceeds a 12% and 200 mL increase over Baseline and was derived at Day 1 only. Time to onset was calculated over 0 to 4 hours (5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, and 4 hours) post-dose. Participants who never exceeded a 12% and 200 mL increase over Baseline were censored at the actual time of their last FEV1 measurement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Serial FEV1 Over 0-4 Hours Post First Dose (at Randomization)</title>
        <description>The weighted mean serial FEV1 (the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second) over 0-4 hours post-dose at Baseline was derived using actual times and using the pre-dose assessment as the 0 hour measurement. Change from Baseline was calculated as the weighted mean of the 4-hour serial FEV1 measures on Day 1 minus the Baseline value. Baseline was the pre-dose measurement on Day 1. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Test (ACT) Scores at Day 168</title>
        <description>The ACT is a 5-item questionnaire developed as a measure of the participant's asthma control. Questions are designed to be self-completed by the participant and include the following: In the past 4 weeks, &quot;How much of the time did your asthma keep you from getting as much done at work, school or at home?&quot;, &quot;How often have you had shortness of breath?&quot;, &quot;How often did your asthma symptoms wake you up at night or earlier than usual in the morning?&quot;, &quot;How often have you used your rescue inhaler or nebulizer medication (such as albuterol)?&quot; and &quot;How would you rate your asthma control&quot;? The ACT total score is defined as the sum of the scores from all 5 questions, provided all questions have been answered; thus, the total score ranges from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25 (complete control of asthma). A score of 20 or higher indicates well-controlled asthma. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 168 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The AQLQ is a disease-specific, self-administered quality of life (QOL) questionnaire developed to evaluate the impact of asthma treatments on the QOL of asthma sufferers. The AQLQ contains 32 items in four domains: activity limitation (11 items), symptoms (12 items), emotional function (5 items), and environmental stimuli (4 items). The response format consists of a 7-point scale: a value of 1 indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;; a value of 7 indicates &quot;no impairment.&quot; The AQLQ total score is defined as the average of the scores from all 32 questions, provided at least 90% of the questions have been answered; thus, the total score ranges from 1 (indicates &quot;total impairment&quot;) to 7 (indicates &quot;no impairment&quot;). Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 168 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline total AQLQ score, country, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, 2-part, self-assessment instrument, designed for self-completion, used to measure health outcome. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured by a three-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems and 3=severe problems). Respondents are asked to choose one level that reflects their &quot;own health state today&quot; for each of the five dimensions.</description>

          <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, 2-part, self-assessment instrument, designed for self-completion, used to measure health outcome. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension is measured by a three-point Likert scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems and 3=severe problems). Respondents are asked to choose one level that reflects their &quot;own health state today&quot; for each of the five dimensions.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a standardized, 2-part, self-assessment instrument, designed for self-completion, used to measure health outcome. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The second part is a 20 centimeter VAS that has endpoints labelled &quot;best imaginable health state&quot; and &quot;worst imaginable health state&quot; anchored at 100 and 0, respectively. Participants were asked to indicate how they rate their own health by drawing a line from an anchor box to that point on the EQ-VAS that best represents their own health on that day. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline VAS score, country, sex, age, and treatment.</description>
