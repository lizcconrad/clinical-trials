        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have completed study E2020-A001-211 according to the protocol.

          2. Male and female patients between 18-65 years of age. Women of childbearing potential
             practiced effective contraception (e.g., abstinence, intra-uterine device (IUD) or
             barrier method plus hormonal method), had a negative urine -hCG at Week 0, and be
             willing to remain on their current form of contraception for the duration of the
             study. Pregnant and/or lactating females were to be excluded.

          3. Patients of any race who were in generally good health.

          4. Patient was willing to participate, and has provided written informed consent prior to
             being exposed to any study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of any clinically significant disorder which was being evaluated medically,
             and which had not been shown to be stable on medications or other treatment(s) for a
             period of at least 3 months, including active or uncontrolled tumors, non-trauma
             related cerebrovascular accidents, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine or
             pulmonary disease, cardiovascular system disease or known collagen vascular disease
             (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). Hypertension was medication controlled (supine
             diastolic BP &lt; 95 mmHg). Cardiac disease (angina pectoris, congestive heart failure or
             arrhythmias) was stable on appropriate medication for 6 months. No elective surgical
             procedures were allowed during the course of the study.

          2. Patients with a recent history (&lt;/= 2 years) of or on active treatment for any
             hematologic/oncologic disorders (other than basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin).

          3. Patients with a serious central nervous system (CNS) disorder (e.g., neoplasm,
             infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological disease such as
             Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, or any other progressive
             CNS disease) or who either evidence focal neurological signs or symptoms by
             examination or history (e.g., papilledema) or who evidence transient neurological
             symptoms without an ensuing headache.

          4. Any medical or psychiatric (e.g., severe depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder)
             condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, made the patient unsuitable for
             the study.

          5. History of chronic alcoholism or drug abuse as defined by DSM-IV criteria or patients
             who had previously been hospitalized and/or treated for substance abuse within the
             past one year.

          6. History of overuse (&gt; 12 days per four week period on average) of acute headache
             medications including analgesics, opioids, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs), butalbital containing compounds, ergots and triptans within the past one (1)
             year.

          7. Patients who were taking any prior or concomitant medications, as defined in the
             Protocol (Appendix 16.1.1), during the study.

          8. Patients who were unwilling or unable to fulfill the requirements of the study.

          9. Patients with known hypersensitivity to piperidine derivatives.

         10. Patients who had taken a cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., donepezil, tacrine,
             rivastigmine, galantamine, metrifonate) for the acute or prophylactic treatment of
             migraines in the past (excluding E2020-A001-211) or who were currently taking a
             cholinesterase inhibitor for any other indication.

         11. Patients who had taken any unapproved prior or concomitant medications. In particular,
             patients were not allowed to take beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium
             channel blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, valproate, methysergide,
             cyproheptadine or any other ongoing prophylactic treatment for migraines while
             participating in this study.
