    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, pilot study in patients with a diagnosis of recurrent ovarian,
      fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have undergone standard cytoreductive
      surgery following by adjuvant chemotherapy. It is expected that this first surgery was
      optimal - as defined as no residual tumor &gt; or = 1 centimeter. Patient has clinical evidence
      of a first recurrence. The patient undergoes surgery and isotonic normal saline (perfusate)
      heated and administered into the abdomen, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy infusion (HIPC) administering carboplatin (chemotherapy). Six weeks after
      surgery patients will receive adjuvant chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for 6
      cycles.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  The primary objectives are

             -  to determine the clinical response of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
                (HIPC) in patients at the time of first clinical recurrence of ovarian, fallopian
                tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma

             -  to determine the feasibility of delivering HIPC in a recurrent setting.

        -  Secondary objectives are

             -  to determine disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS),

             -  to determine treatment related changes in quality of life (QOL)

             -  to monitor the toxicities and complications associated with HIPC.
