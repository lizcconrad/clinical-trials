  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational study in participants who completed the
      24-week, placebo-controlled MK-0476 Protocol 272 (NCT00076973) study of montelukast in the
      treatment of respiratory symptoms subsequent to RSV-induced bronchiolitis. The purpose of
      this study is to better understand the clinical and demographic correlates of asthma and
      atopic disorders in children (through the age of 6 years) with a history of severe
      RSV-induced bronchiolitis.

    <description>Asthma was defined as a positive response to the Epidemiology Questionnaire item &quot;Has your child had wheezing or whistling in the chest in the past 6/12 months?&quot; for the period of 12 months prior to age 6 years.
Prognostic factors for asthma at age 6 years were derived from baseline characteristic, disease characteristic and family history data, and were identified by a forward stepwise regression model.</description>

    <description>Atopic disorders include allergic rhinitis (AR) and/or atopic dermatitis (AD). Atopic disorders was defined as a positive response to the Epidemiology Questionnaire item &quot;In the past 6/12 months, has your child had a problem with sneezing or runny or blocked nose when he/she did not have a cold or the flu?&quot; for AR and/or a positive response to both of the following items for AD: &quot;Has your child had an itchy rash which was coming and going at any time in the past 6/12 months?&quot; and &quot;Has this itchy rash at any time affected any of the following places: the folds of the elbows, behind the knees, in front of the ankles, under the buttocks, or around the neck, ears, or eyes?&quot; for the period of 12 months prior to age 6 years.
Prognostic factors for atopic disorders at age 6 years were derived from baseline characteristic, disease characteristic and family history data, and were identified by a forward stepwise regression model.</description>

Prognostic factors for use of chronic asthma therapy at age 6 years were derived from baseline characteristic, disease characteristic and family history data, and were identified by a forward stepwise regression model.</description>
