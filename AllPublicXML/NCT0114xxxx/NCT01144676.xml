  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-center, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to
      evaluate the delivery of dapivirine from matrix vaginal rings over a 56 and 57 day period and
      to assess the safety as compared to placebo vaginal rings in 48 healthy, HIV-negative,
      sexually active women.

    <measure>Safety: To assess the safety of the dapivirine vaginal ring, the endpoint was the proportion of women in four vaginal ring regimens on dapivirine or placebo ring experiencing specific, protocol-defined safety events during the study (see description)</measure>

    <description>Mucosal abnormalities (as defined in the CONRAD/WHO manual) visible during naked eye examination and/or colposcopy;
Abnormal vaginal pH and/or abnormal vaginal flora during the course of the trial.
Positive diagnostic tests for trichomonas, gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia;
At least one adverse event during the 12-week trial period;
Any laboratory abnormalities on haematology, electrolytes, liver function, and renal function.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: To examine local and systemic pharmacokinetics of dapivirine concentrations delivered by the vaginal rings, measured in plasma, vaginal fluids and cervical tissue during the trial period</measure>
