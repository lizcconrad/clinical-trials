  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to characterize pharmacokinetics of fentanyl during and after
      Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT), using population pharmacokinetic analysis with non
      linear mixed effects modeling.

    <textblock>
      Patients received an initial intravenous bolus of fentanyl 100 μg and infused at variable
      rates ranging from 250 to 400 μg/hr.

      Arterial blood samples (3ml) were taken immediately before the start of infusion (baseline),
      and at scheduled time which were coincident with laboratory tests during surgery as follows.
      In pre-anhepatic phase, blood were taken at 10min, 30min, 1hr, 3hr, 5hr until clamping of the
      hepatic blood supply and venous drainage, after the star of anhepatic phase, blood were taken
      at 5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 2hr until the vessels were reconnected to new
      liver. In neo-hepatic phase, blood were taken at 5min, 10min, 30min, 60min, 90min, 2hr, 3hr,
      5hr until fentanyl-infusion stop, and at 0hr, 1hr, 3hr, 5hr, 8hr, 12hr, 24hr immediately
      after the stop of infusion. Samples were collected into tubes containing heparin as an
      anticoagulant and immediately placed on ice. After centrifugation for 8 min at 1800 g, the
      plasma was transferred to a cryovial and stored at -70°C until assay.
