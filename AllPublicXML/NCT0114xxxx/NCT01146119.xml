      This is a Phase II multi-center, randomized, two stage, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study comprising 200 participants. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive one of the
      following administrations (as two single IM injections with an interval of 21 days between
      each injection Administration A: Prime twice with Adjuvanted Multimeric-001 500 mcg - 64
      subjects.

      Administration B: PBS (Placebo) twice - 32 subjects. Administration C: Adjuvanted PBS
      (Placebo)twice - 32 subjects. Participants from administrations A and B will be further
      immunized with a 15% dose of commercial seasonal trivalent vaccine for 2011 on day 81.

      Administration D: Adjuvanted Multimeric-001 500 mcg coadministered once with 15% of TIV dose
      - 24 subjects. Administration E: Adjuvanted Multimeric-001 500 mcg coadministered once with
      50% of TIV dose - 24 subjects Administration group F: PBS (Placebo) co-administered once with
      50% of TIV dose - 24 subjects

    <description>The serum is tested for its ability to adhere to influenza virus and thus inhibit the Hemagglutination reaction. Adjuvanted M-001 co-administered with partial dose of TIV (Vaxigrip, 50%) was effective in enhancing immunity to influenza-related antigens, as manifested by increased HAI antibody responses toward viruses contained in the TIV as well as toward non-TIV virus strains.</description>
