  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine use, abuse and dependence is a public health problem that is directly responsible for
      hundreds of billions of dollars in health care expenditures per year. Relapse rates to
      cocaine use are high, creating a pressing need to develop effective therapies for cocaine
      dependence. The proposed research will focus on investigating the determinants and
      consequences of cocaine dependence via measurement of physiological, behavioral and
      subjective effects of acute doses of cocaine in healthy non-drug dependent human volunteers
      in the laboratory, and through examination of the effects of pharmacotherapies on the above
      effects of cocaine. This study will examine cocaine-derived reinforcement under week-long
      sub-chronic varenicline (Chantix) dosing, and under placebo conditions. The study is a
      within-subjects crossover design using 24 subjects. Subjects will be screened and consented
      into the study at the Treatment Research Center (TRC). Study visits where behavioral and
      physiological outcome data will be obtained will be conducted at the Clinical and
      Translational Research Center (CTRC) of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
      Subjects will be outpatients for this trial, with CTRC sessions scheduled at least one week
      apart.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females, 18 to 60 years old.

          2. Recreational users of cocaine reporting at least six instances of cocaine use in the
             past 12 months and at least one use in the past 30 days.

          3. Live within a commutable distance of the Treatment Research Center (TRC) at the
             Penn/VA Center for Studies of Addiction, University of Pennsylvania. We define this to
             be a distance within the service area of Septa, within an hour drive, or a distance
             that both the patient and Principal Investigator (PI) find acceptable.

          4. Understands and signs the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current DSM-IV diagnosis of any psychoactive substance dependence other than nicotine
             dependence, as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM (SCID).

          2. Current severe psychiatric symptoms (e.g., psychosis, dementia, suicidal or homicidal
             ideation, mania or depression requiring anti-depressant therapy) as diagnosed using
             the SCID, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (Ham A), and Hamilton Ration Scale for
             Depression (HAM-D).

          3. Individuals scoring &gt; 10 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D).

          4. Use of any investigational medication within the past 30 days.

          5. Concomitant treatment with psychotropic medications.
