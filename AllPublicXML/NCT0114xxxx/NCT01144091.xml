      The investigators will study 2 separate groups:

        -  Cardiology patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography +/- PCI (Percutaneous
           coronary intervention).

        -  Patients undergoing CT examination with contrast medium. All patients will receive
           intravenous (I.V) hydration for 8-12h before and 36 to 48 h after angiography with 0.45%
           saline 100ml/h.

      All patients will receive oral N-acetyl cysteine 1200 mg twice daily, a day before, on the
      day of the angiography and for another 48 hours.

      In addition, patients will be assigned to receive oral pentoxyphylline (P group) or placebo
      (C - control group) tablets 3 times a day one day before, on the day of the procedure and for
      another 48 hours.

      Baseline Serum Creatinine (S.Cr) levels in will be taken before angiography and two days
      after angiography. Radio-contrast nephropathy is defined, in this study, as increase in serum
      ≥ 25 % of baseline after injection of the radio-contrast agent. Pentoxyfylline is an orally
      active haemorheological agent for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease,
      cerebrovascular disease and a number of other conditions involving a defective regional
      microcirculation. Pentoxyfylline acts primarily by increasing red blood cell deformability,
      by reducing blood viscosity and by decreasing the potential for platelet aggregation and
      thrombus formation (mechanism unclear). Pentoxyfylline has also proven to have a significant
      anti inflammatory effect as well as anti oxidant effect, mechanisms considered to be
      important patho-physiological causes of contrast induced nephropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impairment of renal function following exposure to intravenous radio-graphic contrast
      materials is the third major cause of renal hospital acquired renal dysfunction. Renal
      dysfunction occurs most often in patients with chronic renal failure and or patients with
      diabetes mellitus and contributes to the morbidity and mortality. Previous research work
      proved that the use volume expansion with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is superior to volume
      expiation alone to prevent renal impairment due to radio-contrast5. NAC a potent anti oxidant
      may prevent CIN by stopping direct oxidative tissue damage and by improving renal
      hemodynamics.Pentoxyfylline has also proven to have a significant anti inflammatory effect as
      well as anti oxidant effect.Preangiographic and the highest post-angiographic values of
      Creatinine and eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) will be recorded. Levels of the
      biomarker Neutrophil - gelatinase - associated lipocalin (NGAL) will be tested randomly in 49
      patients p as a biomarker for contrast induced nephropathy. Blood serology for NGAL will be
      drown from patients before the procedure and 2 hours after angiography.
