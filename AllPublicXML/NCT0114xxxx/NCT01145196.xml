  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is an anti-inflammatory drug that is used to treat some
      autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. This drug can damage the retina
      by causing a condition called plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity, which may lead to vision
      loss. However, most people taking plaquenil do not develop this problem. Researchers are
      interested in studying whether differences in a person s genes explain why some people
      develop plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity while others do not.

      Objectives:

      - To investigate possible correlations between certain genes or genetic mutations and
      plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have previously used plaquenil.

        -  Both individuals who have and have not developed plaquenil-induced retinal toxicity will
           be eligible for this study.

      Design:

        -  The study requires one or two visits to the National Eye Institute or an outpatient
           study clinic over a maximum 2-year period.

        -  Participants will provide a personal and family medical history, and will have a full
           eye examination.

        -  Participants will also provide blood samples for testing.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The objective of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between genetic
      mutations, beginning with an analysis of ABCA4, and Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity and
      to describe the phenotype of Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      The study will enroll 45 patients, 18 years of age or older, found to have Plaquenil -induced
      retinal toxicity. Seventy-five volunteers with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA), or Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome and history of Plaquenil use, but
      without evidence of retinal toxicity, will also be recruited.

      DESIGN:

      The study is an observational study with 1-2 outpatient visits to the NEI clinic or review of
      medical records for off-site participants. All participants will provide a blood sample for
      genetic analysis.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      Clinical examination and blood samples will be used for genetic testing and mutation
      identification. The outcome of this study is to identify genetic mutations, starting with
      those in ABCA4 gene, associated with retinal toxicity in participants with a history of
      Plaquenil use.

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Affected participants must be 18 years of age or older and have:

               -  History of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or
                  Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome, and

               -  History of Plaquenil use, and

               -  Evidence of Plaquenil -induced retinal toxicity, based on clinical findings.

          2. Unaffected volunteers must be 18 years of age or older and have:

               -  History of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or
                  Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome, and

               -  History of Plaquenil use, and

               -  No retinal disease upon examination within the last six months.

          3. All participants must be able to:

               -  Provide their own consent, and

               -  Safely provide a blood sample.

        &lt;TAB&gt;

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        1. Participants with other known (genetic) retinal disease including but not limited to:
        Stargardt s disease and cone or cone-rod dystrophy whose diagnosis preceded their Plaquenil
        use. Participants with no known previous genetic diagnosis but with clinical findings
        associated with a genetic diagnosis, such as parafoveal or macular flecks which are
        associated with Stargardt s disease or fundus flavimaculatus, will also be excluded.
