  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of MK2206 (an AKT inhibitor)and gefitinib in nonsmall cell lung
      cancer patients who failed prior chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). The patient population is enriched for EGFR mutations.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is safe to administered MK-2206 in
      combination with gefitinib in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer. The second purpose of this study is to define the MTD (Maximum Tolerated
      Dose) of MK-2206 when combined with gefitinib.

      A standard 3-3 dose escalation scheme of MK-2206 with fix dose gefitinib is used in this
      study.

      Preclinical data from communication with Merck clinical and pre-clinical group support the
      application of MK2206 and an EGFR-TKI, and the synergistic effect of this combination. This
      proposed study is a phase I dose defining study to define the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of
      MK-2206 when combined with gefitinib.

      MK-2206 is a potent, orally active, allosteric inhibitor of human AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 with
      preclinical anti-tumor activity.

      This is a Phase I, single-center, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Patients who previously failed and
      progressed through EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib or gefitinib and up to one line of
      chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study. Patients will be administered with oral MK-2206
      and a standard dose of EGFR inhibitor gefitinib.

      This study will be conducted in three cohorts to identify a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)
      of MK-2206 in combination with standard dose of gefitinib (250 mg QD). Cohorts of 3 patients
      will be enrolled sequentially on escalating doses of MK-2206 administered in combination with
      a standard dose of gefitinib. Patients will advance doses of MK2206 if 0/3 patients or 0-1/6
      develop DLT (Dose-Limiting Toxicity). If 1/3 patient develops DLT, the cohort will be
      expanded to 6. If 2/6 patients developed DLT, the dose will be de-escalate to 90 mg Qwk. The
      highest dose cohort with 0-1/6 with DLT will be deemed as MTD and used as cohort expansion
      for a total of 15 patients.
