  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to
      evaluate whether 4 weeks of treatment with aprepitant will improve nausea as compared with
      placebo in patients with symptoms of chronic nausea and vomiting of presumed gastric origin.

      APRON is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled trial of 4 weeks of
      treatment with aprepitant or placebo for patients with symptoms of gastroparesis and related
      disorders. Screening for eligibility and collection of baseline data will span up to 4 weeks
      after obtaining informed consent and registration. Eligible patients will consist of patients
      with symptoms of gastroparesis and will be randomized to either aprepitant (125 mg per day)
      or placebo for 4 weeks.

      The symptoms will be measured with the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary
      (GCSIDD)for one week at baseline and for four weeks after randomization. In addition, the
      nausea symptom will be measured daily on a 0 to 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS)14 for one
      week at baseline and daily for four weeks after randomization. There will be a 2 week washout
      period at the end of the treatment to ensure patient safety following the end of treatment.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is a binary (0,1) variable indicating improvement in nausea or not in the mean of available VAS scores over the 28 day treatment period compared to the mean of VAS scores during the 7 day baseline period. The criteria for improvement are either a 25 mm or more reduction in mean VAS or attaining a mean VAS during the treatment period of &lt; 25 mm.</description>
