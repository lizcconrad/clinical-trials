  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for about 20% of adult leukemias. Treatment
      results in adult ALL have lagged behind the improvements achieved in the pediatric
      population. A modified version of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute pediatric protocol is used
      to treat adult patients with ALL. The results seem to be superior to those reported with
      other adult protocols. However, there is limited data on the impact of such intensified
      approaches and resulting toxicities on the quality of life (QOL) of these survivors.
      Identifying important factors affecting the QOL may permit attempts at early interventions
      and may help to further modify the regimen and mitigate these adverse effects on QOL.

      This study is evaluating the quality of life of long term survivors of adult ALL. It involves
      the patients filling out several questionnaires that are well-validated measures assessing
      various QOL issues of concern to these patients. The following questionnaires are used in
      this study:

        -  EORTC QLQ C30 to assess global health and major health domains

        -  Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)

        -  Personal Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) to assess psychosocial distress

        -  Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Fatigue Questionnaire

        -  Peripheral Neuropathy Questionnaire

      The data obtained from the questionnaires will be analyzed and the various domains of health
      will be quantified.
