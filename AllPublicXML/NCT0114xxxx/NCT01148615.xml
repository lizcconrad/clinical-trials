      Primary Objective:

        -  To confirm the dose of aflibercept in western studies by assessing the dose-limiting
           toxicity (DLT) of intravenous (IV) aflibercept when administered in combination with
           docetaxel given intravenously every 3 weeks in Chinese patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety profile of intravenous (IV) aflibercept when administered in
           combination with docetaxel

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of IV aflibercept and docetaxel when administered in
           combination

        -  To make a preliminary assessment of antitumor effects of the combination of docetaxel
           plus aflibercept in patients with evaluable disease

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of IV aflibercept

        -  To measure endogenous free Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)

      The duration of screening, treatment, and follow-up are within 21 days, 3 weeks/cycle, and 90
      days after the last aflibercept administration. Patients will be administered aflibercept in
      combination with docetaxel until when/if a definitive treatment discontinuation criterion is
      met such as progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal to continue.
