  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the incidence of sampling bias during pathologic assessment of
      sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) when they are cut at a certain thickness (1 mm) and the tissue
      slices are completely analyzed by histopathology (at 200 µm sections). The sponsor and
      investigators would like to determine how often small cancer deposits are present in one
      slice but not the other. The data will provide an empirical estimate of the incidence of
      tissue sampling bias inherent in using different tissue sections for analysis. The data will
      also show how varying degrees of detail in evaluating the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) with
      histopathology methods will impact the degree of agreement.

    <description>A maximum of 3 dissected sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) per subject will be included in this study. Lymph nodes will be sliced at 1 mm intervals with Sysmex's 5-blade lymph node cutter. Alternate slices will be allocated to either &quot;reference&quot; histopathology or &quot;test&quot; histopathology. Three serial sections will be cut every 200 µm (level): the 1st section per level for hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E), the middle section of the 3rd level for Immunohistochemistry (IHC)(pan- cytokeratin antibody clone AE1/AE3). All other sections will be blanks in case further analysis is needed.</description>

             best of their ability) and signed the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects diagnosed pre-surgically with large or locally advanced (T3 &amp; T4) breast
