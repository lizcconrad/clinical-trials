    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if health interventions (intensive exercise or
      health education) can be used to help improve substance abuse treatment. The primary
      objective of this protocol is to compare percent days of abstinence between Vigorous
      Intensity High Dose exercise (VIHD) and Health Education Intervention (HEI) groups based on
      stimulant (i.e., cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamine, or other stimulant, excluding
      caffeine and nicotine) use during a 12-week acute phase.

      This study is designed as a two-group, randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness
      of the addition of exercise and health education to treatment as usual in improving drug
      treatment outcomes in 330 eligible and interested participants who provide informed consent
      at 8-10 sites across the nation. These participants will be randomized to one of two
      treatment arms: (1) Vigorous Intensity High Dose Exercise Augmentation (VIHD): Usual Care
      Augmented with Vigorous Intensity High Dose Exercise or (2) Health Education Intervention
      Augmentation (HEI): Usual Care Augmented with Health Education. This study will include
      individuals diagnosed with stimulant abuse or dependence (cocaine, methamphetamine,
      amphetamine or other stimulant, except caffeine or nicotine) who begin treatment while in a
      residential setting.

    <description>Percent days of abstinence based on stimulant (i.e., cocaine, methamphetamine, amphetamine, or other stimulant, excluding caffeine and nicotine) use during the 12-week acute phase. Days of abstinence will be measured during days 22-84, since it is anticipated that most individuals will be in a highly structured environment during the first 21 days of the study, and therefore would have little opportunity to use substances (i.e., the groups are not likely to differ during this time period). Measured by the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) and aided by urine drug screen collected three times/week.</description>

The health education sessions will be conducted as one-on-one (i.e., individual) sessions. Health education sessions will consist of information on health-related topics distributed via methods such as didactics, audio and video materials, and written materials.</description>
