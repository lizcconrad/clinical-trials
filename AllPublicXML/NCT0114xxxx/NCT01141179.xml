  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the impact of reduced renal function on the pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic profile of LEO 27847. Volunteers with different degrees of renal impairment
      will be administered one dose of the investigational drug and then followed until
      investigational drug is eliminated from the body.
