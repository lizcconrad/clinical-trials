  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a brief (12 week) psychological treatment
      program, based in primary care, can help youths struggling with anxiety and/or depression.
      This brief cognitive behavioral therapy program will be compared to enhanced referral to
      specialty mental health care.

      Mood and anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are disabling, distressing, and
      prevalent and produce added costs to health systems. This two-site randomized controlled
      trial will test the effects of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (BCBT) protocol (8-12
      sessions) in a large sample (N=210) of children and adolescents (age 8-16) presenting with
      anxiety and/or depression in primary care. Clinical and cost-effectiveness of BCBT will be
      compared to a plausible public health alternative - enhanced referral to specialty mental
      health care (SMHC). This investigation is noteworthy in adopting a deployment-focused model
      and testing this intervention early in its development within a real world context (primary
      care) and against a plausible public health comparison condition (SMHC) relevant for future
      treatment dissemination.
