  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether trazodone is effective in the treatment of
      sleep disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders (SD) affects 35 to 50 percent of patients with AD. These disorders often make
      caring for patients at home very difficult. Trazodone is commonly prescribed drugs for SD in
      AD patients. There are no controlled studies in this sample of patients for this purpose.
