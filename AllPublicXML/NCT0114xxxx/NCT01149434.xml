  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two parts: Drug Interaction (Pharmacokinetic) Phase and Pharmacodynamic
      Phase

      The primary study objective for the Drug Interaction Study is to determine the
      pharmacokinetic interactions between RAD001 and JI-101.

      The primary study objective for the Pharmacodynamic Study is progression-free survival at 2
      moths, evaluated separately in each of the three cohorts.

      These will include a determination of tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria and an assessment of ephrinB4 expression in blood samples.

      Secondary objectives are to determine safety and tolerability of JI-101. The investigational
      products are everolimus (42-O-(2-hydroxyethyl) rapamycin) and JI-101
      (1-[1-(2-amino-pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1H-indol-4-yl]-3-(5-bromo-2 methoxy-phenyl)-urea)

      Eligible patients meeting all study entry criteria will be enrolled in the study. For the
      Drug Interaction study, patients with solid tumors will receive a single dose (10 mg) of
      Everolimus by mouth on Day 1 and Day 8 and JI-101 capsules (200 mg) by mouth on Day 8 and Day
      15. For the Pharmacodynamic Study, all patients will receive JI-101 capsules by mouth (200 mg
      BID) for 28 day treatment cycles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of RAD001 and JI-101 in patients with solid tumors.

      Patients will complete all Screening evaluations within 21 days of Study Cycle 1Day 1. All
      patients will provide written Informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and
      Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization before any procedures or assessments are initiated
      for the purposes of the protocol.

      For the Drug Interaction Study, Everolimus will be administered to eligible patients at Cycle
      1 Day 1 and blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic analyses prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1,
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours after dosing. On Day 8, Everolimus and JI-101 will be
      administered and blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic analyses prior to dosing and at 0.5,
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours after dosing. On Day 15, JI-101 will be administered and
      blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic analyses prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
      10, and 24 hours after dosing. Patients will continue to receive JI-101(200 mg BID) for 28
      day treatment cycles. Patients in the Drug Interaction Study will also receive CT scans prior
      to screening and every 2 treatment cycles.

      For the Pharmacodynamic Study, JI-101 will be dispensed to eligible patients at Cycle 1 Day
      1. JI-101 will be administered (200 mg BID) for 28 day treatment cycles. PET and CT scans
      will be performed prior to commencing treatment if it is standard of care. A CT scan will be
      performed otherwise. Patients will return to the study site every 2 cycles to complete safety
      assessments with radiologic tumor assessments (CT and/or PET). Adverse events will be
      monitored following the first administration of investigational product for the duration of
      the patient's participation in this study. Archival tissue will be collected for detection of
      mutations in relevant pathways and development of assays to study modulation of pathways that
      are targeted by JI-101.

JI-101: JI-101 inhibits angiogenesis, and subsequently tumor growth, by inhibiting three receptor tyrosine kinases: VEGF Receptor Type 2 (VEGFR 2), platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR β and Ephrin B4 (EphB4). JI-101 selectively inhibits kinases critical for all three stages of tumor angiogenesis.
Everolimus: Everolimus is a signal transduction inhibitor that selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key and highly conserved serine-threonine kinase, that is present in all cells and is a central regulator of protein synthesis and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell survival. mTOR is the only currently known target of everolimus (1).</description>

          <title>Pharmacokinetic Arm</title>
          <description>Patients going on Pharmacokinetic arm will receive JI-101 &amp; Everolimus (4 patients only)
JI-101: JI-101 inhibits angiogenesis, and subsequently tumor growth, by inhibiting three receptor tyrosine kinases: VEGF Receptor Type 2 (VEGFR 2), platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR β and Ephrin B4 (EphB4). JI-101 selectively inhibits kinases critical for all three stages of tumor angiogenesis.
Everolimus: Everolimus is a signal transduction inhibitor that selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key and highly conserved serine-threonine kinase, that is present in all cells and is a central regulator of protein synthesis and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell survival. mTOR is the only currently known target of everolimus (1).</description>
