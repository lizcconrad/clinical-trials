    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Remission by Disease Activity Score 28 Based on C-reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) Criteria at Month 12 and at Both Months 12 and 18</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to Months 12 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-CRP remission defined as &lt;2.6; TP=treatment phase; WP=withdrawal phase. The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient's global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). These measures are then fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization to Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. SDAI-defined remission= ≤3.3. The SDAI is the simple linear sum of 5 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) (based on a 28-joint assessment); patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity (assessed on 0-10 cm visual analog scale, on which higher scores=greater affection due to disease activity); and C-reactive protein level (mg/dL). SDAI total score=0-86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11=low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26=moderate disease activity, and &gt;26=high disease activity. TJC is assessed and recorded at each visit, with no swelling=0, swelling=1. SJC is assessed through identification of joints that are painful under pressure or to passive motion. TJC is recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit, with no tenderness =0, tenderness = 1. Higher score indicates greater affection due to disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Response Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ response defined as a reduction of at least 0.3 units from baseline in score on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), which assesses patients' functional ability by rating their abilities over the previous week. The HAQ-DI includes at least 2 questions from each of 8 categories: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, and common daily activities. Patients rate difficulty performing specific tasks: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The sum of the categories score (the highest scored item in the category) is divided by the number of categories answered, yielding a score from 0-3. When aids, devices, or help is indicated by the patient, the score for the category item is raised from a 0 or a 1 to a 2, but if the patient's highest score for a subcategory is a 3, it stays a 3.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization to Months 6, 12, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. The SF-36 is a 36-item self-administered questionnaire developed to assess health-related quality of life (QOL) and comprises 8 domains, including 4 physical (physical health, bodily pain, physical functioning and physical role limitations) and 4 mental (mental health, vitality, social functioning, and emotional role limitation) subscales. Responses are used to derive physical and mental component summary scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QOL (0=Poorest Health; 100=Best Health). Mean change from baseline=postbaseline value-baseline value; a higher value signifies improvement.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline Over Time in Findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. Change from Baseline=Postbaseline-baseline value. MRI was used to assess joint damage progression at Months 6, 12, and 18. If &gt;20% of joints with a missing score for a parameter (erosion, osteitis, and synovitis), the MRI score of each parameter was considered missing. If ≤20% of joints had a missing score for a parameter, the MRI score for that parameter from the missing joints was carried forward from the previous MRI assessment, or carried backward from the next MRI assessment, if missing score occurred at baseline. MRI total score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 4 (worst outcome). A gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the dominant hand-wrist was performed on all randomized patients at 5 points. The hand/wrist assessed to have more synovitis was selected initially and used for all subsequent evaluations. The MRI examination was standardized to ensure sufficient image quality for the evaluation of radiographic progression of rheumatoid arthritis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 511 patients were enrolled in the study, and 351 were randomized. The primary reasons that 160 enrolled patients were not randomized were failure to meet study criteria (130/160) and withdrawal of consent (20/160).</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Abatacept, 125 mg, Plus Methotrexate, 2.5 mg</title>
          <description>Participants received abatacept, 125 mg subcutaneously, plus methotrexate (MTX), 2.5 mg orally as tablets, once weekly, during the 12-month Treatment Period. Participants with a Low Disease Activity Score (LDAS) defined as DAS28-CRP score of &lt; 3.2 at Month 12 (end of Treatment Period) entered the Withdrawal Period for up to 12 months, during which all study medication was withdrawn. Participants with a DAS28-CRP score of &gt;3.2 were discontinued from the study. All MTX and corticosteroids, if not already discontinued, were to be tapered off during the first month of the Withdrawal Period. Participants who experienced a worsening of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms or a RA flare after at least 3 months in the Withdrawal Period were eligible to enroll into a 6-month Re-exposure Period, during which they received open-label treatment with abatacept subcutaneous (SC) 125 mg/week and MTX.</description>

          <title>Disease Activity Score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP)</title>
          <description>The DAS28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient’s global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). These measures are then fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

          <description>The HAQ-DI assesses patients' functional ability by rating their abilities over the previous week. It includes at least 2 questions from each of 8 categories: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, and common daily activities. Patients rate difficulty performing specific tasks: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The sum of the categories score (the highest scored item in the category) is divided by the number of categories answered, yielding a score from 0-3.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Remission by Disease Activity Score 28 Based on C-reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP) Criteria at Month 12 and at Both Months 12 and 18</title>
        <description>DAS28-CRP remission defined as &lt;2.6; TP=treatment phase; WP=withdrawal phase. The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient’s global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). These measures are then fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

        <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient’s global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity. Individual measures are fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.)</description>

        <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. SDAI-defined remission= ≤3.3. The SDAI is the simple linear sum of 5 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) (based on a 28-joint assessment); patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity (assessed on 0-10 cm visual analog scale, on which higher scores=greater affection due to disease activity); and C-reactive protein level (mg/dL). SDAI total score=0-86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11=low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26=moderate disease activity, and &gt;26=high disease activity. TJC is assessed and recorded at each visit, with no swelling=0, swelling=1. SJC is assessed through identification of joints that are painful under pressure or to passive motion. TJC is recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit, with no tenderness =0, tenderness = 1. Higher score indicates greater affection due to disease activity.</description>

        <description>HAQ response defined as a reduction of at least 0.3 units from baseline in score on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), which assesses patients' functional ability by rating their abilities over the previous week. The HAQ-DI includes at least 2 questions from each of 8 categories: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, and common daily activities. Patients rate difficulty performing specific tasks: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The sum of the categories score (the highest scored item in the category) is divided by the number of categories answered, yielding a score from 0-3. When aids, devices, or help is indicated by the patient, the score for the category item is raised from a 0 or a 1 to a 2, but if the patient's highest score for a subcategory is a 3, it stays a 3.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Over Time</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) assesses patients' functional ability by rating their abilities over the previous week. The HAQ-DI includes at least 2 questions from each of 8 categories: dressing and grooming, hygiene, arising, reach, eating, grip, walking, and common daily activities. Patients rate difficulty performing specific tasks: 0=without difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The sum of the categories score (the highest scored item in the category) is divided by the number of categories answered, yielding a score from 0-3. When aids, devices, or help is indicated by the patient, the score for the category item is raised from a 0 or a 1 to a 2, but if the patient's highest score for a subcategory is a 3, it stays a 3.</description>

        <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. The SF-36 is a 36-item self-administered questionnaire developed to assess health-related quality of life (QOL) and comprises 8 domains, including 4 physical (physical health, bodily pain, physical functioning and physical role limitations) and 4 mental (mental health, vitality, social functioning, and emotional role limitation) subscales. Responses are used to derive physical and mental component summary scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better QOL (0=Poorest Health; 100=Best Health). Mean change from baseline=postbaseline value-baseline value; a higher value signifies improvement.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline Over Time in Findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</title>
        <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. Change from Baseline=Postbaseline-baseline value. MRI was used to assess joint damage progression at Months 6, 12, and 18. If &gt;20% of joints with a missing score for a parameter (erosion, osteitis, and synovitis), the MRI score of each parameter was considered missing. If ≤20% of joints had a missing score for a parameter, the MRI score for that parameter from the missing joints was carried forward from the previous MRI assessment, or carried backward from the next MRI assessment, if missing score occurred at baseline. MRI total score ranged from 0 (best outcome) to 4 (worst outcome). A gadolinium-enhanced MRI of the dominant hand-wrist was performed on all randomized patients at 5 points. The hand/wrist assessed to have more synovitis was selected initially and used for all subsequent evaluations. The MRI examination was standardized to ensure sufficient image quality for the evaluation of radiographic progression of rheumatoid arthritis.</description>

        <description>WP=withdrawal period. Remission defined as DAS28-CRP&lt;2.6. The DAS 28-CRP is a measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assesses the 28 joints RA commonly affects; the score includes the number of tender and swollen joints (out of 28), CRP level (a measure of inflammation in the blood), and the patient's global assessment of health (ranging from very good to very bad). DAS-CRP scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater disease activity. Individual measures are fed into a complex mathematical formula to produce the overall DAS (a score greater than 5.1 implies active disease; less than 3.2, well controlled disease; and less than 2.6, remission.). Percentage= number of participants with remission divided by number of participants who were analyzed (all treated participants who were in remission at end of treatment period and entered the Withdrawal Period)</description>

        <description>TP=treatment period; WP=withdrawal period. SDAI-defined remission= ≤3.3. The SDAI is the simple linear sum of 5 outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) (based on a 28-joint assessment); patient's and physician's global assessments of disease activity (assessed on 0-10 cm visual analog scale, on which higher scores=greater affection due to disease activity); and C-reactive protein level (mg/dL). SDAI total score=0-86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11=low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26=moderate disease activity, and &gt;26=high disease activity. TJC is assessed and recorded at each visit, with no swelling=0, swelling=1. SJC is assessed through identification of joints that are painful under pressure or to passive motion. TJC is recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit, with no tenderness =0, tenderness = 1. Higher score indicates greater affection due to disease activity.

All MTX and corticosteroids, if not already discontinued, were to be tapered off during the first month of the Withdrawal Period. Participants who experienced a worsening of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms or a RA flare after at least 3 months in the Withdrawal Period were eligible to enroll into a 6-month Re-exposure Period, during which they received open-label treatment with abatacept SC (125 mg/week) and MTX.</description>
