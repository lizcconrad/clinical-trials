  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although failure and mortality are the most relevant outcomes in patients with
      Community-acquired Pneumonia (CAP), there is little discussion in the literature on their
      incidence and etiology. A pathophysiological approach has been recently developed and used to
      evaluate clinical failure in CAP patients. Clinical failure has been analyzed as related
      versus unrelated to CAP, considering the role that the pulmonary infection and the
      inflammatory response played in the development of this outcome. Cardiac events were
      identified as triggers of clinical failures in a significant percentage of CAP patients. The
      development of cardiovascular events have been also identified in CAP patients both on
      admission to the hospital and during hospitalization. However, data on this topic belong to
      studies evaluating only selected populations of veteran patients with CAP. Understanding
      clinical failure, as well as cardiovascular events in hospitalized patients with CAP would be
      useful in order to prevent complications during the hospitalization, to develop new treatment
      modalities and, thus, to improve outcomes.

      The objectives of this international, multicenter, observational, prospective cohort study
      will be: 1) To define incidence, timing, etiology and risk factors of clinical failure,
      related vs. unrelated to CAP, in hospitalized patients with CAP; 2) To define incidence,
      timing, and risk factors for cardiovascular events either on hospital admission or during
      hospitalization in hospitalized patients with CAP.Consecutive adult patients hospitalized for
      CAP in acute care hospitals in Europe and US will be enrolled. Daily clinical evaluations.
      Demographics, history, clinical, radiological, and antibiotic therapy data will be recorded,
      as well as serum, urinary and respiratory samples will be collected both on admission and
      during hospitalization from consenting individuals. Patients will be classified as having a
      CAP-related versus CAP-unrelated failure, according to a pathophysiological classification.
      Patients will be also classified as having or not a cardiovascular event either on admission
      or during hospitalization.The following outcomes will be measured:

      1) Incidence, timing, etiology and risk factors of clinical failure related vs. unrelated to
      CAP; 2) Incidence, timing and risk factors of cardiovascular events; 3)time to clinical
      stability, length of hospital stay, mortality at hospital discharge, and mortality at 30 and
      180 days.

    <description>Incidence rates for clinical failure will be standardized and reported. Statistically significant differences between clinical failure related vs. unrelated to CAP will be investigated. Timing of clinical failure rates for those with clinical failure related vs. unrelated to pneumonia will be standardized and reported. Etiology and risk factors of clinical failure will be investigated through linear models, in order to identify associations of factors with the outcome and possible independent groups of factors in the explanation of the outcome.</description>

    <description>A patient will be considered to reach clinical stability when the following criteria will be met in a single day during hospitalization: 1) improved clinical signs (cough and shortness of breath); 2) patient will be afebrile for at least eight hours; 3) improving leukocytosis (decreased at least 10% from the previous day) or PCR or PCT 4) tolerating oral intake. Criteria for clinical stability will be evaluated daily during the first seven days of hospitalization.</description>

Adverse events will be considered if either death, CAP-related vs. CAP-unrelated, or re-hospitalization, CAP-related vs. CAP-unrelated, will occur within 180 days after hospital discharge. In addition, data regarding visits at general practitioner clinic, antibiotic use, cardiovascular events, discharge setting (nursing home, intermediate care facility, home) will be also collected.</description>
