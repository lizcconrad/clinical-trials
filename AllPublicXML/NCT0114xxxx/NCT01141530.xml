  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a pilot study designed to investigate transcriptional regulation in breast
      cancer. Although the main focus of the present study will be triple negative breast cancer
      where all of the clinically relevant receptors - estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
      receptor (PR) and herceptin (HER2) - are absent, all breast tissue biospecimens, including
      normal and mammary dysplasia, stored in the UAMS Tissue bank, procured from outside
      collaborators or purchased from commercial vendors will eventually be investigated. We will
      use high throughput molecular profiling techniques such as microarrays and next generation
      sequencing to correlate gene expression and gene expression regulation with clinical
      parameters such as tumor size, time to relapse and overall survival.

      The informed consent process for biospecimen collection we expect to use in this research has
      already been obtained by the UAMS Tissue Bank personnel as a part of the UARK 2005-06
      protocol. Tissue is collected during biopsies or mastectomies after pathologist approval. We
      will sequence small non-coding molecules (microRNA), messenger RNA, chromatin
      immunoprecipated and bisulfite treated DNA.
