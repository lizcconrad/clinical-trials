  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinomas (CCCs) are malignant tumors arising from the biliary epithelium. CCCs are
      characterised by a high mortality and the only curable therapy is complete tumor resection,
      if feasible, or in some cases liver transplantation. Since surgery for CCC is a procedure
      associated with a high mortality itself it needs to be ascertained that an accurate
      preoperative diagnosis has been established. However, it often appears to be difficult to get
      a preoperative pathological diagnosis, since it is difficult to obtain tumor specimens using
      cytologic brushings, biopsy forceps, bile aspiration or endoscopic ultrasonography
      guided-fine needle aspiration. This is reflected by a nearly 100% specificity but low
      sensitivity rates.

      The aim of this study is to compare a new method of biliary biopsy using a double-balloon
      enteroscopy (DBE) forceps to enable a safe and reliable tissue specimen collection within the
      proximal biliary tract with cytology brushings in patients with suspected malignant proximal
      biliary strictures.

    <description>For this study we recruit patients with proximal biliary stenoses, which are suspect for malignancy. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) will be performed on all patients . During ERC all subjects are undergoing both biopsy (using a double-balloon enteroscopy [DBE] forceps under a guidance of a pusher and guiding catheter with guidewire) and transpapillary brush cytology. The definite clinical diagnosis will be compared to cytological/histological results obtained by biopsy/cytology and accuracy will be evaluated.</description>

    <description>An endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) with a duodenoscope Olympus TFJ 160-R (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and endoscopic sphincterotomy with an Olympus papillotome (Olympus) is performed under analgosedation . Then, the cannulation of the bile duct is performed by a pusher using a guidewire/guiding catheter. Subsequently, 2 histology samples are taken via a double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) forceps (BF1725DF, Fujinon GmbH, Willich, Germany), which is placed under the guidance of the pusher.</description>
