  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current measures of adherence detect problems weeks to months after they occur. Because the
      HIV virus rapidly begins replicating and mutating in the absence of effective antiretroviral
      therapy, treatment failure may develop before an intervention can be deployed. Real-time
      objective adherence monitoring could redirect efforts from a reactive response to the
      proactive prevention of treatment failure. Because adherence is so closely associated with
      viral suppression, accurate adherence monitoring could also strategically limit viral
      monitoring only to those patients at a defined risk for viral rebound.

      This observational study is assessing a wireless adherence monitoring device and mobile
      phone-based adherence data collection among caregivers of children under the age of ten years
      in Mbarara, Uganda. It involves both quantitative and qualitative measures of the feasibility
      and acceptability of these measures, as well as circumstances of adherence lapses and other
      individual and cultural factors affecting adherence. The qualitative data will be used to
      explore models of adherence behavior, which will likely include the child-caregiver dynamic,
      the child's mental and physical health, and social support mechanism.
