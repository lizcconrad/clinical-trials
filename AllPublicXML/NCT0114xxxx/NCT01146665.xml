  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse amongst youth is a significant clinical and public health problem. The
      Emergency Department (ED) is an important setting for the treatment of alcohol-related
      problems as it is often the first point of contact between youth, their families, and the
      healthcare system. This pilot study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of a
      computer-based intervention in the ED for youth with alcohol-related presentations. The
      investigators research team will: (1) evaluate the methodological and operational processes
      involved in study recruitment and intervention implementation, (2) determine recruitment and
      retention rates, and (3) obtain preliminary data on the difference in alcohol consumption at
      different time points. The clinical and health service implications of this research will be
      used to plan further investigations designed to improve the standard of ED care among youth
      aged 12 to 16 with alcohol-related presentations. This research will also help optimize the
      planning and development of a full-scale randomized controlled clinical trial of a
      computer-based intervention designed to reduce higher-risk alcohol consumption and
      alcohol-related health and social problems in this target population.

    <description>The acceptability of the Personalized Assessment Feedback (PAF) intervention will be assessed by youth post-intervention and ED physicians and research staff post-trial using a study developed, 4-item questionnaire focusing on satisfaction with design and length of PAF, perceptions of helpfulness, credibility of the feedback provided by the PAF and user friendliness. PAF feasibility will be discussed by the team by examining the other secondary outcomes.</description>

    <description>This type of brief intervention targets norm misperceptions, for example summarizing a person's drinking in comparison to the average male or female in the general population. Theoretically, such normative feedback corrects norm misperceptions and motivates drinkers to re-evaluate their consumption patterns.</description>

        Study Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Youth aged 12 to 17 years who present to the Emergency Department (ED) with an
             alcohol-related problem.

          -  Medically stable

        Alcohol involvement will be determined by youth self-report of drinking alcohol prior to
        event necessitating a visit to the ED and/or a positive Blood Alcohol Content (BAC).

        Study Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Youth who require hospital admission

          -  Youth whose ED presentation is linked to drugs aside from alcohol

          -  Youth who report other drug use within the last 24 hours prior to ED presentation

          -  Youth who do not speak or understand English

          -  Youth who are currently enrolled in a treatment program for alcohol use

          -  Youth who are accompanied by a non-guardianship adult but are not considered Mature
             Minors

          -  Youth who do not have the capacity to give informed consent as determined by their
