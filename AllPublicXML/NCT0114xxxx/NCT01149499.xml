             fourteen units of alcohol per week [1 Unit = 150 mL of wine or 360 mL of beer or 45 mL
             of alcohol 40% alcohol]) or positive urine drug screen at screening.

          -  Use of soft drugs (such as marijuana) within 3 months of the screening visit or hard
             drugs (such as cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP) and crack) within 1 year prior to the

             drugs.

          -  Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples of
             inducers: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, omeprazole;
             examples of inhibitors: antidepressants (SSRI), cimetidine, diltiazem, macrolides,

          -  Any clinically significant history or presence of clinically significant neurological,
             endocrinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, immunologic, psychiatric or
             metabolic disease.

          -  Use of prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration of study

             except for topical products without systemic absorption.

          -  Difficulty to swallow study medication.

          -  Use of any tobacco products in the 90 days preceding drug administration.

          -  Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the

             study medication.

          -  Donation of plasma (500 mL) within 30 days prior to drug administration. Donation or
             loss of whole blood (excluding the volume of blood that will be drawn during the

             follows:

          -  50 mL to 300 mL of whole blood within 30 days,

          -  301 mL to 500 mL of whole blood within 45 days, or

          -  more than 500 mL of whole blood within 56 days prior to drug administration.

          -  Intolerance to venipunctures.
