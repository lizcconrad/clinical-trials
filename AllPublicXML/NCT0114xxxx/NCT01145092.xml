  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life style intervention including diet and exercise is the recommended strategy for
      prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). First-degree relatives of patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of insulin resistance and a lifetime risk of
      developing type 2 diabetes of 40%- 80%. Poor physical fitness is a strong indicator of an
      increased risk of developing diabetes.

      Long-term endurance exercise training has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in
      sedentary young and elderly individuals, first degree relatives of patients with Type 2
      diabetes, glucose intolerant obese, or Type 2 diabetic humans. In type 2 diabetic patients,
      non-diabetic individuals with IGT and sedentary adults after exercise training of different
      intensity, different duration and different frequency an increase of insulin sensitivity was
      found.

      However, despite the vast knowledge concerning beneficial effects physical activity for the
      prevention of T2DM (and many other chronic metabolic disorders) to date wide ranging
      strategies have not been realized satisfactory. Regardless of age, ethnicity, sex or health
      status the lack of time is the primary reason for the failure to exercise on a regular basis
      (or is stated as primary reason). Therefore the investigators aimed at investigating whether
      a controlled endurance/resistance training twice a week over 6 month might be beneficial for
      healthy, non obese, first degree relatives with T2DM. Therefore the investigators measure
      parameters associated with the prevention of T2DM like insulin sensitivity, flux through
      fATPase and fCK, intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipids.

    <description>The endurance training group exercised on a cycle ergometer (90% of power output determined at the respiratory compensation point = RCP). The duration of each training unit was increased with time. The resistance group trained on 8 weight machines where the workload gradually increased every 2-3 weeks. At week 13 an additional physical examination, OGTT and spiro-ergometry for adjusting the training were performed.</description>
