  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doxazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, may play an important role in cocaine
      addiction in humans. This study will evaluate to what extent the prospective screening for
      catecholamine related polymorphisms for alpha 1 NE receptor/transporter, COMT and DBH as main
      targets predict the treatment efficacy of doxazosin for cocaine-using behavior.

      The NE system, especially the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, may play an important role in
      cocaine addiction in humans. The results of this study will provide medical safety data on
      the duration of the induction schedule that will be optimal for attaining our target dose of
      8 mg doxazosin daily and will guide future pharmacotherapy trials using Doxazosin or related
      alpha 1 receptor antagonists for cocaine addiction.

      This 16-week double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial will provide treatment for 100
      cocaine-dependent patients and includes a 13 week medication trial (weeks 1-13) and up to 2
      week washout period(weeks 14-15). Qualifying subjects will be randomized to receive Doxazosin
      8 mg/day, or placebo during the study participation.

      Subjects will be receiving 1 mg study medication/placebo capsules at week 1, with 4mg/week
      induction rate for weeks, according to their randomized assignments, and are maintained on
      these agents through week 13. At the end of the study (weeks 14-15), participants will
      undergo discontinuation from active/placebo medication over a 2-week period. Subjects who
      wish to be transferred to an appropriate treatment program or treatment-research program will
      be helped with referral during the 2 week period (weeks 14-15).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: (1) Signed informed consent form (2) Subject understands the risk and
        benefits and agrees to visit frequency and procedures (3) Male or female (4) Any race or
        ethnic origin (5)Diagnosis of cocaine-dependence according to DSM-IV criteria (6) between
        the ages of 18 and 64 (7)Must be current users of cocaine with self-reported use of cocaine
        at least once weekly for at least one month preceding study entry, cocaine-positive urine
        screen and score over 3 which is the cut-off for diagnosis of cocaine dependence as
        assessed with the Severity of Dependence Scale (Kaye &amp; Darke 2002; Gossop, et al 1995;
        Gossop, et al. 1997) (8)Women of childbearing age are eligible to be included in the study
        if they have a negative pregnancy test at screening, agree to adequate contraception to
        prevent pregnancy, to have monthly pregnancy tests, and they understand the risk of fetal
        toxicity due to medication.

        Exclusion Criteria: (1)Current diagnosis of other drug , especially alcohol or
        benzodiazepine dependence or abuse (other than cocaine or tobacco) (2) Significant medical
        conditions (e.g., major cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, hepatic disorders) such as
        abnormal liver function (with laboratory findings of SGOT or SGPT greater than three times
        normal), hypotension or hypertension, a current cardiac condition, and those having a high
        risk of cardiovascular disease, seizure disorders, or another significant underlying
        medical condition which would contraindicate Doxazosin treatment (3)Lifetime schizophrenia,
        bipolar disorder, or other psychotic disorders (4) Actively considering plans of
        suicidality or homicidality (5) Current use of a prescribed psychotropic medication that
        cannot be discontinued (6) Women planning to become pregnant or breastfeed during the
        study, or refuse to use a reliable form of birth control or refuse monthly pregnancy
        testing (7) Subjects who are prescribed any anti-hypertension drugs, except thiazides, will
        be excluded because these medications may interact with Doxazosin's brain effects in
        reducing cocaine abuse.
