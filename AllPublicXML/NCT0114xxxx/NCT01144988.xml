  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant glioma are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. Despite
      advances in multimodal treatment including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, most patients
      have a dismal prognosis of 9-15 months (Stupp et al., NEJM 2005).

      A major reason for the aggressiveness of malignant glioma is a pronounced tumor
      neovascularization, mainly driven by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its
      receptors. The therapeutic monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab (Avastin®) inhibits the VEGF
      pathway by binding the VEGF ligand. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) this treatment
      reduces contrast enhancement by restoring both, the blood-brain-barrier and the destabilized
      vessel integrity. Furthermore, it raises the sensitivity of co-administered chemotherapeutics
      such as Irinotecan. In conclusion, anti-angiogenic therapy leads to the problem that the
      routinely used MRI techniques cannot distinguish anti-vascular effects from true anti-tumor
      effects.

      The study hypothesis of the clinical trial part is that in 35% of malignant glioma patients
      Avastin / Irinotecan chemotherapy results in objective tumor responses assessed by standard /
      functional MRI and FET- /FLT-PET neuroimaging. The study hypothesis for the translational
      study part is that the expression of the molecular targets of Avastin and Irinotecan in
      malignant glioma tissue ( = tumor and vascular cells) are predictive for Avastin / Irinotecan
      therapy induced treatment response measured by functional MRI and FET- / FLT-PET imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             possible, patients may have prior surgical resection of the tumor progression and will
