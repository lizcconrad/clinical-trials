    <textblock>
      Randomized double blind placebo controlled trial on transversus abdominus plane block
      approached from abdominal cavity, in patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential advantages compared to percutaneous approach are decrease in risk of visceral
      injury as it is under direct visual and tactile guidance, ease of approach in obese patients,
      short theatre time for administration, easy to administer.

    <description>This intraabdominal approach to TAP block is being used regularly by gynaecological surgeons in this hospital now.
To be performed bilaterally before surgical wound closure by an experienced surgeon who initially undergo initial observation by investigator to ensure uniformity in technique.
Local anaesthetic or placebo solution will be injected to TAP with blunt needle from within abdominal cavity under visual and tactile guidance at the triangle of Petit, after feeling one 'pop' through the transversus abdominis muscle to the TAP layer.
After careful aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, 1.5mg/kg of 0.5% ropivacaine or 0.3ml/kg of 0.9% saline placebo will be injected to each side slowly while observing for signs of toxicity.</description>
