      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of aminolevulinic acid during
      surgery in treating patients with malignant brain tumors. Aminolevulinic acid becomes active
      when it is exposed to a certain kind of light and may help doctors find and remove tumor
      cells during surgery

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. Establish a safe dose for oral ALA administration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Determine which of 3 ALA (aminolevulinic acid) doses (10, 20 or 30
      mg/kg) provide optimal discrimination between normal and malignant tissue intraoperatively.

      II. Determine whether or not the use of ALA (compared to comparable cases performed without
      the aid of ALA) leads to a higher rate of gross total resection, as determined by
      postoperative MRI scanning within 48 hour of surgery completion.

      III. Compare time-to-progression and survival to that in comparable cases performed without
      the aid of ALA.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study

      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally (PO) 4 hours before undergoing surgery. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 5 and then every 8-12 weeks
      for 27 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may have clinically documented primary malignant glioma for which
             re-resection is clinically indicated; in this instance, previous pathology slides will
             be reviewed by University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) Neuropathology prior to
             surgery; alternatively, patients may have imaging studies (magnetic resonance imaging
             [MRI] and /or computed tomography [CT] scans), which are highly indicative of a new
             malignant glioma, for which surgical resection is clinically warranted; the
             anticipated histology at resection should include: glioblastoma, gliosarcoma,
             anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma
             (mixed glioma)

          -  Prior therapy is not a consideration in protocol entry; patients with recurrence of
             known malignant gliomas are eligible following UWMC neuropathology slide review

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy is not a consideration for protocol entry

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt;
             2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  The effects of ALA on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the
             duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy is not an exclusion criterion

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ALA

          -  Personal or family history of porphyrias

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ALA is of unknown teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ALA, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ALA
