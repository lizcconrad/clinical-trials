  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate methods to help people in substance abuse treatment
      receive better psychiatric care. Patients enrolled in the study will be offered three months
      of standard psychiatric treatment, which consists of weekly individual counseling and group
      counseling, as well as regular appointments with a psychiatrist. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to standard psychiatric care or standard psychiatric care plus voucher incentives.
      These incentives can be earned by successfully attending all scheduled psychiatric
      appointments each week. The investigators expect that patients in the voucher condition will
      attend more psychiatric sessions, which will lead to greater reductions in psychiatric
      distress.

      Male and female opioid-dependent patients at Addiction Treatment Services with any current
      psychiatric disorder (N = 100) will be randomly assigned to one of two psychiatric service
      conditions: 1) reinforced on-site integrated care (ROIC), with voucher incentives contingent
      on attending weekly psychiatric sessions; or 2) standard on-site integrated care (SOIC).
      Participants in both conditions will receive access to the same schedule and range of
      psychiatric and substance abuse treatment services. Participants will be assessed for
      3-months post-randomization to determine rates of service utilization and adherence to
      psychiatric care, changes in scope and severity of psychiatric and psychosocial problems, and
      rates of drug use and treatment retention. Positive findings would have considerable
      heuristic and health care policy and practice implications. The entire study, including
      dissemination of the major findings at a national meeting and submission of the first
      manuscript, is designed to be completed within 2-years.
