  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of collection of bone marrow from
      donors treated with or without filgrastim. Giving colony-stimulating factors, such as
      filgrastim (G-CSF), to donors helps the stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so
      they can be collected and stored.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate short- and long-term toxicities in bone marrow donors treated with vs without
      filgrastim before harvest.

      II. To compare 10-year mortality and cancer in donors treated with vs without filgrastim.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease in the marrow
      recipients enrolled on COG-ASCT0631 with four parameters assessed in the bone marrow
      harvests: absolute T-cell numbers, Th1 vs Th2 profile of T-cells, dendritic cell populations,
      and T-regulatory cell content.

      OUTLINE: Donors are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (unstimulated harvest): Donors undergo conventional (i.e., unstimulated) bone marrow
      harvest on day 0.

      ARM II (stimulated harvest): Donors receive filgrastim subcutaneously on days -4 through 0.
      Donors then undergo bone marrow harvest on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, donors are followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually for up to 10 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Appropriately human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched (HLA, A, B, DRB1 identical or
             antigen mismatched [i.e., 5/6 or 6/6 antigens matched]) sibling of the bone marrow
             recipient enrolled on COG-ASCT0631

          -  Adequate size relative to the recipient (i.e., harvesting the maximum of 20 cc/kg from
             the donor would result in a bone marrow graft that will provide an adequate cell and
             volume dose to the recipient, in the opinion of the treating physician)

          -  Enrolled on the COG Umbrella Long-Term Follow-Up Study COG-ALTE05N1

          -  No sickle cell trait or sickle cell anemia/disease

          -  Not at an increased risk from bone marrow donation after filgrastim administration due
             to a pre-existing medical condition, as determined by an independent physician
             separate from the research team

          -  None of the following:

               -  Active infection, especially pulmonary

               -  Splenomegaly or a history of splenic injury

               -  Active or recent pulmonary disease (i.e., pneumonia within the past 4 weeks)

               -  A condition that would make the donor unsuitable to donate, as determined by an
                  independent physician separate from the research team

          -  No autoimmune disease
