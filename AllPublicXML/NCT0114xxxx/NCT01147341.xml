  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the study is to determine if Cimzia is safe and effective in subjects who have
      received previous treatment with a TNF-alpha inhibitor other than Cimzia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, parallel-group 12-week study of
      Cimzia with concomitant methotrexate (MTX) or other DMARD compared to MTX or other DMARD
      alone in patients with an inadequate secondary therapeutic response to a TNF-alpha inhibitor
      as defined above and active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) followed by a 12-week open-label phase
      with concomitant MTX or other DMARD and Cimzia.

      Subjects must washout from the previous TNF inhibitor for at least 4 weeks prior to the
      baseline visit. Subjects unable to tolerate MTX must have been on a stable dose of another
      non-biologic DMARD for at least 3 months. Subjects' diagnosis of RA must be based on the 1987
      Revised American Rheumatism Association Criteria for the Classification of Rheumatoid
      Arthritis.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and, up to 28 days later, at the baseline visit,
      randomized to one of two treatment groups (2:1): Cimzia or placebo (in addition to
      concomitant MTX or other DMARD). All subjects will continue MTX/other DMARD at the same dose
      utilized prior to study entry.

      After the Week 12 study visit, all subjects will have the opportunity to continue in the
      study on open-label Cimzia treatment (using an induction regimen for all subjects, regardless
      of their treatment in the blinded phase).

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Achieving an American College of Rheumatology 50% (ACR50) Response Criteria in the Cimzia Treatment Group Compared to the Placebo Group at Week 12</title>
        <description>ACR50 responders are subjects with at least 50% improvement from baseline for tender joint cout (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: 1) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 2) C-reactive protein (CRP), 3) Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale, 4) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale, 5) Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale.
HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0-3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do.
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - assessment of arthritis was measured on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = very good and 100 mm = very bad.</description>

          <description>ACR50 responders are subjects with at least 50% improvement from baseline for tender joint cout (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: 1) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 2) C-reactive protein (CRP), 3) Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale, 4) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale, 5) Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale.
HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0-3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do.
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - assessment of arthritis was measured on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = very good and 100 mm = very bad.</description>

        <description>The EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) response criteria is a classified response criteria which classifies the patients individual as non-, moderate or good responders dependent on the change and the level of the Disease Activity Score.
The Disease Activity Score(DAS28) is a continuous disease measure composite of 4 variables: 28 tender joint count, 28 swollen joint count, ESR or CRP, and participant assessment of disease activity measure on a visual analogue scale. High disease activity= &gt; 5.1, low disease activity= &lt; 3.2, and remission= &lt; 2.6. Clinically significant response= decrease of &gt;1.2 from baseline. Utilizing EULAR response criteria, DAS28 categorical responses define a good (absolute: &lt;3.2 or &gt;1.2 improvement from baseline), moderate (absolute: 3.2-5.1 or 0.6-1.2 change from baseline), or no response (absolute: &gt;5.1 or &lt;0.6 change from baseline).</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Achieving an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) Response Criteria in the Cimzia Treatment Group Compared to the Placebo Group</title>
        <description>ACR20 responders are subjects with at least 20% improvement from baseline for tender joint cout (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), and at least 3 of the 5 remaining core set measures: 1) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), 2) C-reactive protein (CRP), 3) Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain-Visual Analog Scale, 4) Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale, 5) Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity-Visual Analog Scale.
HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0-3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do.
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) - assessment of arthritis was measured on a 0 to 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = very good and 100 mm = very bad.</description>
