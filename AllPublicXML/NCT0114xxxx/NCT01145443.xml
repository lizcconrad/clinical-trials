    <textblock>
      The care of critically ill patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is an important part of
      modern health care systems. However, ICU care suffers from similar problems as the rest of
      the health care system. Powerful arguments support the concept that most of problems in
      complex systems, such as ICUs, relates to flaws in institutional systems and processes that
      hinder the ability of individuals to perform their jobs well. To fix these problems, the
      defective systems and processes must be redesigned in ways that make it easy for people to do
      their job well, and hard to make mistakes. Altering the structure of ICU care for the purpose
      of improving ICU performance is an example of Organizational Systems Engineering,
      alternatively called Total Quality Management.

      Another serious problem in ICU care is that after 2007 there will be a increasing shortage of
      physicians specializing in the care of the critically ill (Intensivists), with a 35%
      shortfall by 2030. One contributor to this shortage is that Intensivists retire at a younger
      age than do physicians in general, and often curtail their care of critically ill patients
      even before they retire. It is likely that the emotional and physical demands of this career
      choice leads Intensivists to &quot;burn out&quot; and leave the field prematurely. For these reasons it
      is important to find ways to make working as an Intensivist more sustainable so that the most
      experienced practitioners will continue in the field up to a normal retirement age.

      The way in which groups of Intensivists organize themselves to provide care in an ICU is
      highly variable. One potentially important way in which Intensivist staffing differs is in
      the degree of continuity of care. The more days in a row that the same physician cares for a
      patient the greater the continuity of care. While it is generally held that a higher
      continuity of care results in better care and better outcomes for patients, in fact there are
      no studies addressing this issue. On the other side of the coin however, it seems likely that
      working many days in a row increases the physical and emotional burdens on the Intensivist,
      increasing job distress and job burnout over time.

      A common pattern of Intensivist staffing, in which continuity of care is reduced, is when the
      Intensivist who is caring for ICU patients during the weekdays has the weekend off, during
      which one of his/her partners provides &quot;cross-coverage&quot;. While it is reasonable to
      hypothesize that cross-coverage would lead to inefficient patient care, at the same time it
      may reduce the burdens on the Intensivists.

      This purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of weekend cross-coverage on both
      ICU patients and on Intensivists. This will be a multicenter study performed in 4 member
      institutions of the Midwest Critical Care Consortium: The University of Toledo, MetroHealth
      Medical Center, Ohio State University, and Indiana University. Five adult medical ICUs from
      the six institutions will participate in this study, with two ICUs from the Ohio State
      University site.

      To answer the research questions, each participating ICU will alternate between two common
      models of Intensivist staffing. In both models an Intensivist is responsible for ICU care for
      14 days. In the Continuous model, a single Intensivist will be responsible for all 14 days.
      In the Discontinuous model, both weekends during the 14 days will be cross-covered by a
      colleague. Continuity of care is higher in the Continuous model, which has 2 physician
      transitions over a 4 week period, while the Discontinuous model has 8 transitions per 4
      weeks. Each participating ICU will use one model for 12 weeks, then switch to the other model
      for 12 weeks, and finally revert back to the first model for the final 12 weeks of this 36
      week study. To address problems of historical controls, seasonal differences, and to increase
      comparability of groups, the participating ICUs have been randomly assigned to begin the
      study either with the Continuous or Discontinuous model.

      Comparisons will be made between the two scheduling models in: (1) patient outcomes,
      specifically hospital mortality rate, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay, and
      (2) Intensivist outcomes, specifically job distress, job burnout, and the balance between
      work and home life.

      Since there is currently nothing known about whether weekend cross-coverage influences
      medical care, both models of care are common in ICUs. Thus the investigators expect that the
      findings of this study will have general relevance. While the patients admitted to the
      participating ICUs during this study would not be expected to benefit from this
      investigation, the results derived are expected to enable policy makers to make
      evidence-based decisions about this important aspect of ICU physician staffing and thus
      improve the performance and/or cost-effectiveness of ICU care, benefiting future ICU
      patients, and society.

    <description>During the study period, each participating ICU alternated between two distinct intensivist staffing formats: (i) in the Discontinuous arm of the study, there was a weekend cross-coverage format wherein an intensivist was responsible for care for a two week or half-month block, but colleagues covered the weekends within each block, or (ii) in the Continuous arm of the study, there was an uninterrupted staffing format, wherein a single intensivist was responsible for the entire two week, or half-month, period. In each ICU the study interval was divided into three phases, so that the models alternated twice in each ICU, beginning with either the weekend cross-coverage or the uninterrupted staffing formats, the four hospitals were randomly assigned between these two patterns.</description>
