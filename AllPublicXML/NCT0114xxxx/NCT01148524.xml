  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2b/3, multi-center, extension study of V72P10 to assess antibody persistence
      at 18 months after the vaccination course in study V72P10 (NCT00661713).

      Subjects who participated in study V72P10, and who meet all other enrollment criteria for
      this extension study, and a group of naïve subjects (defined as subjects who had never
      received rMenB+OMV NZ or other experimental MenB vaccines) of similar age to the subjects who
      were eligible to participate in this extension study, performed one study visit in which a
      single blood sample was drawn for MenB serological analyses.
