  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this study are (1) to determine the clinical phenotypes and natural
      history of hepatic RC and FAO disorders, (2) to determine the correlation between genotype
      and phenotype, (3) to determine if circulating biomarkers reflect diagnosis and predict liver
      disease progression and survival with the native liver, (4) to determine the clinical outcome
      of these disorders following liver transplantation, and (5) to develop a repository of serum,
      plasma, urine, tissue and DNA specimens that will be used in ancillary studies. To accomplish
      these aims, the ChiLDREN investigators at clinical sites (currently 15 sites) will
      prospectively collect defined data and specimens in a uniform fashion at fixed intervals in a
      relatively large number of subjects. Clinical information and DNA samples to be collected
      from subjects and their parents will enhance the potential for meaningful research in these
      disorders. A biobank of subject specimens and DNA samples will be established for use in
      ancillary studies to be performed in addition to this study.

      This study will be conducted as part of the NIH-supported Childhood Liver Disease Research
      and Education Network (ChiLDREN). ChiLDREN is investigating rare cholestatic liver diseases
      of childhood: alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT), Alagille's Syndrome (AGS), progressive
      familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC), bile acid synthesis defects and mitochondrial
      hepatopathies (all previously studied by the Cholestatic Liver Disease Consortium [CLiC]);
      biliary atresia (previously studied by the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium [BARC]);
      neonatal hepatitis; and cystic fibrosis liver disease, which is studied by a new branch of
      ChiLDREN known as the Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease (CFLD) Network.

      In this protocol, mitochondrial hepatopathies in children and young adults will be
      investigated. The focus will be on respiratory chain defects (RC) and defects of fatty acid
      oxidation (FAO). There is little known about the full spectrum of severity and long-term
      natural history of mitochondrial hepatopathies. Moreover, these disorders have not been
      subject to prospective, rigorous clinicopathological scrutiny.
