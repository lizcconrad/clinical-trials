      The purpose of this study is to determine whether operative fixation of unilateral flail
      chest provides greater benefit than non-operative treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chest trauma is frequent in the multiply-injured patient and is directly responsible for
      20-25% of trauma deaths. Additionally, chest trauma is a major contributory factor in another
      25% of deaths after trauma. Besides short term mortality, injuries to the chest result in
      significant morbidity and cost of care and long term disability. Among patients sustaining
      chest trauma, flail chest is one of the more serious injuries. Patients require prolonged
      ventilation, ICU and hospital stays and have a high incidence of pulmonary infections.
      Survivors often go on to have significant impairment of pulmonary function and over half may
      never return to gainful employment.

      The standard therapy of injuries to the chest wall, including flail chest has been effective
      analgesia, pulmonary toilet with postural drainage and aggressive chest physical therapy.
      Despite these measures, flail chest patients often do not do well. Early operative fixation
      (surgical anchoring and bracing of bones) to stabilize the chest wall and restore pulmonary
      dynamics has always been an attractive option. With improvements in patient selection,
      availability of good modern anesthesia and critical care, and mechanical fixation devices,
      small studies and several case reports testify to the feasibility of the concept and possible
      short and long term benefits. All but one small institutional study are retrospective in
      nature limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. In that small single institutional
      prospective trial in which patients with flail chest were randomized to either early
      operative fixation or standard non-operative therapy, patients randomized to early operative
      fixation showed significant improvements in both short- and long-term health outcomes
      resulting in lower in-hospital costs in the surgically treated group. Despite these very
      impressive results, although prospective, it is one study with a small number of patients
      from a single institution. The question of the benefits of operative fixation can only be
      conclusively answered by a larger multi-institutional prospective randomized study.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults &gt;21 years and &lt;75 years

          2. &quot;Stove-in chest&quot; to encompass both

               1. Unilateral flail chest (&gt;3 ribs fractured at two places) or

               2. Contiguous rib fractures with at least 2 ribs pushed in &gt; the rib diameter of the
                  pushed in rib

          3. Mechanically ventilated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient unlikely to survive due to the trauma or age or multiple co-morbidities

          2. Stove-in chest patients that do not require early (less than or equal to 48 hours of
             injury) ventilatory support

          3. Bilateral flail chest

          4. Sternal flail

          5. P/F ratio &lt; 200:1 over a period of greater than or equal to 6 hours while on the
             ventilator.

          6. Other injuries that will likely prolong tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
             eg significant head injury resulting in low GCS (Glasgow Coma Score, a scale used to
             assess the central nervous system in patients who have undergone trauma), spinal cord
             injury resulting in paralysis of some or all of the respiratory muscles etc. These are
             merely examples. It is in the opinion of the investigator/surgeon what injuries would
             prolong tracheal intubation.

          7. Any contra-indication to surgery including severe immunosuppression or severe chronic
             disease making elective surgery dangerous in the opinion of the surgeon

          8. Inability to proceed with any aspect of critical care due to personal beliefs, living
             will etc eg non acceptance of blood products

          9. Inability to obtain informed consent.

         10. Subject's refusal for follow up

         11. Pregnant women

         12. Prisoners

         13. Any other reason for which the potential subject is not a good candidate, in the
             opinion of the investigator.

        If the site investigator believes that a patient is a good candidate for the study (i.e.
        requires ventilation primarily due to altered chest wall mechanics) but fails to meet all
        criteria, site may contact Dr Ajai Malhotra to see if a waiver will be granted.

    <baseline>
      <population>Adult patients, 21 to 75 years old, admitted to the trauma unit with injuries that include either stove in chest (contiguous rib fractures with at least 2 ribs pushed in a distance greater than the rib diameter of the pushed in rib) or a unilateral flail chest (3 or more ribs fractures at two places). Patients must be on a ventilator.</population>

          <title>Operative Rib Fixation</title>
          <description>Randomized subjects will be operated upon within 72 hours of ventilation (early fixation) to stabilize the stove-in segment. Where all fractured ribs are accessible and the number of fractured ribs is few, stabilization of all fractured ribs would be the goal. However, where fractured ribs are in areas difficult to access, enough ribs, based on surgeon judgment, would be fixed to stabilize the stove-in segment. Post-operatively, the patients would receive the standard of care, similar to what is outlined for the non-operative arm.
Operative fixation will be accomplished utilizing the MatrixRIB Fixation System (Synthes CMF, West Chester, PA, USA) according to the device's instructions for use. Sites will obtain the product based on their medical center's normal purchasing practices.

Where all fractured ribs are accessible and the number of fractured ribs is few, stabilization of all fractured ribs would be the goal. However, where fractured ribs are in areas difficult to access, enough ribs, based on surgeon judgment, would be fixed to stabilize the stove-in segment.

Operative fixation will be accomplished utilizing the MatrixRIB Fixation System (Synthes CMF, West Chester, PA, USA) according to the device's instructions for use. Sites will obtain the product based on their medical center's normal purchasing practices.

            <title>Operative Rib Fixation</title>
            <description>Randomized subjects will be operated upon within 72 hours of ventilation (early fixation) to stabilize the stove-in segment. Where all fractured ribs are accessible and the number of fractured ribs is few, stabilization of all fractured ribs would be the goal. However, where fractured ribs are in areas difficult to access, enough ribs, based on surgeon judgment, would be fixed to stabilize the stove-in segment. Post-operatively, the patients would receive the standard of care, similar to what is outlined for the non-operative arm.
Operative fixation will be accomplished utilizing the MatrixRIB Fixation System (Synthes CMF, West Chester, PA, USA) according to the device's instructions for use. Sites will obtain the product based on their medical center's normal purchasing practices.
