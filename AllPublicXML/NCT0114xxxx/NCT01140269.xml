      The purpose of this study is to determine if rapid early detection of the bacteria causing
      sepsis in burn patients improves patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burn patients have lost their primary barrier to microorganism invasion and therefore are
      continually and chronically exposed to pathogens. Ninety-seven percent of patients with &gt;20%
      total body surface area (TBSA) burns develop septicemia; predominantly involving gram
      positive cocci including MRSA and methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Blood culture
      (BC) is the traditional detection method for septicemia. However, antibiotics and inadequate
      sample volumes can impair detection by BC and results can take 3-4 days.

      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represents a potential adjunct to BC. Pathogens are detected
      in a growth-independent manner by targeting their genetic make-up. Quantitative determining
      of pathogen DNA using PCR could aid in determining antimicrobial drug therapy efficacy by
      providing results on the same testing day as opposed to 3-4 days with BC. PCR may also detect
      persistent infections during antimicrobial therapy when culture samples are inhibited.

      The aims of this study are:(1)to correlate quantitative PCR results with that of the BC; (2)
      to test the clinical application of PCR results with clinical outcomes of treatment of
      presumptive diagnosis of staphylococcal sepsis.

    <description>PCR will be used in parallel with routine laboratory tests such as culture. Treatment for PCR results will be based on the standard of care. Treatment of the patient will be dependent on the physician's clinical judgment based on existing clinical information including PCR, microbiology, patient physical presentation, and other laboratory results.</description>

    <description>PCR samples will test for Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) from wound swab and positive blood culture samples to augment treatment decisions. Serial PCR testing will follow after positive results to catalog pathogen loads over the course of treatment in a blinded fashion.</description>
