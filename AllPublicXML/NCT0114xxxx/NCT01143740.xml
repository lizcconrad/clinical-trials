    <textblock>
      This open-label study will evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of RO5045337 in
      patients with liposarcoma who are eligible for debulking surgery. Prior to surgery, patients
      will receive 2-3 cycles of RO5045337, orally for 10 days followed by 18 days of rest per
      cycle. Anticipated time on study treatment is 3 months. Patients with an incomplete resection
      may be treated for an additional 3 cycles with RO5045337.
