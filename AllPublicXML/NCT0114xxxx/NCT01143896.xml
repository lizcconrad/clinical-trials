    <textblock>
      Chronic infection with hepatitis C (CHC) is a common and expensive condition, and it
      disproportionately affects Veterans. Treatment with antiviral therapy reduces liver disease
      progression and improves health related quality of life. However, ~70% of Veterans with CHC
      are considered ineligible for antiviral treatment. Most of these patients are excluded due to
      the presence of co-existing depression and substance use. The proposed project will adapt and
      adopt an evidence-based collaborative depression care model in CHC clinics. By removing the
      leading contraindication for antiviral treatment, this project will potentially yield
      benefits that go far beyond the obvious quality of life benefit from antidepressant therapy
      itself.

      Project Background and Rationale: Depression is highly prevalent, yet under-diagnosed and
      under-treated in CHC. Treatment models that increase collaborative management of depression
      by mental health and physical health clinicians can improve quality and outcomes, and
      collaborative care models have been identified as the best-practice for depression in VA
      primary care settings. However, the antiviral treatment for CHC patients may not benefit from
      the existing primary care-mental health integration because the antiviral treatment is
      time-limited and conducted in specialty clinics. Although there is little evidence evaluating
      the effects of collaborative depression care in specialty settings, QUERI HIV-hepatitis
      initiated one of the first such efforts that effectively implemented collaborative depression
      care in HIV clinics. Built on this experience, an intensive yet focused collaborative care
      model in CHC clinics may be effective in improving not only depression but also CHC care.
      This proposed study, &quot;Hepatitis-Translating Initiatives for Depression into Effective
      Solutions (HEP-TIDES)&quot; will target this issue.

      Project Objectives: The proposal has three overarching primary aims and one exploratory aim.
      The primary aims are (1) adapt and adopt the collaborative care model for improving
      depression care in specialty CHC care settings, (2) compare the effectiveness of HEP-TIDES to
      usual care in improving CHC care, and (3) compare the effectiveness of HEP-TIDES to usual
      care in improving depression care. The exploratory aim is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
      of HEP-TIDES versus usual care.

      Project Methods: HEP-TIDES is a multi-site, multi-method implementation project. HEP-TIDES
      will use evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) methods to adapt and implement depression
      screening and the collaborative care model for depression in the CHC clinics at 4 disparate
      VA facilities (aim 1). HEP-TIDES will involve CHC and mental health providers working with an
      off-site depression care team comprised of a depression care nurse manager, pharmacist, and a
      psychiatrist. The purpose of the team will be to support CHC and mental health clinicians in
      delivering evidence-based stepped-care depression treatment. The adapted model will also take
      into account the substance use disorders among CHC patients. HEP-TIDES implementation will be
      assessed using a formative evaluation of the implementation process and a summative
      evaluation of a randomized controlled implementation trial of collaborative depression care
      in 242 patients (aims 2 and 3).

    <measure>Number of Patients Who Initiated Hepatitis C Antiviral Treatment Within 12 Months of Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Antiviral treatment initiation was measured dichotomously by assigning a value of 1 if the patient received at least one prescription of interferon within 12 months of enrollment, and a value of 0 otherwise.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Care: Treatment Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression outcomes were assessed using the item mean score from the 20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) collected at baseline and 12-months. The SLC-20 items are scored from 0 to 4 and averaged to provide a mean depression severity score ranging from 0 to 4. Depression treatment response was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in the mean SCL-20 score compared with baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Care: Depression Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression outcomes were assessed using the item mean score from the 20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) collected at baseline and 12-months. The SLC-20 items are scored from 0 to 4 and averaged to provide a mean depression severity score ranging from 0 to 4. Remission was defined as an item mean SCL-20 score of less than 0.5.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Care: Change From Baseline in Number of Depression Free Days (DFDs) at 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in Depression Free Days was assessed using the item mean score from the 20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) collected at baseline and 12-months. The SLC-20 items are scored from 0 to 4 and averaged to provide a mean depression severity score ranging from 0 to 4. Depression-free days (DFDs) were calculated using an SCL-20 score of less than 0.5 for depression-free and 2.0 or higher for fully symptomatic, and scores in between were assigned a linear proportional value.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Hepatitis C Care: Quality Indicators: Proportion of QIs Received</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of CHC Indicator Measure is based on a Delphi panel-derived list of quality indicators (QI) in CHC care. The list spans the following domains of care, i.e., CHC-specific function of care (diagnosis, specialty evaluation, treatment, etc); general function of care (diagnosis, treatment, follow-up); and mode of care (encounter, medication, immunization, counseling, etc). Adherence to a given QI is scored as 1 if there is evidence in the patient EMR for the indicator being satisfied. The quality of CHC care at the patient level is calculated by dividing the number of QIs for which that individual received the indicated care by the number of QIs for which the individual is eligible for during the length of time the patient is enrolled in the HEP-TIDES 12-month study timeframe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Adherence: Medication Possession Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence was measured using the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) calculation: Pharmacy refill data was used to calculate a medication possession ratio (MPR), by dividing the number of days supply of a medication received by the number of day's supply the patient needed to be able to take the medication continuously. An MPR closer to 1.0 indicates better adherence and has been associated with lower rates of hospital admission in veterans and greater symptom improvement.</description>

    <description>Depression collaborative care: includes a stepped-care model. The 5 steps include symptom and self-management monitoring by a depression care manager (DCM) and the following: 1) watchful waiting, 2) treatment recommendations (counseling or pharmacotherapy), 3) pharmacotherapy recommended by a Clinical Pharmacist, 4) combination pharmacotherapy and specialty mental health counseling, and 5) referral to mental health. The DCM: provides education about depression and depression treatment options; assesses the patient's treatment preferences and barriers, and the patient's current depression severity and mental health comorbidity; initiates a patient self-management plan, and assess treatment adherence. The DCM uses standard alcohol screening and brief intervention. The DCM also screens for street drug use and recommends referral for to the local substance abuse treatment programs.</description>

            <description>Depression collaborative care: includes a stepped-care model. The 5 steps include symptom and self-management monitoring by a depression care manager (DCM) and the following: 1) watchful waiting, 2) treatment recommendations (counseling or pharmacotherapy), 3) pharmacotherapy recommended by a Clinical Pharmacist, 4) combination pharmacotherapy and specialty mental health counseling, and 5) referral to mental health. The DCM: provides education about depression and depression treatment options; assesses the patient's treatment preferences and barriers, and the patient's current depression severity and mental health comorbidity; initiates a patient self-management plan, and assess treatment adherence. The DCM uses standard alcohol screening and brief intervention. The DCM also screens for street drug use and recommends referral for to the local substance abuse treatment programs.</description>

        <title>Quality of Hepatitis C Care: Quality Indicators: Proportion of QIs Received</title>
        <description>Quality of CHC Indicator Measure is based on a Delphi panel-derived list of quality indicators (QI) in CHC care. The list spans the following domains of care, i.e., CHC-specific function of care (diagnosis, specialty evaluation, treatment, etc); general function of care (diagnosis, treatment, follow-up); and mode of care (encounter, medication, immunization, counseling, etc). Adherence to a given QI is scored as 1 if there is evidence in the patient EMR for the indicator being satisfied. The quality of CHC care at the patient level is calculated by dividing the number of QIs for which that individual received the indicated care by the number of QIs for which the individual is eligible for during the length of time the patient is enrolled in the HEP-TIDES 12-month study timeframe.</description>

            <description>Depression collaborative care model: The depression collaborative care arm will include a stepped-care model. The five steps are expected to include symptom and self-management monitoring by depression care manager (DCM) and the following: 1) watchful waiting, 2) treatment recommendations (counseling or pharmacotherapy), 3) pharmacotherapy recommended by a Clinical Pharmacist, 4) combination pharmacotherapy and specialty mental health counseling, and 5) referral to mental health. The DCM will provide education about depression and depression treatment options, assess the patient's treatment preferences and barriers, assess the patient's current depression severity and mental health comorbidity, initiate a self-management plan, and assess treatment adherence. The DCM will use the alcohol screening and brief intervention. The DCM will also screen for street drug use and will recommend referral of participants who are using street drugs to the local substance abuse treatment programs.</description>

An MPR closer to 1.0 indicates better adherence and has been associated with lower rates of hospital admission in veterans and greater symptom improvement.</description>
