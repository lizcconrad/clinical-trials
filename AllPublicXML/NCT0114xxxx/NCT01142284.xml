  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based upon evidence of efficacy and safety of both cilostazol and probucol administration in
      independent randomized controlled trials in PAD and CAD, the present trial seeks to
      investigate the effect of concomitant administration of cilostazol and probucol on FMD
      compared to each drug individually, as well as to evaluate biomarker measures and safety
      indices in this context.

      Primary:

        1. To evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of cilostazol and probucol on the
           12-week change in FMD from baseline compared, with individual drugs alone.

        2. To assess the safety of concomitant administration of cilostazol and probucol in
           peripheral artery disease (PAD) subjects complicated with coronary artery disease (CAD)
           as determined by physical examination, vital signs, adverse events (AEs), laboratory
           tests, ECGs.

      Secondary:

        1. To evaluate the effect of cilostazol and probucol administered concomitantly and as
           individual drugs, compared with control, on changes in FMD from baseline to Weeks 6 and
           12.

        2. To evaluate the effect of cilostazol and probucol administered concomitantly and as
           individual drugs, compared with control, on changes in metabolic, inflammatory,
           oxidative, and platelet biomarkers from baseline to Weeks 6 and 12.

        3. To evaluate the effect of cilostazol and probucol administered concomitantly and as
           individual drugs, compared with control, on the time course (over the 12-week treatment
           period) of changes in FMD and biomarkers levels.

        4. To assess the effect of drug withdrawal on these endpoints at follow-up (from Week 12 to
           Week 16).

        5. To explore the relationship between changes in FMD and changes in the biomarker levels
           at Week 12.
