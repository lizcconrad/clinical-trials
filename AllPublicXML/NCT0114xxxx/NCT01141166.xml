      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an individual multifactorial intervention on
      falls and undernutrition risk in very older people in the community.

    <textblock>
      Design: Randomized, controlled trial.

      Method: Three hundred and twenty eight people born in 1924, after recruitment will be
      followed for a three year period. Subjects received two in-home visits from a trained nurse
      or physicians who assessed falls and nutritional risk factors using an algorithm.

      The intervention consisted of recommendations to the subject and their primary physician, and
      other providers, telephone calls, and exercise and nutritional plan. Control subjects
      received a general primary care assessment.

      Measurements: the primary outcome were rate of falls and rate of undernourished risk.
      Secondary outcomes included different geriatrics characteristics.The outcomes of this study
      will provide important new information to reduce the incidence of falls and the risk of
      undernutrition of this population by intervention. Significant differences are not expected
      according to social-demographics sex and other factors, but they are expected by other
      obtained factors and indices that could allow to detection of octogenarian people with great
      risk of deterioration in just a short time.

    <measure>Different geriatrics characteristics</measure>
    <description>Functional, cognitive and nutritional status and social risk were assessed by instruments currently used in geriatric practice. Functional status was measured using the BI (Mahoney and Barthel, 1965) for the basic ADL, and the Lawton index (LI) (Lawton and Brody, 1969). Cognitive function was measured by the Spanish version (MEC) (Lobo et al., 1999) of the MMSE. Comorbidity by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI)and the others.</description>
