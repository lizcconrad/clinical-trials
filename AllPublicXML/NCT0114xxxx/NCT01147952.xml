  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise is known to produce significant health benefits and to reduce the risk of
      heart diseases, although how this benefit occurs is not well understood. White blood cells
      are known to be involved in triggering heart attacks, and which genes are switched on or off
      in white blood cells determines whether they have beneficial or harmful effects. Previous
      studies, and studies ongoing in our group, have demonstrated measurement of peripheral blood
      gene expression (which reflects white blood cell gene expression) is able to distinguish
      between patients with and without coronary artery disease, or patients who are able to
      develop good compared with poor coronary collateral arteries. Therefore, the gene expression
      signature in peripheral blood may provide novel diagnostic or prognostic information, and
      insight into the pathogenesis of heart disease.

      We therefore hypothesise that exercise alters peripheral blood gene expression in patients
      with coronary artery disease and angina. This will identify possible ways that exercise
      improves angina and reduces the risk of heart disease.
