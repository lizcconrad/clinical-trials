      Evaluate chemotherapy related tumor markers on non small cell lung cancer by fluorescent in
      situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, targets to be studied include EGFR, c-MET,
      topoisomerase II, p53, topoisomerase I, thymidylate synthase, ERCC1, tau, c-myc, RRM1, class
      III tubulin. These targets have been chosen because they are targets for chemotherapeutic
      agents that are currently used in clinical management of these diseases. In total 50 specimen
      will be studied, approximately one third have mutations/deletions of the EGFR gene.To attempt
      to establish a correlation between the pre-selected tumor markers and response to
      chemotherapy, and thus to be able to create a clinically useful classification that would
      provide clinical guidance for selection of the most effective chemotherapy for a individual
      patient, and thus be able to logically design more effective clinical trials for the future.
