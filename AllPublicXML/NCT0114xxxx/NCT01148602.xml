  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To reduce door-to-needle times in acute stroke treatment. Using an organizational behaviour
      intervention (a large stopwatch), we will post a visual cue to remind all parties that &quot;time
      is brain&quot;. We hypothesize that this simple visual cue will improve door-to-CT scan times and
      door-to-needle treatment times, and thus improve treatment response, and reduce adverse
      events.

  <detailed_description>

      We will construct a large, &quot;in-your-face&quot; red LED stopwatch-clock that is the intervention.
      The clock will be attached to the stretcher of patients presenting for hyperacute stroke
      treatment (consideration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment at the moment of
      their Emergency department arrival. This will act as a constant visual reminder to all team
      members (physicians, RN's, CT technologists) of the urgency of the situation. The study will
      be a block randomization, by week of presentation. All patients presenting during &quot;on&quot; weeks
      will have a stopwatch timer with them during the hyperacute stroke workup. During &quot;off&quot;
      weeks, the clocks will not be used.
