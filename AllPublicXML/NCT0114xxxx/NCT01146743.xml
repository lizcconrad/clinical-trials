  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to conduct a prospective, randomized non-inferiority study to
      compare clinical outcome between endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided gallbladder drainage and
      percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) in high risk acute cholecystitis
      patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome is to compare clinical resolution rate of EUS-guided gallbladder drainage
      versus percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage in acute cholecystitis patients with
      high risk.

      The secondary outcome is to compare complications, conversion rate to open cholecystectomy
      during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

    <description>EUS-guided gallbladder drainage was performed with a linear-array echoendoscope. The initial puncture was performed at the antrum of the stomach or bulb of the duodenum and was chosen to access the gallbladder body or neck and avoid visible vessels. After removal of the needle, a 6F or 7F bougie were inserted and then removed to dilate the tract. Afterward, nasobiliary drainage tube or stent was placed.</description>
