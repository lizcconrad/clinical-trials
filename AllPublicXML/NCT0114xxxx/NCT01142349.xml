    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy of three group interventions for people with co-morbid
      osteoarthritis (OA) and insomnia to help them manage their OA symptoms. The investigators
      hypothesize that a combination cognitive-behavioral treatment will produce significantly
      greater initial and long-term improvements in OA symptoms than will the other two treatments.

      This study is only for members of the Group Health Cooperative (GHC) of Puget Sound who have
      both osteoarthritis pain and insomnia. The first part of the study involves filling out a
      mailed survey. Based on the results of the survey some respondents will be eligible for the
      second part of the study. Our goal in the second part is to test three different treatments
      for managing OA symptoms. The programs teach about things people with arthritis can do to
      improve the quality of their lives. All three programs deal with pain, sleep, mood and
      activityâ€”but each has a slightly different focus. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three programs. Each program is made up of six weekly group sessions that last
      about 90-120 minutes. The programs will be co-led by licensed therapists and each will
      include 8-12 members. Study participants will also take part in a series of visits at their
      homes over the next 18 months. At each visit the investigators will ask them to do a few
      other study activities, such as keep a 7-day diary of their sleep and fill out a survey about
      their arthritis pain. With their permission the investigators will also ask them to let us
      collect some information from their GHC medical records.
