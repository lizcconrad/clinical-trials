      RATIONALE: Acupuncture may help relieve dry mouth caused by radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying to see how well one set of acupuncture
      points work in comparison to a different set of acupuncture points or standard therapy in
      treating dry mouth caused by radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether acupuncture can symptomatically improve moderate or severe
           radiation-induced xerostomia (grade 2 or 3) in patients with head and neck cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To explore the duration of response (up to a maximum of 6 months) in the subgroup of
           patients who report a response to the acupuncture intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to stage of disease,
      age, sex, the mean of parotid radiotherapy doses received, and baseline Xerostomia
      Questionnaire (XQ) scores. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard oral hygiene care for 8 weeks, including instructions
           regarding mouth rinses, use of lip balms, use of mild fluoride toothpaste, the
           importance of adequate oral hydration, and other standard advice.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive acupuncture at 3 sites on each ear, on the chin, on each
           forearm, and on each leg twice a week for 4 weeks. Patients with minor response may
           continue treatment for an additional 4 weeks. Patients also receive standard oral
           hygiene as in arm 1.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive acupuncture twice a week for 4 weeks and standard oral hygiene
           as in arm 1. Patients with minor response may continue treatment for an additional 4
           weeks.

      Patients complete XQ, the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory for Head and Neck Cancer
      (MDASI-HN), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) questionnaires at
      baseline and at the end of weeks 4, 8, and12. Patients with partial response or minor
      response, according to week-8 questionnaires, complete XQ, MDASI-HN, and the FACT-G at the
      end of week 12 and at 6 months. Patients in group 2 and 3 also complete the Acupuncture
      Expectancy Scale (AES). Saliva is also collected at these time points.
