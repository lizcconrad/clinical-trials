  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether group educational visits improve the
      quality of life of patients referred to the Dermatology Clinic. Secondary outcomes will be to
      determine whether group educational visits influences other key elements of patient care such
      as topical steroid usage, disease exacerbations, emergency visits, and phone calls to the
      office. Lastly, the investigators hope to evaluate which aspects of the educational visit
      were found to be the most helpful to families caring for children with atopic dermatitis
      (AD). Patients will be new atopic dermatitis referrals to OHSU dermatology and pediatric
      dermatology clinics. All consecutive patients with such appointments during a three month
      time period will be screened for participation in the study. Parents will be recruited via
      telephone. In the intervention group, parents will be invited to participate in a group
      education visit prior to their first appointment with a dermatologist. All parents in the
      study will fill out questionnaires. The children involved in the study will be assigned an
      eczema severity score during their routine visits, but this will be incorporated into the
      regular clinic assessment. The Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale (CADIS) assesses the
      quality of life in households with children who have atopic dermatitis. The Eczema Area and
      Severity Index (EASI) measures the extent and severity of the patient's atopic dermatitis.
      The change in CADIS scores will be analyzed to determine if there is a more significant
      improvement in quality of life for the group in which parents receive the group eczema
      education visit.
