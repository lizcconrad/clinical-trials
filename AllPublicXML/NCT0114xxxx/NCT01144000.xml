    <textblock>
      To determine the outcome and safety of a combined antimicrobial treatment involving
      daptomycin and surgical approach involving retention or short-interval two-stage exchange of
      the implant. Patients with hip, knee and shoulder Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) caused by
      methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci will be included and followed
      during 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective open observational clinical study (phase 2) patients with hip, knee and
      shoulder PJI (as defined below) caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant
      staphylococci will be included. An informed consent will be obtained prior to patient
      inclusion. Medical records will be prospectively abstracted for demographic characteristics,
      clinical, radiographic, laboratory and microbiologic data using a standardized case report
      form (CRF). After inclusion, intravenous daptomycin 10 mg/kg (calculated as actual body
      weight) is given once daily for 2-3 weeks, followed by oral rifampin-containing antibiotics
      for a total of 3 months (as outlined below).

      Two surgical modalities will be applied according to the PJI treatment algorithm:

        -  Open debridement and retention of the prosthesis (change of mobile parts): daptomycin
           will be combined with rifampin.

        -  Two-stage exchange of the prosthesis with a short interval (2-3 weeks): daptomycin of
           the prosthesis: daptomycin will be used alone.

      The decision whether the implant will be retained or removed is based on objective criteria
      of the treatment algorithm and is not subject to bias. All consecutive patients with a
      staphylococcal PJI infection of the hip, knee or shoulder prosthesis will be included, if no
      exclusion criterion is present, obviating the selection bias. Since not many specialized
      institutions are treating patients with PJI, we expect low number of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed consent has been obtained;

          2. Subject is 18-80 years of age;

          3. Subject has a PJI of the hip, knee and shoulder prosthesis caused by Staphylococcus
             aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) susceptible to daptomycin and
             rifampin;

          4. Surgical approach: Debridement and retention of the prosthesis OR a two-stage
             prosthesis exchange with a short interval (2-3 weeks). The selection of the surgical
             procedure is performed according to the PJI treatment algorithm;

          5. Subject is willing to participate in the study, to follow protocol study treatment
             regimen, and to comply with all planned follow-up assessments;

          6. Females of childbearing potential are willing to practice reliable birth control
             measures other than oral contraceptives (e.g., condoms or diaphragms together with a
             spermicidal foam or gel) and willing to undergo a urine pregnancy test prior to study
             entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance rate ≤30 ml/min, as determined
             by the Cockcroft-Gault equation at inclusion);

          2. Significant hepatic dysfunction at inclusion (AST or ALT ≥4 x upper limit of normal
             value);

          3. Elevated creatin phosphokinase (CPK) ≥2 x upper limit of normal value at inclusion

          4. PJI caused by additional microorganism;

          6. Subject has been previously enrolled in the study or is currently enrolled in another
             investigational study previously enrolled in the study or is currently enrolled in
             another investigational study, which deviates from the treatment algorithm;

          7. Subject had prior exposure to daptomycin within the past 3 months;

          8. Allergy or intolerance to daptomycin or rifampin, known hypersensitivity;
