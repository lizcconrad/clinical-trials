      Statins (such as simvastatin or Zocor) are the most effective and widely prescribed
      medications to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the frequency of heart attacks, cardiac
      deaths and strokes. Unfortunately, statins can cause muscle discomfort or pain called
      &quot;myalgia&quot; in patients treated with these drugs. These symptoms often cause patients who need
      these medications to stop taking the drug. The cause of statin muscle pain is not known, but
      it is thought that a reduction of a vitamin-like substance called Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) during
      statin treatment may play a role. CoQ10 is a vitamin like substance and is not a drug
      approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This study will look at the
      effects of CoQ10 supplements on individuals who develop muscle symptoms while on simvastatin.

      The investigators hope to test the hypothesis that CoQ10 supplementation compared to placebo
      in patients with documented statin myalgia reduces the intensity of pain during statin
      treatment.

      Study Overview: We estimate, based on the calculations detailed below that 80 subjects with
      documented statin myalgia will be required to test our hypothesis. Consequently, 135 patients
      with statin myopathic complaints will be recruited from the Cholesterol Management Center at
      Hartford Hospital, newspaper and radio advertisements and contact with physicians' offices.
      Subjects will be withdrawn from all lipid lowering medications for at least 4 weeks. Subjects
      will then have serum measured for baseline lipids, liver, kidney, and thyroid function,
      creatine kinase (CK) and CoQ10 values and be randomized to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg
      daily or matching placebo for up to 2 months. Subjects will be called weekly to assess
      symptoms. Blood measurements will be repeated and treatment (simvastatin or placebo) will
      stopped after 2 months or after subjects have experienced muscle symptoms continuously for
      one week. After 4 weeks, subjects will cross over to the alternative placebo or simvastatin
      treatment and the monitoring and measurement process will be repeated. Those patients
      developing myalgia during statin treatment, but not during placebo, will enter the CoQ10
      study, again after 4 weeks off treatment. These subjects will have serum lipids, liver, CK,
      vitamin D and CoQ10 levels measured, 4mL of blood sample will be stored for future white
      blood cell analysis and they will undergo tests of muscle performance and exercise capacity.
      They will then be randomized to placebo or CoQ10 treatment arms, &quot;loaded&quot; with placebo or
      CoQ10 to ensure adequate tissue levels for two weeks, and then retreated with simvastatin 20
      mg daily. Subjects will be called weekly to inquire about muscle symptoms. Blood measurements
      will be repeated, another 4mL of blood sample will be stored for future white blood cell
      analysis and treatment (simvastatin/CoQ10 or simvastatin/placebo) will be stopped after 2
      months or after subjects have experienced muscle symptoms continuously for one week. After 4
      weeks subjects will cross over to the alternative simvastatin/CoQ10 or simvastatin/placebo
      treatment and the monitoring and measurement will be repeated. The primary endpoint will be
      the intensity of pain at eight weeks, or after subjects have had continuous symptoms for a
      week (or less in the case of intolerable symptoms), whichever comes first. We will also
      determine time in days to the onset of repeat myopathic symptoms and measure muscle
      performance including skeletal muscle strength and endurance and maximal aerobic exercise
      capacity using techniques used in our present NIH funded research project The Effect of
      Statins on Skeletal Muscle Function (R01 HL081893). We will measure muscle strength,
      endurance and aerobic capacity because weakness is a frequent, but largely unquantified,
      complaint among patients with statin myalgia and its prevention with CoQ10 is therefore
      important. Also, some investigators have reported changes in the rest and exercise
      respiratory exchange ratio (RER) with statin therapy implying an alteration in cellular
      substrate metabolism with statins that may be influenced by CoQ10 treatment.

      Study Subjects: Subjects will be recruited from the Cholesterol Management Center, which sees
      approximately 20 new patients weekly, the majority of whom have statin myalgia and who are
      referred because of Dr. Thompson's expertise in this topic, via advertisements and by
      physician contact by mail and email informing them of the study. Subjects will be reimbursed
      $500 for their participation in the study.

      Study Definition of Statin-Related Myopathic Complaints: Statin myopathic symptoms have been
      poorly defined in the medical literature. For the purpose of this study, subjects will be
      considered to have had prior statin related complaints and recruited for participation in the
      study if all of the following occur:

        1. They developed new myalgia, cramps, or muscle aching during statin treatment;

        2. The symptoms resolved within 4 weeks of stopping the statin. Subjects meeting these
           criteria will be recruited into the study. To ensure that only patients with documented
           statin myalgia are entered into the CoQ10 trial, all subjects with a history of statin
           myalgia will be treated for up to 8 weeks with simvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo in a
           double-blind, cross-over protocol.

      Those developing statin myalgia only during simvastatin treatment will be advanced to the
      CoQ10 trial.

      Throughout the study, subjects will be contacted by phone weekly to inquire about muscle
      complaints using the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) (BPI-SF) (18). Results will be
      recorded on paper forms and entered into the database. During the phone contacts, subjects
      with symptoms for statin myopathy will have a CK level determined within 72 hours and while
      on study drug. If the CK is &gt; 10 times upper limits of normal (UNL), the standard diagnosis
      of myositis, and is unassociated with recent exercise, the drug will be stopped and the
      subject will undergo prompt repeat testing and be removed from the study. If the CK is &lt; 10
      UNL, the drug will be continued until the subject has had symptoms for 1 week to document
      that the symptoms are not transitory. After 1 week of persistent symptoms or as soon as
      possible if the patient has intolerable symptoms, the subject will undergo final testing and
      have completed the study. This reduces undue subject burden such that subjects do not have to
      maintain statin treatment for multiple weeks with pain symptoms. Subjects who do not report
      recurrent symptoms will be treated for 8 weeks, at which time they will undergo final testing
      and have completed the study.

      Justification of Primary Endpoint: We will examine the ability of CoQ10 to reduce the
      intensity of pain because many patients would remain on statin therapy if the discomfort were
      tolerable. Consequently, increasing pain tolerability is a key clinical measure. We selected
      8 weeks of therapy for the simvastatin vs placebo and CoQ10 vs placebo sections of the study
      because in the largest clinical study, the median time to onset of myalgia in statin naïve
      subjects was 1 month and statin rechallenge typically reproduces symptoms more rapidly.
      Consequently, most subjects with true statin myalgia will have clearly developed symptoms at
      or before 8 weeks, the point at which study procedures are completed, allowing us to
      accurately assess the impact of CoQ10 on muscle pain intensity. Except for chronic aspirin
      use, commonly recommended in patients at risk for heart disease, or in patients chronically
      using pain medications even off statin therapy, over the counter pain medication use for
      myalgic or myopathic symptoms will be prohibited during the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will not exclude patients with diagnosed CAD, peripheral vascular disease or
             diabetes since these patients warrant aggressive lipid treatment, and would benefit
             from any intervention that increases their tolerance of statins. We do not consider it
             inappropriate or unethical to place such patients on placebo during the simvastatin vs
             placebo phase because these patients will have previously been documented to be
             intolerant of statins. All patients will be maintained on lipid lowering diets during
             the study.

          -  LDL Cholesterol Levels - LDL levels will not be a criterion for inclusion or exclusion
             from this study since all patients will have previously been deemed appropriate
             candidates for statin therapy by their physicians and because recent clinical trial
             results suggest that statins will be used in high risk individuals regardless of their
             pretreatment LDL-C values.

          -  Race - We will seek to recruit Caucasians, Hispanics and African American in
             accordance with their distributions in the study communities.

          -  CoQ10 Use - Subjects previously using supplemental CoQ10 must discontinue this
             supplementation for two months prior to entering the study.

          -  Diet - All subjects will be instructed in a standard lipid lowering diet and asked to
             maintain this throughout the 6 months of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they have had cancer within 5 years of entry, have
             hepatic disease (ALT &gt; 2 times normal) or renal disease (creatinine &gt; 2 mg/L) since
             these patients may require more careful monitoring during the study and would be best
             managed in a totally clinical setting.

          -  Subjects presently treated with other medications known to alter statin metabolism (3)

          -  Subjects who cannot discontinue other lipid-lowering medications

          -  Subjects with hypo or hyper thyroidism defined as a TSH &gt; 5 or &lt;0.01 IU/L since these
             conditions are known to be associated with statin intolerance and muscle weakness,
             respectively

          -  Subjects with hepatic dysfunction evidenced by a baseline alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) level &gt; 2 UNL

          -  Subjects with renal dysfunction defined as a baseline creatinine &gt; 2mg/dl;

          -  Subjects with physical disabilities prohibiting the strength and exercise performance
             measurements

          -  Subjects who regularly use corticosteroids or other drugs known to affects skeletal
             muscle metabolism or regularly have intramuscular injections that will affect CK
             levels.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who do not use an effective birth-control technique.
