    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose limiting
      toxicity, safety and tolerability of TH-302 in patients with acute leukemias, advanced phase
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), high risk myelodysplastic syndromes, advanced
      myelofibrosis or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor hypoxia has been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Brown et
      al, 2004; Boyle 2006). TH-302, a hypoxia activated prodrug (HAP), exploits the hypoxic nature
      of tumors while having little or no effect on normal tissue. TH-302 belongs to a class of
      alkylating agents called oxazaphosphorines which have major experimental and clinical
      activity (Brock 1989). Since TH-302 is selectively targeted to the hypoxic microenvironment,
      this agent may represent an improvement over other agents in this class. Preclinical data
      support the hypothesis that TH-302 targets hypoxic regions of tumors and also is able to kill
      other tumor cells in normoxic regions as a result of cytotoxin diffusion, leading to
      significant effects on tumor growth. Preclinical data has shown that TH-302 has anti-tumor
      activity in multiple myeloma cells in vivo and in vitro.

      Additional preclinical data demonstrated the marked expansion of the hypoxic bone marrow
      areas in diseased mice with ALL. These results suggest that this agent may be useful in
      treating advanced leukemias. The drug is stable in plasma and liver, does not appear to be at
      risk for drug-drug interactions, and has mild, reversible toxicities. In this dose-escalation
      study, patients with advanced leukemias will receive infusions of TH-302 to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose.

    <description>TH-302 will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion daily for 5 days every 21 days. Patients who successfully complete a 3-week treatment cycle without evidence of significant treatment-related toxicity or clinically significant progressive disease will continue to receive treatment for up to six cycles.</description>
