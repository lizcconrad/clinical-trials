    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is one of the most prevalent anxiety disorders in the western
      world. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the psychological treatment that has the
      largest empirical support. However, the availability to CBT is very limited in Sweden due to
      lack of therapists with proper training. Therefore it is important to evaluate alternative
      forms of treatment that are more time efficient. One of these methods is Internet based
      self-help therapy, which has proven to be an effective treatment for social anxiety disorder.

      In this study, the investigators aim to conduct a follow-up assessment five years after
      completed Internet-based CBT. Participants received treatment within the context of a
      randomised controlled trial conducted in 2005. Thus, in the present study there will be no
      treatment interventions, only assessment.
