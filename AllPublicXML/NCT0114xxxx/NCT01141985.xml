      The objective of this study is to evaluate the ease of use of a modified, disposable contact
      lens and suction ring assembly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single center clinical trial of up to 300 consecutive eyes of
      subjects scheduled to undergo ocular surgery requiring an initial incision, specifically,
      cataract surgery. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will be
      examined preoperatively to establish a baseline for ocular condition.

      Subjects will undergo unilateral cataract surgery using the LenSx Laser for one or a
      combination of the following laser procedures: anterior capsulotomy, laser lens
      phacofragmentation and corneal incision with implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL).
      Surgeon and staff comments will be solicited for ergonomic and packaging features of the new
      disposable contact lens. Subjects will be evaluated intraoperatively to assess comfort of the
      new disposable contact lens, as well as the completion of anterior capsulotomy, laser lens
      phacofragmentation and completion of corneal incisions. All patients will be evaluated
      postoperatively at one day, one week and 1 month to follow the condition of the surgical eye.
      Further follow up can be performed at the discretion of the surgeon.

    <description>Modified Disposable Contact Lens Patient Interface: Like the current disposable contact lens, a single unit is used for each procedure only once, and is then discarded. It is similarly mounted onto the distal end of the system's focusing objective and serves as a sterile barrier between the patient and the laser. In place of a separate suction ring that is used in the current contact lens, the modified contact lens has an integrated suction ring and curved applanation surface. These features result in significantly lower elevation of intraocular pressure and significantly easier application by the surgeon in preliminary testing. Identical to the current contact lens, the suction ring is applied around the patient's limbus and mild suction is applied to stabilize the eye.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be eligible to undergo cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with
             primary intraocular lens implantation in at least 1 eye.

          2. Subjects must be at least 24 years of age.

             corneal abnormality (for example, recurrent corneal erosion, severe basement membrane
             disease) in either eye are excluded.

          4. Subjects with a history of steroid-responsive rise in intraocular pressure, glaucoma,
             or preoperative IOP&gt;21 mm Hg in either eye are excluded.

          5. Subjects with known lens/zonular instability such as, but not restricted to, Marfan's

          6. Subjects who have undergone previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind,
             including any type of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes in either
             eye are excluded.

          7. Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to be pregnant during the course of

          8. Subjects with known sensitivity to planned study concomitant medications are excluded.

             the time of this clinical investigation are excluded

         10. Subjects presenting any contraindications to cataract surgery are excluded.
