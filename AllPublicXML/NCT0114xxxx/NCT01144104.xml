      This trial consists of two linked substudies.

      Substudy 1: Activating Messages for Enhancing Primary Care Practice (AMEP2): Effectiveness
      Study

      Substudy 2: Activating Messages for Enhancing Primary Care Practice (AMEP2): Toxicity Study

      The purpose of the Effectiveness Study is to assess the comparative effectiveness of three
      multimedia educational interventions (a targeted educational video, a tailored interactive
      multimedia computer program, and an &quot;attention control&quot;) for increasing the likelihood that
      primary care patients with significant depressive symptoms will seek appropriate care (n =
      510). The primary study outcomes are provision of minimally acceptable initial care,
      reductions in depression-related stigma, and improvement in depression symptoms. (See Process
      of Care and Patient Outcomes in Primary Outcome Measure section.)

      The purpose of the Toxicity Study is to assess the potential benefits (reduced stigma) and
      harms (inappropriate prescribing) associated with three multimedia depression educational
      interventions when administered to patients with few or no depressive symptoms (n = 308). The
      primary outcomes relating to this outcome are reducing depression-related stigma and reducing
      unnecessary prescribing. (See Toxicity in Primary Outcome Measure section.)

      Both studies will look at the secondary outcome measure of patient requests for depression
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is an investigator-initiated study involving two sequential phases and is funded
      by the National Institute of Mental Health. Phase I included the use of marketing research
      (i.e. focus groups, adaptive conjoint analysis, and other survey methods) to produce two
      clinic-based interventions: a public service announcement (PSA) and interactive multimedia
      computer program (IMCP). The two clinic-based interventions are intended to include messages
      that will activate patients to talk with their physicians about specific health concerns
      (depression) and/or any depressive symptoms they've been experiencing. In Phase II (as
      described in this registration protocol), those interventions will undergo assessment in a
      randomized controlled effectiveness trial (RCT) in primary care settings in Sacramento and
      San Francisco.
