  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a two-page print brochure that delivers
      individually tailored educational messages about the Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine
      increases HPV vaccine-hesitant mothers' intentions to have their adolescent daughters
      vaccinated against HPV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled intervention trial for HPV vaccine-hesitant mothers of
      adolescent (ages 11-15 years old) girls. Mothers will complete a three-item measure that
      assesses their baseline intentions for having their adolescent daughter vaccinated against
      HPV. Mothers will then fill out a short, computer-based survey that assesses demographic
      factors, prior experience with HPV-associated illnesses and views about a variety of
      potential barriers to HPV vaccination. Following the survey, the intervention group (40
      mothers) will receive a two-page print brochure that uses their survey data to generate the
      brochure such that it addresses each mother's top three concerns about the HPV vaccine. The
      control group (40 mothers) will receive a generic, two-page brochure that is similar in
      appearance to the intervention, but contains only untailored, generic information about the
      vaccine. HPV vaccination intention will be assessed a second time after reading the brochure,
      using the same three-item measure as before the survey. The vaccine administration records of
      the adolescent daughters of these mothers will be accessed three months after mothers'
      participation in the study to assess whether any HPV vaccine doses were provided.

    <measure>Mother's Intention to Vaccinate Daughter Against HPV</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of intervention (one day)</time_frame>
    <description>Mother will rate her intention to have her daughter vaccinated against HPV using a Likert scale before and after the intervention. The scale ranges from 0-11 with higher numbers representing more positive intentions to vaccinate against HPV, and 5 being neutral intentions (i.e. neither positive nor negative). In this assessment we use this 11-point scale to assess vaccination before and after viewing the educational materials. The difference pre and post intervention in vaccination intention is calculated (min 0, max 11) and the mean of these differences are calculated for the control and intervention groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vaccination of Daughter</measure>
    <time_frame>Less than or equal to three months from the date of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>With mother's consent, daughter's University of Michigan vaccination record will be accessed to determine whether daughter has received any doses of the HPV vaccine. If the University of Michigan vaccination record does not document a visit three months after the intervention, with mother's consent, research staff will call mother at home to determine whether daughter has received any doses of the HPV vaccine.</description>

        <title>Mother's Intention to Vaccinate Daughter Against HPV</title>
        <description>Mother will rate her intention to have her daughter vaccinated against HPV using a Likert scale before and after the intervention. The scale ranges from 0-11 with higher numbers representing more positive intentions to vaccinate against HPV, and 5 being neutral intentions (i.e. neither positive nor negative). In this assessment we use this 11-point scale to assess vaccination before and after viewing the educational materials. The difference pre and post intervention in vaccination intention is calculated (min 0, max 11) and the mean of these differences are calculated for the control and intervention groups.</description>
