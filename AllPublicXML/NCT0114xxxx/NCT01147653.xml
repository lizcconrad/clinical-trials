  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a single intravenous infusion of
      autologous umbilical cord blood (UCB) for the treatment of pediatric patients with spastic
      cerebral palsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy results from in utero or perinatal injury to the developing brain, often
      through stroke, hypoxic insult or hemorrhage. Currently available treatments for patients
      with cerebral palsy are supportive, but not curative. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has been
      shown to lessen the clinical and radiographic impact of hypoxic brain injury and stroke in
      animal models. UCB also engrafts and differentiates in brain, facilitating neural cell
      repair, in animal models and human patients with inborn errors of metabolism undergoing
      allogeneic, unrelated donor UCB transplantation. We hypothesize that, in the setting of brain
      injury, infusion of autologous UCB will facilitate neural cell repair resulting in improved
      function in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Gross Motor Function Measure 66 (GMFM-66) Score from Baseline to Year 1. The GMFM-66 is a clinical tool used to evaluate gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy and is scored using a propriety software program called the Gross Motor Ability Estimator (GMAE) that produces an interval level continuous score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better motor function. A negative change in GMFM-66 score indicates a reduction in motor function, a positive change indicates improvement in motor function, and zero indicates no change in motor function.</description>

    <description>The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales - Second Edition (PDMS-2) measures gross and fine motor skills in children from birth through five years of age. The Gross Motor Quotient score from the PDMS-2 was used in this study to evaluate gross motor function. The Gross Motor Quotient measures the ability to use large muscle systems for locomotion, maintain a stable posture when not moving, and throw/catch objects. The range of possible scores is 41 to 164. High scores indicate better gross motor function. Lower scores indicate less gross motor function ability. The change in Gross Motor Quotient from Baseline to Year 1 was evaluated in this study. Positive numbers indicate an increase in gross motor ability, negative numbers indicate decreases in gross motor function, and a zero indicates no change.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cognitive Z-Score From Baseline to Year 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Year 1</time_frame>
    <description>Because patients in this study were evaluated with different cognitive assessments based on their age at the time of assessment (The Bayley-III Cognitive Composite, the WPSSI-III Full Scale IQ, and the WISC-IV Full Scale IQ Composite), with some patients being assessed using different tools at subsequent visits during the trial, a method for combining the assessments was employed to evaluate change in cognitive function over time in as many patients as possible. A cognitive Z-score was calculated for each participant at Baseline and Year 1 by adjusting each score by the relevant assessments' population mean and standard deviation. The Z-scores represent the distance from the population mean, as measured by standard deviations. The analysis presented here summarizes the change in Z-score between Baseline and Year 1. A positive number indicates an increase in cognitive function, a negative number indicates a decrease, and zero indicates no change.</description>

          <title>GMFCS Level</title>
          <description>The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) classifies gross motor function of children with cerebral palsy into Levels I (least disabled) to V (most disabled). For example, children at Level I are able to walk at home, in school, and in the community and can climb stairs without a railing. At Level II children may walk with assistance and can climb stairs using a railing. At Level III children walk with handheld assistive devices for short distances but use a wheelchair for long distance mobility. Mobility at Levels IV and V require physical assistance or powered devices.</description>

        <description>Change in Gross Motor Function Measure 66 (GMFM-66) Score from Baseline to Year 1. The GMFM-66 is a clinical tool used to evaluate gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy and is scored using a propriety software program called the Gross Motor Ability Estimator (GMAE) that produces an interval level continuous score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better motor function. A negative change in GMFM-66 score indicates a reduction in motor function, a positive change indicates improvement in motor function, and zero indicates no change in motor function.</description>

        <title>Change in Peabody Gross Motor Quotient From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales - Second Edition (PDMS-2) measures gross and fine motor skills in children from birth through five years of age. The Gross Motor Quotient score from the PDMS-2 was used in this study to evaluate gross motor function. The Gross Motor Quotient measures the ability to use large muscle systems for locomotion, maintain a stable posture when not moving, and throw/catch objects. The range of possible scores is 41 to 164. High scores indicate better gross motor function. Lower scores indicate less gross motor function ability. The change in Gross Motor Quotient from Baseline to Year 1 was evaluated in this study. Positive numbers indicate an increase in gross motor ability, negative numbers indicate decreases in gross motor function, and a zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Change in CP-QOL Score</title>
        <description>Children age four years or older at study entry were assessed using the disease-specific “CP-QOL Child” assessment tool as completed by a parent. The CP-QOL Child primary-caregiver proxy form is designed for children 4 – 12 with cerebral palsy and contains 66 items which assess physical, emotional, and social well being as well as access to services and acceptance by others. Scores are summarized in seven topic areas. Scores in each area range from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health). The change score from Baseline to Year 1 is summarized here for each item. Negative scores indicated a decrease in quality of life, positive scores indicate an increase and zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Change in Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III, Cognitive Composite From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>Cognitive function was assessed in English-speaking study participants using one of three different tools depending on the age of the patient at the time of assessment: The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III). Some patients were assessed with different tools at subsequent visits as they aged during the conduct of the trial. The Bayley-III is designed to assess developmental functioning of infants and toddlers. Scores for the Cognitive Composite range from 1 to 19 and results in the range of 8 to 12 are considered average. The outcome measure reported here is the change in Cognitive Composite between Baseline to Year 1. Positive numbers indicate increases in cognitive functioning, negative numbers indicate a decrease, and zero indicates no change.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Year 1</time_frame>
        <population>The Bayley III is an age-specific test and was used for 42 patients at Baseline. A total of 27 of these patients were also scored with the Bayley III at Year 1. The results here represent change from Baseline to Year 1 in the 27 participants assessed with the Bayley III at both time points.</population>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Z-Score From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>Because patients in this study were evaluated with different cognitive assessments based on their age at the time of assessment (The Bayley-III Cognitive Composite, the WPSSI-III Full Scale IQ, and the WISC-IV Full Scale IQ Composite), with some patients being assessed using different tools at subsequent visits during the trial, a method for combining the assessments was employed to evaluate change in cognitive function over time in as many patients as possible. A cognitive Z-score was calculated for each participant at Baseline and Year 1 by adjusting each score by the relevant assessments’ population mean and standard deviation. The Z-scores represent the distance from the population mean, as measured by standard deviations. The analysis presented here summarizes the change in Z-score between Baseline and Year 1. A positive number indicates an increase in cognitive function, a negative number indicates a decrease, and zero indicates no change.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Year 1</time_frame>
        <population>When using all available cognitive assessments, the change in cognitive Z-score was available for 42 of the 63 participants.</population>

          <title>Change in Cognitive Z-Score From Baseline to Year 1</title>
          <description>Because patients in this study were evaluated with different cognitive assessments based on their age at the time of assessment (The Bayley-III Cognitive Composite, the WPSSI-III Full Scale IQ, and the WISC-IV Full Scale IQ Composite), with some patients being assessed using different tools at subsequent visits during the trial, a method for combining the assessments was employed to evaluate change in cognitive function over time in as many patients as possible. A cognitive Z-score was calculated for each participant at Baseline and Year 1 by adjusting each score by the relevant assessments’ population mean and standard deviation. The Z-scores represent the distance from the population mean, as measured by standard deviations. The analysis presented here summarizes the change in Z-score between Baseline and Year 1. A positive number indicates an increase in cognitive function, a negative number indicates a decrease, and zero indicates no change.</description>
          <population>When using all available cognitive assessments, the change in cognitive Z-score was available for 42 of the 63 participants.</population>

        <title>Change in Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) Score From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) measures the use of hemiplegic cerebral palsy patients' involved hand in tasks involving two hands. The test is valid for ages 18 months to 12 years. The score is an interval scale ranging from 22 to 88 with higher numbers indicating more effective use of the affected hand in performance of bimanual tasks. Change in this score was evaluate between Baseline and Year 1. Positive numbers indicate more effective use of the affected hand, negative numbers indicate a reduction in the effective use of the affected hand, and a zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Change in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Z-score Internalizing Problems From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>Two versions of the CBCL exist for children ages 1.5 to 5 years and ages 6-18 years. The CBCL evaluates internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems using 99-item assessments that are scored on an ordinal scale as 0 for “not true of the child,” 1 for “somewhat or sometimes true of the child,” and 2 for “very true or often true of the child” based on behavior in the preceding two months. Scores are expressed on a standard normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 10. Z scores were created for analysis. A Z-score represents the distance from the population mean in terms of the number of standard deviations. The change in Z-score from Baseline to Year 1 was calculated for each patient. A positive number indicates an increase in the behavior, a negative number indicates a decrease in the behavior, and a zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Change in Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Z-score Externalizing Problems From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>Two versions of the CBCL exist for children ages 1.5 to 5 years and ages 6-18 years. The CBCL evaluates internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems using 99-item assessments that are scored on an ordinal scale as 0 for “not true of the child,” 1 for “somewhat or sometimes true of the child,” and 2 for “very true or often true of the child” based on behavior in the preceding two months. Scores are expressed on a standard normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 10. Z scores were created for analysis. A Z-score represents the distance from the population mean in terms of the number of standard deviations. The change in Z-score from Baseline to Year 1 was calculated for each patient. A positive number indicates an increase in the behavior, a negative number indicates a decrease in the behavior, and a zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Change in Parental Distress From Baseline to Year 1</title>
        <description>Parent stress was evaluated with the Parenting Stress Index – Short Form for children aged 0-12 years, which measures stress in three domains: Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child. Results in each domain are expressed as percentiles. Scores from the 15th-80th percentile are considered to be within the normal range.
Scores at or above the 85th percentile considered high distress. Scores greater than the 89th percentile indicate clinically significant levels of distress. Analysis focused on changes in percentile scores between Baseline and Year 1. Positive numbers represent an increase in distress, negative numbers represent a decrease in distress, and zero indicates no change.</description>

        <description>The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, (BOT-2) evaluates motor function in four areas: stability, mobility, strength, coordination, and object manipulation. A Total Motor Composite is then calculated and expressed on a normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate better motor function. The BOT-2 Total Motor Composite was used to measure motor function in children at age 6 in this study. The study intended to evaluate change in the BOT-2 Total Motor Composite from Baseline to Year 1, where positive change indicates improvement in motor function, negative change indicates decrease in motor function, and zero indicates no change.</description>

        <description>The Barry-Albright Dystonia Scale measures generalized dystonia in eight body regions (eyes, mouth, neck, trunk, and the four extremities) using an ordinal scale (0=no dystonia, 1=slight dystonia, 2=mild dystonia, 3=moderate dystonia, and 4=severe dystonia). Individual scores for each region are summed to obtain a total score. The total score can range from 0 to 32 and higher scores indicate an overall greater degree of dystonia. The change in Barry-Albright Dystonia Total Score was evaluated from Baseline to Year 1. Positive numbers indicate increasing dystonia, negative numbers indicate a decrease in dystonia, and zero indicates no change.</description>

        <title>Gross Motor Function Measure 66 (GMFM-66) Change Score at 1 Year by Infused Dose</title>
        <description>Gross Motor Function Measure 66 (GMFM-66) Change Score at 1 Year. Analyzed by infused dose, above or below the median. The GMFM-66 is a clinical tool used to evaluate gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy and is scored using a propriety software program called the Gross Motor Ability Estimator (GMAE) that produces an interval level continuous score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better motor function. A negative change in GMFM-66 score indicates a reduction in motor function, a positive change indicates improvement in motor function, and zero indicates no change in motor function.</description>
        <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
        <population>Patients randomized to Autologous Umbilical Cord Blood were divided into two groups for this analysis: Low and High dose. The median dose infused in these 32 patients was used as the cut point to define Low and High doses: 1.98x10e7 total nucleated cells per kilogram of patient weight (TNCC/kg).</population>

        <description>The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales - Second Edition (PDMS-2), Gross Motor Quotient change score was calculated for each patient at 1 year after infusion with autologous umbilical cord blood. Analyzed by infused dose, above or below the median. The Gross Motor Quotient score from the PDMS-2 was used in this study to evaluate gross motor function. The Gross Motor Quotient measures the ability to use large muscle systems for locomotion, maintain a stable posture when not moving, and throw/catch objects. The range of possible scores is 41 to 164. High scores indicate better gross motor function. Lower scores indicate less gross motor function ability.</description>
