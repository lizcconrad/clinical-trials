      Primary Hypotheses:

        1. Gabapentin will significantly reduce the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as compared to
           placebo. The primary outcome measure of alcohol withdrawal will be the Clinical
           Institute Withdrawal Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) (Sullivan, Sykora, Schneiderman, Naranjo, &amp;
           Sellers, 1989) score.

        2. Gabapentin will significantly reduce alcohol consumption and promote abstinence as
           compared to placebo. The primary outcome measure will be the number of the heavy
           drinking days (defined as any day where the number of standard drinks was at least 5 for
           men and at least 4 for women) per week as measured by the timeline follow-back method.

      Secondary Hypotheses:

      1. Gabapentin will be superior to placebo in reducing alcohol use as measured by secondary
      outcomes such as amount of drinks per day, amount of drinks per drinking day, percent days
      abstinent and serial measurement of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) serum level.

    <textblock>
      In an 8-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled outpatient pilot trial the efficacy
      of gabapentin in the treatment of alcohol dependence will be studied in 60 patients.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment under double-blind conditions with either
      1) a fixed dosing schedule of gabapentin or 2) placebo. All participants will receive weekly
      supportive behavioral treatment that promotes abstinence from alcohol and other substances,
      encourages mutual-support meeting attendance, and facilitates compliance with study
      medication. The primary outcome measures will be: the treatment of alcohol withdrawal as
      measured by the CIWA-Ar and the reduction of heavy drinking days per week as measured by the
      timeline follow-back method.

      Participants will be alcohol-dependent men and nonpregnant women who report drinking a
      minimum of 5 standard drinks for men or 4 standard drinks for women at least 4 days per week
      over the past 28 days. The daily minimum drinking requirements are consistent with the
      commonly accepted definition of &quot;binge drinking.&quot; A minimum requirement of having a heavy
      drinking episode 4 days a week would select for a population of individuals who are drinking
      excessively more days than not. A minimum threshold of weekly alcohol use is set to prevent a
      &quot;floor effect&quot; (i.e. participants with minimal alcohol use at baseline would be unable to
      demonstrate significant improvement.)
