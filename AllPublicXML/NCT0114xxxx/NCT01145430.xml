      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of veliparib when given
      together with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with ovarian
      cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back after a period
      of improvement, or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Veliparib may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving veliparib together with liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended Phase II dose of ABT-888 (veliparib) given in combination
      with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride) (PLD -
      40 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) in patients with ovarian or breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity profile of the ABT-888 plus PLD combination. II. To determine
      the effects of ABT-888 on the pharmacokinetics of PLD. III. To determine the efficacy of
      ABT-888 plus PLD in ovarian and breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and
      then every 6 months for 2 years.

             primary peritoneal carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma, OR histologically confirmed
             metastatic breast cancer, that is estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone
             receptor (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu
             negative (as determined by local pathology laboratory)

          -  Prior chemotherapy:

               -  Ovarian cancer: patients with no prior PLD exposure are eligible after failure of
                  platinum-containing chemotherapy; no more than 2 prior platinum containing
                  regimens is permitted; dose escalating cohorts only: patients already on PLD are
                  also eligible if they are receiving PLD beyond 3 cycles without prohibitive (i.e.
                  no grade 3 or 4) skin or mucosal toxicities, and showing no progressive disease
                  compared to a computed tomography (CT) scan obtained 2 or more months earlier;
                  these patients are eligible in spite of any progression from baseline determined
                  prematurely (i.e., applicable to those patients who are deemed in their best
                  interest to continue to receive PLD after a CT obtained at 2 or 3 months has
                  shown progression from baseline)

                       for metastatic disease; breast cancer patients may not have received prior
                       PLD, and will not be eligible for the expanded cohort A

                    -  Interval between prior chemotherapy and registration for breast and ovarian
                       cancer; there should be at least a 3 week interval between the last

                       from acute toxicity related to prior therapy (6 weeks if the last regiment
                       included BCNU or mitomycin C)

                    -  Dose escalating cohorts only: patients will be categorized in the following
                       strata based upon prior PLD exposure: Stratum A -patients with ovarian
                       cancer who have had prior PLD exposure and received at least 3 cycles of PLD
                       without prohibitive (i.e. no grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity) and have not had
                       progressive disease; Stratum B: patients with ovarian or breast cancer who
                       have had no prior PLD exposure

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-2

          -  All potential subjects should be evaluated for whether breast cancer (BRCA)1-2 testing

             BRCA1-2 mutation (Myriad tables at www.myriad.com) are encouraged (but not required)
             to have mutation testing and results known; information regarding mutation status
             (positive [including specific mutation], negative, or unknown) and projected risk of
             having a mutation (as determined by Myriad tables) will be collected at the time of
             diagnosis

          -  Non-measurable and/or measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) criteria, or abnormal cancer antigen (CA)-125 to levels (in patients

             evidence of liver metastasis)

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction at or above institutional lower limit of normal
             (obtained within 8 weeks of registration by multigated acquisition [MUGA] scan or
             echocardiogram; the same test performed at baseline should be repeated after every 3
             cycles of therapy)

          -  Prior or current non-gynecologic or non-breast malignancy within 5 years except

             central nervous system disease) which is either poorly controlled with currently
             available treatment, or which is of such severity that the investigators deem it
             unwise to enter the patient on protocol

          -  Patients with history of seizure disorder requiring antiepileptics who have had a
             seizure episode within the last 6 months
