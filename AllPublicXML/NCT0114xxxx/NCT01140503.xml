    <time_frame>Data collected at baseline at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDASI (Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Activity and Severity Index) is a validated instrument to measure skin disease activity in dermatomyositis. A clinically meaningful change is a decrease of 4 points. All missing data are imputed using last observation carried forward. Calculation is performed as the score at 12 weeks minus the score at baseline.</description>

          <description>This is a validated instrument (Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Activity and Severity Index) quantifying dermatomyositis skin disease activity by assigning severity points on redness, scale, and ulceration to specific body sites typically involved by dermatomyositis. Possible scores for the CDASI-a range from 0 to 100, with higher numbers represent higher severity of skin disease. Scores above 15 are considered to have moderate-to-severe activity. A clinically meaningful improvement in this scale is 4.</description>
