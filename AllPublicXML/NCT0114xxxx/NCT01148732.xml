    <textblock>
      Reliable endotracheal tube (ETT) insertion confirmation is essential for critically ill
      patients. Incorrect placement causes a high rate of mortality and morbidity. Therefore, early
      detection of accidental esophageal intubation must be a primary focus of emergency airway
      efforts in emergency department (ED). Although many techniques have been suggested to verify
      the ETT placement, there is currently no entirely reliable method. Ultrasonography (US) is an
      indispensable and easily accessible tool in ED. Several studies of ultrasonographic
      confirmation of ETT position provided promising results in cadaver model or patient in a
      controlled operating room setting.In this study, the investigators have proposed a protocol
      called T.R.U.E, an acronym for tracheal rapid ultrasound exam, to confirm the ETT position in
      emergency intubation. This method provided a fast, real-time examination to prevent
      esophageal or endotracheal intubation.

      Establishing a definite airway, endotracheal tube placement, is an important component for
      resuscitation. A high rate of morbidity and mortality was reported for unrecognized
      esophageal intubation. Therefore, early detection of esophageal intubation is essential for
      emergency airway management. There are several methods being used for endotracheal tube
      confirmation, such as auscultation of breathing sound, chest X-ray and capnography.2 However,
      all of these methods had false-negative rates and not entirely reliable during resuscitation.
      Ultrasound is an indispensable and easily accessible tool in emergency department. Recent
      studies showed that ultrasound can be used to confirm endotracheal tube placement in cadaver
      model. In this prospective study, we investigate the sensitivity and specificity of
      ultrasound for endotracheal tube confirmation in emergency intubation The study is conducted
      in the emergency department at National Taiwan University Hospital and approved by the
      hospital institutional review board. During resuscitation, the duty emergency resuscitation
      team performs the intubation and confirms the endotracheal tube position by auscultation and
      end-tidal capnography. Meanwhile, the researcher performs ultrasonography examinations for
      endotracheal tube position. A curvilinear ultrasonography transducer is used and placed
      transversely on the anterior neck just superior to the suprasternal notch and bilateral
      hemithorax. The result of ultrasonography will be compared with auscultation, capnography and
      chest X-ray. Sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography examination is computed to
      determine the accuracy and effectiveness of clinical use.
