      This phase II trial studies how well veliparib with or without carboplatin works in treating
      patients with stage III-IV breast cancer. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet
      known whether veliparib is more effective with or without carboplatin in treating breast
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of single agent ABT-888 (veliparib) (NSC 737664) in breast cancer
      (BRCA) carriers with metastatic breast cancer based on response rate (Response Evaluation
      Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct subset analysis on BRCA1 vs. BRCA2 and hormone receptor status. II. To evaluate
      progression-free survival of patients on single-agent ABT-888. III. To further describe the
      safety and tolerability of ABT-888 (NSC 737664) as a single agent and in combination with
      carboplatin for BRCA-associated breast cancer.

      IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888 (NSC 737664) alone and in combination with
      carboplatin.

      V. To assess the relationship between the level of poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose
      polymerase (PARP) inhibition by ABT-888 and biomarkers of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC's) and in tumor.

      VI. To explore the relationship between biomarkers of drug effect and progression-free
      survival.

      VII. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of carboplatin and ABT-888 in
      patients who have failed single agent ABT-888.

      VIII. To conduct subset analysis on BRCA1 vs. BRCA2 and hormone receptor status.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21.

      ARM II: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      veliparib as in Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.
