  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV /AIDS is a major public health problem in Uganda. The prevention of mother to child
      transmission of HIV/ AIDS (PMTCT) was launched in Uganda in November 2001 and in Mbale
      Hospital in May 2002. Currently, PMTCT services have been integrated into mainstream
      antenatal care services throughout the country.

      Though engaging men as partners is a critical component in the PMTCT programme, their
      involvement has been low. Measures to increase male partner involvement in the PMTCT
      programmes have not been explored in Uganda.

      Objectives: To determine the effect of a written invitation letter to the spouses of women,
      attending their first antenatal visit on: (a) couple attendance at subsequent antenatal
      clinic visits; and (b) couple acceptance of HIV testing.

      Study site: The study will be carried out at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital in eastern
      Uganda

      Study design: A randomised clinical trial among 1060 (530 intervention and 530 control) new
      antenatal attendees. The intervention will be a written invitation letter to their spouses.

      Outcome measures: The main outcome measure is the proportion of pregnant women who come with
      their partners for ANC at the subsequent antenatal visit.

      Utility: The results of this study will be utilised in re-orienting the ANC services to
      encourage male participation and hopefully improve the uptake of the PMTCT services at Mbale
      Regional Referral Hospital.
