             for at least 28 days after the last vaccination. A woman is considered of childbearing
             potential unless post-menopausal or with a history of hysterectomy (Acceptable
             contraception methods are restricted to abstinence, barrier contraceptives,
             intrauterine contraceptive devices or licensed hormonal products)

                  x 72) = CrCl (ml/min)

               -  For women: multiply the result by 0.85 = CrCl (ml/min).

          -  Adequate hepatic function defined as:
