      This research study is studying identification of de novo Fanconi anemia in younger patients
      with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Studying samples of tissue from patients with
      cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to
      Fanconi anemia in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated on COG-2961
      and COG-AAML03P1 who are at high risk of having de novo Fanconi anemia.

      II. Procure diagnostic samples from the COG AML Biology Repository and identify Fanconi
      anemia patients using western blot techniques.

      OUTLINE:

      Previously collected cryopreserved cells are analyzed via western blot to identify patients
      with Fanconi anemia.
