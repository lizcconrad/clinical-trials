    <textblock>
      This multi-centre prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (bIAP) in
      reducing the pro-inflammatory post-surgical responses and thereby preserving organ functions
      in patients undergoing invasive cardiac surgery: combined aortic valve replacement and
      coronary artery bypass grafting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to be fully evaluated for follow-up.

          -  Patients who have base AP levels at &gt; 125 IU/L, or levels &lt; 30 IU/L (ammediol, DEA
             (diethanolamine) units)

          -  Patients who show pre-operative infections or who are suspected of endocarditis or
             systemic infection.

          -  Patients who refuse to accept medically-indicated blood products.

          -  Patients who received investigational drugs in the 30 days prior to study drug
             administration, or are currently participating in a study during which the
             administration of investigational drugs within one month is anticipated.

          -  Patients who require pre-operative ventilatory support.

          -  Patients who have renal insufficiency (history of creatinine &gt;177mol/L or &gt;2.0 mg/dL)

             excluded.

          -  Patients who are scheduled to receive &quot;stress doses&quot; of glucocorticoids (i.e., doses
             &gt;2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent) prior to, during or following
             surgery.
