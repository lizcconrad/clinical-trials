  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics incl.
      dose proportionality, and pharmacodynamics of BI 135585 XX (Part 1), as well as the relative
      bioavailability of two different immediate release tablet formulations versus oral solution
      (Part 2)
