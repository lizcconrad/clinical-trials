  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the causes of the solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN), benign causes including tuberculosis
      was noted on 15 to 60 percents in various studies.

      Although the characteristics of chest imaging is helpful in diagnosis and percutaneous needle
      biopsy for pulmonary nodule has been represented high diagnostic yield in many reports, but
      still surgical biopsy has been needed in definite diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in many
      cases.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of interferon-gamma release assay in
      addition to the percutaneous needle biopsy, in diagnosis of pulmonary nodules.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the patients who failed to diagnosis by percutaneous needle biopsy and needed to have
      Surgical biopsy, thirty percents of the patients were diagnosed as benign nodules and about
      six percents were diagnosed as tuberculosis in Seoul National University Hospital during
      2007-2008.

      The investigators want to know whether conducting an interferon-gamma release assay in
      addition to percutaneous needle biopsy is helpful in diagnosis of lung nodules.

    <description>the result of the interferon-gamma release assay is reported in three different categories as positive, negative or indeterminate. We want to know whether the positive rate of the interferon-gamma release asssay would be significantly different according to the pathologic diagnosis of lung nodules confirmed by percutaneous needle biopsy.</description>
