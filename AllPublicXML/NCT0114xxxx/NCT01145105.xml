  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain ( LBP) is a significant health problem which affects about 70%-80% of the
      population during the course of their life . The majority of LBP is resolved within 3 months;
      however, up to 40% of LBP becomes chronic. One subgroup of chronic LBP is patients with
      sciatica. Sciatica is characterized by radiating pain to the buttock and lower limb, with or
      without low back pain.

      It has been shown in the upper limb that by positioning the contra-lateral arm in tension the
      investigators actually reduce tension in the ipsilateral arm. Patients, who present with
      symptoms like sciatica, can benefit from this maneuver (neural dynamics techniques) that
      reduces tension through the contra-lateral leg.

      Working Hypothesis: Compared with a placebo maneuver of the upper limb, the neural dynamics
      techniques will result in better rehabilitation of individuals with radicular LBP.

      Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of neural dynamics techniques, using the contra-lateral
      leg, in the treatment of sub-acute/chronic Low back pain with radiation to the leg. Study
      Methodology: Eligible individuals will be assessed by a physiotherapist that will be blinded
      to the treatment allocation; treatment (either intervention or placebo) will be provided by a
      physiotherapist that will be blinded to the patient's assessment. The treated individuals and
      the referring physician will also be blinded to the treatment allocation;
