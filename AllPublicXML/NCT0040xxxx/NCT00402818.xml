    <textblock>
      RESTORE is an observational, open-label, multi-center, prospective, study enrolling Raptiva®
      (efalizumab) treated patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The overall
      duration of the study is approximately 4 years. Patients will be followed from the time of
      study enrolment to study/treatment termination; thus active follow-up period will vary across
      subjects. Raptiva® (efalizumab)treated patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque
      psoriasis and meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified will be eligible for
      participation in this study.

      Objectives:

        -  To document and quantify the incidences of adverse events in this patient population

        -  To explore the association of psoriasis treatments with changes in patient outcomes,
           quality of life, and treatment compliance.
