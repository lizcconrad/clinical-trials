  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy and the duration of efficacy of Botulinum toxin A
      (Botox®) injected into the lumbar paraspinal muscles for reducing pain and disability in
      subjects suffering from chronic low back pain of six months duration or longer and arising
      from an identifiable muscle strain injury or back trauma. The treatment modality and
      techniques used are based on a successful prior 4 month open-labeled pilot study done by this
      research group, but will employ a prospective double-blind, randomized, cross-over design to
      control for any placebo or mechanical trigger-point injection effects. Subjects will also be
      assessed for a longer duration to better define the duration of efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four arms (placebo/placebo,
      placebo/Botox, Botox/placebo, Botox/Botox). In the first of two phases, randomized subjects
      will blindly receive either Botox® (study arms Botox/placebo and Botox/Botox) or placebo
      (study arms placebo/placebo and placebo/Botox) injection into the lumbar paraspinal muscles.
      The subjects will be assessed using validated scales for pain and disability prior to
      injection and monthly thereafter for four months. In the second phase, a second set of lumbar
      injections will be administered based on the initial randomization and will blindly receive
      either Botox® (study arms placebo/Botox and Botox/Botox) or placebo (study arms
      placebo/placebo and Botox/placebo) injection into the lumbar paraspinal muscles. The subjects
      will again be assessed using the same validated scales for pain and disability, prior to
      injection and monthly thereafter, but for six months to extend the monitoring period to
      better define the limits of duration of effect.

      This will result in half of the subjects being crossed-over from Botox® to placebo (study arm
      Botox/placebo) or vice versa (study arm placebo/Botox) and one quarter of subjects receiving
      two courses of either Botox® alone (Botox/Botox) or placebo alone (placebo/placebo). All
      subjects will continue to receive medication and/or physiotherapy per standard of care but
      those treatments will be recorded and controlled for in the data analysis.
