      -  To determine whether a Phase III trial of acupuncture for postoperative recovery after
           colorectal surgery is warranted as defined by evidence of reduction of postoperative
           ileus when compared to sham acupuncture.

        -  To explore whether acupuncture reduces the length of hospital stay more than sham
           acupuncture

        -  To explore whether acupuncture improves patient satisfaction with the hospital
           experience by ameliorating other postoperative symptoms such as pain and nausea and
           vomiting.

        -  To determine the feasibility of a Phase III trial in terms of sample size, accrual rate,
           attrition rate and data completion.

      Postoperative ileus contributes to prolonged hospital stay, readmission and postoperative
      morbidities in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Reduction of postoperative ileus
      is important in postoperative recovery. Postoperative pain may require opioids, which further
      reduce gastrointestinal (GI) motility. Postoperative nausea and vomiting hamper the
      resumption of oral intake. Together, these three common postoperative problems contribute to
      patient discomfort, delayed discharge and increased overall hospitalization costs, despite
      current multi-modal management options. Any safe and effective therapy in addition to current
      standard of care would be welcomed by patients, surgeons and hospitals.

      Acupuncture is a complementary medicine modality shown to reduce postoperative pain, suppress
      nausea and vomiting, and promote GI motility. It is associated with few adverse events. Here
      we propose a randomized, sham controlled phase II study to evaluate acupuncture, in addition
      to conventional therapy, for its safety and effectiveness in improving postoperative recovery
      of colorectal cancer patients undergoing segmental or subtotal colectomy. The overall
      objective of this developmental project is to determine whether a more extended research
      project is warranted.

      The specific aims are:

        -  To determine whether a Phase III trial of acupuncture for postoperative recovery after
           colorectal surgery is warranted as defined by evidence for a reduction of postoperative
           ileus when compared to sham acupuncture. Hypothesis: acupuncture promotes upper and
           lower GI motility in patients experiencing postoperative ileus after colectomy more than
           sham acupuncture.

        -  To explore whether acupuncture improves patient satisfaction with the hospital
           experience by ameliorating other postoperative symptoms such as pain and nausea and
           vomiting. Hypothesis 2a: acupuncture reduces postoperative pain more than placebo in
           colectomy patients; 2b: acupuncture reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting more than
           placebo in colectomy patients.

        -  To determine the feasibility of a phase III trial in terms of sample size, accrual rate,
           attrition rate and data completion. Hypothesis 3: a phase III study of acupuncture in
           the treatment of post-colectomy ileus in cancer patients is feasible.

    <description>Acupuncture will be given twice daily for a total of three days (Day 1 to 3). The two acupuncture sessions will be separated by at least 4 hours, preferably given in the morning and late afternoon. Each session will last approximately 30 minutes, starting from the moment the first needle is inserted and ending the moment the first needle is removed. The last treatment will be given at the end of Day 3 or day of discharge.</description>

    <description>Sham Acupuncture involves the acupuncturist tapping a plastic guiding tube on the surface of the true points to produce some discernible sensation and then immediately tapping a real needle sideways parallel to the skin surface without needle insertion. It will be given twice daily for a total of three days (Day 1 to 3). The two acupuncture sessions will be separated by at least 4 hours, preferably given in the morning and late afternoon. Each session will last approximately 30 minutes, starting from the moment the first needle is inserted and ending the moment the first needle is removed. The last treatment will be given at the end of Day 3 or day of discharge,</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women of any ethnicity

          -  Age over 18 years (children are not included because colorectal cancer is rare in
             children).

          -  Scheduled to undergo elective resection of biopsy proven colorectal cancer or
             suspected colorectal cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pre-operative factors:

          -  History of major abdominal or pelvic surgery that have caused significant alteration
             in anatomy and function of the GI tract which may affect the endpoints of this study.

          -  Laparoscopic procedures. They tend to result in less postoperative ileus.

          -  Administration of epidural anesthetics or epidural opioids: these have previously been
             shown to affect postoperative GI motility. They made up only 5% of colectomy patients
             in the investigators' institution.

          -  Acupuncture within the last 4 weeks (to exclude any possible residual effect from
             acupuncture)

          -  Contraindications to use of electrical stimulation, including cardiac pacemaker and
             implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)

          -  Prior serious adverse event with acupuncture

          -  Intra-operative events (these events alter the postoperative recovery course
             significantly):

               -  Resection incorporating the upper GI tract. Such surgeries are usually more
                  complex, involving more organs and are associated with a more diverse
                  postoperative course, making the study population more heterogeneous.

               -  Gross fecal spillage (high complication rate in this setting)

               -  Need to leave nasogastric tube in (contaminating the primary endpoint)

               -  Decision to give epidural anesthetics or epidural opioids postoperatively (shown
                  previously to change the major endpoints)

               -  Complications during surgery requiring a patient to be transferred to the
                  Intensive Care Unit (ICU) directly from the Operating Room or Post Anesthesia
                  Care Unit (PACU) as this also alters the postoperative course significantly.
                  Patients transferred to the floor first will not be excluded. They will be fully
                  registered and randomized. If they deteriorate later during the hospital stay,
                  requiring a transfer to the ICU, they will still be followed.
