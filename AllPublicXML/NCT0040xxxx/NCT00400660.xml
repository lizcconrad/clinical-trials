  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK615915A is being developed as a novel surfactant for use in the formulation of GSK's
      future generation of Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs). A surfactant in a MDI would provide a more
      stable drug suspension, this in turn will produce a consistent dose of drug being delivered
      with each puff.
