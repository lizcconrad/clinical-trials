    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare muscle energy capacity in men with obesity or diabetes as
      compared to athletes. This study will also enable researchers to determine whether MRS can
      replace muscle biopsy for this type of assessment.

      Skeletal muscle mitochondrial defects are a sine qua non of insulin resistance in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obese and subjects with family history of T2DM (FH+).
      Exercise increases mitochondrial capacity whereas lipid infusion or high fat diet decreases
      genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this study 2 cohorts will be involved: Cohort
      I (athletes, T2DM and obese) and Cohort II (healthy with &quot;FH+&quot; or without &quot;FH-&quot; family
      history of T2DM). This randomized, parallel arm clinical trial will consist of 4 periods:
      screening, stabilization (3 days), baseline (for Cohort I and II) and exercise period (14
      days, only for Cohort II). The overall objective of the study is to validate a paradigm for
      the evaluation of compounds and drugs that activate mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal
      muscle. In Specific Aim 1 we will compare and contrast biopsy and MRS power to detect
      differences in mitochondrial capacity in 78 subjects: athletes (N=10), FH- (N=24), FH+
      (N=24), obese (N=10) and T2DM (N=10). In Specific Aim 2 we will compare mitochondrial changes
      in response to exercise in subjects FH - vs. FH + subjects. In Specific Aim 3 we will
      determine if HFD impairs mitochondrial changes in response to exercise in FH+ subjects. In
      Specific Aim 4 we will determine the role of mitochondrial capacity in metabolic flexibility
      and insulin sensitivity in T2DM, obese, FH+, FH- and athlete subjects.

    <description>Interval Exercise Training: Each interval training session will start with 10 minutes of warm up and will end with 10 minutes of cool down period at 40% VO2 peak. Training duration, intensity and number of exercise bout will increase with the progression of training period
Aerobic training: Each endurance training session will start with 5 minutes of warm up and will end with 5 minutes of cool down at 40% VO2 peak. Subjects will exercise at 70% VO2 peak for 45 minutes on day 3 and 5, for 55 minutes on day 8 and 10, and for 35 minutes on day 14 using a bicycle ergometer.</description>
