  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We run a successful clinic in Bristol for children with severe obesity who already
      demonstrate many features to suggest they are at increased risk of early diabetes and heart
      disease. However, we have found that young children respond better to simple interventions
      than do adolescents. We have used a new treatment regimen &quot;Mandometer®&quot; to help our most
      difficult adolescent cases lose weight. We would like to do a study to see if all adolescents
      might improve weight loss using this technology compared to what we routinely offer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions in the United Kingdom. Recent
      studies have indicated a prevalence level for obesity of 15% at 15 years of age. The
      implications for metabolic, cardiovascular and cancer risk in later life are enormous. The
      International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) and the European Association for the Study of Obesity
      (EASO) have identified childhood obesity as a matter for urgent attention. However, there are
      very few obesity clinics for children in the UK and effective treatment regimens are simply
      not available. We have developed an obesity clinic at the Royal Hospital for Children in
      Bristol and observed effective weight reduction in pre-pubertal children. Our simple
      treatment framework has proved far less effective in adolescence. We have therefore
      collaborated with an eating disorder clinic from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden to
      develop a novel therapy to treat obesity using modified equipment originally designed to
      treat adolescents with DSM-IV eating disorders. Pilot data indicate that adolescents are
      better able to address the issue of weight reduction within this treatment modality. Having
      established the software and treatment process we now wish to perform a randomised, control
      trial to test the efficacy of this new treatment against that currently provided.
