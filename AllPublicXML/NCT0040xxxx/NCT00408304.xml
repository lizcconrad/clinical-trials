  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to check whether development of depression as a side effect of
      interferon alpha treatment in chronic carriers of hepatitis C can be prevented by omega-3
      fatty acids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Omega-3 fatty acids are known as an alternative treatment for different conditions, including
      mental conditions, such as depression. We assume that combining omega-3 with the treatment by
      interferon alpha may prevent the development of depression, which is quite a common side
      effect of the interferon alpha.
