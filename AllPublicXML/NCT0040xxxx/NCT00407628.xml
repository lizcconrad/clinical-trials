  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relationship between the integrity of the white matter, including the
      corticospinal tracts and the corpus callosum, with the recovery of lower extremity function
      in patients with cerebral stroke at the subacute and chronic stages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have provided strong evidence that motor recovery after adult ischemic stroke
      is a function of neural plasticity. Up to date, it remains largely unknown as to the
      relationship between the integrity of the subcortical white matter with the lower extremity
      function recovery. Given the fact that the white matter is more resistant to ischemia after
      acute stroke than the gray matter (Falcao et al., 2004) and that the intensity of white
      matter in stroke has been found to be much greater in many brain areas in stroke than in
      healthy controls (Wen et al., 2004), it is of interest to study how the integrity of the
      subcortical white matter, primarily the corticospinal tracts and the corpus callosum,
      contributes to the recovery of lower extremity function in subacute and chronic stroke with
      lesions involving different areas of the brain.
