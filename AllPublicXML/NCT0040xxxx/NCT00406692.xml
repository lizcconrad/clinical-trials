      In this study the influence of zonisamide administration over a 13 week period on alcohol
      consumption in alcoholic (alcohol dependent) subjects will be examined. The dose of
      zonisamide given to subjects will be slowly increased over a period of several weeks. They
      will receive a full dose over a 5 week period. This will be a pilot study in which all of the
      subjects will only receive zonisamide. A primary objective of this study is to determine the
      possible size of the effect that zonisamide administration has on drinking (i.e. drinks
      consumed per day) to allow us to plan for a larger clinical trial of the effects of
      zonisamide on alcohol dependence.

        <title>The Weekly Mean Number of Standard Drinks Consumed Per Day at Baseline and Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>The mean daily standard alcoholic drinks were determined for the baseline period and each treatment week as a measure of alcohol intake. One standard drink=14g of alcohol. Mean value is the difference between mean standard drinks for the baseline period and week 12 of the study.</description>
