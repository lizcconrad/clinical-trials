    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to check a preliminary evidence that bright light may help to lose weight
      in obese people (Thor Helge Bergan, Norvay, 2002, unpublished). Subjects: aged 20-65 y, BMI &gt;
      30, non-seasonal (SPAQ score &lt;8, no seasonal problem), in good general health, with regular
      sleep from 22:00-1:00 to 6:00-9:00. Study season: November-April. Placebo-controlled,
      single-blind, crossover. At least 1 mo between two arms; at similar phase of menstrual cycle
      (if present). If could not complete at the first year, the second arm is to be done the next
      winter. Intervention: Lightbox (4300 lux) - during one arm, deactivated ioniser - during
      another arm (sequential alternation upon entering the study) for 3 weeks each morning (at
      least 18 days) starting between 6:00-9:00. Seating distance (from the face to the device) is
      41 cm, duration - 30 min. Diet: a target amount of kcal per day is calculated based on age,
      weight and gender (WHO), e.g. for a woman 40 y ang 80 kg it is 1502 kcal per day. Food
      content - is also as recommended by WHO. Food distribution over day - usual for the
      particular test subject but constant over sessions. Food diary is completed daily and
      subjects calculate kcal themselves based on a Table of kcal. Outcomes: Weight is measured
      during a visit to doctor a day before and day after the 3-week session, and also at home
      every week. Motivation and Expectation are rated by 3-point scales in a Diary, at the
      beginning of each session. Mood, activity and appetite are self-estimated using a VAS-like
      10-points scale every week. At the end of each arm the &quot;Easiness of dieting&quot; scale and
      Adverse event(s) are completed. In the diary, there are also columns for sleep on and off
      times, intervention time, duration and distance, number of kcal. A target number of subjects
      to complete the study is 40.
