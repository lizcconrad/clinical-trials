  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intranasal fentanyl is better than placebo
      at decreasing pain in children 4-8 years of age during urinary catheterization for a VCUG
      study.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that the voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) can be distressful and painful
      for children as the child is catheterized during the procedure. Currently no sedation or
      analgesia is recommended for the procedure. The practice of pediatrics is constantly seeking
      measures to decrease pain and distress for children. The opioid fentanyl was originally
      synthesized in the 1950's and 60's as an alternative to morphine and meperidine. The safety
      and efficacy of intranasal (IN) fentanyl has been previously demonstrated in the setting of a
      pediatric emergency department.

      We are proposing the use of IN fentanyl for analgesia prior to the catheterization for a
      voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG). If we prove that IN fentanyl is effective in reducing the
      pain while ensuring patient safety, it could become the analgesic of choice for this
      procedure.
