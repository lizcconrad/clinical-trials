      RATIONALE: Lithium carbonate may be an effective treatment for intestinal graft-versus-host
      disease caused by a donor stem cell transplant.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying lithium carbonate in treating patients with acute
      intestinal graft-versus-host-disease after donor stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of lithium on functional and mucosal anatomic recovery in the
      small or large bowel of patients with acute GVHD.

      II. Functional recovery will be evaluated according to changes in clinical manifestations of
      gastrointestinal GVHD. III. Mucosal anatomic recovery will be evaluated by review of results
      from clinically indicated endoscopic evaluations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the tolerability of lithium administration in allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplant recipients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lithium carbonate once or twice daily. Treatment continues for
      up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Functional recovery was defined as partial or complete resolution of gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease. Gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bleeding. Complete response (CR) of intestinal GVHD was defined as the absence of any symptoms referable to intestinal GVHD. Partial response (PR) was defined as clearing of abdominal pain (or withdrawal of opioid analgesic requirements in patients treated for abdominal pain) and of grossly visible bleeding if present, and resolution of diarrhea or decrease in the three day average stool volume by ≥ 500 mL in patients with stool volumes of ≥ 500 mL. Progression of GVHD was defined as an increase in the three day average stool volume by &gt; 500 mL, or the development of new abdominal pain (or new opioid analgesic requirements) or new intestinal bleeding.</description>

    <description>Endoscopic evaluation of improvement. Categories include 1) no improvement, 2) regenerative changes, 3) limited improvement, 4) partial improvement and 5) complete response. Endoscopic manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include edema, erythema, mucosal ulceration and denudation. Complete mucosal recovery was defined as the appearance of intact mucosa with at least 98% of the luminal surface covered by epithelium. Partial response was defined as the appearance of mostly intact mucosa with at least 80% improvement or less than 10% denuded. Limited response was retrospectively designated to describe visible improvement that was less than partial response. Regenerative change was retrospectively designated to describe early reappearance of mucosal integrity in a previously denuded area but not sufficient to meet criteria for partial response. Failure to respond was defined as failure to meet partial response criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a diagnosis of severe intestinal GVHD that is not improving at any time
             after initial treatment with glucocorticoids for at least 7 days are eligible for
             enrollment; measures indicating severity of GVHD will include: a) persistent diarrhea
             with average daily stool volumes &gt; 500 mL per day; or b) persistent hemorrhage that is
             detectable by visual inspection of the stool

          -  Patients with denuded mucosa caused by GVHD are eligible for enrollment, regardless of
             prior treatment for acute GVHD; denuded mucosa is defined as loss (i.e., erosion or
             sloughing) of the epithelium in: a) at least one-third of the surface area in a 30 cm
             colonic segment (i.e., rectosigmoid, descending or transverse colon); or b) at least
             one fifth of the surface area of the second portion of the duodenum, as estimated by
             endoscopic evaluation; denuded mucosa must be documented by images of the duodenum and
             colon and by histologic evaluation of the colon

          -  All subjects must provide written informed consent with the use of forms approved by
             the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) Institutional Review Board (IRB)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant renal dysfunction (estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min)

          -  Persistent or recurrent malignancy

          -  Secondary malignancy

          -  Patients who had autologous or syngeneic marrow transplantation

          -  Presence of any cause of intestinal symptoms or ulceration other than GVHD

          -  Patients with any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol will be excluded

        <title>Functional Recovery</title>
        <description>Functional recovery was defined as partial or complete resolution of gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease. Gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bleeding. Complete response (CR) of intestinal GVHD was defined as the absence of any symptoms referable to intestinal GVHD. Partial response (PR) was defined as clearing of abdominal pain (or withdrawal of opioid analgesic requirements in patients treated for abdominal pain) and of grossly visible bleeding if present, and resolution of diarrhea or decrease in the three day average stool volume by ≥ 500 mL in patients with stool volumes of ≥ 500 mL. Progression of GVHD was defined as an increase in the three day average stool volume by &gt; 500 mL, or the development of new abdominal pain (or new opioid analgesic requirements) or new intestinal bleeding.</description>

        <description>Endoscopic evaluation of improvement. Categories include 1) no improvement, 2) regenerative changes, 3) limited improvement, 4) partial improvement and 5) complete response. Endoscopic manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include edema, erythema, mucosal ulceration and denudation. Complete mucosal recovery was defined as the appearance of intact mucosa with at least 98% of the luminal surface covered by epithelium. Partial response was defined as the appearance of mostly intact mucosa with at least 80% improvement or less than 10% denuded. Limited response was retrospectively designated to describe visible improvement that was less than partial response. Regenerative change was retrospectively designated to describe early reappearance of mucosal integrity in a previously denuded area but not sufficient to meet criteria for partial response. Failure to respond was defined as failure to meet partial response criteria.</description>
