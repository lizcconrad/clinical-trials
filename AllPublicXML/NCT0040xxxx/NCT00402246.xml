  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ability of clinicians to receive and
      review information from patients implanted with a heart device over the internet (remote
      care) is comparable to patients who are seen in-office for routine visits to check the status
      of their device.

    <measure>Symptomatic AT/AF Alerts</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment to last visit (up to 15 month post-implant)</time_frame>
    <description>AT/AF represents atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation which are arrhythmias involving rapid beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. The devices in this study store how many hours each day that a patient experiences AT/AF. The patient may not be aware they are experiencing these atrial arrhythmias, but if the AT/AF is accompanied by symptoms, the AT/AF is said to be symptomatic AT/AF. Devices in this study have an alert that fires if the patient experiences at least a programmed amount of AT/AF in a day. Measure is count of symptomatic AT/AF alerts as classified by the clinician</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Per Patient From a Clinical Event Onset to a Clinical Decision for Both Device Events and Symptom-driven Device Interrogations</measure>
    <time_frame>From event onset to clinical decision</time_frame>
    <description>Days from device detection of a clinical event or a symptom-driven device interrogation event onset to a clinical decision, as reported by the clinician or as evidenced by device data obtained at interrogation. A clinical event is an event as defined in the primary objective. A symptom-driven device interrogation event is defined as a subject complaint received by the managing clinician in which the clinician determines that he/she must interrogate the subject's device to properly treat the subject.</description>

    <measure>CareLink Transmission Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12 months visits</time_frame>
    <description>The CareLink Transmission Compliance Rate for a particular visit (e.g. 3 month visit) is the proportion (ranging from 0 to 1) of subjects with device interrogation data remotely transmitted via the CareLink system on the date it was scheduled to be sent for that visit. The proportion is a fraction in which the denominator is the number of subjects in the Remote Arm who were not exited from the trial prior to the visit of interest, and the numberator is the number of Remote Arm subjects who successfully transmitted device data via the CareLink system on the date it was scheduled to be sent.</description>

    <measure>Variability in Left Ventricular (LV) Threshold as Measured by Left Ventricular Capture Management (LVCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months visits</time_frame>
    <description>LV Capture Threshold is the required energy(volts) necessary to cause the left ventricule to contract. It is important that a device which paces the left ventricule be set to a threshold such that current conducted through the left ventricular lead will induce contraction in the left ventricle. However, these thresholds may vary over time.
The standard deviation and range (maximum LVCM threshold - minimum LVCM threshold) of the most recent 14 days of LVCM results prior to each follow-up visit were determined for each subject and used to assess within-patient variability in LV thresholds.</description>

    <measure>State-Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Anxiety scales for each subject were obtained at multiple time points. The State-Anxiety scale was derived by summing the 20 scores in the State section of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. The State-Anxiety scales can vary from a minimum of 20 (best possible) to a maximum of 80 (worst possible).</description>

    <description>The Remote Management method of treating patients consists of 3 components:
CareAlerts: Device alerts that are triggered by either device integrity issues or arrhythmic issues with the patient (e.g. multiple shocks delivered for a ventricular arrhythmia, more than 12 hours of atrial arrhythmias occurring in a day)
Conexus: the device feature which allows the device to wirelessly transmit information (possibly triggered by a CareAlert) to a patient monitor that is hooked up a patient's phone line
CareLink: the Medtronic system which allows device data to be transmitted from a patient's monitor through the phone line to ultimately be displayed on a secure website for viewing by the patient's physician.
The combination of these 3 components allow the patient's device to transmit information relating to either a device issue or patient issue to be viewed by a clinician without the patient having to take direct action.</description>

        <description>Days from device detection of a clinical event to a decision being made in response to the event, as reported by the clinician or as evidenced by device data obtained at interrogation. A clinical event could be any of the following that satisfied pre-specified thresholds: arrhythmias (e.g. at least 12 hours of atrial tachycard/atrial fibrillation in a day), cardiovascular disease progression (e.g. multiple device shocks delivered to terminate a single episode), or device issues (e.g. low battery).</description>

          <title>Time Per Patient From a Clinical Event to a Clinical Decision in Response to Arrhythmias, Cardiovascular (CV) Disease Progression, and Device Issues</title>
          <description>Days from device detection of a clinical event to a decision being made in response to the event, as reported by the clinician or as evidenced by device data obtained at interrogation. A clinical event could be any of the following that satisfied pre-specified thresholds: arrhythmias (e.g. at least 12 hours of atrial tachycard/atrial fibrillation in a day), cardiovascular disease progression (e.g. multiple device shocks delivered to terminate a single episode), or device issues (e.g. low battery).</description>
          <population>All enrolled subjects who experienced at least one event and satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria were included in the analysis. An intention to treat analysis was performed for this objective.</population>

            <description>Wireless remote monitoring, consisting of 3 components:
CareAlerts: Device alerts that are triggered by either device integrity issues or arrhythmic issues with the patient (e.g. multiple shocks delivered for a ventricular arrhythmia, more than 12 hours of atrial arrhythmias occurring in a day)
Conexus: the device feature which allows the device to wirelessly transmit information (possibly triggered by a CareAlert) to a patient monitor that is hooked up a patient's phone line
CareLink: the Medtronic system which allows device data to be transmitted from a patient's monitor through the phone line to ultimately be displayed on a secure website for viewing by the patient's physician.
The combination of these 3 components allow the patient's device to transmit information relating to either a device issue or patient issue to be viewed by a clinician without the patient having to take direct action.</description>

        <title>Symptomatic AT/AF Alerts</title>
        <description>AT/AF represents atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation which are arrhythmias involving rapid beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. The devices in this study store how many hours each day that a patient experiences AT/AF. The patient may not be aware they are experiencing these atrial arrhythmias, but if the AT/AF is accompanied by symptoms, the AT/AF is said to be symptomatic AT/AF. Devices in this study have an alert that fires if the patient experiences at least a programmed amount of AT/AF in a day.

CareAlerts: Device alerts that are triggered by either device integrity issues or arrhythmic issues with the patient (e.g. multiple shocks delivered for a ventricular arrhythmia, more than 12 hours of atrial arrhythmias occurring in a day)
Conexus: the device feature which allows the device to wirelessly transmit information (possibly triggered by a CareAlert) to a patient monitor that is hooked up a patient's phone line
CareLink: the Medtronic system which allows device data to be transmitted from a patient's monitor through the phone line to ultimately be displayed on a secure website for viewing by the patient's physician.

          <title>Symptomatic AT/AF Alerts</title>
          <description>AT/AF represents atrial tachycardia or atrial fibrillation which are arrhythmias involving rapid beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. The devices in this study store how many hours each day that a patient experiences AT/AF. The patient may not be aware they are experiencing these atrial arrhythmias, but if the AT/AF is accompanied by symptoms, the AT/AF is said to be symptomatic AT/AF. Devices in this study have an alert that fires if the patient experiences at least a programmed amount of AT/AF in a day. Measure is count of symptomatic AT/AF alerts as classified by the clinician</description>
          <population>All enrolled remote patients who experienced at least one AT/AF alert were included in the analysis. AT/AF alerts there were not classified by the clinician as symptomatic or asymptomatic were excluded from the analysis.</population>

        <title>CareLink Transmission Compliance</title>
        <description>The CareLink Transmission Compliance Rate for a particular visit (e.g. 3 month visit) is the proportion (ranging from 0 to 1) of subjects with device interrogation data remotely transmitted via the CareLink system on the date it was scheduled to be sent for that visit. The proportion is a fraction in which the denominator is the number of subjects in the Remote Arm who were not exited from the trial prior to the visit of interest, and the numberator is the number of Remote Arm subjects who successfully transmitted device data via the CareLink system on the date it was scheduled to be sent.</description>
        <time_frame>3, 6, 9, 12 months visits</time_frame>
        <population>9 of 1014 remote arm subjects did not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining 1005 remote arm subjects were included in the analysis.</population>

CareAlerts: Device alerts that are triggered by either device integrity issues or arrhythmic issues with the patient (e.g. multiple shocks delivered for a ventricular arrhythmia, more than 12 hours of atrial arrhythmias occurring in a day)
Conexus: the device feature which allows the device to wirelessly transmit information (possibly triggered by a CareAlert) to a patient monitor that is hooked up a patient's phone line
CareLink: the Medtronic system which allows device data to be transmitted from a patient's monitor through the phone line to ultimately be displayed on a secure website for viewing by the patient's physician.
The combination of these 3 components allow the patient's device to transmit information relating to either a device issue or patient issue to be viewed by a clinician without the patient having to take direct action.</description>

        <title>Variability in Left Ventricular (LV) Threshold as Measured by Left Ventricular Capture Management (LVCM)</title>
        <description>LV Capture Threshold is the required energy(volts) necessary to cause the left ventricule to contract. It is important that a device which paces the left ventricule be set to a threshold such that current conducted through the left ventricular lead will induce contraction in the left ventricle. However, these thresholds may vary over time.
The standard deviation and range (maximum LVCM threshold - minimum LVCM threshold) of the most recent 14 days of LVCM results prior to each follow-up visit were determined for each subject and used to assess within-patient variability in LV thresholds.</description>

        <population>All enrolled subjects who were implanted with a Concerto CRT-D (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy with Defibrillation)device, met inclusion/exclusion criteria, and had daily LVCM measurement for at least one of the 6 scheduled visits/transmissions were included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>The State-Anxiety scales for each subject were obtained at multiple time points. The State-Anxiety scale was derived by summing the 20 scores in the State section of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire. The State-Anxiety scales can vary from a minimum of 20 (best possible) to a maximum of 80 (worst possible).</description>

            <description>Wireless remote monitoring, consisting of 3 components:
CareAlerts: Device alerts that are triggered by either device integrity issues or arrhythmic issues with the patient (e.g. multiple shocks delivered for a ventricular arrhythmia, more than 12 hours of atrial arrhythmias occurring in a day)
Conexus: the device feature which allows the device to wirelessly transmit information (possibly triggered by a CareAlert) to a patient monitor that is hooked up a patient's phone line
CareLink: the Medtronic system which allows device data to be transmitted from a patient's monitor through the phone line to ultimately be displayed on a secure website for viewing by the patient's physician.
The combination of these 3 components allow the patient's device to transmit information relating to either a device issue or patient issue to be viewed by a clinician without the patient having to take direct action.</description>
