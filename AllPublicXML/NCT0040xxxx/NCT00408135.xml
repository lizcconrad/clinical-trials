      The primary objective is to assess the safety of telithromycin (HMR 3647) (20% fine granules)
      1g filling sachet in children with infections (Respiratory tract infections, Dermatological
      infections, Otorhinolaryngological infections, Dentistry/Oral surgery infections).

      Secondary objectives are to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and
      acceptability of telithromycin (20% fine granules) 1g filling sachet in children with
      infections.
