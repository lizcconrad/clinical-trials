  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The following are done for screening procedures to determine if patients are eligible for
      this study: blood count, kidney and liver blood tests. Patients will complete a 6-minute walk
      test. Patients will be instructed to follow a no-added-salt diet for 1-3 weeks before the
      study and for the whole duration of the study. Diet instructions will be given to the patient
      and the patient will collect his/her urine for 24 hours before the active study day. Patients
      will need to avoid strenuous exercise and abstain from smoking, alcohol, and caffeine for 3
      days prior to the study days. Patients will remain on their regular medications.

      Participants in this study will be randomized to receive BNP or placebo (an inactive, saline
      shot). The participant will need to give themselves a shot in their stomach (similar to
      diabetics giving themselves insulin) twice a day for twelve weeks. The study requires a
      screening visit to determine eligibility and discuss the study. At this visit a blood draw
      for heart and liver function and a six minute walk will be done. There will also be two other
      outpatient visits and two inpatient stays, for 48 hours, in the General Clinical Research
      Center (GCRC) at St. Marys Hospital. During the two in-patient stays in the GCRC, blood and
      urine samples will be done to get heart and kidney function as well as a research echo. After
      enrollment, the study lasts for twelve weeks. There is a one week visit in outpatient setting
      getting a blood draw and a 6 week visit in outpatient setting to get a blood draw, 24 hour
      urine collection and resupply the study medication. There is a one week visit in outpatient
      setting getting a blood draw and a 6 week visit in outpatient setting to get a blood draw, 24
      hour urine collection and resupply the study medication.

    <time_frame>baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Kidney function was measured by GFR determined by iothalamate clearance. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney measured in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m^2 of body surface area. A lower GFR means the kidney is not filtering normally. An estimated GFR of less than 60 mg/min/1.73 m^2 of body surface area is considered to be impaired kidney function.</description>

    <description>Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) is a surrogate of left ventricular hypertrophy and a predictor of cardiac morbidity and mortality in adults with hypertension. LVMI was measured with echocardiography, indexed to body surface area estimated by left ventricular (LV) cavity dimension and wall thickness at end-diastole.</description>

        <title>Change in Renal Function as Measured by Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in Response to Saline Load</title>
        <description>Kidney function was measured by GFR determined by iothalamate clearance. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney measured in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m^2 of body surface area. A lower GFR means the kidney is not filtering normally. An estimated GFR of less than 60 mg/min/1.73 m^2 of body surface area is considered to be impaired kidney function.</description>
