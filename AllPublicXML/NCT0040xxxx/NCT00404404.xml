      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ABI-007, work in different ways stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving ABI-007 together with bevacizumab may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II is studying how well giving ABI-007 together with bevacizumab works in
      treating women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the activity of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
           (ABI-007; Abraxane^®) and bevacizumab, in terms of progression-free survival and
           response rate, in women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (ABI-007; Abraxane^®)
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
