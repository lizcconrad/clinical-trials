  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the ability of olmesartan medoxomil to lower the blood pressure of
      patients with Type II diabetes and high blood pressure. The medication being tested has been
      approved by the FDA for the treatment of high blood pressure.

    <description>Blood pressure (BP) measurements were taken every three weeks for 12 weeks. In accordance with their BP results, participants either stayed on their current medication or were started on the next higher regimen at the 3, 6, or 9 week visits. All participants began at 20 mg olmesartan, once daily for 3 weeks. The next higher regimen was olmesartan 40 mg, followed by olmesartan 40 mg + 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, followed by olmesartan 40 mg + 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide.</description>
