    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide scientific evidence of the efficacy and safety of this agent as
      'add-on' therapy for adult patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on standard medication.
      The aims are to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of AKL 1 companred to placebo in
      the treatment of asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is of either sex and between the ages of 18 to 70 years, inclusive.

          2. The patient has received verbal and written study information, all questions have been
             answered satisfactorily and a consent form has been personally signed and dated by the
             patient and the investigator.

          3. The patient has a diagnosis of persistent chronic bronchial asthma (with reference to
             the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, NIH, NHLBI. Global Initiative for
             asthma. NIH Publication no.96-3659B. Bethesda, MD:NID 1998) ).

          4. The patient has a FEV1 (% predicted) of &gt; 60% at Visit 1.

          5. The patient has a positive reversibility test (or history of such) with &gt;or equal 15%
             improvement in FEV1 from 15 to 30 minutes after inhalation of at least 200 ug of
             salbutamol (beta-2-adrenergic agonist administration) or PEF variability of 20% as
             described in current BTS/SIGN guidelines (British Thoracic Society, Scottish
             Intercollegiate Guideline Network. British Guidelines on the Management of Asthma.
             Thorax 2003;58:1-94.

          6. Females must be postmenopausal (&gt; 1 year), surgically sterile or using adequate
             contraception (hormonal contraception, intrauterine device), not breast-feeding and
             have a negative serum pregnancy test.

          7. The patient is in satisfactory health with the exception of asthma as determined by
             the investigator on the basis of medical history and physical examination.

          8. In the investigator’s judgment, the patient is able and willing to comply with Study
             Visits and procedures (including laboratory tests, lung function tests), and accurate
             and timely completion of an electronic asthma diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has poorly controlled asthma defined as requiring a course of oral or
             parenteral corticosteroids, admission to hospital for asthma (including treatment in
             an emergency room), or exacerbation of asthma in the three months prior to Visit 1 (in
             the investigator’s judgment).

          2. Maintenance oral corticosteroid treatment.

          3. The patient has seasonal asthma alone.

          4. Use of unlicensed doses of inhaled corticosteroid medication (&gt;2000mcg beclomethasone
             diproprionate/ day or equivalent).

          5. The patient has any known laboratory abnormality, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, would contraindicate study participation, including, blood urea nitrogen
             (BUN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;or equal
             1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL.

          6. The patient is unable to discontinue short-acting beta-2-adrenergic agonists for at
             least 4 hours prior to the Screening Visit.

          7. The patient has chronic heart failure class III or IV (New York Heart Association).

          8. The patient has a recent (less than six months) history of stroke, transient ischemic
             attack or myocardial infarction.

          9. The patient has a history of known alcohol or substance abuse within the one-year
             prior to Visit 1.

         10. The patient is not able to follow study procedures (e.g., language problems,
             psychological disorders) or is considered to be non-compliant according to the
             investigator.

         11. The patient has an active malignancy of any type or history of a malignancy (with the
             exception of patients with malignancy surgically removed with no evidence of
             recurrence within five years before enrolment, and patients with history of treated
             basal cell carcinoma).

         12. The patient has any other severe or acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study

         13. The patient has significant uncontrolled chronic disease, such as hepatic or renal
             insufficiency, which in the opinion of the investigator, would contraindicate study
             participation or confound interpretation of the results.

         14. The patient has difficulty swallowing capsules or tablets, dysphagia or is unable to
             tolerate oral medication.
