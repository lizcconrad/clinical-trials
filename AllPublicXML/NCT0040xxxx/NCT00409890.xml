      To determine whether hyoscine butyl bromide is effective in shortening the first stage of
      labor, with no increase in maternal or neonatal complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyoscine butyl bromide has been used to shorten the duration of labor in several hospitals
      here in Jamaica, as it has elsewhere in the world. Thus, it represents a new addition to the
      armamentarium of active management. The mechanism by which it acts in the context of labor
      has not yet been elucidated, and the evidence for its efficacy was previously largely
      anecdotal. The specific objectives of this project are to assess whether hyoscine butyl
      bromide (in the form of Buscopan®) is effective in hastening cervical effacement and
      dilatation, thus shortening the duration of the first stage of labor. We also intend to
      determine whether the use of hyoscine butyl bromide in the first stage of labor has any
      associated increase in complications, such as an increase in blood loss or rate of Caesarean
      deliveries, or a decrease in neonatal APGAR scores.

      The study was designed as a double blind, randomized, controlled, clinical trial comparing
      two groups of patients matched for age and parity. One group of patients received the 20 mg(1
      ml)of hyoscine butyl bromide, while the other (control) group received 1 ml of normal saline
      (placebo).
