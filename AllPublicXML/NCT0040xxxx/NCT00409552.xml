  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) can be used to distract patients
      from pain and anxiety during painful medical procedures for which medication provides
      inadequate relief. An inexpensive, commercially available VE could have significant impact in
      reducing perceived pain involved in a variety of medical procedures. The Virtual Reality
      Medical Center (VRMC) developed an engaging virtual world that proved to be effective in
      reducing reported pain ratings of participants experiencing several different forms of
      painful stimuli. The virtual world called Icy Cool World was found to successfully distract
      patients from painful stimuli and reduce patients' perceived levels of pain. Phase II looks
      to expand on these findings and examine the effectiveness as a pain distraction technique for
      a variety of acute and chronic pain etiologies. The main objective of the clinical
      investigation will be to expand on the findings from earlier studies and obtain a more
      comprehensive analysis regarding the clinical versatility of VR pain distraction.
