  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label, multi-centre study for Korean women with postmenopausal
      osteoporosis, evaluating the preference for either the once-monthly dosing of ibandronate or
      the once-weekly dosing of risedronate.

      Eligible subjects will be randomised either ibandronate monthly regimen or risedronate weekly
      regimen.

      Treatment period consists of 3 month with ibandronate 150mg and additional 12 week with
      risedronate 35 mg or vice versa.

      After taking the first interventional medicine for 3 months or 12 weeks completely, a subject
      changes the treatment arm. There is no washout period.
