    <textblock>
      Alefacept is a new anti-psoriatic drug within the group of the so-called biologics. In about
      30% of patients alefacept induces a more than 75% improvement of psoriasis after a 12-week
      treatment period. The start of anti-psoriatic effect by alefacept is delayed, however
      improvement of psoriatic lesions outlasts the end of alefacept treatment.

      Narrowband UVB (UVB-311nm) phototherapy is an established anti-psoriatic treatment regimen
      with rapid onset of anti-psoriatic efficacy but disease-free intervals after the end of
      successful treatment courses may be short.

      Therefore, in this half-side (left/right side) comparison study we aim to investigate whether
      an additional narrowband UVB treatment accelerates and improves the anti-psoriatic treatment
      effects of alefacept.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease that affects an estimated 2% to 3% of the world's
      population. There are a wide range of local and systemic clinical treatments and agents for
      clearing, or at least reducing the expression of, psoriatic skin lesions. There is a new
      generation of antipsoriatic drugs that specifically target T-cell mediated inflammatory
      pathways and that are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in the
      United States. Alefacept (Amevive) is one of these so-called biologics. Alefacept appears to
      have several advantages over other systemic antipsoriatic agents and is very well tolerated
      by patients. Weekly administration of alefacept for 12 weeks reduced the psoriasis area and
      severity index (PASI) by greater than 75% in 30% of patients. The maximal antipsoriatic
      effect, however, apparently occurs after the 12-week course has ended. In vitro studies and
      previous case reports suggested that alefacept's antipsoriatic effect may be augmented when
      it is administered in combination with UVB. These findings prompted us to conduct a
      prospective randomized half-body comparison study, in which we ask whether the clinical
      response of psoriatic lesions to alefacept could be improved by combining alefacept with
      standard UVB 311nm phototherapy.

      Comparison: Psoriatic patients are treated with intravenous alefacept once per week for 12
      weeks. One randomized chosen body-half (left or right side) is additionally treated with
      narrowband UVB (UVB-311nm) three times per week until complete clearance of psoriatic lesions
      at the UV-treated side. PASI is evaluated before, weekly during, and for 3 to 12 months after
      alefacept +/- narrowband UVB treatment.
