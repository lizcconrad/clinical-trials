  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a combination of Optive® Artificial
      Tears with Restasis®.The primary hypothesis is that the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)
      score and symptoms will be the same or lower than baseline after treatment in these patients.
      The patients will tolerate the combination of Restasis® and Optive® with a low incidence of
      clinical adverse events.
