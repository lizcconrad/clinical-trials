  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Red Cross has funded a multidisciplinary, comprehensive evaluation and treatment
      program for target individuals with suspected World Trade Center (WTC)-related health
      problems. The populations served consist predominantly of a) local residents who were
      impacted by the disperion of the WTC dusts and fumes, b) individuals involved in cleaning and
      debris removal of local commercial spaces, and c) responders to the WTC collapse. These
      populations are recruited from past and ongoing programs that we have developed as well as
      from ongoing collaborations with community organizations that include: the Beyond Ground Zero
      Network, 9/11 Environmental Action committee, and the WTC Residents Coalition. In addition,
      there is collaboration with the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center and the centers
      involved in the ongoing WTC Workers and Volunteer Medical Screening and Monitoring Program.
      We would now like to access the data from this treatment program to create a NYU/Bellevue WTC
      Health Impacts Research Registry to increase knowledge about the health effects of exposure
      to World Trade Center dust.
