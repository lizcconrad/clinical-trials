    <textblock>
      Cilostazol is an kind of oral antiplatelet agent with a rapid onset of action that
      selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase III, a mechanism different from adenosine diphosphate
      (ADP) receptor antagonists. Previous studies had suggested that cilostazol has
      lipid-modifying and vasodilating effects in addition to antiplatelet effects. From those
      experimental and clinical backgrounds, we assumed that triple antiplatelet therapy with
      aspirin, clopidogrel, and cilostazol might have a beneficial effect on the prevention of
      atherothrombosis complications following coronary stenting. Therefore, we evaluated the
      safety and efficacy of triple antiplatelet regimen of aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol
      compared with dual antiplatelet regimen of aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with acute
      coronary syndrome undergoing successful coronary artery stenting.

      Patients undergoing successful coronary stenting were divided into dual antiplatelet therapy
      (aspirin plus clopidogrel) and triple antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel plus
      cilostazol) groups. All enrolled patients in triple regimen group will receive cilostazol
      100mg, b.i.d., for 6 months in addition to standard dose and duration of aspirin and
      clopidogrel for post-PCI. The primary endpoints included death, myocardial infarction, target
      lesion revascularization, stent thrombosis within 30 days, binary restenosis at six month and
      major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at one year. The secondary endpoints were side effects of
      study drugs, including major bleeding, vascular complication, hypersensitivebility, and
      bleeding complications. The study will be powered to test the hypothesis that triple
      antiplatelet therapy is better than dual antiplatelet therapy.
