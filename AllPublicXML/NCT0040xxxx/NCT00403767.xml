  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with warfarin
      for the prevention of blood clots in the brain (referred to as stroke) and blood clots in
      other parts of the body referred to as non-central nervous system systemic embolism) in
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm disorder).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for stroke and non-central
      nervous system (non-CNS) systemic embolism, will be randomized (assigned by chance) to
      receive treatment with rivaroxaban or warfarin, two different anticoagulants (substances that
      prevent blood clots). Treatment will be double-blinded (neither the patient nor study staff
      will know which study drug is assigned to patients during the study). Patients assigned to
      rivaroxaban will receive rivaroxaban 20 mg orally (p.o.) once daily (OD) plus warfarin
      placebo p.o. OD titrated to a target sham international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5.
      Patients with moderate renal impairment at screening will receive rivaroxaban 15 mg p.o. OD.
      Patients assigned to warfarin will receive warfarin p.o. OD titrated to a target INR of 2.5
      plus rivaroxaban placebo p.o. OD. The maximum expected length of treatment is up to 32 months
      but may be extended up to 4 years.

      <recruitment_details>This study, an efficacy and safety study of Rivaroxaban with Warfarin for the prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, was conducted from 18 December 2006 to 07 September 2010. Patients were recruited at 1,170 study centers located in 45 countries worldwide.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 14,269 patients were randomized in the study. Five patients were randomized twice bringing the number of randomized unique patients to 14,264. A total of 14,236 (7111 and 7125 patients in the rivaroxaban and warfarin groups, respectively) unique patients took at least 1 dose of study medication and were included in the Safety Population.</pre_assignment_details>
