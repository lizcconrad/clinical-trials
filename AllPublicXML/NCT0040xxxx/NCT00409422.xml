      To compare anthropometric and metabolic effects of a comprehensive weight management program
      on obese adolescents and children in comparison to regular clinical weight management visits.

    <textblock>
      Patients are randomized (2:1) to either the intensive or standard treatment (control). Those
      who get randomized into the intensive group go to a family-based weight management program,
      including exercise, nutrition, behavior modification, and parenting classes. The intensive
      group is further randomized into a diet or non-dieting class to compare the outcomes of two
      different nutrition intervention methods. These classes meet twice per week (exercise twice
      per week and nutrition/behavior modification once per week)for first six months and then only
      twice per month during last six months. An exercise physiologist supervises the exercise
      component, which involves 45 minutes of aerobic activity (targeted at 65 to 80 percent of the
      subject's estimated maximum heart rate. A registered dietitian facilitates the nutrition and
      behavior component. A social worker facilitates parent classes when the children have a
      behavior modification topic in their class (parents only attend nutrition sessions). Those
      who get randomized into the control group go to clinic visits every 6 months. Intervention
      subjects go to clinic, as well, every 6 months to obtain the same measurements as the
      controls (weight, BMI, % fat, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, lipids, blood pressure).
