  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis underlying this study is that failure to recognise the role of lactose
      intolerance among patients with ulcerative colitis has led to inappropriate dietary advice
      and treatment with drugs that contain lactose as a filler. These failures exacerbate symptoms
      and lead to the unnecessary use of immune suppressant drugs.

      There is disagreement amongst researchers regarding the amount of lactose needed to cause
      symptoms in those who are lactose intolerance. The general consensus is that the amount of
      lactose in a glass of milk (12 grams) is enough to cause mild symptoms in most patients who
      are lactose intolerant (1). However, there have been a number of studies and case studies
      that argue that much lower amounts can cause symptoms (2, 3, 4, 5). This could be as little
      as 0.02 grams (6).

      Ulcerative colitis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum,
      characterised by recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and profuse diarrhoea. The prevalence
      of lactose intolerance in patients with ulcerative colitis is not greater than in the general
      population, but there is no evidence as to whether these patients are more sensitive to
      lactose.

      This study will identify the threshold at which symptoms of lactose intolerance develop in
      those who have both lactose intolerance and ulcerative colitis, to provide appropriate advice
      and treatment in the management of patients with these conditions.
