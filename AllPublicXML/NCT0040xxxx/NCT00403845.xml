  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to obtain data about the efficacy and safety of 3 doses of indacaterol
      (150, 300, and 600 µg) in Japanese patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      so that optimal dose(s) could be chosen for testing in later studies.

    <time_frame>From 22 to 24 hours post-dose on Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made in each treatment period at 22, 23, and 24 hours post-dose on Day 2. Standardized FEV1 AUC was calculated by the trapezoidal rule. The analysis included patient, period, and treatment group as fixed effects and baseline FEV1 prior to drug administration in the treatment period as a covariate.</description>
