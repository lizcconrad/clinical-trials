  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Rosiglitazone,decreases the ADMA
      concentration and thereby increases the arginine/ADMA ratio of critically ill patients.

    <textblock>
      Endothelial vasodilatation dysfunction precedes the development of arteriosclerosis. The
      endothelium plays a pivotal role in the control of the vascular tone by releasing nitric
      oxide (NO). The amino acid arginine is the sole substrate for the enzyme NO synthase (NOS).
      Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous derivative of arginine that inhibits NOS.
      Thus the arginine/ADMA ratio an important determinant of NO production by NOS. ADMA is an
      independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but elevated levels of ADMA have also
      been shown to be a strong independent predictor of ICU mortality. The central mechanism by
      which ADMA may cause deterioration in critically ill patients is by impairing organ blood
      flow and reducing cardiac function, especially during stress. Accumulation of ADMA could
      thereby be a causative factor in the development multi organ failure (MOF). Thus inhibition
      of NO production by ADMA may become especially important when cardiac demand is increased.
