  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether a simple manipulative technique of relaxing the
      tissues of the occipito-atlantal junction in the neck had any effect on the activity of the
      sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Subjects were dark adapted then measures of
      pupillary activity, reflecting autonomic nervous system activity were taken before and after
      treatment. The study hypothesis was that thet treatment technique would have no effect on the
      pupillary measures, hence indicating no effect on autonomic system activity.

      This study was a within subjects/crossover design in which each subject received the
      treatment and served as his/her own control. 100 subjects were recruited from the
      student/staff population of the university, were 18 y/o or older with no condition affecting
      pupillary activity. Pupillary activity was measured with a PLR100 pupillometer and included
      pupillary diameter, pupillary response latency, maximum constriction velocity and maximum
      redilation velocity. Subjects were adapted to a dim light environment, measures taken,
      treatment given at either third or fourth time period and measures retaken. The study was
      approved by the NSU IRB. Subject numbers were sufficient to have statistical power to find an
      effect. The study found an effect of treatment on maximum size, showing a decrease with
      treatment.
