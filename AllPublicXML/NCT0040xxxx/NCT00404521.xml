      Phase I single-institution, open-label, dose-escalating, clinical and pharmacokinetic study.
      The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability and to identify the dose limiting
      toxicities(DLT) and recommended dose (RD) of PM02734 administered every 3 weeks,
      intravenously, over 30 minutes to subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors.

      Phase I single-institution, open-label, dose-escalating, clinical and pharmacokinetic study.
      The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability and to identify the dose limiting
      toxicities(DLT) and recommended dose (RD) of PM02734 administered every 3 weeks,
      intravenously, over 30 minutes to subjects with advanced malignant solid tumors. Secondary
      objectives are to determine preliminary Pharmacokinetics of PM02734, to explore the
      relationships between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. To evaluate the preliminary
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics correlation and to evaluate the preliminary antitumor
      activity of PM02734. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and
      applicable regulatory requirements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntary written informed consent of the subject obtained before any study-specific
             procedure.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumor.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. Subject with measurable or non-measurable disease using the RECIST criteria (only
             subjects with measurable disease are allowed to enter the expanded cohort).

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x109/L , hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL and absolute neutrophil count
                  (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x109/L.

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x the upper limit of normality (ULN) (&lt; 5 x ULN in
                  case of extensive bone metastases).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): ≤ 2.5 x ULN (&lt;5 x ULN in case of extensive
                  liver metastases).

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 x ULN (&lt;5 x ULN in case of extensive liver
                  metastases).

               -  Total bilirubin:1.5 ≤ ULN, unless due to Gilbert's syndrome.

               -  Creatinine: ≤ ULN, or measured creatinine clearance: ≥ 60 mL/min without
                  significant proteinuria (&gt;250 mg/m2 /day)

               -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL.

               -  Partial thromboplastin time ≤ 1.1 x ULN

               -  INR ≤ 1.1

                  hepatitis).

               -  Significant non-neoplastic renal disease.

               -  Immunocompromised subjects, including subjects known to be infected by human

                  within the last month or hospital admission within the last 3 months).

               -  Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially
                  increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this study.

          7. Limitation of the subject's ability to comply with the treatment or to follow-up at a
             participating protocol. Subjects registered on this trial must be treated and followed
