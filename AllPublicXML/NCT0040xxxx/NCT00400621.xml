  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective was to evaluate the safety of ten consecutive days of therapeutic
      acetaminophen dosing in moderate alcohol consumers. The main outcome was liver injury
      (measured by an increase in mean serum ALT or AST levels). Patients were randomly assigned to
      10 days of acetaminophen or placebo. Blood tests were measured at baseline, day 4 and day 11
      to look for injury. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in liver enzymes
      between the two groups.

        Inclusion criteria Adult volunteers of age 21 years or older, regardless of ethnicity or
        gender, who provided written consent and met all three of the following criteria of a
        moderate alcohol consumer:

          1. Average baseline ethanol consumption of at least one alcoholic beverage per day before
             enrollment for the past two months. The estimate of ethanol intake was based on the
             average intake over seven days. For example, a person who ingested no alcohol on
             Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, two drinks on Thursday and four drinks on Friday
             and Saturday would be calculated as 10 drinks/7days = 1.4 drinks/day. The average
             alcoholic beverage contains 15 grams of alcohol(9).

          2. Average baseline ethanol consumption of no more than three alcoholic beverages (&gt; 45
             grams of alcohol) per day, calculated as a weekly average over the preceding two
             months.

          3. At least one alcohol-containing drink within the last 48 hours

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects were excluded from the study at baseline if any of the following were evident at
        baseline:

          1. Serum acetaminophen level greater than 20 mcg/ml

          2. Serum AST or ALT levels greater than 50 IU/L

          3. If female, positive for b-HCG

          4. Clinically intoxicated, psychiatrically impaired or unable to give informed consent

          5. Known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen

          6. History of ingesting more than four grams of acetaminophen per day for any of the four
             days preceding study enrollment

          7. Alcoholic patients as defined by those who consume on average more than three
             alcoholic beverages daily

          8. Currently enrolled in another trial or had been enrolled in another trial in the
             preceding three months
