  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this phase III study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the
      fixed combination of pyronaridine artesunate (180:60 mg) with that of the combination of
      mefloquine plus artesunate in children and adults with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum malaria kills over one million people and results in up to 500 million
      cases annually, affecting mainly young children and pregnant women. Artemisinin-based
      combination therapies (ACT) are considered today by WHO to be the best anti-malarials in
      terms of efficacy and lower propensity to resistance. Pyronaridine artesunate is a new ACT,
      in development to treat acute uncomplicated malaria. Pyronaridine and artesunate are
      antimalarial agents with a history of clinical use both separately and in combination with
      other drugs.Each drug has powerful antischizonticidal actions. The aim of a fixed dose
      combination of pyronaridine and artesunate in the treatment of uncomplicated acute malaria is
      to provide rapid reduction in parasitaemia with a three-day regimen, thereby improving
      compliance and reducing the risk of recrudescence through the slower elimination of
      pyronaridine.
