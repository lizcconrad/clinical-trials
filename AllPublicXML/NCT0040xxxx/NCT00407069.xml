  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent
      viral skin infections. Recent studies have demonstrated that the skin of people with AD my
      have decreased antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression. The purpose of this study is to
      compare smallpox virus replication and the number of AMPs and other antiviral molecules in
      people with AD, as compared to those seen in people with psoriasis or asthma, or healthy
      individuals.

      AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by frequent viral skin infections.
      Recent studies have found that components in the skin of people with AD may block AMP
      expression. AMPs are responsible for preventing infection from viruses. The purpose of this
      study is to examine smallpox virus replication and AMP expression in the skin of patients
      with AD as well as identify other antiviral molecules involved in immune response. These
      findings will be compared with those of people with psoriasis or asthma, or healthy
      individuals. This study will consist of one study visit at which skin and blood samples will
      be taken.
