  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that donepezil slows the progression of
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to measure the
      volume of the hippocampus in patients with pre-dementia Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of a new automated method of measurement of the volume of the hippocampus
      allows confirming these results in patients presenting with pre-dementia Alzheimer's Disease
      (AD), treated with donepezil in order to verify if this product is capable of stopping the
      speed of the atrophy of the hippocampus in patients and more specifically in those who will
      evolve to AD, compared to a placebo. This method is a semi automatic segmentation of the
      hippocampus from MRI, made by competitive region growing.

      It was developed at the cognitive neurosciences and MRI laboratory in Pitié-Salpêtrière
      hospital. This method was validated on healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease patients by
      comparison with manual segmentation.

      Neuropsychological tests will be realized in order to supervise the clinical evolution of the
      patients and to correlate these results to the progression of the atrophy of the hippocampus.
