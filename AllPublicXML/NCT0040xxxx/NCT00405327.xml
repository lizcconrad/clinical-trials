  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Localized solid tumors such as, sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms' tumor, can generally be
      effectively treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However,
      patients with metastatic or relapsed disease have a very poor prognosis.

      New approaches to the management of these difficult groups of patients are needed. There is
      evidence to suggest that solid tumors may be good candidates for immunotherapy approaches. In
      fact, recent experimental evidence indicates that the period of lymphopenia that occurs after
      stem cell transplant may be an opportune time to use an immunotherapy treatment approach. In
      light of the very poor prognosis of young patients with advanced solid tumors, this treatment
      approach warrants further investigation.

      Localized solid tumors such as, sarcoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms' tumor, can generally be
      effectively treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However,
      patients with metastatic or relapsed disease have a very poor prognosis.

      For the past decade, efforts to increase overall survival and progression-free survival for
      patients with high-risk pediatric and young adult tumors, have evaluated the use of high-dose
      chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The proportion of patients
      who enter a complete remission with HSCT is high, ranging from 81 to 90%. While autologous
      HSCT renders a large proportion of patients temporarily disease-free, relapse develops in the
      majority of patients.

      Survival appears to have been most improved with this strategy for neuroblastoma, but
      relapses occur in the majority of patients. Similar strategies have also been tried for
      patients with advanced stage sarcoma and Wilms' tumor, but relapses are even more
      problematic.

      New approaches to the management of these difficult groups of patients are needed. There is
      evidence to suggest that solid tumors may be good candidates for immunotherapy approaches. In
      fact, recent experimental evidence indicates that the period of lymphopenia that occurs after
      HSCT may be an opportune time to use this treatment approach. In light of the very poor
      prognosis of young patients with advanced solid tumors, this treatment approach warrants
      further investigation.

      <textblock>
        Eligibility

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To participate in this study, it is necessary to collect sufficient tumor and peripheral
        blood stem cells to both develop the vaccine and perform the autologous stem cell
        transplant. Patients who also have previously had tumor or stem cells collected, which are
        available and sufficient for this study, are eligible to participate as study subjects.

          1. Patients must have a histologically verified diagnosis of neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor,
             or sarcoma, including rhabdomyosarcoma, a Ewing's sarcoma family tumor (ES, PNET),
             synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, or desmoplastic round cell tumor.

             and must meet one of the following criteria:

               1. have metastatic disease at diagnosis

               2. have never achieved complete remission following frontline standard therapy

               3. have relapsed after receiving standard therapy

          2. Patients must have been &lt; 30 years of age at the time of original diagnosis.

          3. Patients must have a source of tumor tissue from which approximately 1 gram of viable
             tumor can be obtained for vaccine development.

          4. Patients must have a good performance status (&gt;70% by Lansky or Karnofsky scales).

          5. Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 16 weeks.

          6. Females of child-bearing age (&gt;= 12 years old) must have a negative pregnancy test.

             Patients may enroll on this study at various points in their treatment including
             diagnosis, recurrence, or just prior to initiation of study mandated transplant
             therapy. Because patients may enter this study prior to completion of retransplant
             treatments, the below criteria must be met only to proceed to the high dose
             chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant part of this study. These criteria
             are not a requirement to enter this study in order to collect tumor or peripheral
             blood stem cells.

          7. Patients must have achieved complete response or very good partial response(&gt;= 90%
             decrease in tumor volume) before proceeding to transplant. For patients enrolling on
             this study just prior to transplant a VGPR or CR must be achieved to be eligible.

          8. Patients may have undergone prior autologous peripheral blood stem cell
             transplantation, provided at least 12 months have elapsed prior to entry on this
             study.

          9. Patients must have had a successful peripheral blood stem cell collection, with
             cryopreservation of PBSCs for both engraftment and for generation of dendritic cells.

         10. Adequate baseline organ function must be present:

             hematologic parameters (not applicable if bone marrow is involved with tumor):

               1. ANC &gt; 500/mm3

               2. platelet count &gt; 50,000/mm3

               3. serum creatinine &lt; 1.5x upper limit of normal for age

               4. serum hepatic transaminases (AST, ALT) &lt; 3x upper limit of normal

               5. serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5x upper limit of normal

               6. cardiac echocardiogram with either SF &gt; 27% or EF &gt; 50%. A comparable EF on a
                  MUGA scan will also meet eligibility criteria.

         11. Give or obtain informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received prior antitumor vaccines are ineligible

          2. Patients who meet the response criteria but progress prior to study enrollment are
             ineligible

          3. Patients with known autoimmune diseases or conditions are ineligible

          4. Patients with HIV infection, AIDS, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, ongoing
             bleeding, or any significant uncontrolled medical or psychiatric illness are
             ineligible.

          5. Patients under treatment for infection must cleared by BMT physician prior to
             enrollment.

          6. Patients who are pregnant or nursing are ineligible

          7. Prior allogenic transplant
