    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Recovery Guide support services are
      effective in promoting recovery and social integration among psychiatrically disabled
      individuals who experience high rates of inpatient hospitalizations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The paradigm shift in mental health treatment from a deficit-and institution- based framework
      to a recovery and community integration frame necessitates new models of &quot;case management&quot;
      practices. The Recovery Guide model is just such a model. Beyond theoretical frameworks, the
      effectiveness of Recovery Guides has not been well studied. It is the intent of this study to
      conduct a randomized trial examining the effects of Recovery Guides on community tenure and
      integration. Furthermore, it is the intent of this study to to establish fidelity criteria.

      Comparison(s): Recovery Guide services in addition to treatment as usual, compared to
      treatment as usual.
