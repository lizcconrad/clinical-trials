  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a Phase I clinical trial involving in situ RTVP-1
      gene therapy for prostate cancer. We will conduct necessary safety evaluations on a new
      adenovirus that contains the human genes for RTVP-1. This virus will then be evaluated for
      safety in men with prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy. Based on the preclinical
      data, we hope that this treatment will induce not only a local cytotoxic and antiangiogenic
      effect but also, a systemic antitumor immune response capable of eradicating micrometastatic
      disease (the reason for recurrence in many of these patients).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population selected for this study includes patients with locally advanced and/or poorly
      differentiated tumors. These patients have an unacceptably high failure rate when treated by
      radical prostatectomy alone (over 50% fail within 5 years). The pattern of failure varies.
      While some patients present with a local recurrence, many have both a local recurrence and
      distant metastases, or just distant metastases. It is reasonable to assume that many, if not
      most of these patients, actually harbor micrometastases, present but undiagnosed clinically,
      at the time of their radical prostatectomy. Our hypothesis is that the cytotoxic,
      proapoptotic, antiangiogenic and immune stimulatory activities of in-situ RTVP-1 gene therapy
      will lower the incidence of local tumor recurrences when given to patients prior to surgery.
      The second part of our hypothesis is that RTVP-1 gene therapy will induce a systemic
      anti-tumor immune response, which will eliminate pre-existing micrometastases in some of
      these patients and lower the overall failure rate.

      While this Phase I study is not designed to answer these questions, we hope to obtain
      mechanistic evidence in support of this hypothesis. A Phase II study will then be proposed
      (and properly powered), to study the efficacy of this approach.

      Based on our experience with HSV-tk and GCV in-situ gene therapy, it appears that maximal
      immune stimulation occurs about 2 weeks following vector injection. Furthermore, repeat
      injections of an adenoviral vector do not result in excess toxicity or in the generation of
      anti-adenoviral antibodies sufficient to suppress vector activity. We propose here an
      intraprostatic injection of RTVP-1 in an adenoviral vector 4-6 weeks prior to radical
      prostatectomy, in order to allow full expression of the gene therapy tissue effects.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic proof of prostatic adenocarcinoma without evidence of regional and/or
             distant metastasis, clinical stage T1c, T2 or T3 with high grade disease (Gleason's 7
             - 10) on initial biopsy, or PSA greater than 10 ng/ml with any stage or Gleason score.

          -  Recent (equal to or less than 1 month prior to study entry) negative bone scan and CT
             scan of abdomen/pelvis.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 10 years.

          -  Appropriate surgical candidate for radical prostatectomy and a performance status of
             equal to or less than 2 (Zubrod scale).

          -  Patients should have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral
             granulocyte count equal to or greater than 1,500 and platelet count of equal to or
             greater than 100,000, adequate hepatic function with a bilirubin equal to or less than
             1.5 mg per cent and SGPT less than 2 x the upper limits of normal, adequate renal
             function defined as serum creatinine equal to or less than 2.0 mg per cent.

          -  Patients must have normal coagulation profile (PT, PTT) and no history of substantial
             non-iatrogenic bleeding diatheses. Use of anticoagulants is limited to local use only
             (for control of central line patency).

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of the study, in keeping with the policies of the institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or current hormonal treatment, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy
             or other investigational status drug within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Unable to tolerate transrectal ultrasound.

          -  Patients who are not appropriate surgical candidates for radical prostatectomy based
             on the evaluation of co-existent medical diseases and competing causes of death.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, renal or neurologic/psychiatric disorders
             are not eligible.

          -  Patients who are HIV positive or have chronic hepatitis B or C infections are not
             eligible (because of possible immune effects of these conditions).

          -  Patients with a history of primary or secondary immunodeficiency or patients taking
             immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids continuously for greater than 4 months
             [greater than 5 mg hydrocortisone/day] are ineligible. (The experimental treatment
             being evaluated in this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have
             a decreased immune competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and
             more susceptible to its toxicities.)
