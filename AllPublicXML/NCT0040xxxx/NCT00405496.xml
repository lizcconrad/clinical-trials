  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion is
      effective in the treatment of uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to investigate the efficacy and safety of 0.05% difluprednate
      ophthalmic emulsion in patients with endogenous anterior uveitis and to determine its
      clinical usefulness for treatment of this disease in the early phase of development, in
      comparison with Rinderon® solution (containing 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate) that has
      widely been used for treatment of postoperative inflammation, uveitis, etc. as a steroid
      ophthalmic solution.

      The secondary objective was to establish the evaluation system for a dose-finding study.
