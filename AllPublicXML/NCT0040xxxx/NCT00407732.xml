      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a 9-month psychosocial intervention that
      will assist patients with hepatitis C in overcoming barriers that prevent them from becoming
      appropriate candidates for interferon therapy. Patients who have been deferred from therapy
      due to mental health or substance abuse issues will work with the team psychologist on
      following through with the hepatologist's treatment recommendations that would lead to
      becoming eligible for interferon therapy.
