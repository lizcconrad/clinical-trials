      The purpose of this study was to compare ACCM/PALS guidelines performed with and without
      central venous oxygen saturation monitoring on the morbidity and mortality rate of children
      with severe sepsis and septic shock.

      Background: ACCM/PALS guidelines addresses early correction of pediatric septic shock using
      physical examination supplemented by indirect measures of cardiac output such as central
      venous or superior vena cava oxygen saturation (ScvO2&gt;70%) in a goal directed approach.
      However, these endpoints are based on unsupported evidence. The purpose of this study was to
      compare ACCM/PALS guidelines performed with and without ScvO2 on the morbidity and mortality
      rate of children with severe sepsis and septic shock.

      Methods: Children and adolescents with severe sepsis or fluid-refractory septic shock were
      recruited at two university-affiliated hospitals and randomly assigned to ACCM/PALS without,
      or with an ScvO2 goal directed (goal ScvO2 &gt; 70%) resuscitation. Twenty-eight day mortality
      is the primary end point.
