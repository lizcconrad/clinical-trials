  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since men are less likely to develop multiple sclerosis, the hypothesis was that testosterone
      might be protective in MS. Men with MS for followed untreated for 6 months, followed by a 12
      month treatment period with Androgel.

      While testosterone (T) has been previously shown to be safe and well tolerated in hypogonadal
      males, it has not been previously given to male MS patients. This study will determine
      whether treatment with testosterone (T), as a percutaneous gel, is safe and well tolerated in
      male patients with relapsing MS through the following approach. Patients will be followed
      clinically and with serological studies 6 months prior to treatment to establish baseline
      data. Then, testosterone (T) gel will be administered daily at 100 mg per day for 6 months.
      Patients will continue to be followed clinically and with serological studies. Toxic effects
      of T gel treatment will become evident if patients change during treatment as compared to
      their baseline. To determine if T gel treatment induces a decrease in MS disease activity,
      the most sensitive measure will be used, the number and volume of gadolinium enhancing
      lesions and the volume of T2 lesions on serial cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 12
      patients will undergo MRI once a month, for 6 consecutive months, before starting treatment
      to establish their baseline level of disease activity on MRI. Then these 12 patients will be
      treated with T gel for 6 months. Patients will continue to undergo serial MRI once a month,
      for 6 more consecutive months, while on treatment. In this manner, the level of disease
      activity during treatment can be compared to the level of disease activity before treatment.
      Patients will also be followed with standard neurological exams (every 3 months), however it
      is hypothesized that, with only 6 months of treatment, no effect of T gel treatment will be
      observed on clinical disease activity (disability, relapse rate) since this is a less
      sensitive measure. Further, to determine whether T gel treatment induces desired effects in
      the immune system, immune responses will be assessed before treatment and during treatment.
      Results of in vivo (delayed type hypersensitivity) and in vitro (cytokine production)
      responses will be compared before treatment with those during treatment. Finally, since T gel
      therapy at this dose of 100 mg/day has been shown to improve sexual function and mood,
      increase lean body mass and strength, decrease body fat and increase bone mineral density, we
      will monitor whether these positive effects also occur in men with MS during treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men, age 18-65, with a diagnosis of clinically definite relapsing remitting multiple
             sclerosis.

          2. Relapsing remitting patients who have declined or not tolerated treatment with beta
             interferon (Betaseron, Avonex) or glatiramer acetate, copolymer-1 (Copaxone).

          3. At least one relapse in the two years prior to entry. Relapse will be defined
             historically as definite worsening of a previous symptom (over 0-3 days) or
             development of a new symptom (over 0-3 days).

          4. Not in an intercurrent relapse.

          5. Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) = 0.0 to 5.0.

          6. The patients must have a significant T2 burden of disease on screening cerebral MRI as
             defined by T2 lesion loads greater than 7.5cm3.

          7. Must live within 100 miles of UCLA.

          8. Must be willing and able to receive an initial screening cerebral MRI, a baseline MRI
             and monthly cerebral MRIs (with and without gadolinium) for a total period of 12
             months (6 months prior to treatment and 6 months during treatment).

          1. Males unable to fulfill the above criteria and all female patients.

          2. Males who have been on sex hormone treatment including androgens, estrogens, or
             anti-estrogens for hypogonadism or other medical condition during the 12 months prior
             to study.
