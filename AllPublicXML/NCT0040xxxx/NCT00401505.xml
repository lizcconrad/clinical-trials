  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the reasons why multiparous women (women who are
      pregnant and have been pregnant before) might still be susceptible to rubella.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate why multiparous women might still be susceptible to
      rubella. All pregnant women are checked for rubella immunity, and if they are non-immune,
      there are standard orders in our hospital to administer the rubella vaccine on the
      post-partum floor prior to discharge home from the hospital. Despite this, some multiparous
      women are found to be susceptible (non-immune), and this study will explore the reasons for
      this.
