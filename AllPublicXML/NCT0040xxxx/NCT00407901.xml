      The purpose of this research is to evaluate how accurately a proposed &quot;Functionality
      Assessment Questionnaire&quot; measures the differences between low-functioning and
      high-functioning visually challenged individuals who are legally blind.

      The specific aim of this research is to establish the scientific validity of an evaluation
      assessment tool that will measure the functional level of the visually challenged population.
      For this study a quantitative, self-evaluation tool has been designed to assess the
      functional skills at performing a variety of activities. It is called the Functional
      Assessment Questionnaire. The questionnaire is an innovative approach to measuring the level
      of these functional skills. It also includes critical benchmarks of real-world success that
      are not considered in assessing functional levels of the visually challenged, but are
      measures of evidence-based outcomes. It is a comprehensive measurement tool covering many
      areas of daily living, including:

        1. Education Level

        2. Employment Level

        3. Income Level

        4. Personal Living Skills

        5. Kitchen Skills

        6. Mobility Level

        7. Reading/Writing Skills

        8. Oral Communication Skills

        9. Social Skills

       10. Technology Level

       11. Financial Management Skills

       12. Recreation Skills

       13. Organizational Skills

       14. Independence Level

      Each of these categories include a progressive scale of 10 activities, 1 being the lowest
      level of functionality and 10 being the highest level of functionality. Most of the
      categories are easily self-evaluated, though some will require one-on-one discussion with the
      test administrator. At the completion of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, a
      functionality score, ranging between 14 and 140 is tabulated for each individual.

      In order to maintain scientific integrity of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, certain
      non-identifiable information will be collected on each human subject. This information
      includes:

        1. Age

        2. Sex

        3. Visual Acuity (BCVA)

        4. Peripheral Field

        5. Diagnosed Eye Condition

      Comparative statistical analysis will be performed with the Functional Assessment
      Questionnaire results and the widely used SF-36 (36-Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument)
      and NEI-VFQ-25 with Appendix (National Eye Institute/Visual Function Questionnaire-25)
      questionnaires. The goal will be to check which questionnaire is more sensitive and accurate
      in measuring functional level outcomes both prior to (low-functioning individuals) and after
      (high functioning individuals) vision rehabilitation program participation.

        Approximately 30 legally blind individuals. Between 12-15 individuals will be categorized
        as poor or low-functioning, and the same number of subjects that are categorized as
        high-functioning.

        The factors that will establish high-functioning abilities will be outward skills in
        adapting to vision loss, such as:

          1. Employment in mainstream job market

          2. Extensive vision rehabilitation

          3. Inclusion into mainstream society

          4. Success in real world

          5. Demonstrated ability to live independently, shop, cook, clean, pay bills, and move
             around safely without assistance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between ages of 18 and 80.

          -  Capacity to complete the informed consent process

          -  Legally blind (best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or greater, and/or vision field
             of 20 degrees or less).

          -  Long-term or short-term blindness with no or minimal vision rehabilitation. (These
             will be considered low-functioning subjects). or

          -  Legally blind with extensive vision rehabilitation, independent and self-sufficient.
             (These will be considered high-functioning subjects).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have incapacitating physical and mental challenges other than vision
             loss.

          -  Patients who are not legally blind.

          -  Patients who have had some vision rehabilitation, thus falling in between a
             high-functioning and low-functioning category.
