      To study the efficacy of acupuncture used as an adjunct measure for patients with refractory
      RA

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study employs a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture, traditional Chinese acupuncture and sham
      acupuncture in patients with refractory RA. All patients received 20 sessions over a period
      of 10 weeks. Six acupuncture points were chosen. Primary outcome is the changes in the pain
      score. Secondary outcomes included the changes in the ACR core disease measures, DAS 28 score
      and the number of patients who achieved ACR 20 at week 10.

    <description>Placebo-needles 17 will be used for those randomized to receive sham-acupuncture, which will be connected to the electrical current generator for the same duration and at the same acupuncture points without any current passing through, and intermittent non-specific manual twirling will also be applied. Patients are discouraged to communicate with each other before and after the treatment sessions to minimize bias.</description>
