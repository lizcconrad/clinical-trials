  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to determine the most effective dose of BAy 46-9003 associated to
      taxotere for first-line treatment of patient with prostatic cancer.

      BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and VEGFR inhibitor, which is
      orally available and has a favorable safety profile in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      This, together with the antitumor activity observed after treatment with BAY 43-9006
      (SORAFENIB), provides a rationale for further evaluation in patients with advanced cancer.
      The recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 (SORAFENIB) for future studies is 400 mg bid as a
      continuous dosing schedule.

      This study propose to treat patients with metastatic and hormone-refractory prostatic cancer
      in first intention. There is no limits of age from 18 years old. A new inhibitor of
      angiogenesis (Sorafenib) is associated to the standard treatment in this type of pathology.

      Patients have to demonstrate radiologically a disease progression and also a progression
      based on increase of psa level.

      The main objective is to Determine the recommended dose of BAY 43-9006 in combination with
      docetaxel in hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients as first line treatment in patients
      with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.
