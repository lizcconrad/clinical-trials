      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness (level of pain control) and safety
      of the administration of Extended Release Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen and Immediate Release
      Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen with placebo over a 12 hour dosing period in patients who have had
      a bunionectomy, and to assess the safety of the drug for 7 days after patients are discharged
      from the hospital.
