    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if this combination of chemotherapy plus radiation
      therapy and immunotherapy (with bevacizumab) expands treatment options for patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      The patients on this study will receive treatment in 3 stages of therapy.

      The first stage is Induction Therapy. This therapy is 7 weeks long. Patients will receive
      bevacizumab followed by pemetrexed followed by carboplatin all by vein once a week in weeks 1
      and 4. During Induction patients will also receive radiation therapy daily, Monday through
      Friday, for 7 weeks (weeks 1-7). This is followed by 2 weeks of rest. During this rest period
      patients will have scans done to see how their disease has responded to treatment.

      The next stage of treatment is Consolidation Therapy. This stage is 10 weeks long. Patients
      will receive bevacizumab followed by pemetrexed followed by carboplatin all by vein once a
      week in weeks 10, 13 and 16. This is followed by 3 weeks rest. During week 19 patients will
      have scans to see how their disease has responded to treatment.

      The last stage of treatment is Maintenance Therapy. Patients will receive bevacizumab alone
      by vein every 3 weeks. Treatment will be given every three weeks for up to 9 treatments.
      (week 45)

    <description>Induction treatment included: carboplatin AUC=5, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg each administered intravenously weeks 1 and 4. Radiation was administered concurrently at a dose of 1.8 Gy/d weeks 1 to 7 to a total of 61.2 Gy per institutional guidelines. Consolidative therapy, following an 8-week break from chemoradiotherapy, included carboplatin AUC=6, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg each administered intravenously on week 16, repeated weeks 19 and 22. Folic acid (350 to 1,000 ug or equivalent) supplementation was administered orally beginning 1 to 2 weeks before the first dose of pemetrexed and continued daily until the patient discontinued study therapy. Vitamin B12(1,000ug) was administered by intramuscular injection 1 to 2 weeks before the first dose of study therapy and repeated every 9 weeks until the patient discontinued therapy.</description>

Radiation was administered concurrently at a dose of 1.8 Gy/d weeks 1 to 7 to a total of 61.2 Gy per institutional guidelines. Consolidative therapy, following an 8-week break from chemoradiotherapy, included carboplatin AUC=6, pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg each administered intravenously on week 16, repeated weeks 19 and 22. Folic acid (350 to 1,000 ug or equivalent) supplementation was administered orally beginning 1 to 2 weeks before the first dose of pemetrexed and continued daily until the patient discontinued study therapy. Vitamin B12(1,000ug) was administered by intramuscular injection 1 to 2 weeks before the first dose of study therapy and repeated every 9 weeks until the patient discontinued therapy.</description>
