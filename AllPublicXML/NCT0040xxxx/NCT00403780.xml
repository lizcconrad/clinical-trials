  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis behind the trial is the concept that Pregabalin is effective in reducing pain
      at rest in lower limb ischemia, and the study evaluates active treatment or placebo added to
      the regular pain regimens for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the end stage of peripheral arterial disease in the legs and
      is a consequence of deteriorating blood flow supply to the lower limbs. The clinical
      definition of CLI includes peripheral arterial disease and recurrent rest pain for at least
      two weeks with or without ulcers or gangrene.

      In patients not amenable to revascularization - around 35% - amputation or palliative
      conservative care remains the options. Pain control is a vital part of any treatment of these
      patients. Besides being the principal conservative treatment, also patients undergoing
      revascularization experience severe pain both during work up and after surgery.

      Experimental data indicate that pain in CLI is multimodal and to a large extent neuropathic.
      Still, current therapy is mostly based on opioid treatment, which clinically often affects
      pain moderately. The doses required to influence pain are also associated to severe side
      effects. Accordingly, there is a great need to improve pain control in the rather common
      disease CLI.

      comparisons: pregabalin up to 600mg daily in addition to regular pain regimens compared to
      placebo and regular pain regimens.
