    <measure>Change of Cross-linked N-telopeptide of Type I Collagen (NTx) Level Assessed as Standardized Area Under the Curve From Screening to Month 12 in the Intent-to-Treat Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to end of study (Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The level of bone activity as measured by NTx over the course of 12 months was assessed using the standardized area under the curve. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours between 7:00 and 11:00 AM at Screening and Months 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. Serum was analyzed at a central lab using commercially available ELISA kits. Standardized AUC was calculated by the AUC divided by the number of days the patient participated in the study.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Qualeffo-41 Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire Score From Baseline to Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Qualeffo-41 QoL questionnaire was completed by the patient at Baseline and at Month 12. The questionnaire includes 41 questions covering 7 domains (pain, physical function and activities of daily living, physical function and jobs around the house, physical function and mobility, leisure and social activities, general health perception, mental function). Scores on each question range from 1 to 3, 4, or 5. The total score summed over all questions ranges from 41-205 points; the lower the score the higher the quality of life. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients received zoledronic acid 5 mg in 100 ml solution in a 15 minute intravenous (iv) infusion once per year. The peripheral iv infusion was preceded by and followed by a 10 ml normal saline flush of the intravenous line. In addition to study therapy, all participants received 1200 mg elemental calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D daily. Calcium and vitamin D were supplied in a chewable tablet that was to be taken twice daily.</description>

        <title>Change of Cross-linked N-telopeptide of Type I Collagen (NTx) Level Assessed as Standardized Area Under the Curve From Screening to Month 12 in the Intent-to-Treat Population</title>
        <description>The level of bone activity as measured by NTx over the course of 12 months was assessed using the standardized area under the curve. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours between 7:00 and 11:00 AM at Screening and Months 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. Serum was analyzed at a central lab using commercially available ELISA kits. Standardized AUC was calculated by the AUC divided by the number of days the patient participated in the study.</description>

        <description>The Qualeffo-41 QoL questionnaire was completed by the patient at Baseline and at Month 12. The questionnaire includes 41 questions covering 7 domains (pain, physical function and activities of daily living, physical function and jobs around the house, physical function and mobility, leisure and social activities, general health perception, mental function). Scores on each question range from 1 to 3, 4, or 5. The total score summed over all questions ranges from 41-205 points; the lower the score the higher the quality of life. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change of Cross-linked N-telopeptide of Type I Collagen (NTx) Level Assessed as Standardized Area Under the Curve From Screening to Month 12 in the Per Protocol Population</title>
        <description>The level of bone activity as measured by NTx over the course of 12 months was assessed using the standardized area under the curve. Blood samples were collected after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours between 7:00 and 11:00 AM at Screening and Months 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after baseline. Serum was analyzed at a central lab using commercially available ELISA kits. Standardized AUC was calculated by the AUC divided by the number of days the patient participated in the study.</description>
