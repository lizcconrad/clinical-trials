      RATIONALE: Dutasteride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well dutasteride works in treating patients with
      recurrent prostate cancer that did not respond to androgen-deprivation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the time to disease progression in patients with recurrent prostate cancer that
           progressed during androgen-deprivation therapy who are treated with dutasteride.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of dutasteride in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and objective radiographic
           response rate in patients treated with dutasteride.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with dutasteride.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with dutasteride.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 months thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of prostate cancer

               -  Asymptomatic progressive disease despite androgen-deprivation therapy

                    -  Progression must occur during androgen-deprivation therapy comprising
                       orchiectomy or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogue with or
                       without antiandrogen AND after antiandrogen withdrawal

                         -  Concurrent LHRH monotherapy (i.e., LHRH analogs, such as leuprolide
                            acetate or goserelin) required in patients who did not undergo prior
                            bilateral orchiectomy to assure testicular androgen suppression

          -  Recurrent disease, as indicated by at least 1 of the following:

               -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at baseline ≥ 2.0 ng/mL

               -  Biopsy-confirmed local recurrence

               -  Increase in size of measurable lesions on radiographic study

               -  New lesion on a nuclear bone scan

               -  Two successive increases in serum PSA measured at least 1 week apart

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm^3

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  SGOT ≤ 4 times upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 3 months after
             completion of study therapy

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  See Disease Characteristics

          -  At least 28 days since prior radiotherapy and recovered

             nilutamide

                  have started antiandrogens without reduction of serum PSA are eligible without
                  requiring a 28- or 42-day washout interval after antiandrogen withdrawal

             orchiectomy or LHRH analogues only) or antiandrogens

               -  Drugs with antiandrogenic properties (e.g., spironolactone, flutamide,
                  bicalutamide, cimetidine, ketoconazole, metronidazole, and progestational agents)

               -  Products containing selenium ≥ 75 mcg or vitamin E ≥ 100 IU
