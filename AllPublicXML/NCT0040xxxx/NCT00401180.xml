      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and temozolomide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel and
      temozolomide in treating patients with metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of
           docetaxel and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with metastatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the activity of docetaxel and TMZ in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral temozolomide once
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and temozolomide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 6
      patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
