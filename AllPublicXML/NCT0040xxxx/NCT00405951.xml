  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defects in the apoptotic process can lead to the onset of cancer by allowing cells to grow
      unchecked when an oncogneic signal is present. Obatoclax is designed to restore apoptosis
      through inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby reinstating the natural process
      of cell death that is often inhibited in cancer cells.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I/II study of obatoclax administered in combination
      with docetaxel in 3-week cycles to patients with relapsed or refractory Non-Small Cell Lung
      Cancer. Treatment may be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigation or commercial
      agents or therapies other than those described herein may be administered with the intent to
      treat the patient's malignancy. Supportive care measures including those directed at
      controlling symptoms resulting from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer are allowed.
