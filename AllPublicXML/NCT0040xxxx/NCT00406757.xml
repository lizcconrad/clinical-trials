  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Japan, patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL represent an extremely small
      patient population. While the small number of patients presents a practical limitation to the
      size of a clinical trial, patients whose disease has not responded to or has relapsed after
      treatment with multiple prior chemotherapy regimens have no accepted standard therapies
      available. Japanese leukemia experts have expressed interest in evaluating 506U78 in Japanese
      patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL. In order to obtain safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetic data of 506U78 in Japanese patients, this study is designed to maximize
      the contribution of each available patient.

          -  Disease that is refractory to at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, or has relapsed
             following complete remission to at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

          -  At least 4 weeks since the last dose of prior last chemotherapy, or radiotherapy
             before beginning treatment with 506U78 (2 weeks is permitted if growth of blast cells
             is significant).

          -  Adequate function of other organ systems as measured as follows.Serum creatinine is
             less than 1.5 times of upper limit of normal and estimated creatinine clearance &gt;=50
             mL/min. Hepatic transaminases (SGPT and SGOT) &lt;=3 x upper limit of normal, bilirubin
             is less than 1.5 times of upper limit of normal(&lt;=5 x upper limit of normal if it is
             related by T-ALL or T-LBL).

          -  Adequate performance status (ECOG-PS&lt;=2).

          -  Capable of giving informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Patient is willing to accept hospitalization during the blood sampling for
             pharmacokinetic measurement (i.e., Cohort 1: for pharmacokinetic sample collection
             during both cycle 1 and 2; and Cohort 2: for pharmacokinetic sample collection during
             cycle 1).

          -  Female subjects who are of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test
