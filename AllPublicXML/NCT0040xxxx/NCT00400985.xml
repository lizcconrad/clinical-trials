      The SENSE-HF study is a prospective, observational, international multi-center study
      prospectively evaluating the sensitivity and positive predictive value of the OptiVol Fluid
      Trends data in predicting HF-related hospitalizations and health care utilizations associated
      with signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary congestion, and to define OptiVol clinical guidelines
      for subject therapy management.

      The SENSE-HF study prospectively evaluates the OptiVol feature in the prediction of
      HF-related events associated with signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion and in the
      subject HF therapy management.

      The OptiVol feature is based on the measurement of daily intrathoracic impedance values,
      measurements that can be used to track changes in the subject's thoracic fluid status over
      time. An Alert warns the patient whenever a programmable threshold has been reached.

      The study is divided into three phases.

      The first phase is double-blinded and designed to determine the sensitivity and positive
      predictive value of the OptiVol Fluid Trends data for the detection of Heart Failure related
      hospitalizations with signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary congestion.

      In the second phase of the study, the Alert is turned ON and the positive predictive value of
      the first OptiVol Patient Alert for the development of signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary
      congestion will be evaluated.

      The third phase of the study allows for remote subject therapy management using the OptiVol
      Patient Alert. The patient management strategy is then based on the experience gained in the
      second study phase Physician actions taken in the occurrence of a Patient Alert will be
      summarized.
