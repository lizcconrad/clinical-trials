  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cancer vaccine tecemotide (L-BLP25) in
      addition to best supportive care is effective in prolonging the lives of subjects with
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer, compared to best supportive care alone.

      A local ancillary (sub) study in European centers will evaluate the immune response in
      peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.

      Ancillary Trial: An exploratory investigation of immune response in peripheral blood after
      tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination.

      The ancillary study is a sub-study within START. This is an exploratory investigation of the
      immune response in peripheral blood after tecemotide (L-BLP25) or placebo vaccination. The
      main objective is to evaluate whether administration of single-shot, low-dose
      cyclophosphamide followed by tecemotide (L-BLP25) vaccinations induces specific immune
      response in peripheral blood to BLP25 (the mucinous glycoprotein 1 [MUC1] antigen) as well as
      a modulation of cellular and soluble components of the immune response in subjects with
      unresectable stage III NSCLC.

      Twenty-five of the European START sites will participate in the ancillary study.

      Sample size: up to 60 to 80 subjects

      All inclusion criteria specified in the START clinical trial protocol except for hemoglobin
      &gt;= 100 gram/Liter (g/L)

      All exclusion criteria are the same as specified in the START clinical trial protocol

      Schedule of events: Blood samples will be taken at baseline, visit week 4, 8 13 and 25 (80
      milliliter (mL) whole blood each)

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 66 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival time was defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants without events were censored at the last date they were known to be alive or the clinical cut-off date, whatever was earlier.</description>

    <measure>Time To Symptom Progression (TTSP) as Measured by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 66 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to symptom progression (TTSP) was measured by LCSS. Symptomatic progression was defined as an increase (worsening) of the Average Symptomatic Burden Index (ASBI that is, the mean of the six major lung cancer specific symptom scores of the LCSS patient scale - ranging from 0 to 100 where higher score indicates worst outcome). Worsening was defined as a 10% increase in the scale breadth from the baseline score. TTSP is defined as the time from randomization to worsening in ASBI. Participants without event are censored at the date of the last LCSS assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time To Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 66 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time from randomization to disease progression. Disease progression was defined based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.0 [RECIST v1.0]) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from nadir, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</description>

    <measure>One-, Two- and Three-year Survival Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Years 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Injection Site Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose up to 42 days after the last dose of the trial treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment -emergent adverse events were defined as those with onset or worsening occurring at or after the first dosing day of study medication and up to 42 days after the last administration of any study drug or the clinical cut-off date. Injection site reactions were reported as assessed by the Investigator.</description>

        <description>Time to symptom progression (TTSP) was measured by LCSS. Symptomatic progression was defined as an increase (worsening) of the Average Symptomatic Burden Index (ASBI that is, the mean of the six major lung cancer specific symptom scores of the LCSS patient scale – ranging from 0 to 100 where higher score indicates worst outcome). Worsening was defined as a 10% increase in the scale breadth from the baseline score. TTSP is defined as the time from randomization to worsening in ASBI. Participants without event are censored at the date of the last LCSS assessment.</description>
