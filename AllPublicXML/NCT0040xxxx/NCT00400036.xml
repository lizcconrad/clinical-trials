  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of our research project is to determine the effects of fish protein, present in
      fish, on insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant human individuals, and its mechanism of
      action on glucose metabolism. Our hypothesis is that fish protein improves insulin
      sensitivity, glucose tolerance and plasma lipid profile through an improvement in a primary
      defect in insulin signaling in overweight and insulin-resistant subjects.

    <textblock>
      Recent data show that cod protein prevents the development of insulin resistance in rats.
      Dietary fish protein may also enhance insulin sensitivity in overweight insulin-resistant
      subjects by improving a primary defect in insulin signaling to PI 3-kinase, leading to
      reduced activation of the downstream effectors Akt and PKC. To determine whether this is the
      case, we will study the effects of fish protein on insulin sensitivity in humans, and how it
      improves the ability of muscles to use glucose. Such studies will help to advise individuals
      with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes about eating fish.
