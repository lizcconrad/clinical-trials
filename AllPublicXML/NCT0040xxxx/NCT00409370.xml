      This study compared standard hospital restraints to a newer safety net restraint system to
      compare them for acceptability, tolerance, duration of restrain, length of stay in the
      hospital, and satisfaction of MD, nurse, and relatives of patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age more than 18

          2. hospitalized

          3. acute confusion or agitation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who require acute respiratory or cardiac support such as patients requiring
             ventilator support or patients in cardiac or septic shock

          2. Patients who have a documented history of claustrophobia

          3. Patients or family members who refuse to consent for safety net treatment under any
             circumstances. Failure to obtain consent due to absence of or inability to reach a
             family member or to give consent to participate in the study

          4. Failure to obtain consent due to absence of or inability to reach a family member
             within reasonable time or to give consent to participate in the study.

          5. Acutely ill patients requiring intravenous vasopressors, intubation or ventilatory
             support

          6. Other conditions deemed terminal within 24 hours as determined by the patient's
             attending physician

          7. Patients who stay less than 24 hours in the hospital

          8. If patient is already on restrains for more than 48 hours preceding enrollment.

          9. If two or more limbs are already on restraint to protect IV lines.

         10. Extreme degree of agitation requiring continuous IV sedation or anesthesia. Such
             patients may pose a danger to staff or themselves if their restraints were to be
             discontinued in order to put them on study restraints.

         11. When the intent of single wrist restraint is only to hold the IV line and patient is
             not agitated or in delirium.
