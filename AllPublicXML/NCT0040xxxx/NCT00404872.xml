  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects millions of people in the United States; each year, more
      people die from CVD than from any other disease. Individuals with low levels of n-3 fatty
      acids and high levels of trans-fatty acids may have an increased risk of developing CVD. This
      study will evaluate the link between fatty acids and the presence of CVD in older adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CVD includes diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels, including congestive heart
      failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AF), and stroke. CVD may be associated with low levels of
      n-3 fatty acids and high levels of trans-fatty acids, but more research is needed to
      determine the role of various fatty acids in the development of CVD. Results from prior
      studies on this topic have not always been reliable because data from self-reported dietary
      questionnaires on fatty acid intake have sometimes been inaccurate. A more effective way to
      measure levels of fatty acids is to analyze blood samples. This study will use blood samples
      of participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, a study that examined CVD risk factors in
      older adults, to determine the link between various fatty acids and the incidence of CHF, AF,
      and stroke. The results from this study may help researchers identify the dietary factors
      that influence the development of CVD in older adults.

      This study will examine previously collected data from participants in the Cardiovascular
      Health Study. There will be no study visits specifically for this study. Plasma samples
      obtained from participants will be analyzed for the presence of n-3 fatty acids and
      trans-fatty acids. The study will also determine the incidence of CHF, AF, and stroke and the
      way in which fatty acids are related to hemodynamics, heart structure and function,
      electrophysiology, insulin sensitivity, inflammation, endothelial function, and obesity.
