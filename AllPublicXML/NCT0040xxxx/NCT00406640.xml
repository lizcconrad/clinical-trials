  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS) is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). This study will investigate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability
      of DVS SR versus escitalopram in women with major depressive disorder (MDD) who are
      postmenopausal.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) Score at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a global rating scale that measures disease improvement. Using a 7-point scale, the clinician rates how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to the baseline status (1= very much improved; 7= very much worse).</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) Score From Baseline to Week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a global rating scale that measures the severity of a patient's disease. Using a 7-point scale, the clinician rates the severity of the patient's mental illness at the time of the assessment, relative to the clinician's experience with patients who have the same diagnosis (1= normal; 7= extremely ill).</description>

    <measure>Change in Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Anxiety From Baseline to Week 8 (HAM-A) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 14 items characteristically associated with major anxiety disorders. Items are scaled 0 - 4 (0=none and 4=very severe), with a maximum total score of 56. Change= 8 week adjusted mean HAM-A total score minus baseline adjusted mean total score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Dimension Health State EuroQol (EQ-5D) Score From Baseline to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardized, subject-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a single index value characterizing current health status using a 100-point visual analog scale (0=worst, 100=best). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Change=8 week score minus baseline score.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients achieving a response to treatment at the end of the 8-week acute double blind (DB) phase continued the same treatment in a 6-month DB continuation phase and were evaluated to see if the response was maintained. A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) score. HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression.

Remission is defined as a Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) score of ≤ 7. HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression.

    <measure>Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>DESS is a clinician-administered 43-item assessment that evaluates discontinuation-emergent symptoms resulting from the withdrawal from test article. The DESS total score is the sum of the number of new symptoms and old (but worse) symptoms that appeared during tapering of the test article. A higher score indicates more symptoms. The DESS score was assessed by status of taper.</description>

        <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4) with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe,for a maximum total score of 50. Change= 8 week adjusted mean HAM-D17 minus baseline adjusted mean HAM-D17.</description>

          <description>HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4) with 0=none/absent and 4=most severe,for a maximum total score of 50. Change= 8 week adjusted mean HAM-D17 minus baseline adjusted mean HAM-D17.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D is a standardized, subject-administered measure of health outcome. It provides a descriptive profile for 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), using 3 levels (no, moderate, or extreme problems) and a single index value characterizing current health status using a 100-point visual analog scale (0=worst, 100=best). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).

A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) score. HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression.

          <description>Patients achieving a response to treatment at the end of the 8-week acute double blind (DB) phase continued the same treatment in a 6-month DB continuation phase and were evaluated to see if the response was maintained. A response is defined as ≥ 50% decrease from baseline on Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D17) score. HAM-D17 is a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Individual items are scored on a 0 to 2 or 4 scale (0=none/absent and 4=most severe) for a maximum total score of 50.</description>

        <description>DESS is a clinician-administered 43-item assessment that evaluates discontinuation-emergent symptoms resulting from the withdrawal from test article. The DESS total score is the sum of the number of new symptoms and old (but worse) symptoms that appeared during tapering of the test article. A higher score indicates more symptoms. The DESS score was assessed by status of taper.</description>

          <title>Discontinuation-Emergent Signs and Symptoms (DESS) Total Score</title>
          <description>DESS is a clinician-administered 43-item assessment that evaluates discontinuation-emergent symptoms resulting from the withdrawal from test article. The DESS total score is the sum of the number of new symptoms and old (but worse) symptoms that appeared during tapering of the test article. A higher score indicates more symptoms. The DESS score was assessed by status of taper.</description>
