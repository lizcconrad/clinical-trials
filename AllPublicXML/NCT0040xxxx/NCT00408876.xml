        <description>The EuroQoL Questionnaire – 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows patients to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 is generated for each domain. For each patient, the outcome rating on the 5 domains will be mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranges between 0 and 1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the patient.</description>

        <description>A 21-item, patient-completed questionnaire to assess characteristics of depression. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression is summed to give a single score. There is a four-point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3.
