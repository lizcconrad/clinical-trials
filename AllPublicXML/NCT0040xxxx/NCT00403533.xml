  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that atorvastatin will decrease HCV viral load in patients taking the
      medication.

      Cholesterol is needed for HCV virion production. Cell culture studies have shown that
      atorvastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) decreases HCV viral replication. As
      atorvastatin has been proven to decrease heart attack and stroke in patients with high
      cholesterol, this medication is indicated for the treatment of elevated cholesterol in at
      risk individuals. Therefore we propose to study the effect atorvastatin has on the viral load
      of patients initiated on atorvastatin therapy for their elevated cholesterol.

      Men and women ages 30 to 80 infected with HCV viremia whose physician has determined need
      cholesterol lowering medication will be recruited by the study investigators from
      Massachusetts General Hospital.

      The study investigators will approach the potential subject after the referring doctor has
      ascertained that the potential subject is interested in meeting with the investigator.

      Each subject who consents will undergo phlebotomy of 10 cc of blood three times. Once prior
      to the initiation of atorvastatin to measure the patients viral load. In addition, patients
      will undergo phlebotomy 4 and 12 weeks after the initiation of atorvastatin. The week 12
      phlebotomy is required in all patients started on atorvastatin to monitor for side effects.
      Therefore patients who enroll in this study will undergo one additional phlebotomy. As part
      of our study an extra 10 cc of blood will be taken at these times to measure the patients HCV
      viral load.
