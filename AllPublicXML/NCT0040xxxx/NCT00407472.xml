      This study was a Phase I, open label, randomized, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study
      designed to assess the relative bioavailability of Saizen administered by the ATS-1
      needle-free injection device and a standard needle and syringe. Informed consent was obtained
      prior to screening. All screening assessments establishing subject eligibility were performed
      in the 21 days before dosing. Randomization Pre-dose on Day 1, subjects were randomized to
      one of the two treatment sequences: Sequence 1: SC Saizen administered by the Standard needle
      and syringe (Period 1) followed by the administration using the ATS-1 device (Period 2).
      Sequence 2: SC Saizen administered by the ATS-1 device (Period 1) followed by administration
      using the standard needle and syringe (Period 2).

      Subjects were resident at the Unit from approximately 19:00 on Day -1 until Day 2
      (approximately 30 hours (h) post dose) of each treatment period. An IV Stilamin infusion was
      commenced 1 h before. Saizen administration and stopped immediately after the last
      pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sample has been taken, i.e. a 25 h infusion. Stilamin was
      administered as a constant IV infusion at a rate of approximately 118 mg/h (40 mL/h), which
      corresponds to 1.65 mg/kg body weight/h for a person weighing 70kg. Dosing with Saizen
      occurred between approximately 0800 and 0900 h on Day 1 of each treatment period after an
      overnight fast of at least 10h. Subjects were dosed with Saizen at the same time on Day 1 in
      Periods 1 and 2. There was a minimum of 7-day washout between treatment periods 1 and 2.

      Laboratory safety tests, ECGs were taken at protocol specified time points and blood samples
      for the assessment of glucose and growth hormone were taken immediately predose and 1, 2, 3,
      4 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h post dose. A post-study visit took place 33+/- 3 days
      after dosing a treatment period 2.
