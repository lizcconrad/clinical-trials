  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1 portion of the study evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of ABT-263
      with the objective of defining the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose in
      subjects with lymphoid malignancies. The Phase 2a portion of the study is evaluating ABT-263
      using a step-up dosing regimen and may be increased to the defined recommended Phase 2 dose
      to obtain additional safety information and a preliminary assessment of efficacy in subject
      with lymphoid malignancies. The Extension portion of the study is to allow Phase 2a subjects
      who remain active 1 year after the last subject enrolls or who have been on study
      approximately 1 year to continue receiving ABT-263 with less frequent study evaluations.
      Subjects in the Extension Study will continue receiving study drug for up to 7 years after
      the last subject transitions to the Extension Study, or until disease progression or toxicity
      that necessitates discontinuation (whichever comes first).
