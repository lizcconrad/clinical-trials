      The purpose of this research study is to assess patient and provider attitudes towards the
      role that patients should play in medical decision making and self-management. We will
      examine the degree to which similarity of attitudes held by VA patients being treated for
      co-morbid diabetes mellitus and hypertension and by their primary care providers is a
      determinant of patient satisfaction, patient adherence, and adequacy of blood pressure and
      diabetic control.

      Previous work has shown that similarities in patients' and providers' beliefs about the role
      each should play in health care contexts are associated with greater patient satisfaction,
      greater trust in the provider, and greater treatment adherence. Extending this work by
      examining the effect of patient-provider attitudinal similarity on patients' diabetic and
      blood pressure control over an 18 month period is important because management of patients
      with co-morbid hypertension (HTN) and diabetes (DM) is a costly and clinically challenging
      task within the VA health system. Self-report questionnaires will be used to assess VA
      providers' beliefs about their own preferences for patient-provider role orientation in care,
      whereas interviews will be used to measure veterans' beliefs about their preferences for
      patient-provider role orientation in their care, satisfaction with their care, and
      self-reported treatment adherence. Data regarding health services use, prescription refills
      (a measure of adherence), and 18-month means of blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c will be
      collected from veterans' medical records. The study represents a critical step toward
      understanding how patient and provider attitudes toward care might be explicitly assessed and
      incorporated into the evidence-based health care delivery process to enhance the management
      of chronic illnesses and overall health among veterans.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients enrolled in primary care clinics at the study sites (Iowa City VAMC, Jesse Brown
        VAMC - Chicago) who are scheduled to be seen by a participating provider in the next three
        (3) months and have been seen on at least three (3) additional occasions by that same

        provider in the prior 24 months. Participating patients must also:

        i) have prior diagnoses of both HTN and DM, as documented in VA administrative files;

        ii) have an active prescription for an anti-hypertensive medication in the following
        medication classes: thiazide diuretic, beta blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
        inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), calcium channel blocker, or alpha blocker;

        iii) have an active prescription for an oral hypoglycemic agent or for an insulin
        preparation;

        iv) be able to provide informed consent;

        v) have a home telephone; and

        vi) reside in an independent living environment and not in a skilled care facility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i) cognitive impairment;

        ii) severe underlying illness, including: metastatic cancer, active treatment for any
        malignancy (excluding basal and squamous cell skin cancers), end-stage renal disease,
        cirrhosis, severe chronic obstructive lung disease requiring home oxygen therapy, and
        congestive

        heart failure with a documented left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% or a
        prior echocardiogram denoting &quot;severe&quot; left ventricular dysfunction; and

        iii) visits in the prior 18 months to a VA endocrinology, cardiology, or nephrology clinic.
