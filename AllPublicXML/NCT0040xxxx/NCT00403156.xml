    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to determine if Lucentis combined with imatinib mesylate will help
      treatment in patients with newly diagnosed choroidal neovascularization.

      This is an open-label dose escalating study (n=15) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      the addition of imatinib mesylate to the Lucentis treatment regime over a 6 month period in
      patients with newly diagnosed choroidal neovascularization:

        -  5 patients will be treated with 4 weeks of imatinib mesylate 400mg per day (the lowest
           typical starting dose) to be started concurrently with ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0.5mg
           intravitreal injection. The patients would be injected at monthly intervals for the
           first 3 months followed by treatment on an as needed basis.

        -  If imatinib mesylate is safely tolerated for the first 4 weeks, the following set of 5
           patients will be treated with 6 weeks of imatinib mesylate 400mg per day to be started
           concurrently with Lucentis 0.5mg intravitreal injection. The patients would be injected
           at monthly intervals for the first 3 months followed by treatment on an as needed basis.

        -  If imatinib mesylate is safely tolerated for the first 6 weeks, the following set of 5
           patients will be treated with 8 weeks of imatinib mesylate 400mg per day to be started
           concurrently with Lucentis 0.5mg intravitreal injection. The patients would be injected
           at monthly intervals for the first 3 months followed by treatment on an as needed basis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a BCVA letter score in the study eye between 73-24 (approximately 20/40 to
             20/320) using an ETDRS chart

          -  Have a CNV lesion of any type in the study eye with the following characteristics as
             determined by fluorescein angiography:

          -  Evidence that CNV extends under the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone.

          -  The area of the CNV must occupy at least 50% of the total lesion.

          -  The lesion must be ≤4000 microns in greatest linear dimension (GLD)

          -  For occult with no classic CNV, the lesion must have presumed recent disease
             progression as assessed by the Investigator and defined as having at least one of the
             following criteria:

               -  Blood associated with the lesion at baseline

               -  Loss of VA in the previous 3 months defined as either

               -  ≥5 letters (ETDRS equivalent) as determined by protocol refraction and protocol
                  measurement OR- 2 or more lines using a Snellen or equivalent chart by standard
                  examination

                  months
