      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the response and toxicity rate at day 56 of two different dose levels of
           thymoglobulin (ATG) [anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit)] as a treatment of
           steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the response rate at day 28.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival and non-relapse mortality at 6 months.

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of thymoglobulin when used for the treatment of
           steroid-refractory aGVHD in each of two dose schedules.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of thymoglobulin in each of two dose
           schedules.

        -  To analyze biomarkers of cellular drug effect by quantifying T-cell apoptosis in aims of
           finding the minimal effective dose.

        -  To determine immune-reconstitution after administration of thymoglobulin to patients
           with steroid-refractory aGVHD for each dose schedule.

    <textblock>
      GvHD is a common side effect of a stem cell transplant. It is caused by a type of white blood
      cell (a lymphocyte). ATG is designed to kill lymphocytes and is commonly used to help prevent
      or treat GvHD and to treat steroid-refractory aGvHD.

      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. You will be asked
      questions about your medical history. You will have a complete physical exam. You will have
      blood drawn (about 2 tablespoons) for routine tests and to check for any viral infections.
      Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
      pregnancy test. You will also have a biopsy of the site that is suspected to be affected by
      aGvHD. The study doctor will describe the type of biopsy procedure you will have, which will
      depend on the part of the body that is affected by the disease. If you had an earlier biopsy
      performed that confirmed aGvHD, you will not need a biopsy repeated for this study.

      If you are found to be eligible to participate in this study, you will be randomly assigned
      (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive a higher
      dose of ATG by vein. Participants in Group 2 will receive a lower dose of ATG by vein. You
      will have an equal chance of being in 1 of the 2 groups. Participants in both groups will
      receive doses of ATG over 4-6 hours, 1 time a day every other day for a total of 3 doses.

      During this study, you will be able to remain on steroids and any other drugs you may be
      receiving for treatment of aGvHD (such as tacrolimus or cyclosporine). You will also have
      blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) to learn the effect of ATG on the lymphocytes.

      You will be taken off this study, if the disease is stable as determined by the study doctor,
      if the disease gets worse, or you experience any intolerable side effects. If you are taken
      off this study, your study doctor will discuss other treatment options with you.

      After you finish receiving the study medication, you will come to the clinic at regularly
      scheduled follow-up visits. At first, you will be seen in the clinic once a week for 1 month.
      You will also have additional blood drawn (about 2 teaspoons) for biomarker testing (testing
      that looks at how the drug is working in your body). After the first month of follow-up
      visits, you will come in for visits every other week while you are on this study, which will
      continue until you have at least 2 consecutive (back to back) evaluations of the disease
      status to see if the disease is stable.

      This is an investigational study. ATG is FDA approved and commercially available. You and/or
      your insurance provider will be financially responsible for the cost of ATG while you are on
      this study. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D.
      Anderson.

             cells). Enrollment may be started prior to results of biopsy in cases of high clinical
             suspicion for aGVHD.

          3. Early steroid-refractory aGVHD. This is defined as any NR or PD after a minimum of 3

          4. Ability to sign informed consent.

          5. Ability to return for clinical follow-up as specified in the protocol.

          6. Inability to taper as defined by patients on &lt; or = 1 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone
             but unable to further taper without resultant increase of acute GVHD stage.

          7. Patients with a reflare of a GVHD defined as worsening of 1 stage of acute GVHD in a
             patient who initially responded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Relapsed malignancy.

          2. Acute GVHD as a result of a second or subsequent transplant or donor lymphocyte
             infusion (DLI).

          4. Patients who have received any second-line of immunosuppressive treatment for GVHD
             beyond corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids, oral budesonide
             and extracorporeal photochemotherapy started at the time of steroids are allowed.

          5. Life-threatening infusion reaction or hypersensitivity to any formulation of ATG in
