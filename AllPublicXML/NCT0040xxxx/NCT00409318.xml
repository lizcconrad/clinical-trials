      This study investigates whether blockade of TNF will result in reduced inflammatory indices

      Metabolic syndrome is an increasingly prevalent disorder associated with elevated risks of
      type II DM (diabetes mellitus) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A subclinical
      inflammatory state is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome,
      insulin resistance, and coronary artery disease (CAD). TNF-alpha is an inflammatory cytokine
      that is increased in a spectrum of inflammatory diseases as well as in insulin resistance.
      TNF-alpha antagonists are clinically effective in the inflammation of arthritides, but have
      not been examined in the metabolic syndrome population. Moreover, data suggests that
      adiponectin, a recently discovered adipocytokine that may protect against the development of
      insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, may be downregulated by TNF-alpha. We propose a study
      in which we administer etanercept, a TNF-alpha receptor fusion protein, to subjects with
      metabolic syndrome to examine its effect on inflammatory markers,CRP, adiponectin and insulin
      resistance. This would be the first study to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties and
      insulin sensitizing potential of TNF-alpha blockade on the growing population with metabolic
      syndrome.
