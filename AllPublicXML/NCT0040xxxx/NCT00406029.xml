  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a range of doses of SCH
      420814 (preladenant) when used together with a stable dose of L-dopa/dopa decarboxylase
      inhibitor to treat Parkinson's disease. In this study, we will be comparing 3 doses (1 mg, 2
      mg, and 5 mg taken twice a day) of preladenant with placebo (sugar pill). Following an
      Interim Analysis (temporary hold for new enrollment-ongoing subjects will continue on
      treatment) to review drug safety, a new dose group of 10 mg (taken twice a day) may be added.

      Approximately 160 participants will be randomized in this study in approximately 22 study
      centers worldwide for the first part of this study. Following the Interim Analysis, 40 new
      participants may be added, for a total of 200 participants. The study is double blind, which
      means neither you nor your study doctor will know whether you are receiving the study
      medication or placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Endpoint of 12 Weeks in the 3-day Average of Awake Time Per Day Spent in the &quot;Off&quot; State</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week -1) and up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Off&quot; time refers to periods of inadequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (worsening or presence of symptoms). For baseline and the 12 weeks treatment period, hours spent in the &quot;off&quot; state during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. Change from baseline in least squares (LS) means and pooled standard deviation (SD) were obtained from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. A negative change from baseline signifies less time spent in the &quot;off&quot; state.</description>

        Note: Acceptable methods of birth control include oral or injectable hormonal
        contraceptive, medically prescribed intrauterine device (IUD), and double-barrier method
        (eg, condom in combination with spermicide). Bilateral tubal ligation is an acceptable
        method of birth control for this study.

          -  Participants' clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count [CBC], blood
             chemistries, and urinalysis) must be within normal limits or clinically acceptable to
             the investigator/sponsor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with any form of drug-induced or atypical parkinsonism, cognitive
             impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score &lt;=23), a history of Diagnostic
             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV) diagnosed major depression,
             unstable mild depression or psychosis, or participants taking tolcapone will be
             excluded. (Participants with mild depression who are well controlled on a stable dose
             of an antidepressant medication for at least 4 weeks before screening will be
             eligible.)

          -  All participants with a severe or ongoing unstable medical condition will be excluded
             including those with a history of poorly controlled diabetes, obesity associated with
             metabolic syndrome, uncontrolled hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, or any form of
             clinically significant cardiac disease, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, renal
             failure, history of abnormal renal function, seizures, alcohol/drug dependence, or
             previous surgery for Parkinson's disease.

          -  Average daily consumption of more than two 4-oz (120 mL) glasses of wine or their
             equivalent.

          -  Because it is not known whether preladenant passes into breast milk and because the
             effects, if any, of preladenant on the developing human are unknown, women who are
             breastfeeding or who are considering breastfeeding are excluded from this trial.

          -  Participants with allergy/sensitivity to study drug or its excipients.

          -  Participants with any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the
             condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             the study evaluations or optimal participation in the study.

          -  Participants who have used any other investigational drugs within 30 days of
             Screening.

          -  Participants who are participating in any other clinical study.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint of 12 Weeks in the 3-day Average of Awake Time Per Day Spent in the &quot;Off&quot; State</title>
        <description>&quot;Off&quot; time refers to periods of inadequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (worsening or presence of symptoms). For baseline and the 12 weeks treatment period, hours spent in the &quot;off&quot; state during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. Change from baseline in least squares (LS) means and pooled standard deviation (SD) were obtained from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. A negative change from baseline signifies less time spent in the &quot;off&quot; state.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Endpoint of 12 Weeks in the 3-day Average of Awake Time Per Day Spent in the &quot;Off&quot; State</title>
          <description>&quot;Off&quot; time refers to periods of inadequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (worsening or presence of symptoms). For baseline and the 12 weeks treatment period, hours spent in the &quot;off&quot; state during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. Change from baseline in least squares (LS) means and pooled standard deviation (SD) were obtained from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Awake Time Per Day Spent in the &quot;on&quot; State</title>
        <description>&quot;On&quot; time refers to periods of adequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (symptoms better or absent). Hours spent in the &quot;on&quot; state during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. For treatment period visits, the 24-hour average was derived for the final 3 consecutive days with data available for the particular visit. Change from baseline in LS means and pooled SD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. A positive (+) change from baseline signifies more time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Awake Time Per Day Spent in the &quot;on&quot; State (no Dyskinesias)</title>
        <description>&quot;On&quot; time refers to periods of adequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (better/absent). Dyskinesias refers to maintenance therapy (e.g., L-dopa) side effects of chorea, dystonia, or in combination. Hours spent in the &quot;on&quot; state with no dyskinesias during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. For treatment period visits, the 24-hour average was derived for the final 3 consecutive days with data available for the particular visit. Change from baseline in LS means &amp; pooled SD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment &amp; baseline covariate. A (+) change from baseline signifies more time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state (no dyskinesias).</description>

        <description>&quot;On&quot; time refers to periods of adequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (better/absent). Troublesome dyskinesias refers to maintenance therapy side effects of chorea, dystonia, or in combination that impair function. Hours spent in the &quot;on&quot; state with troublesome dyskinesias during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. For treatment period visits, the 24-hour average was derived for the final 3 consecutive days with data available for the particular visit. Change from baseline in LS means &amp; pooled SD were obtained using ANCOVA with treatment effect &amp; baseline covariate. A (+) change from baseline signifies more time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state (troublesome dyskinesias).</description>

        <description>&quot;On&quot; time refers to periods of adequate control of Parkinson disease symptoms (better/absent). Troublesome dyskinesias refers to maint. therapy side effects of chorea, dystonia, or in combination that impair function. Hours spent in the &quot;on&quot; state without troubles. dyskinesias during awake time were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. For treatment period visits, the 24-hour average was derived for the final 3 consecutive days with data available for the particular visit. Change from baseline in LS means &amp; pooled SD were obtained using ANCOVA with treatment effect &amp; baseline covariate. A (+) change from baseline signifies more time spent in the &quot;on&quot; state (without troubles. dyskinesias).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Absolute Duration of Dyskinesias</title>
        <description>Dyskinesias refers to maintenance therapy side effects of chorea, dystonia, or in combination (that occur in the ON time). Hours spent with dyskinesias (troublesome and not troublesome) were recorded in half-hour time intervals using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visits. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. For treatment period visits, the 24-hour average was derived for the final 3 consecutive days with data available for the particular visit. Change from baseline in LS means &amp; pooled SD were obtained using ANCOVA with treatment effect &amp; baseline covariate. A negative change from baseline signifies less time spent with dyskinesia.</description>

        <description>Hours spent in the sleep state were recorded using a daily diary at least 3 full days before scheduled visit. For baseline, the 24-hour average over 3 consecutive days was derived for Week -1. For endpoint, the 24-hour average was derived for the last available 3 consecutive days with postbaseline data available during the treatment period. For treatment period visits, the 24-hour average was derived for the final 3 consecutive days with data available for the particular visit. Change from baseline in LS means &amp; pooled SD were obtained using ANCOVA with treatment effect &amp; baseline covariate. A positive change from baseline means more time asleep and a negative change means less time asleep.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Sleep Attacks at Week 2</title>
        <description>Sleep attacks are uncontrollable episodes of sleep that occur during the daytime lasting a few seconds to several minutes. A questionnaire to determine sleep attacks over the prior 2 week period was administered at baseline and at 2-week intervals during the treatment period. Frequency of sleep attacks over the two-week treatment period intervals were tabulated in relation to the baseline assessment. Results are presented as participants showing the respective change in frequency of sleep attacks at baseline to the week of assessment (Week 2) (as reported by the participant). For example, someone who had &gt;2 sleep attacks at BL who had a decrease of 1-2 by Week 2 would be reported as BL &gt;2 to WK2 1-2. BL = baseline. WK = week.</description>

        <population>The Efficacy Population consisting of all treated participants who had post-baseline data (sleep attacks) for the assessment week was used for analysis.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Sleep Attacks at Week 4</title>
        <description>Sleep attacks are uncontrollable episodes of sleep that occur during the daytime lasting a few seconds to several minutes. A questionnaire to determine sleep attacks over the prior 2 week period was administered at baseline and at 2-week intervals during the treatment period. Frequency of sleep attacks over the two-week treatment period intervals were tabulated in relation to the baseline assessment. Results are presented as participants showing the respective change in frequency of sleep attacks at baseline to the week of assessment (Week 4) (as reported by the participant). For example, someone who had &gt;2 sleep attacks at BL who had a decrease of 1-2 by Week 4 would be reported as BL &gt;2 to WK4 1-2. BL = baseline. WK = week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Sleep Attacks at Week 6</title>
        <description>Sleep attacks are uncontrollable episodes of sleep that occur during the daytime lasting a few seconds to several minutes. A questionnaire to determine sleep attacks over the prior 2 week period was administered at baseline and at 2-week intervals during the treatment period. Frequency of sleep attacks over the two-week treatment period intervals were tabulated in relation to the baseline assessment. Results are presented as participants showing the respective change in frequency of sleep attacks at baseline to the week of assessment (Week 6) (as reported by the participant). For example, someone who had &gt;2 sleep attacks at BL who had a decrease of 1-2 by Week 6 would be reported as BL &gt;2 to WK6 1-2. BL = baseline. WK = week.</description>

A questionnaire to determine sleep attacks over the prior 2 week period was administered at baseline and at 2-week intervals during the treatment period. Frequency of sleep attacks over the two-week treatment period intervals were tabulated in relation to the baseline assessment. Results are presented as participants showing the respective change in frequency of sleep attacks at baseline to the week of assessment (Week 8) (as reported by the participant).

          <title>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Sleep Attacks at Week 8</title>
          <description>Sleep attacks are uncontrollable episodes of sleep that occur during the daytime lasting a few seconds to several minutes. A questionnaire to determine sleep attacks over the prior 2 week period was administered at baseline and at 2-week intervals during the treatment period. Frequency of sleep attacks over the two-week treatment period intervals were tabulated in relation to the baseline assessment. Results are presented as participants showing the respective change in frequency of sleep attacks at baseline to the week of assessment (Week 8) (as reported by the participant). For example, someone who had &gt;2 sleep attacks at BL who had a decrease of 1-2 by Week 8 would be reported as BL &gt;2 to WK8 1-2. BL = baseline. WK = week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Frequency of Sleep Attacks at Week 12</title>
        <description>Sleep attacks are uncontrollable episodes of sleep that occur during the daytime lasting a few seconds to several minutes. A questionnaire to determine sleep attacks over the prior 2 week period was administered at baseline and at 2-week intervals during the treatment period. Frequency of sleep attacks over the two-week treatment period intervals were tabulated in relation to the baseline assessment. Results are presented as participants showing the respective change in frequency of sleep attacks at baseline to the week of assessment (Week 12) (as reported by the participant). For example, someone who had &gt;2 sleep attacks at BL who had a decrease of 1-2 by Week 12 would be reported as BL &gt;2 to WK12 1-2. BL = baseline. WK = week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part 1</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a frequently used multi-item 4-part questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of Parkinson's disease severity. A total of 42 items are assessed divided across Parts 1 to 4. Part 1 assesses mentation (4 items scored from 0 [best] to 4 [worst]; total range 0-16). Assessments were obtained at baseline (predose Day 1) and 2 hours postdose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. For endpoint, the last postbaseline visit while on study medication was used. Change from baseline in LS means and pooled SD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. Negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part 2</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a frequently used multi-item 4-part questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of Parkinson's disease severity. A total of 42 items are assessed divided across Parts 1 to 4. Part 2 assesses daily living (13 items scored from 0 [best] to 4 [worst]; total range 0-52). Assessments were obtained at baseline (predose Day 1) and 2 hours postdose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. For endpoint, the last postbaseline visit while on study medication was used. Change from baseline in LS means and pooled SD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. Negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part 3 (1 Hour Post-dose)</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a frequently used multi-item 4-part questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of Parkinson's disease severity. A total of 42 items are assessed divided across Parts 1 to 4. The Part 3 subscale assesses motor function across 14 categories for 27 items. Scores for each item range from 0 (best) to 4 (worst) with a total range of 0-108. Assessments were obtained at baseline (predose Day 1) and 1 hour postdose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. For endpoint, the last postbaseline visit while on study medication was used. Change from baseline in LS means and pooled SD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. Negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part 3 (2 Hours Post-dose)</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a frequently used multi-item 4-part questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of Parkinson's disease severity. A total of 42 items are assessed divided across Parts 1 to 4. The Part 3 subscale assesses motor function across 14 categories for 27 items. Scores for each item range from 0 (best) to 4 (worst) with a total range of 0-108. Assessments were obtained at baseline (predose Day 1) and 2 hours postdose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. For endpoint, the last postbaseline visit while on study medication was used. Change from baseline in LS means and pooled standard deviation were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. Negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in severity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part 4</title>
        <description>The UPDRS is a frequently used multi-item 4-part questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of Parkinson's disease severity. A total of 42 items are assessed divided across Parts 1 to 4. The Part 4 subscale assesses complications of therapy over the past week for a total of eleven question items. The first three questions and question 8 are rated from 0 (best) to 4 (worst), and the remaining seven questions are simple no (0) / yes (1) questions. The total subscale score ranges from 0 to 23. Assessments were obtained at baseline (predose Day 1) and 2 hours postdose at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. For endpoint, the last postbaseline visit while on study medication was used. Change from baseline in LS means and pooled SD were obtained from an ANCOVA model with effect for treatment and baseline covariate. Negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in severity.</description>
