  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in different
      ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Thalidomide may stop the growth of prostate cancer by
      blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving GM-CSF and thalidomide before surgery may make the
      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving GM-CSF together with thalidomide
      works in treating patients undergoing surgery for high-risk prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the impact of neoadjuvant sargramostim (GM-CSF) and thalidomide on pathologic
           response (histologic P0, margin positivity, capsular penetration), prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) response, and other investigational endpoints in patients with high-risk
           prostate cancer undergoing prostatectomy.

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of GM-CSF and thalidomide.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 1, 3, and 5 and oral
      thalidomide on days 1-5 or 1-7 in weeks 1-4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy at week 8 or 9.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
