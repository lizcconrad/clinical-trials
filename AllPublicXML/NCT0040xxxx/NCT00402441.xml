      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate that risedronate 35-mg once weekly is more efficacious than placebo in
           increasing or maintaining bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine after 1 year of
           treatment in women who are non-osteoporotic and 0.5-5 years postmenopausal.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that risedronate 35-mg once weekly is more efficacious than placebo in
           increasing or maintaining total proximal femur, femoral neck, and trochanter BMD after 1
           year of treatment in women who are 0.5-5 years postmenopausal

        -  To assess the general safety of 35-mg risedronate administered once weekly.

        Main Inclusion/Exclusion criteria are listed hereafter:

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Be postmenopausal for 0.5-5 years.Menopause is defined as 12 months without menses,
             based on medical history. Subjects who are post-menopausal secondary to bilateral
             oophorectomy must have serum FSH &gt;40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt;20 pg/mL.

          -  Subjects with 3 contiguous lumbar spine vertebral bodies (L1-L4) without fracture or
             degenerative disease.

          -  Lumbar spine BMD mean value &gt; 0.772g/cm2 (Hologic) or &gt;0.880 g/cm2 (Lunar).

        Exclusion criteria :

          -  Subjects with adequate lumbar spine BMD but osteoporotic by total proximal femur BMD
             (&lt;0.637 g/cm2 [Hologic]) or &lt;0.694 g/cm2 [Lunar]) as determined by dual-energy x-ray
             absorptiometry (DXA)
