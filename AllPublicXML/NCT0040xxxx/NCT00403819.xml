      A phase III, multi-centre, double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study, followed by an
      open label post study follow-up, to assess the efficacy and safety of Movicol in the
      treatment of chronic constipation in children

    <textblock>
      After a baseline period of 1 (one) week, subjects who had met the inclusion criteria were
      entered into the treatment phase of the study. Patients were randomised to receive either
      Movicol or matching Placebo for two (2) weeks. Following the treatment phase, patients
      underwent a two (2)-week placebo washout period prior to crossing over to receive the
      alternative treatment e.g. those patients who took Movicol were given the matching Placebo or
      vice versa on completion of the washout period for two (2) weeks.

      On completion of the double blind treatment phase, patients were given the option to
      participate in the eight (8) week open label post study follow-up. Patients who participated
      in the post study follow-up received Movicol.
