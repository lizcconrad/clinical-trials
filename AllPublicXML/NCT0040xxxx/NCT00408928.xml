      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of VELCADE® in the
      treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that has not responded to steroids or has
      worsened when the steroid dose was decreased. VELCADE® is a drug that inhibits certain immune
      reactions that happen when lymphocytes encounter foreign substances. We are doing this
      research to determine if VELCADE® may be useful in treating GVHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication after bone marrow transplantation
      from another donor. GVHD is caused by certain cells called lymphocytes. Normally these cells
      make immune reactions that help protect the body from foreign substances that cause
      infection. Here, these cells attack the normal tissues of the body as if they were foreign
      substances. This interferes with the normal function of vital organs and results in their
      damage. In GVHD these cells attack the skin, liver and bowel. GVHD also increases the chances
      of infection.

      VELCADE® is a drug that inhibits certain immune reactions that happen when lymphocytes
      encounter foreign substances. We are doing this research to determine if VELCADE® may be
      useful in treating GVHD.

      VELCADE® is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of multiple
      myeloma in patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated
      disease progression on their last therapy. Its effectiveness is also being tested in other
      cancers. The dose of the drug being used in this research study is the same as what is used
      for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It has not been approved by the FDA for use in GVHD.
      Therefore, using VELCADE® for GVHD is experimental in this research study.

    <description>Response is the primary endpoint of this study and will be scored on day 21 (3 weeks after the first dose of VELCADE) and every 3 weeks subsequently. Patients who progress or expire before the end of the study will be considered non-responders.
Patients are evaluated for response in an organ if they have AGVHD in that organ at the start of treatment with VELCADE or if AGVHD develops after the start of VELCADE, but before the time period of evaluation. Complete response in an organ is defined as no evidence clinical or biochemical signs of AGVHD. For the overall assessment, it is defined as complete resolution of rash, abnormal LFTs, and absence of diarrhea attributed to AGVHD.
Partial response is defined as a one stage decrease in any organ system without worsening in other organ systems.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: (All criteria must be met)

          1. Patients must have undergone an allogeneic HSCT

          2. Clinical or histological evidence of AGVHD

          3. Has been treated with a minimum of 2mg/kg of methylprednisolone per day or equivalent
             dose of steroids and either one of the following:

               1. Has had a minimum of 3 days of steroids including the day of assignment and has

Patients are evaluated for response in an organ if they have AGVHD in that organ at the start of treatment with VELCADE or if AGVHD develops after the start of VELCADE, but before the time period of evaluation. Complete response in an organ is defined as no evidence clinical or biochemical signs of AGVHD. For the overall assessment, it is defined as complete resolution of rash, abnormal LFTs, and absence of diarrhea attributed to AGVHD.
Partial response is defined as a one stage decrease in any organ system without worsening in other organ systems.</description>
