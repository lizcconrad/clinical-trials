      This is a Phase III, multicenter, extension study to evaluate the safety of rituximab
      administered on a scheduled basis approximately every 6 months. All subjects who complete
      their Week 52 visit in Study U2970g will be eligible for this study, as long as the inclusion
      and exclusion criteria are met.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability and willingness to provide written informed consent and comply with the
             requirements of the study protocol

          -  Participation in Study U2970g and completion of the Week 52 visit in that study

          -  For subjects of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a reliable means of
             contraception throughout their study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

             visit

          -  Any safety concern potentially attributable to rituximab that in the investigator's
             opinion may jeopardize subject safety

          -  In the investigator's opinion, lack of any clinical improvement by Week 52 in Study
             U2970g and for whom the proposed therapy would represent risk without benefit

          -  Current thrombocytopenia or at high risk for developing clinically significant
             bleeding or organ dysfunction requiring therapies such as plasmapheresis or acute
             blood or platelet transfusions

          -  Lack of peripheral venous access

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

             monoclonal antibodies

          -  Significant new or uncontrolled disease in any organ system not related to SLE (e.g.,
             poorly controlled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, cardiovascular
             disease, accelerated hypertension, major depression) that in the investigator's
             opinion would preclude subject participation

          -  Known active infection of any kind (excluding fungal infection of nail beds), any
             major episode of infection requiring hospitalization, or treatment with IV antibiotics
             within 4 weeks of a study drug infusion or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks of a study
             drug infusion

          -  History of cancer, including solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and carcinoma in
             situ

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to screening

          -  Intolerance or contraindication to oral or IV corticosteroids

          -  Lipase &gt; 2 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x the ULN

          -  Amylase levels &gt; 2 x the ULN

          -  Absolute neutrophil counts &lt; 1.5 x 10^3/uL
