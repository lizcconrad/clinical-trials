  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microscopic polyangiitis (MP) is a primary systemic vasculitis predominantly affecting small
      blood vessels. Following the widespread introduction of ANCA testing, the primary systemic
      vasculitis (SV), Wegener?s granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MP) appear to be
      more frequent than was previously thought (see definitions in Appendix 6). In addition, the
      existence of early and organ-limited forms of these diseases, such as renal-limited
      vasculitis (RLV) is now clearly recognized. Their annual incidence exceeds 20 per million per
      year and they account for at least 5 % of the causes of end stage renal failure. The two
      diseases share many features of their histology, serology and response to treatment, pointing
      to similarities in their pathogenesis, which have justified a common approach to their
      management. The standard treatment with corticosteroids (CS) and cyclophosphamide (CYC) is
      usually effective at controlling active disease but continued treatment is necessary to
      prevent disease relapse. Due to the cumulative toxicity associated with CYC treatment,
      alternatives have been looked for. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been used to treat
      patients with a variety of immune-mediated nephritides, including ANCA-associated vasculitis,
      with less toxicity than CYC but with variable outcome. The present trial will examine whether
      substitution of oral CYC with oral MMF is equally efficient for induction of remission with
      less adverse effects in cases of MP with mild to moderate renal involvement. All patients
      will receive the same regimen of oral prednisone + MMF. Prednisone will be tapered to a stop
      after 24 weeks but MMF will continue for a total of 18 months unless there is worsening or
      persistent disease. The trial ends after 18 months.

      1. Patients will receive I.V. methylprednisone, or I.V. dexamethazone, oral prednisone and
           oral MMF therapy as outlined in table 2.

        2. MMF will be initiated within the first 1-2 weeks of the start of steroids. Patients will
           receive CellCept, 750 mg po b.i.d for the first week. Dose will be increased to 1000 mg
           po b.i.d for the second week, and thereafter, according to blood levels and patient
           tolerance. Target blood levels are 1 ? 3.5 &amp;#61549;g/ml. Treatment will be for a total
           of 18 months. This is based on the published dose-dependent adverse effect profiles in
           transplant patients (31-32) and on reports that lower doses are ineffective and shorter
           courses (less then 6 months) result in relapses or failure of therapy (25). Dose will be
           reduced in patient who can not tolerate MMF at the above dose.

      2) Relapse treatment to follow guidelines for relapse regimens. 3) After 18 months, all
      medications will be tapered to a full stop unless disease is active or grumbling.

      4) Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis will be used during the trial (with
      sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or Dapsone or Mepron if allergic to sulfa).
