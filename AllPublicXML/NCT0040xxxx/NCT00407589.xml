    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, single dose/multiple dose, pharmacokinetic study in
      participants with bacterial conjunctivitis. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      extent of systemic exposure to BOL-303224-A following single and multiple topical
      administration of BOL-303224-A in participants with suspected bacterial conjunctivitis.
