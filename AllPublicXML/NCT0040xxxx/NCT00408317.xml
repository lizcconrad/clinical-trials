      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Ultrase® MT20 compared to
      placebo for the correction of fat and protein malabsorption in participants with cystic
      fibrosis (CF) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). This study is sponsored by Aptalis
      Pharma (formerly Axcan).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, two-period cross-over,
      placebo-controlled study designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Ultrase® MT20 to
      placebo in participants with CF and pancreatic insufficiency. The study consists of a
      screening period (up to 11 days) and two treatment periods (6-7 days). During screening
      period participants will be treated with open-label Ultrase® MT18 or MT20. Each treatment
      period will be preceded by a stabilization period (4 days) and the two treatment periods are
      separated by a break period (3-6 days). A safety follow-up visit will be performed 7-10 days
      after discharge from the last treatment period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 to Day 7 in first intervention period and second intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Percent (%) CFA was calculated as ([fat intake - fat excretion]/fat intake)*100, determined by the stools collected during the 72-hour period which could extend to 96 hours during both intervention periods. Mean CFA percent was calculated for 72-hour/96-hour period during Day 3 to Day 7 in the first and second intervention periods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Coefficient of Nitrogen Absorption (CNA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 to Day 7 in first intervention period and second intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Percent (%) CNA was calculated as [(nitrogen intake-nitrogen excretion)/nitrogen intake]*100, determined by the stools collected during the 72-hour period which could extend to 96 hours during both intervention periods. Nitrogen intake was calculated as protein intake/6.25. Mean percent CNA was calculated for 72-hour/96-hour period during Day 3 to Day 7 in the first and second intervention periods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bowel Movements</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 3 on first intervention period and second intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Number of bowel movements of each participant was calculated from frequency of stools by the participant per day. Mean daily number of bowel movements on Day 3 for the first treatment period and second treatment period was summarized.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Stool Categorized by Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4 on first intervention period and second intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Stool consistency was categorized as hard, formed/normal, soft or watery stool. Percentage of stools of a specific consistency of each participant was calculated as the number of stools with a specific consistency relative to the total number of stools during the collection period. Mean percentage of stool with specific consistency on Day 4 for the first treatment period and second treatment period period for total participants was summarized.</description>
