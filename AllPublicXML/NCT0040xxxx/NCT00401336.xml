  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron excess is increasingly regarded as an important cofactor in the morbidity attributed to
      many disorders. Assessment of body iron stores by measurement of serum ferritin
      concentrations has poor specificity and the most reliable method is histological or
      biochemical assessment from a liver biopsy. Because liver biopsy is an invasive procedure,
      imaging methods have been developed to detect and quantify hepatic iron content. The aim of
      the study is to use a simplified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to quantify
      simultaneously iron and fat contents in the liver and to compare the results to the
      quantification obtained biochemically.

      Iron excess is increasingly regarded as an important cofactor in the morbidity attributed to
      many disorders. Assessment of body iron stores by measurement of serum ferritin
      concentrations has poor specificity and the most reliable method is histological or

      The aim of the study is to use a simplified magnetic resonance imaging technique to quantify
      simultaneously iron and fat contents in the liver and to compare the results to the
      quantification obtained biochemically.

      Patients who need a liver biopsy will be proposed to be enrolled in the study. A magnetic
      resonance (MR) study will be performed using breath-hold gradient echo sequences with a
      single echo and a new multiple-echo gradient-echo sequence. Liver and muscle MR signal will
      be quantitatively determined and compared to biochemical assessment of liver iron
      concentration and steatosis quantification.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults over 18,

          -  Planned liver biopsy (or liver biopsy within 2 months before inclusion) for one of
             these indications: suspicion of liver iron overload, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis B
             or C, alcohol abuse. No change in diet, transfusions or iron depletion must have occur
             between the liver biopsy and the MRI.

          -  Having given a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non cooperating patient,

          -  Patient with dyspnea,

          -  Patient with contra-indication to MR imaging (pace-maker, heart valve,...).
