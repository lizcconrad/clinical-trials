  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to gather additional safety data for the subjects
      treated with the Alair System (hereinafter, &quot;Alair-Treated Subjects&quot;) who previously
      completed the one-year study entitled: &quot;Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Bronchial
      Thermoplasty with the Alair System for the Treatment of Severe Asthma&quot; (Protocol #0903-27)
      sponsored by Asthmatx, Inc. Subjects who elect to participate in this safety study will be
      followed for an additional four (4) year period beyond the PREDECESSOR STUDY'S one-year
      endpoint.

      This will be a multicenter study conducted only at the clinical sites that participated in
      the PREDECESSOR STUDY.

      Enrollment will be limited to only those subjects who were treated with the Alair System in
      the PREDECESSOR STUDY.

      Written, informed consent will be obtained from all subjects prior to performing any study
      procedures.

      The present study will extend the follow-up evaluation of Alair-Treated Subjects from the
      PREDECESSOR STUDY to 5 years post-treatment with the Alair System. These evaluations will
      consist of four study visits corresponding to the two-year, three-year, four-year and
      five-year time points following completion of Alair treatments in the PREDECESSOR STUDY. For
      consistency with the PREDECESSOR STUDY, ideally the subject's drug therapy should continue to
      be consistent with GINA Guidelines for the severity of the subject's asthma. Any changes in
      maintenance levels of asthma medications will be documented.

      The goal of this follow-on study is to enroll all Alair-Treated Subjects who completed the
      PREDECESSOR STUDY. Inclusion of subjects from the treatment arm will allow for better
      assessment of the long-term safety of the Alair procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who participated in the PREDECESSOR STUDY entitled &quot;Multicenter Randomized
             Clinical Trial of Bronchial Thermoplasty with the Alair™ System for the Treatment of
             Severe Asthma&quot; (Protocol # 0903-27).

          -  Subject was treated with the Alair System (&quot;Alair Group&quot;) in the PREDECESSOR STUDY.

          -  Subject who is able to read, understand, and provide written Informed Consent.

          -  Subject who is able to comply with the study protocol, including requirements for

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject participating in another clinical trial involving respiratory intervention
             that could affect the outcome measures of this study, either within 6 weeks of study
             enrollment, or during the study period.

          -  Subject with a newly diagnosed (since exiting from the PREDECESSOR STUDY) psychiatric
             disorder which in the judgment of the investigator could interfere with provision of
