  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, cross-over, pharmacokinetic (PK) study
      evaluating the effect of the DPD inhibitory action of CDHP as an S-1 component compared with
      FT alone on the PK of 5-FU in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be
      conducted in 2 parts (Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic Phase and S-1 Extension Phase).

                  congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV, see
                  Appendix F).

               -  Known (at the time of entry) gastrointestinal disorder, including
                  malabsorption,chronic nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea present to the extent that it
                  might interfere with oral intake and absorption of the study medication.

               -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
                  abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
                  study drug administration, or may interfere with the interpretation of study
                  results, and in the judgment of the Investigator would make the patient
                  inappropriate for entry into this study.

          3. Is receiving a concomitant treatment with drugs interacting with S-1 or FT. The
             following drugs are prohibited because there may be an interaction with S-1 or FT:

               -  Sorivudine, uracil, dipyridamole, cimetidine and folinic acid (may enhance S-1 or
                  FT activity).

               -  Allopurinol (may diminish S-1 or FT activity).

               -  Phenytoin (S-1 or FT may enhance phenytoin activity).

               -  Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1 or FT,
                  and flucytosine activity).

               -  Pilocarpine (may inhibit CYP2A6 activity).

          4. Has sensitivity to 5-FU.

          5. Is a pregnant or lactating female.

          6. Is a patient with reproductive potential who refuses to use an adequate means of
             contraception (including male patients). 3.3.3 Discontinuation Criteria Clearly
             document the reason for the patient's discontinuation in the patient's source
             documents and on the CRF. Discontinue the patient from study if any of the following
             occur:

               -  Patient withdraws consent.

               -  Patient has toxicities that, in the opinion of the Investigator, require the
                  patient's discontinuation.

               -  Patient has an intercurrent illness that in the opinion of the Investigator
                  requires the patient's discontinuation.

               -  The Investigator concludes that it is in the patient's best interest to
                  discontinue therapy.

               -  Patient is willingly or inadvertently noncompliant in the opinion of the
                  Investigator and requires the patient to be discontinued.

               -  During optional Extension Phase, the patient has objective PD (defined by imaging
                  studies or clinical evaluation). g. During optional Extension Phase, the patient
                  requires a recovery period of &gt; 4 weeks (ie, more than 3 weeks from the scheduled
                  start date of the next cycle; see Section 4.5.4.1.1).

               -  The patient completes the Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic Phase but does not choose to
                  enter the optional S-1 Extension Phase.
