  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multiple-dose
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneously
      administered HAE1 in subjects 12-75 years old with moderate to severe asthma whose symptoms
      are inadequately controlled with moderate to high-dose ICS and LABA.
