             patients who have undergone IOL insertion surgery at the same time)

          -  Patients showing an anterior chamber cell score of not less than “2” at a day after
             surgery

          -  Patients aged 20 years or over, irrespective of genders (it is eligible for enrollment
             when patients’ age attains the criterion on the day of consent obtainment)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who took systemic administration of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             agents, or used ophthalmic ointments of corticosteroids within 1 week before
             instillation of the investigational drugs;

          -  Patients who underwent local injection of corticosteroids in the eyes before
             instillation of the investigational drugs; (patients who used aqueous preparations
             within 1 week or patient who used depot preparations within 2 weeks were excluded)

          -  Patients who took systemic administration of non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents or
             antiinflammatory enzyme preparations within 3 days before instillation of the
             investigational drugs;

          -  Patients who instilled of corticosteroids, no-steroidal antiinflammatory agents or
             antiinflammatory enzyme preparations within 24 hours before the pre-instillation
             observation (a day after surgery);

          -  Patients who underwent perioperative and/or postoperative intravitreous injection of
             corticosteroids;

          -  Patients who underwent sub-conjunctival injection or sub-Tenon capsule injection of
             corticosteroids;

          -  Patients who have intraocular hemorrhage with a degree that may affect the
             postoperative evaluations;

          -  Patients who underwent gas tamponade at the surgery;

          -  Patients with endogenous uveitis;

          -  Patients having corneal epithelial detachment or corneal ulcer in the target eye;

             disorders in the target or opposite eye;

          -  Patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, or those with past history of IOP
             increased due to instillation of corticosteroids, or those whose IOP has been
             controlled by use of ophthalmic antihypertensive agents;

          -  Patients showing IOP not less than 25 mmHg a day after surgery;

          -  Patients who have allergy to corticosteroid drugs;

          -  Patients who are required to wear contact lens during the study period;
