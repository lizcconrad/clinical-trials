  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of esomeprazole 20 mg dosed once daily
      and ranitidine 150 mg dosed twice daily through 4 weeks of treatment for the healing of
      gastric ulcers in patients receiving daily non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
      (NSAID)therapy.

    <measure>The Percentage of Subjects Whose Gastric Ulcer(s) (GUs) Was (Were) Healed at Week 4 After Treatment With Esomeprazole 20 mg qd and Ranitidine 150 mg Bid in Patients Receiving Daily Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID)Therapy.</measure>

    <description>Healed was defined as the absence of gastric ulcers. It was calculated as the proportion of subjects whose gastric ulcer(s) healed after 4 weeks treatment.
(Ulcers were on S stage, stage 1 = Nonblanchable erythema of intact skin, stage 2 = Partial thickness skin loss involving epidermis, dermis, or both, stage 3 = Full thickness skin loss involving damage to or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue, stage 4 = Full thickness skin loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis, or damage to muscle, bone, or supporting structures or absent).</description>
