      Janus stent is the only marketed drug-eluting stent (DES) without polymer coating as yet in
      China. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of JANUS (Tacrolimus eluted stent)
      in inhibiting of restenosis in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) real world and to
      observe the safety and efficacy of 4 months’clopidogrel treatment after implantation of JANUS
      stent.

      Patients were enrolled and randomized to be treated by JANUS or SRNCRO (bare metal stent with
      the same platform as JANUS). All enrolled patients received daily clopidogrel for 4 months
      and aspirin for life long for post-PCI period(In AMI group, patients received daily
      clopidogrel 150mg for 2 weeks at first). The primary endpoints included death of heart,
      myocardial infarction, revascularization of the target lesson, sub-acute and late stent
      thrombosis one year after PCI, The secondary endpoints included MACE at 30 days, 6 months and
      restenosis by follow-up angiogram at 6 to 12 months.
