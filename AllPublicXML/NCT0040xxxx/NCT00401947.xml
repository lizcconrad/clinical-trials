      The purpose of this study is to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and
      Antiviral Activity of Multiple Doses of ACH-0137171 in Subjects with Chronic Hepatitis C
      Infection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study of ACH-0137171
      in subjects with chronic HCV infection.

      Sequential cohorts of 10 subjects will be randomized (8:2) to receive multiple doses of
      ACH-0137171 or placebo for 4 days (Days 1 through 4) with a single dose on Day 5 followed by
      a complete pharmacokinetic profile. Dosing will be 300 - 600 mg administered either every 12
      hours or every 6 hours (maximum daily dose of 2400 mg). All doses will be administered with
      food.

      The dose cohorts are as follows:

      Study Schema:

      Cohort 1: 300 mg ACH-0137171/placebo every 12 hours (600 mg/day)* Cohort 2: 300 mg
      ACH-0137171/placebo every 6 hours (1200 mg/day)* Cohort 3: 600 mg ACH-0137171/placebo every 6
      hours (2400 mg/day)*

      A full review of all safety data will occur following each cohort. Depending on the data, the
      Sponsor, in consultation with the Principal Investigator(s), may consider modifying the
      planned dose escalation. The Sponsor may choose to interject an intermediate dose cohort
      between 2 planned dose escalations or repeat a given dose level, or extend the dosing period,
      or add an additional cohort. If a similar Grade 3 or 4 adverse event occurs in three or more
      subjects, and is considered to be at least possibly related to study drug, escalation to a
      higher dose will not occur.

      Serial HCV RNA measurements, pharmacokinetic measurements of plasma concentrations of
      ACH-0137171, and periodic safety monitoring will occur on Days 1 through 5. Additional HCV
      RNA and PK measurements will be taken on Days 6 through 9. Follow up safety evaluations will
      be completed out to 14 days after last study drug administration (i.e., on Days 12 and 19).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic HCV infection must be documented by positive anti HCV antibody using a third
             generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and persistent detection of HCV RNA in the blood
             for at least 6 months. Subjects must be infected with HCV genotype 1 (line probe
             assay; INNO-LiPA HCV II, Innogenetics) and may be treatment-naïve or
             treatment-experienced (treatment experienced specifically means prior treatment with
             interferon, standard or pegylated, with or without ribavirin with therapy stopped &gt; 6
             months prior to screening). In addition, eligible subjects must have ALT and AST &lt; 5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN), plasma HCV RNA&gt; 5 log10 IU/mL, and have no clinical or
             laboratory evidence of hepatic decompensation for inclusion (must have platelets
             &gt;100,000/mm3, total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN, prothrombin time &lt; 1.5 x ULN, or albumin &gt;
