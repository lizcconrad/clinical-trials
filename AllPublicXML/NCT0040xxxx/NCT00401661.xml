      Primary objective:

        -  End-point improvement from baseline in Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Ejaculation
           domain (MSHQ-EjD)in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)suggestive of benign
           prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treated for 6 months with XATRAL 10mg once daily OD.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  MSHQ-EjD improvement by visit

        -  Improvement in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) total score, voiding and
           filling subscores, nocturia and bother score at end-point and by visit

        -  Onset of action of XATRAL 10mg OD

        -  Tolerability of XATRAL 10mg OD including occurrence of acute urinary retention.
