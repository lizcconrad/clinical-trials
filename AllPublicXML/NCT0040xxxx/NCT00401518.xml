      The purpose of this study is to determine if the ACADIA® Facet Replacement System is
      effective in the treatment of spinal stenosis. The primary objective of the study is to
      evaluate the overall success rate of the Anatomic Facet Replacement System in patients with
      spinal stenosis when compared to a posterior spinal fusion control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Stenosis continues to be a major cause of back and leg pain. The condition is
      attributed to narrowing of the space around the nerves in the lumbar spine. This is often
      caused by the degenerative process in the spine and the facet joints. The current treatment
      calls for removal of bone around the affected nerve including the facet joints and fusing the
      posterior of the spine to ensure the segments remain stable.

      The ACADIA® Facet Replacement System (AFRS) allows for an anatomic reconstruction of the
      facet joint after decompression and removal of the degenerated facet. Like the original facet
      joint, the replacement implant is designed to reproduce facet motion while restoring normal
      stability and motion.

      The ACADIA® Facet Replacement System (AFRS) has been designed on the principals that have
      allowed other total joint replacement procedures to provide significant patient benefits.
      These guiding principals include:

        -  Anatomically based implant design

        -  Reproducible surgical technique

        -  Elimination of pain

      The ACADIA® Facet Replacement System allows the surgeon to remove the offending bone while
      preserving the motion of the facet joint.

      This study will evaluate the outcomes of patients using the AFRS™ investigation compared to
      those receiving instrumented posterior fusion procedure. Patients will be required to
      complete study visits before the procedure and at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 24 months post procedure
      and annually thereafter as required by FDA. Follow up visits consist of administration of
      questionnaires, radiographs and neurological assessment.
