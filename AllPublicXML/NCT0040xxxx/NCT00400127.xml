  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that silicone suction suspension
      without additional belt support does not significantly diminish the postural sway or walking
      performance of persons with transfemoral amputation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  be forty-five (45) or older;

          -  unilateral transfemoral amputee;

          -  current patients of the QEII Health Sciences Centre Amputee Service based at the Rehab
             Site;

          -  can walk comfortably with their prosthesis for a minimum of 5 minutes, regardless of
             whether they require ambulation aids (i.e. canes, walkers, etc.);

          -  are in the process of being fitted with a silicon suction liner and pin system;

          -  are competent to give informed consent or have a proxy with power of attorney;

          -  have the written permission of the attending physician to participate;

          -  be willing to take part in the study, including signing the consent after carefully
             reading it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have an unstable medical condition (e.g. angina, seizures), as determined by the
             attending or house physician;

          -  have major medical or neurological conditions that affect balance (specifically
             Parkinson's disease, stroke or Multiple Sclerosis), as determined by the physician or
             house staff physician;

          -  have an emotional or psychiatric problem of a type or extent that might make
