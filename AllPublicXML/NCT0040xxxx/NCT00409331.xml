      Primary Objective:

      To determine if amifostine in combination with IMRT can mitigate the decrease in production
      of saliva by the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands in patients with HNSCC.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To establish a parotid gland dose volume histogram (DVH) versus measured flow
           relationship in this patient population:

             -  When the mean dose is &lt; 24-26 Gy (shift recovery time to left)

             -  When the mean dose is &gt; 24-26 Gy (DVH shift)

        2. To observe mucositis in the following lower dose RT areas:

             -  Upper lip

             -  Lower lip

             -  Right cheek

             -  Left cheek

             -  Right ventral and lateral tongue

             -  Left ventral and lateral tongue

             -  Floor of the mouth

             -  Soft palate

             -  Hard palate.

        3. To observe the incidence and patterns of occipital scalp epilation;

        4. To observe the incidence of dysphagia using the List Performance Status Scale (LPSS);
           and

        5. To further evaluate the safety profile of amifostine in this patient population.

      Amifostine is designed to protect the cells in normal tissues against the toxicities of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study.

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests. Your complete medical
      history will be recorded. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital
      signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate), weight, and height. You
      will have a dental exam. You will complete a questionnaire that asks questions about dry
      mouth. In addition, you will be asked questions about your diet and eating habits. This
      should take no longer than 10 minutes. Also, saliva will be collected by a simple, in-office
      oral test that measures saliva flow rate over a 5 minute period. Women who are able to have
      children must have a negative blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) pregnancy test.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive IMRT Monday
      -Friday over a 6-7 week period. In addition, 2-3 hours before IMRT, you will also take
      pre-medications by mouth to prevent potential nausea and skin reactions (anti-nausea &amp;
      antihistamine), including drinking water.You will receive daily IMRT therapy, excluding
      weekends and holidays. The radiation dose is designed to conform to the 3-dimensional shape
      of the tumor by controlling the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation
      dose on the tumor (and not the surrounding normal tissue). Thirty (30) to 60 minutes before
      every IMRT treatment, you will receive study drug in two injections beneath the skin. IMRT
      will take about 30 minutes to complete.

      Every day that you are receiving IMRT (Monday-Friday), you will be asked about any drugs you
      are taking and any side effects you are experiencing. Your vital signs will be recorded.

      Every week (Weeks 2-7), you will have a complete oral and physical exam. You will complete
      the questionnaire that asks questions about dry mouth. You will be asked questions about your
      ability to perform daily activities (performance status evaluation). Your weight will also be
      measured. You will be asked to complete the symptom survey (the M.D. Anderson Symptom
      Inventory) that will ask you to rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms interfere in
      your daily activities.

      On the last day you receive IMRT or amifostine (whichever is last), you will have a complete
      oral exam and you will complete the questionnaire about dry mouth.

      Six (6) weeks after the end of therapy, you will have an end-of-therapy visit. At this visit,
      you will have a complete physical and oral exam with a saliva collection. You will complete
      the questionnaire about dry mouth. Your weight will be measured, and you will have a
      performance status evaluation. Blood (about (2) tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood
      tests. You will be asked about any drugs you are taking and any side effects you are
      experiencing. In addition, you will be asked questions about your diet and eating habits.

      You will be asked to complete the symptom survey (the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory) that
      will ask you to rate your symptoms and how much the symptoms interfere in your daily
      activities every week for 2 months after the end of radiation therapy. After this point, you
      will be asked to complete the symptom survey every month for 1 year.

      You will have follow-up visits 4, 7, 10, and 12 months after the end of therapy. At these
      visits, you will have a complete oral exam and saliva collection. You will complete the dry
      mouth questionnaire. Your weight will be measured, and you will have a performance status
      evaluation and you will be asked questions about your diet and eating habits.

      THIS IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL STUDY. Amifostine is FDA approved and commercially available.
      Amifostine is FDA approved to be given through a needle in your vein but not FDA approved to
      be given through a needle under the skin.

      Up to 20 patients will take part in this study. All patients will be enrolled at M. D.
      Anderson.

    <description>Primary endpoint is bilateral, 12-month Clinically Relevant Salivary Flow (CRSF) by the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands, collectively. Saliva production will be quantified using selective quantitative submandibular sialometry (total collection time of 5 minutes). A CRSF is equivalent to production of 0.05 mL of saliva post-radiation in a 5-minute collection period.</description>

          2. Women of reproductive potential (defined as being &lt;1 year post-menopausal) must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry;

          3. Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective method of
             avoiding pregnancy (including oral or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device
             (IUD), female condom, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap, use of a condom by the
             sexual partner or sterile sexual partner) beginning at the time the informed consent
             is signed, and must agree to continue using such precautions while receiving IMRT
             through 6 weeks after the last dose of amifostine or RT, whichever is the last therapy
             discontinued;

          4. Patients undergoing definitive or post-operative IMRT as follows:

          5. Definitive Patients: Histology confirmed unknown primary T0N1-2bM0 or oropharynx Stage
             I, II, III, IV (TX, T1-T2, favorable T3 (exophytic) N0-N2b, M0), small volume primary
             and nodal, not requiring chemotherapy during RT (i.e., induction chemo is acceptable
             as well as concurrent biological therapy e.g., Cetuximab), squamous cell carcinoma
             (AJCC Staging of HNSCC). Lymph nodes bilaterally of the neck are at risk for
             metastatic disease and require irradiation per clinical judgment.

          6. Post-operative Patients: Histology confirmed oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and
             hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (AJCC Staging of HNSCC): *Stage III and IV
             squamous cell carcinoma treated with surgery as the primary modality requiring
             post-operative RT, but not receiving concurrent chemotherapy. *Indications for
             post-operative RT include: unfavorable T3 and T4 primaries, compromised margins, nodal
             metastases, extracapsular nodal extension, perineural invasion and lymphovascular
             invasion.

          7. Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1

          8. Adequate nutritional status as determined by the treating physician in conjunction

         10. At least one parotid should keep a mean RT dose of &lt; 24-26 Gy. If this cannot be
             achieved on one side, then the contralateral parotid dosing goal is to keep the mean
             dose as low as possible, typically &lt;15 Gy.

         11. It is anticipated that at least one submandibular gland will receive a mean dose
             &gt;24-26 Gy.

         12. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization obtained from the patient prior to
             receipt of any study medication or beginning study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of significant wound infection, fistula, or major wound dehiscence at time of
             patient entry.

          2. Carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, or N3 at time of patient entry.

          3. Presence of prior malignancies &lt;5 years other than non-melanoma skin cancer or
             cervical, breast or bladder cancer in situ.

          7. Less than gross total resection for patients on post-operative RT.

          8. Prior head neck irradiation except for localized non-melanomatous cutaneous
             carcinomas.

          9. Salivary gland disease, e.g. Sjogren's disease at time of patient entry.

         10. Pregnant or nursing at the time of patient entry or positive serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of study entry.

         11. Use of pilocarpine or cevimeline during participation in the study.

         12. General medical or psychological conditions that might preclude the patient from

        <title>12-month Clinically Relevant Salivary Flow (CRSF)</title>
        <description>Primary endpoint is bilateral, 12-month Clinically Relevant Salivary Flow (CRSF) by the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands, collectively. Saliva production will be quantified using selective quantitative submandibular sialometry (total collection time of 5 minutes). A CRSF is equivalent to production of 0.05 mL of saliva post-radiation in a 5-minute collection period.</description>
