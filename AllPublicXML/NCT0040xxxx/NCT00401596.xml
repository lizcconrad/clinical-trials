    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open label, randomized, controlled, safety trial in subjects aged
      6-75 years with a diagnosis of moderate to severe, persistent asthma. A total of 1899
      subjects were randomized (2:1) to either the active treatment group or the control group.
      Upon successful completion of the screening period (~2 weeks), each subject entered the 24
      week study.
