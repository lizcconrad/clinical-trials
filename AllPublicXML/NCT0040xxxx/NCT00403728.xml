  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beyond its immunosuppressive properties, ciclosporine A (CsA) can also inhibit the opening of
      a mitochondrial mega-channel called the permeability transition pore (mPTP). Opening of the
      mPTP plays a key role in cardiomyocyte death during reperfusion following a prolonged
      ischemic insult. Ciclosporin A has been shown to reduce infarct size when administered at
      reperfusion in experimental models. The objective of the present study is to determine
      whether administration of CsA at reperfusion in patients with ongoing acute myocardial
      infarction treated by coronary angioplasty might reduce infarct size.
