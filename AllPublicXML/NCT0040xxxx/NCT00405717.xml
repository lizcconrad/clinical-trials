  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel and statins are frequently coadministered in patients with ischemic heart
      diseases. Recent reports suggested that clopidogrel's effectiveness in inhibiting adenosine
      diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelets aggregation is attenuated by co-administration of certain
      statins. The objective of the present study is to define which kind of statins might
      interfere with the antiaggregation property of clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary
      Syndrome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      In this prospective randomized study, all patients in test group will receive clopidogrel
      plus atorvastatin, and all patients in control group will receive clopidogrel plus
      pravastatin. All patients will be followed up for one year. The primary endpoints include
      death, non fatal AMI, urgent revascularization. The secondary endpoints include hemorrhage
      events and subacute thrombosis events at 1 year.
