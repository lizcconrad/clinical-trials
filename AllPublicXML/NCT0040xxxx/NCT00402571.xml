  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective was to determine whether liver injury develops in alcoholic patients who
      ingest therapeutic doses of APAP for three consecutive days. Volunteers were recruited from
      two community detoxification centers to take either acetaminophen (4 g/day) or placebo for 3
      consecutive days and remain in the facility an additional 2 days for monitoring. The primary
      measures were aminotransferase measures taken at baseline and Days 2-5. We hypothesized that
      there would be no difference in aminotransferase measures between the acetaminophen and
      placebo study groups.
