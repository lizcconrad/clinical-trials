  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if pregabalin relieves nerve pain associated with
      spinal cord injury compared to placebo (pill that contains no active medicine). This study
      will also evaluate the safety of pregabalin in this patient population.

    <measure>Duration Adjusted Average Change (DAAC) of Mean Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>DAAC was derived from participant's daily pain diary, where pain was measured on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS-Pain)ranging from 0 (did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (completely interfered [unable to sleep due to pain]). The DAAC was calculated as the mean of all daily pain diary rating post baseline minus the baseline score then multiplied by the proportion of the planned study duration completed by the participant.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Brief Pain Inventory Interference Scale (10-Item) (mBPI-10) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Brief Pain Inventory (mBPI-10) Interference Scale is a self administered questionnaire that assessed pain interference with functional activities over the past week. The items were measured on an 11 point scale, ranging from &quot;does not interfere&quot; (0) to &quot;completely interferes&quot; (10). A composite score, the pain interference index, was calculated by averaging the 10 items that comprised the scale.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>1 participant was randomized after the first dose of study drug was taken; the participant was randomized to placebo, but the actual drug taken was pregabalin. This partcipant was included in the placebo group for all baseline characteristics and efficacy outcome measures; and in the pregabalin group for overall study and adverse events reporting.</pre_assignment_details>

On Day 8, dose may have been maintained at 150 mg per day or increased to 300 mg per day. Each week thereafter, including at Visit 4, a dose increase or decrease may have occurred depending on clinical judgement on adequate pain relief and tolerability. Following the end of adjustment phase, at Visit 4, participants were at their optimized dose (150 mg per day, 300 mg per day, 450 mg per day, or 600 mg per day). Participants remained at this maintenance dose throughout the next 12 weeks of the study.</description>

A longitudinal analysis of weekly mean changes using repeated measures mixed models which compared treatments at each week and the last scheduled study week based on this model (to assess durability of treatment effect) was used.
Effects for treatment, pooled center, time (week), baseline score, and treatment by time interaction were included as covariates. The covariance structure was compound-symmetric.</groups_desc>

        <description>The Modified Brief Pain Inventory (mBPI-10) Interference Scale is a self administered questionnaire that assessed pain interference with functional activities over the past week. The items were measured on an 11 point scale, ranging from “does not interfere” (0) to “completely interferes” (10). A composite score, the pain interference index, was calculated by averaging the 10 items that comprised the scale.</description>

        <description>Participant rated questionnaire used to evaluate different symptoms of neuropathic pain (dimensions: burning [superficial] spontaneous pain, pressing [deep] spontaneous pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain, and paresthesia/dyesthesia [P/D]). Includes 10 descriptors quantified on a 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms imaginable) and 2 temporal items assessing duration of spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain. Questionnaire generates a score in each of the relevant dimensions and a total score of 0-100. Higher score indicates a greater intensity of pain.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) - Paresthesia/Dysesthesia</title>
          <description>Participant rated questionnaire used to evaluate different symptoms of neuropathic pain (dimensions: burning [superficial] spontaneous pain, pressing [deep] spontaneous pain, paroxysmal pain, evoked pain, and paresthesia/dyesthesia [P/D]). Includes 10 descriptors quantified on a 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst symptoms imaginable) and 2 temporal items assessing duration of spontaneous ongoing and paroxysmal pain. Questionnaire generates a score in each of the relevant dimensions and a total score of 0-100. Higher score indicates a greater intensity of pain.</description>

On Day 8, dose may have been maintained at 150 mg per day or increased to 300 mg per day. Each week thereafter, including at Visit 4, a dose increase or decrease may have occurred depending on clinical judgement on adequate pain relief and tolerability. Following the end of adjustment phase, at Visit 4, participants were at their optimized dose (150 mg per day, 300 mg per day, 450 mg per day, or 600 mg per day). Participants remained at this maintenance dose throughout the next 12 weeks of the study.</description>

        <description>Participant rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Consists of a 9-item overall sleep problems index (length of time to fall asleep, how many hours of sleep each night during past 4 weeks); 7 subscales rated 1 (all the time) to 6 (none of the time): sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath (SOB) or with a headache, somnolence adequacy, and sleep quantity. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100); total score range = 0 to 100; higher score indicates greater intensity of attribute.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Having Optimal Sleep Based on Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS)</title>
          <description>Participant rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Consists of a 9-item overall sleep problems index (length of time to fall asleep, how many hours of sleep each night during past 4 weeks); 7 subscales rated 1 (all the time) to 6 (none of the time): sleep disturbance, snoring, awaken short of breath (SOB) or with a headache, somnolence adequacy, and sleep quantity. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100); total score range = 0 to 100; higher score indicates greater intensity of attribute.</description>

        <description>HADS: participant rated questionnaire with 2 subscales. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items with range 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicates greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>
