  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired glucose tolerance or mild glucose elevations in the non-diabetic range are
      associated with increased cardiovascular disease and recent studies suggested the need to
      detect these glucose abnormalities early in the post-infarction period. Although in the last
      ten years procedures of coronary revascularisation have dramatically improved the outcome of
      non diabetic patients affected by ischemic heart disease, these procedures are less effective
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and IGT. Possible causes of worse prognosis in
      these patients could be related to the presence of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance
      due to the well known effect of insulin to increase neointimal tissue proliferation and
      in-stent restenosis, by stimulating vascular smooth muscle cell growth factors and migration.
      In addition, it is well known that endothelial dysfunction is an early functional disturbance
      in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. The impairment of eNOS action might change the
      turnover rate of eNOS or nitric oxide production and action influencing nitric oxide
      signalling, apoptosis cascade and angiogenesis. All these factors can contribute to
      endothelial dysfunction to a certain extent, and accelerate atherosclerosis with increased
      risk for cardiovascular disease.

      The constitutively expressed eNOS, is likely to be the major contributors to whole-body
      nitric oxide production. It is interesting to note that a region of chromosome 7q seems to
      influence both insulin resistance and blood pressure, suggesting that this locus may broadly
      influence traits associated with insulin resistance.

      L-arginine is an essential amino acid and its availability is important for the normal
      endothelial cell function and its intracellular reduction may contribute to the dysfunctional
      endothelial state. It is well known that L-arginine is as a precursor for nitric oxide and
      both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that L-arginine can augment vascular
      dilation under certain conditions.

      Our hypothesis is to evaluate the modulating effect of L-arginine on metabolic, endothelial
      variables and on myocardial function in patients with cardiovascular disease.
