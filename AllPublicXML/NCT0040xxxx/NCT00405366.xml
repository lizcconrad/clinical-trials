      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving sorafenib before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and how well sorafenib works in
      treating patients undergoing surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of systemic sorafenib tosylate therapy when given
           prior to definitive nephrectomy in patients with stage II-IV renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      Secondary

        -  Determine all levels of response in primary renal tumors of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Assess effects of this drug on gene expression, protein expression, and metabolic
           profile using tumor tissue samples from these patients.

        -  Identify biomarkers or biomarker patterns associated with RCC or this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, open-label, nonrandomized study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 4-8 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients
      undergo surgical resection of their kidney tumor.

      Patients undergo blood and urine sample collection at baseline and after completion of
      treatment (i.e., at 4 and 8* weeks) for VEGF analysis. Samples are examined by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay for measurement of serum and urinary VEGF levels.

      NOTE: *Blood sampling at 8 weeks is only for those patients undergoing 8 weeks of study
      therapy.

      Patients also undergo tissue sample collection at the time of nephrectomy. Tissue samples are
      examined by microarray analysis and IHC staining for expression of CD31/PECAM, HIF1α, and
      HIF2α. Immunohistochemical staining to identify biomarkers of microvessel density is also
      performed. Tissue samples are also examined for gene expression and metabolic profile by
      small molecule mass spectroscopy, as well as VHL gene mutation by VHL mutation analysis.

      Patients are followed at 4-8 weeks after nephrectomy.

Measurement of the primary tumor, and up to three largest index lesions for patients with metastatic disease, will be recorded on the case report form. The overall percentage of change in the sum of greatest dimension(s) of the kidney lesion (and three largest index lesions, if any) will be recorded. Response to therapy will be measured in absolute size change, as well as according to traditional RECIST criteria.</description>
