  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects between the ages of 20-45 with mild to moderate asthma will be recruited. Following
      consent, subjects will undergo an evaluation to assure no underlying metabolic bone disease.
      Individuals will be treated with inhaled fluticasone low or high dose, daily for 3 months.
      Serum and urine biochemical markers of bone metabolism will be collected at baseline and
      monthly for three months. Adherence to study medication and adverse events will be collected
      at monthly intervals. Differences between fluticasone low and high dose treated individuals
      will be analyzed between groups and compared with baseline values.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized trial. Thirty subjects with mild to moderate
      asthma will receive inhaled fluticasone propionate. Fifteen patients will receive low dose
      inhaled fluticasone 88 mcg twice daily. Fifteen patients will receive inhaled fluticasone 440
      mcg twice daily. The primary outcome will be biochemical markers of bone turnover. These will
      include 1) serum biochemical markers of bone formation [osteocalcin, bone specific alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP) and procollagen I C-terminal propeptide (PICP)] and 2) markers of bone
      resorption, serum collagen type 1 C-Telopeptide (CTx) urinary N-telopeptide (NTx) and
      immunoreactive free deoxypyridinoline (iFDpd)]. Secondary endpoints will include, parathyroid
      hormone (PTH), Urinary Calcium/creatinine, and adverse events.
