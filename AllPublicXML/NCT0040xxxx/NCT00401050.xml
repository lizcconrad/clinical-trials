      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes of combined chiropractic care in anterior
      knee pain patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is standard of care for PFPS but gives limited pain reduction and functional
      improvement. Previous manipulative therapy for PFPS (with and without exercise) has been
      limited to the patellofemoral joint alone. However, literature suggests additional
      manipulative therapy with exercise and soft-tissue treatment may give a better outcome.
      Further research is needed.

      Therefore, this project is a pilot study to inform a future randomized controlled trial to
      determine if chiropractic adjusting of the full lower extremity (lumbosacral through foot)
      combined with exercise and soft tissue treatment (Protocol and group A) is superior to
      chiropractic adjusting of the knee (alone) combined with exercise and soft tissue treatment
      (Protocol and group B) in the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome. We will use the
      Anterior Knee Pain Scale (AKPS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) as valid and reliable primary
      outcome measures, a functional measure (step-ups, step-downs and squats) and a Patient
      Satisfaction Scale (PSS - discharge or refer) as secondary outcome measures. This study will
      help establish the feasibility of conducting quality research at Cleveland Chiropractic
      College Los Angeles.

      In this pilot study there will be two groups of 10 subjects each

        1. Group A will receive CMT to the knee only, exercise and soft tissue treatment (Graston
           Instrument Soft Tissue Mobilization hereafter GISTM)

        2. Group B will receive CMT to the lumbosacral, sacroiliac and (all) lower extremity
           joints, exercise and soft tissue treatment (GISTM).

      Enrolled subjects will receive a total of 6 treatments. The primary endpoint will be a 2
      month follow-up after the 6th treatment.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  anterior, peri or retropatellar knee pain &gt;3 months from at least two of the
             following: prolonged sitting, stair-climbing, squatting, running, kneeling, and
             hopping/jumping or overuse activities. Pain is relieved by rest.

          -  insidious onset of symptoms unrelated to a traumatic incident; and

          -  presence of pain on palpation of the patellar facets, on step down from a 25-cm step,
             or during a double-legged squat

          -  other disorders such as OA, instability or medial meniscus injury must be ruled out

          -  X-ray or MRI findings not required. There is no clear correlation between severity of
             complaints and arthroscopic or radiologic findings

          -  A VAS-Worst pain of ≥ 5.0; a AKPS of ≥ 50.This reflects the current probability that
             less PFPS patients with less severity currently consult chiropractors for this
             disorder

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patellar subluxation/dislocation

          -  meniscal injuries

          -  intra-articular pathology (ACL injury, etc)

          -  ligament laxity

          -  Osgood-Schlatters

          -  Sinding-Larsen-Johanson syndrome

          -  knee joint effusion

          -  previous surgery on patellofemoral joint

          -  illiteracy/inability to understand and answer questionnaires

          -  inability to attend all treatment sessions

          -  true locking of knee joint

          -  a neurological disorder that influences gait

          -  foot orthotics allowed if already worn

          -  arthritidies

          -  bursitis

          -  patellar tendonitis

          -  older subjects &gt; 45 years of age

          -  subjects &lt; 18 years of age

          -  those that begin marked ↑ in physical activity during the course of the trial
