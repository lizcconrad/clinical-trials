  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS SR) is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
      (SNRI). It is a nonhormonal option for the treatment of Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) associated
      with menopause. Nausea is the most common adverse event that is observed in clinical studies
      and is the main reason for discontinuation during the first week of therapy. Other adverse
      events (headache, nausea, and dizziness) associated with DVS SR have been noted to occur when
      subjects abruptly discontinue the medication. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      several titration and tapering regimens of DVS SR to ensure a better tolerability profile at
      the start and completion of treatment. In addition, this study will provide a long
      posttreatment follow-up to assess any symptoms after treatment is discontinued.

    <description>Nausea by spontaneous reports to the investigators was counted if it was reported during first 2 weeks of treatment, and it was not seen before the first dose of treatment, or if it was seen before the first dose and the symptoms got worse. If multiple incidences occurred on the same participant during the 2 weeks, only 1 incidence was counted.</description>

    <description>DESS: a clinician-administered 43-item assessment that evaluates discontinuation-emergent symptoms resulting from the withdrawal from test article. The DESS total score is the sum of the number of &quot;new symptoms&quot; and &quot;old (but worse) symptoms&quot; (1) and 0 for &quot;old and unchanged symptom&quot;, &quot;absent&quot;, or &quot;old symptom but improved&quot; for a total possible range of 0 to 43. A higher score indicates more symptoms.</description>

    <description>MenQOL questionnaire assessed how bothered participants were with 31 symptoms. It contains domains: vasomotor (items 1-3); psychosocial (items 4-10); physical (items 11-26); sexual (items 27-29); in addition to nausea and indigestion. 31 individual symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all bothered) to 6 (extremely bothered). Total possible score ranged from 0 to 186. MenQOL summary score was calculated as mean of four domain scores (Physical function, Psychosocial function, Sexual function and Vasomotor function) ranging from 1 to 8, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

        <description>DESS: a clinician-administered 43-item assessment that evaluates discontinuation-emergent symptoms resulting from the withdrawal from test article. The DESS total score is the sum of the number of &quot;new symptoms&quot; and &quot;old (but worse) symptoms&quot; (1) and 0 for &quot;old and unchanged symptom&quot;, &quot;absent&quot;, or &quot;old symptom but improved&quot; for a total possible range of 0 to 43. A higher score indicates more symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Menopause-specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MenQOL) Score at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16</title>
        <description>MenQOL questionnaire assessed how bothered participants were with 31 symptoms. It contains domains: vasomotor (items 1-3); psychosocial (items 4-10); physical (items 11-26); sexual (items 27-29); in addition to nausea and indigestion. 31 individual symptoms are rated on a scale of 0 (not at all bothered) to 6 (extremely bothered). Total possible score ranged from 0 to 186. MenQOL summary score was calculated as mean of four domain scores (Physical function, Psychosocial function, Sexual function and Vasomotor function) ranging from 1 to 8, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life.</description>

        <population>The OL population included all participants who had taken at least 1 dose of open label test article. The 'n' is signifying those participants who received study drug and were evaluated for this measure at the time points for each group respectively.</population>
