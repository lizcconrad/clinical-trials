  <brief_title>Study Comparing Bioavailability of 3 New Formulations of Premarin/MPA With Premarin/MPA (PREMPRO) Reference Formulation</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the bioavailabity of three new investigational combination
      formulations of Premarin and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) with a currently marketed
      formulation of Premarin and MPA, Prempro™. Prempro™ is indicated for use after menopause in
      women with a uterus to reduce moderate to severe hot flashes; to treat moderate to severe
      dryness, itching, and burning, in and around the vagina; and to help reduce your chances of
      getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones). The purpose of this study is to determine if these
      new formulations of Premarin/MPA provide the same levels of estrogen and MPA in the blood as
      Prempro in healthy postmenopausal women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, postmenopausal women ages 35 to 70 years, inclusive.

          -  Naturally postmenopausal women must not have had a menstrual period for at least six
             months, but less than 12 months, as confirmed by a blood test; or for at least 12
             months with no blood hormone test confirmation. Naturally postmenopausal women must
             not have had a menstrual period since the age of 54. Surgically menopausal women must
             have undergone bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries) at least 6 months
             prior to the start of the study, and the surgical report may be requested to confirm
             the surgery date and that the surgery was not due to a cancerous condition.

          -  Nonsmoker or smoker of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day as determined by history. Must
             be able to abstain from smoking during the inpatient stay.
