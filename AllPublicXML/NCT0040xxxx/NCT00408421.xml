        <description>This is an ordinal scale with scores from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The value is the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the 24-hour worst pain score on the scale.</description>

        <population>Analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. All randomized patients with a baseline and at least one non-missing post-baseline value for the specific outcome measure were included in the analysis.</population>
