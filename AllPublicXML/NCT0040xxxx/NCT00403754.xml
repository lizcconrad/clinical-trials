  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to provide data about the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of
      indacaterol (150, 300, and 600 µg) in Japanese asthma patients so that an optimal dose, or
      doses, could be chosen for testing in later studies.

    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Standardized (With Respect to Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 22 to 24 Hours Post-dose on Day 2</measure>
    <time_frame>22, 23, and 24 hours post-dose on Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC22-24h) of FEV1 values taken at 22, 23 and 24 hours post dose, was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule. Analysis of Covariance was carried out with a mixed model that used (period) baseline, defined as the value of FEV1 measured prior to the first study drug intake in the period, as a covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes to 4 hours post-dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Peak FEV1 is the maximum FEV1 recorded in the period between 5 minutes and 4 hours post dose. Analysis of Covariance was carried out with a mixed model that used (period) baseline, defined as the value of FEV1 measured prior to the first study drug intake in the period, as a covariate.</description>

    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC0-24h) of FEV1 values taken at pre-dose to 24 hours post dose was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule.

There was a washout period of 14-28 days between each treatment period. In open label treatment period 5: patients received 100 μg salmeterol (50 μg in the morning, 50 μg twelve hours post initial dose) inhaled via Diskus®, an inhalation device, on Day 1.
Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was allowed to remain stable throughout the study. The short acting (beta) β2-agonist (SABA) salbutamol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>

          <description>The entire study population included all 4 treatment groups who received indacaterol 150 µg, 300 µg, and 600 µg and placebo via a single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) in the 4 different sequences of the core phase. Two capsules of study medication were inhaled in the morning on Day 1 of each treatment period. Following the core phase patients continued to the Salmeterol open label phase. Salmeterol was inhaled via a Diskus inhalation device 50 µg in the morning and 50 µg 12 hours post initial dose on Day 1. Patients received each treatment only once.
Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was allowed to remain stable throughout the study. The short acting (beta) β2-agonist (SABA) salbutamol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>

        <title>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Standardized (With Respect to Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 5 Minutes Post-dose on Day 1 to 24 Hours Post-dose on Day 2</title>
        <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Standardized area under the curve (AUC0-24h) of FEV1 values taken at pre-dose to 24 hours post dose was calculated based on the trapezoidal rule. Analysis of Covariance was carried out with a mixed model that used (period) baseline, defined as the value of FEV1 measured prior to the first study drug intake in the period, as a covariate.</description>
