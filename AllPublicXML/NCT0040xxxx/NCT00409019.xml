  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if taking a combination of telbivudine and adefovir
      or tenofovir and telbivudine can lower the amount of Hepatitis B virus in patients that have
      been taking adefovir alone for at least 5 months and have had less than optimal responses.
      The safety of taking telbivudine and adefovir together or tenofovir and telbivudine together
      will also be studied.
