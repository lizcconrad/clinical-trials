      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective evaluation regarding the relationship
      between platelets function and cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD.

      The study will include 100-200 patients with ESRD, age 18 years or older, treated in the
      nephrology division of Assaf Harofeh medical center.

      The primary end points of the study are cardiovascular events including acute myocardial
      infarction (defined as symptoms + acute elevation of TnI), need for coronary artery disease
      revascularization, or acute cerebrovascular event (TIA or CVA) and mortality. The secondary
      end points are any hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome, active bleeding with the
      need for blood transfusion and dialysis access graft thrombosis (time to thrombosis).

      Blood will be taken for complete blood count including platelets count and mean platelets
      volume, serum electrolytes, albumin, blood lipids, Kt/V, troponin and two 5 ml aliquots from
      each blood collection will be separated and stored at -70co until analyzed for oxidative
      stress, homocysteine and highly sensitive CRP will be performed. Five mL of blood will be
      sent for platelets function assessment.

      During the follow up period the correlation between platelets function an cardiovascular
      events will be assessed.

      Background Platelets play an important role in cardiovascular disease both in the
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and in the development of acute thrombotic events. Their
      importance in coronary disease and in acute coronary syndromes is indirectly confirmed by the
      benefit of antiplatelet agents (particularly aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, and the
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors) in these disorders. Cardiovascular disease is the single
      best predictor of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, as it accounts for
      almost 50 percent of deaths. Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased
      tendency to bleeding due to platelet dysfunction that can be partly corrected by either
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in approximately two-thirds of cases. Currently there is
      only scant data concerning the relations between platelet function and cardiovascular risk in
      patients with ESRD.

      Platelets, platelet products, and thrombosis play important and proximate causal roles in the
      occurrence of acute occlusive vascular events such as MI and ischemic stroke. The disruption
      of platelet and fibrin rich atherosclerotic plaques may lead to enhanced platelet deposition,
      and ultimately the formation of a thrombus that can precipitate an acute clinical event. The
      following observations are compatible with the importance of platelet thrombus formation in
      acute ischemic syndromes:

        -  Thrombus formation within a coronary vessel is the acute precipitating event in most
           unstable ischemic coronary syndromes, as documented by angiographic and pathologic
           studies . Among patients with sudden death due to coronary thrombosis, the thrombi
           typically have a layered appearance indicative of episodic growth. Episodic growth may
           alternate with intermittent fragmentation of the thrombus, leading to distal
           embolization of both thrombus and platelet aggregates and microinfarction.

        -  Increased platelet-derived thromboxane A2 and other prostaglandin metabolites have been
           found in patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina, providing
           biochemical support for platelet activation as the cause of these events.

        -  Patients with unstable angina have elevated levels of P-selectin, an integral membrane
           protein involved in platelet adhesion. Pulsatile shear stress, as occurs in stenotic
           arteries, can cause platelet aggregation via an increased expression of P-selectin.
           Hydrodynamic shear stress, resulting from plaque rupture, can activate platelets and
           cause both platelet aggregation (via glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and von Willebrand factor)
           and platelet-mediated neutrophil aggregation via upregulation of P-selectin. Although
           levels of P-selectin decrease during the first month after treatment, levels remain
           higher than normal even with therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, suggesting
           continued platelet activation.

        -  Aggregating platelets from patients with acute coronary syndromes produce less nitric
           oxide than those from patients with stable or no angina. Why this might occur is not
           known, but impaired nitric oxide production can enhance platelet aggregation and
           thrombus formation.

      Another platelet-related factor believed to contribute to cardiovascular thrombosis is the
      presence of larger, more reactive platelets in patients with acute ischemic events (19-21).
      The increase in platelet size, which is in compensation for a persistent decrease in platelet
      count, results from the ongoing consumption of platelets in unstable angina; this is not seen
      in an acute myocardial infarction. In addition, platelets from patients with unstable angina,
      as determined by studying platelet aggregability ex vivo, are hyperaggregable. These effects
      promote thrombus growth, limitation of blood flow, and acute ischemia.

      Except for the important of platelets in occlusive vascular events several studies suggests
      that they may also have a role in the evolutionary phase of the atherosclerotic plaque. After
      adhesion to exposed subendothelium following endothelial injury they release vasoactive
      substances that induce smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Platelets may serve as
      a lipid source in the development of the fatty streak and can promote foam cell formation
      even in the absence of hyperlipidemia. However, currently there is no clear clinical evidence
      that platelets contribute to coronary atherosclerosis. In addition, prophylactic therapy with
      aspirin has not been clearly shown to decrease the atherosclerotic burden.

      ESRD is associated with prolongation of the bleeding time due primarily impaired platelet
      function. It is likely that multiple factors are responsible for the platelet dysfunction in
      uremia. Three of the factors that may contribute are the retention of uremic toxins, anemia,
      and nitric oxide.

        -  Uremic toxins – The importance of circulating toxins is suggested by the often
           beneficial effect of acute dialysis on platelet dysfunction, although the bleeding time
           is rarely normalized. In addition, raising the BUN to 60 to 120 mg/dL by dietary
           manipulation can diminish platelet adhesiveness and prolong the bleeding time in some
           normal subjects. Urea alone, however, is probably not the major platelet toxin and there
           is no predictable correlation between the BUN and the bleeding time in patients with
           renal failure. Other potential toxins include guanidinosuccinic acid, phenolic acid, and
           middle molecules (mol wt 500 to 3000 daltons). In vitro studies in which normal
           platelets are incubated with uremic serum suggest that a dialyzable factor interferes
           with the binding of fibrinogen to the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor. In
           addition, uremic platelets are unable to adequately increase the expression of GP
           IIb/IIIa and P-selectin in response to stimulation.

        -  Anemia – Previously, anemia was a common finding in chronic renal failure. The degree of
           anemia appears to correlate relatively closely with the degree of prolongation of the
           bleeding time. Furthermore, correction of anemia with blood transfusions or
           erythropoietin often improves platelet function. It has been proposed that the rheologic
           factors play an important role in the relationship between anemia and platelet
           dysfunction. At a hematocrit above 30 percent, the red cells primarily occupy the center
           of the vessel, while the platelets are in a skimming layer at the endothelial surface.
           This close proximity allows the platelets to adhere and then form a platelet plug when
           there is endothelial injury. With anemia, on the other hand, the platelets are more
           dispersed, thereby impairing adherence to the endothelium.

        -  Nitric oxide – Nitric oxide (NO; endothelium-derived relaxing factor) is an inhibitor of
           platelet aggregation that is produced by endothelial cells and platelets. Studies in
           uremic patients have shown that platelet NO synthesis is increased and that uremic
           plasma stimulates NO production by cultured endothelial cells. The increase in NO
           synthesis may be due to elevated levels of guanidinosuccinic acid, a uremic toxin that
           may be a precursor for nitric oxide in this setting.

      Although patients with ESRD are at increase risk for cardiovascular disease there are only
      scant data concerning the cardioprotective effect of antiplatelets drugs for primary or
      secondary prevention in this population. In a retrospective evaluation of patients with ESRD
      after acute myocardial infarction, Berger et al. have found that aspirin is underused in this
      population (67.0%) and Similar results were found by McCullough et al., . Balanced against
      the potential, but unproven benefit of aspirin in patients with ESRD are its potential risks,
      including bleeding and a possible acceleration of access thrombosis. The evidence for
      accelerate dialysis access graft thrombosis is based on the work of Himmelfarb and
      colleagues. In their trial aspirin appeared to increase the relative risk (RR=1.99) of graft
      thrombosis. They subsequently demonstrated that, in vitro, aspirin enhanced platelet-derived
      growth factor-induced vascular smooth muscle proliferation. Adding clopidogrel to aspirin in
      hemodialysis patients was associated with a significantly increased risk of bleeding and
      probably would not result in a reduced frequency of graft thrombosis. Although data
      concerning aspirin for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in ESRD
      patients is not sufficient its efficacy is well proven in the general population. Currently,
      it seems not ethical to perform a randomized placebo controlled trial to evaluate the
      antiplatelet protective effect in these patients. The purpose of this study is to perform a
      prospective evaluation regarding the relationship between platelets function and
      cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD.

      Methods The study will include 100-200 patients with ESRD, age 18 years or older, treated in
      the nephrology division of Assaf Harofeh medical center. Patients will be excluded if their
      platelets count will be lower then 50,000 cu/mm, if they have known hematologic malignancies,
      other solid malignancy with life expectancy of less then 1 year or if they are treated with
      Warfarin (Comadin). Patients will sign a written informed consent before their inclusion in
      the study.

      The primary end points of the study are cardiovascular events including acute myocardial
      infarction (defined as symptoms + acute elevation of TnI), need for coronary artery disease
      revascularization, or acute cerebrovascular event (TIA or CVA) and mortality. The secondary
      end points are any hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome, active bleeding with the
      need for blood transfusion and dialysis access graft thrombosis (time to thrombosis).

      At the beginning of the study, blood will be taken for complete blood count including
      platelets count and mean platelets volume, serum electrolytes, albumin, blood lipids, Kt/V,
      troponin and two 5 ml aliquots from each blood collection will be separated and stored at
      -70co until analyzed for oxidative stress, homocysteine and highly sensitive CRP will be
      performed. Five mL of blood will be sent for platelets function assessment (described below).

      The follow up period will be up to 2 years. During the follow up period, treatment with
      aspirin or clopidogrel will be given as needed and platelet function will be assessed after
      any change in the antiplatelets therapy. Patients who are being treated with aspirin, will
      continue to take the medication with no dose change unless they will have acute
      cardiovascular event or active bleeding. Patients will be treated with antihypertensive
      therapy, erythropoietin, calcium, vitamin D and other medications as needed.

      Platelet Function Tests Cone-and-Platelet Analyzer This technology has been described
      elsewhere (40). Briefly, 200 µL of citrated blood was placed in a polystyrene well and
      subjected to a shear rate of 1300 sec-1 using a rotating conical disk for 2 minutes. The well
      was washed and stained by May-Gruenwald stain. Platelet adhesion was evaluated as the
      percentage of total area covered with platelets designated as surface coverage (%) and
      aggregation as the mean size of the surface-bound aggregates designated as average size
      (µ`m2) by use of an image analysis system (Galai).

      Aspirin Response Assay 3.6µl Arachidonic Acid and 0.2ml blood will be added into a micro tube
      (2ml), (final Arachidonic Acid concentration 0.275 mM). The tube will be rotated on the tube
      mixer at 10rpm for 1 minute. 130µl will be placed in a well and tested with the cone and
      platelet analyzer.

      Clopidogrel Response Assay 5µl ADP and 0.2ml blood will be added into a micro tube (2ml)
      (final ADP concentration 1.25µM). The tube will be rotated on the tube mixer at 10rpm for 1
      minute. 130µl will be placed in a well and tested with the cone and platelet analyzer.
