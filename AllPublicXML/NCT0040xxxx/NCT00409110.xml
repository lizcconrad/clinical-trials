      This study intends to investigate the relationship between choroidal blood flow and ocular
      pulse amplitude (OPA).

    <textblock>
      One eye is randomly selected in 18 healthy subjects. OPA is assessed with Dynamic Contour
      Tonometry. Submacular choroidal blood flow is measured with Laser Doppler Flowmetry. During
      both examinations the systemic blood pressure is continuously recorded with Finometer. An
      average systolic and diastolic LDF parameter flow during 30 seconds are determined and the
      pulsatility index is calculated according to the formula (LDFsys-LDFdia)/LDFdia. An
      association of OPA with the LDF pulsatility index, systemic blood pressure values and mean
      intraocular pressure will be analysed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects should present no history of ocular diseases, of current topical
             medication, or of drug or alcohol abuse. Furthermore, a best corrected visual acuity
             above 20/25 in both eyes, lack of pathological findings upon a slit-lamp examination
             and dilated direct fundoscopy, and an IOP &lt; 21 mmHg in both eyes will be required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of chronic or recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease such as scleritis or
             uveitis.

          -  History of ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. History of infection or inflammation
             within the past 3 months.

          -  History and clinical evidence for other retinal disease such as age-related
             degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.
