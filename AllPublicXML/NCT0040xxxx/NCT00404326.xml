  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current standard for locally advanced cervical cancer is concurrent cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy, however, the treatment results need to be improved. Epigenetic aberrations play
      an important role in cancer progression by silencing growth regulatory genes and there is now
      evidence that inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDAC inhibition synergize the radiation and
      chemotherapy effects.

      Objective. To determine response rate, safety and biological effects of hydralazine and
      magnesium valproate when added to cisplatin chemoradiation.

      Hypothesis. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate associated to chemoradiation will increase
      the clinical complete response rate to 95% as compared to 75% as seen in historical controls
      treated with cisplatin chemoradiation in FIGO stage IIIB patients.

      Metodology. A total of 17 FIGO stage IIIB patients with histologically confirmed cervical
      carcinoma with no previous treatment will be included. Patients will be typed for acetylator
      status and and then receive either 182 or 83 mg of hydralazine, and magnesium valproate at
      40mg/Kg from day -7 to the end of chemoradiation (external and brachytherapy). Clinical
      response rate, safety and transcriptome changes will be analyzed.

      Eligible patients after signing informed consent will undergo study evaluation and then typed
      for acetylator phenotype before receive either 182 or 83 mg of hydralazine, and magnesium
      valproate at 30mg/Kg from day -7 to the end of chemoradiation (external and brachytherapy.
      External beam radiation will be delivered by megavoltage equipment for a dose of 50gy (2Gy
      fraction from monday to friday) concurrently with cisplatin at 40mg/m2 for six weeks. Within
      one to two weeks, intracavitary brachytherapy (low-dose rate, Cesium sources) will be
      delivered to achieve at least 85Gy to point A. A punch biopsy from the primary tumor will be
      taken at entering the study and at day 8 of hydralazine and valproate treatment (before the
      first dose of cisplatin and radiation)to assess global gene expression profiling by
      microarray analysis. Blood samples will be taken to assess global DNA methylation, histone
      deacetylase activity and plasma levels of hydralazine and valproic acid.

      Clinical response and toxicity will be assessed.
