  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of duloxetine 60 mg once
      daily to placebo on depression in elderly patients (greater than or equal to 65 years of
      age). Patients who do not respond in the first 13 weeks will be eligible for rescue using
      pre-defined criteria. Patients randomized to duloxetine 60 mg/day meeting the rescue criteria
      will be increased to 120 mg/day. Patients randomized to the placebo arm meeting the rescue
      criteria will be assigned to duloxetine 60 mg/day.

        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (severity and interference scales) (BPI) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and pain right now. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>

        <description>Numeric Rating Scales (Semantic Differential Scales) for Pain are 6 self-administered scales that assesses experience of overall pain, back pain, headache, shoulder pain, time in pain while awake, and pain interference with daily activities, during the past week. Each item is scored on a numeric 11-point semantic differential scale (0-10) from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as severe as you can imagine; or 0 = none of the time to 10 = all of the time; or 0 = no interference to 10 = unable to do any activities at all.</description>

        <description>Remission (visitwise binary outcome, yes/no) is defined as HAMD-17 Total Score ≤7 and ≤10. HAMD-17 measures depression severity. The total score can range from 0 (normal) to 52 (severe depression). The visitwise probability of patients meeting criteria for remission (either Total Score ≤7 or ≤10) was analyzed using a categorical, pseudo-likelihood-based repeated measures approach. This analysis included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline score.</description>

        <title>Probability of Response at Endpoint as Measured by ≥50% Improvement in the HAMD-17 Total Score</title>
        <description>Response (visitwise binary outcome, yes/no) is defined as ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in the HAMD-17 total score. HAMD-17 measures depression severity. The total score can range from 0 (normal) to 52 (severe depression). The visitwise probability of patients meeting criteria for response was analyzed using a categorical, pseudo-likelihood-based repeated measures approach. This analysis included the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, investigator, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline score.</description>

        <description>Remission defined as HAMD-17 Total Score ≤7 and ≤10. HAMD-17 measures depression severity. Total score ranges: 0 (normal) to 52 (severe depression). Visitwise probability of patients achieving remission was analyzed using a categorical, pseudo-likelihood-based repeated measures approach. CIRS-G evaluates 14 organ-specific categories using a rating strategy of 0=no problems; 1=current mild problem/past significant problem; 2=moderate disability/morbidity; 3=severe/constant significant disability; and 4=extremely severe/immediate treatment required/end organ failure.

        <title>Probability of Efficacy Onset as Measured by at Least 20% Sustained Reduction From Baseline in the HAMD-17 Maier Subscale at Week 3</title>
        <description>Patients are considered to have met onset (visitwise binary outcome, yes/no) criteria at a particular visit if they had at least 20% reduction from baseline in the HAMD-17 Maier subscale at that visit and at all subsequent visits in the acute phase. Maier subscale measures core symptoms of depression and scores range from 0 (normal) to 24 (severe). The visitwise probability of patients meeting onset criteria was analyzed using a categorical, pseudo-likelihood-based repeated measures approach.</description>

        <description>The cognitive assessment battery is composed of four tests: Verbal Learning (score 0-15)and Delayed Recall(score 0-15) test, SDST(Score 0-133),2DCT(score 0-40),Trail Making(Part B)(score 0-180).They are designed to challenge the patient's abilities in the following areas: verbal learning and memory; attention to visually presented material; and working memory and executive function. Composite Cognitive score(0-51)is derived from normalized individual test scores. For Trail Making Test,lower number indicates better cognition.
