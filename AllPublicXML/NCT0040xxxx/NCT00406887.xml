  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 3 confirmatory study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic
      emulsion is effective in the treatment of treatment of uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase 3 study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 0.05%
      difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion (DFBA) in patients with endogenous anterior uveitis, in
      comparison with 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate ophthalmic solution (BP).
