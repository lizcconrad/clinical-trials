    <textblock>
      Phase I/II study with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide microspheres(RETAAC)for treatment
      of diffuse diabetic macular edema unresponsive to laser photocoagulation. Study hypothesis is
      that single intravitreal injection of RETAAC is safe and efficient compared to conventional
      treatment. Fifty patients will participate in this study and will be randomized into
      treatment and observation groups. Efficacy will be evaluated by best corrected visual acuity
      and macular thickness measured by optic coherence tomography (OCT) after 12 months of
      treatment.
