  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of deep inhalation bronchoprotection in asthmatic individuals has been shown to be
      related to the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness, a hallmark of asthma. In several
      studies, asthmatic individuals with mild airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) (methacholine PC20
      &gt; 2 mg/mL) had a difference in methacholine PC20 with and without deep inhalations that
      averaged 1.8 doubling methacholine concentrations (p=0.0003). Conversely, asthmatic
      individuals with moderate to severe AHR (methacholine PC20 â‰¤ 2 mg/mL) had a non-significant
      difference in methacholine PC20 with and without deep inhalations (p=0.09). This loss of deep
      inhalation bronchoprotection is also now believed to play an important role in the
      pathogenesis of asthma. Airway inflammation is another of the key features of asthma and
      information on airway inflammation is increasingly being used in the diagnosis and treatment
      of asthma. The level of airway inflammation (as measured by fraction of exhaled nitric oxide
      and sputum eosinophilia) has also been shown to be correlated to the level of airway
      hyperresponsiveness (as measured by methacholine PC20). In addition, glucocorticoids have
      been shown to decrease airway hyperresponsiveness, further suggesting that these two
      phenomena, airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, are related. We therefore
      suggest that the degree of airway inflammation is related to the loss of deep inhalation
      bronchoprotection and expect there to be a negative correlation between the degree of deep
      inhalation bronchoprotection and airway inflammation.
