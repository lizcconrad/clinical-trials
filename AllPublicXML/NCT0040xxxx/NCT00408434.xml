        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically diagnosed advanced or metastatic malignancy that is

          -  18 years or older

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

          -  Resolution of any toxic effects of prior therapy (except alopecia) to NCI CTCAE v3.0
             grade less than or equal to 1.

          -  Adequate organ and bone marrow function.

          -  Willing to use effective contraceptive while on treatment through at least 3 months
             thereafter.

             study.

          -  Treatment with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, other TZDs, radiotherapy, minor
             surgery, or any investigational agent within 4 wks (6 wks for nitrosoureas, mitomycin
             C, immunotherapy, biological therapy, or major surgery) of study treatment start.

          -  Patients with clinically significant pleural or pericardial effusion (patients with
             minimal pleural effusion may be eligible at the Investigator's discretion).

          -  Clinically significant active infection, which requires antibiotic therapy, or
