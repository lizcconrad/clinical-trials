      Background:

      Exhaled nitric oxide and inflammatory biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate may be useful
      to diagnose and monitor childhood asthma. Their ability to indicate an asthma diagnosis, and
      to assess asthma severity and control, is largely unknown.

      Objective:

      To study 1) the ability of exhaled nitric oxide and inflammatory markers in exhaled breath
      condensate (nitrite, nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, 8-isoprostane, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis
      factor-α, interleukin-2,-4,-5,-10, acidity) to discriminate between childhood asthma and
      controls. 2) the ability of these biomarkers to indicate asthma severity and control.

      Methods:

      114 Children were included: 64 asthmatics (10.7±3.0 years, 67.2% atopic) and 50 controls
      (10.0±0.4 years). Condensate was collected using a glass condenser
