      The aim of the study is to investigate the trial models, Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC), in
      and out of season, and Park Study in season and the clinical efficacy of repeat doses of
      fluticasone propionate in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. This will be a
      single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3 phase study in 40 male or
      female subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The subjects will be randomised to receive
      either fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray or matched placebo. The study consists of
      three phases with each phase consists of 2 treatment periods. A screening visit will be
      followed by Phase 1 (Vienna Chamber Challenge out of season), Phase 2 (Park Study, in season)
      and Phase 3 (Vienna Chamber Challenge in season). There will be a follow-up visit after Phase
      1 and Phase 2 &amp; 3 will be separated by a 10 day wash-out period. A follow-up visit will be
      completed 7-14 days after the last received dose. Intranasal fluticasone propionate will be
      administered daily for 8 days in the VCC and up to 14 days in the Park Study. Primary
      assessment will consist of major symptoms complex (MSC) during a 5-hour pollen allergen
      challenge in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) following final dosing on Day 8 and following
      final dosing between Day 8 and Day 14 in the Park Study. In addition, nasal flow measured by
      anterior rhinomanometry, wet tissue weight (as a surrogate of nasal secretion) and
      categorical scores for ocular symptoms, cough, itchy throat and itchy ears will be measured
      on day 8 (VCC) or on a day between 8-14 (Park).

    <description>Phase 3 will consist of two treatment periods each lasting 8 days, with a 10 day wash-out between each treatment period.
Subjects will administer 200micrograms (μg) fluticasone propionate or fluticasone propionate matched placebo nasal spray, once daily for 8 days. Dosing will be supervised on the first and last days of each treatment period (Day 1 and Day 8).
Immediately following the last dose received on Day 8 the subject's signs and symptoms will be monitored: subjective symptom score every 15 minutes for rhinomanometry and measurement of nasal secretion every 30 minutes, and FEV1, AEs and symptoms of local irritancy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is healthy. Healthy subjects are defined as individuals who are free from
             clinically significant illness or disease as determined by their medical history
             (including family), physical examination, laboratory studies, and other tests.

          -  They have a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis

          -  Exhibit a moderate response to 1500 grass pollen grains per cubic metre after 2 hours
             in the Vienna Challenge Chamber at screening or within 12 months preceding the
             screening visit. A moderate response is defined as a total nasal symptom score of at
             least 6. (Total nasal symptom score is the sum of obstruction, rhinorrhoea, itch and
             sneeze, each of which has been scored on a scale from 0 to 3).

          -  They have a positive skin prick test (wheal size equal to or more than 4mm) for grass
             pollen at or within the 12 months preceding the screening visit.

          -  They have a positive RadioAllergoSorbent Test (RAST) (equal to or more than class 2)
             for grass pollen at or within the 12 months preceding the screening visit.

          -  They have demonstrated an ability to use the intranasal spray

          -  There are no conditions or factors which would make the subject unlikely to be able to
             stay in the chamber for 5 hours.

             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  They are available to complete all study measurements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing females.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use an
             appropriate method of contraception [i.e. implants of levonorgestrel, injectable
             progesterone, an acceptable intra-uterine device (IUD) (any IUD with a failure rate of
             less than 1% per year), oral contraceptives or any other method with a failure rate of
             &lt;1% per year] for at least two weeks prior to the first dose of study medication and
             should continue using the same contraceptive measure until the final pregnancy test
             has been performed (not less than 72 hours after treatment). Alternatively they may be
             surgically sterilised (refer to section 6.4) or remain abstinent for 2 weeks before
             exposure to study drug.

          -  On examination the subject is found to have any structural nasal abnormalities or
             nasal polyposis, a history of frequent nosebleeds, recent nasal surgery or recent
             (within 3 weeks) or ongoing upper respiratory tract infection which in the responsible
             physician's opinion renders the subject unsuitable for participation in the study

          -  The subject has any respiratory disease other than mild stable asthma that is
             controlled with occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists and associated
             with normal lung function.

          -  The subject is likely to be unable to abstain from salbutamol use for 8 hours before a
             challenge

          -  The subject has a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             responsible physician, contraindicates their participation.

          -  The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity during the
             previous 3 months or in any clinical study in the previous 2 months

          -  The subject is concurrently participating in another clinical study in which the
             subject is or will be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational drug or
             device.

          -  The subject is currently taking regular (or a course of) medication whether prescribed
             or not, including steroids, vitamins and herbal remedies (e.g. St. John's Wort).
             Paracetamol and occasional as needed use of short-acting beta agonists is permitted

          -  The subject regularly, or on average, drinks more than 3 units of alcohol per day -
             where 1 unit = ½ pint of beer (284milliliteres mL), or 1 glass of wine (125mL), or 1
             measure of spirit (25mL).

          -  The subject is at risk of non-compliance with the study procedures/restrictions.
