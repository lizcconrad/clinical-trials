  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, phase II study of the safety and efficacy of two dose
      levels of oral ATN-224 in patients with prostate cancer with a rising serum PSA in the
      absence of detectable disease. Patients will be randomized (1:1) after confirmation of
      eligibility requirements. The primary endpoint is to determine the proportion of patients who
      do not have PSA progression for 24 weeks. PSA progression is defined as at least a 50%
      increase in PSA and &gt;5 ng/mL from baseline or post-treatment nadir if lower than baseline,
      confirmed by another PSA at least 28 days later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATN-224 is an orally active, small molecule that has been shown in cellular and animal models
      to be anti-angiogenic and to have activity against prostate cancer cell lines. ATN-224 has
      the potential to affect the progression of prostate cancer by mechanisms that include both
      antiangiogenic and antitumor pathways. ATN-224 may change the time to overt metastatic
      disease in patients with rising PSA as the only manifestation of disease after treatment with
      curative intent and delay the need for hormonal therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, localized prostate cancer who have a
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (DT) as calculated according to the
             Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram
             (http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/10088.cfm)

               -  Doubling time &lt; 12 months after local therapy in patients who have not had any
                  previous hormone therapy, or

               -  Doubling time &lt; 12 months starting at least 6 months after their last dose of
                  hormone therapy

          -  Patients must have a serum testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL at the time of study entry.
             Patients may have received previous castrating hormonal therapy or anti-androgens,
             provided that the testosterone level is &gt;150 ng/dL at the time of study entry. Prior
             chemotherapy is also allowed as long as the requirements for adequate organ and marrow
             function are met.

             pelvis) scans within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of ATN-224

          -  A minimum of three PSA values, each at least 4 weeks apart, to calculate PSA-DT. The
             last PSA level prior to enrollment must be at least 2.0 ng/mL and be rising over the
             prior value.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

        first dose of ATN-224 to bring the hemoglobin level to &gt;9 g/dL to meet eligibility
        criteria.

          -  At least 28 days from receiving any investigational agent

          -  The effects of ATN-224 on sperm at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For

             contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation through the follow up visit 28

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who have had radiotherapy within 3 months prior to the first dose of ATN 224

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ATN-224 or omeprazole or other long acting antacids

             potential to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of ATN-224 treatment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
