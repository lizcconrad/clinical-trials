  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a homeopathic remedy (Cocculine®) is
      effective in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea in non metastatic breast cancer.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2-arms: Cocculine® or placebo.

      The number of patients required to demonstrate a 0.5-point reduction in nausea on a visual
      analogue scale, assuming an alpha risk of 5% in a two-sided test and 85% power, is 396 (198
      per arm). It has been estimated that the enrollment period should be 18 months.

      The proportion of women with breast cancer treated by chemotherapy (CT) is increasing.
      CT-induced nausea and vomiting negatively impact patient quality of life.

      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate against a placebo the efficacy of
      Cocculine® administered as an adjunct to conventional treatments (corticosteroids and 5-HT3
      receptor antagonists) for the management of nausea induced by a 1st course of adjuvant CT
      with FAC50, FEC100 or TAC in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary objectives are to test:

        -  the persistence of Cocculine® efficacy over the 2nd and 3rd CT courses

        -  the contribution of Cocculine® to the global management of nausea and vomiting during
           adjuvant CT

        -  patient compliance with Cocculine® dose.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 arms: Cocculine® or placebo.
