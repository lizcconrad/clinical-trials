    <textblock>
      Primary Total Knee joint replacement surgery is highly successful surgery for relieving pain
      and improving function in patients with disabling arthritis. Unfortunately, like all
      biomedical devices, prosthesis failure is a complication of knee replacement surgery that
      leads to disabling pain, stiffness and loss of function. Approximately 1% of the knee
      replacements fail every year leading to a 20% failure rate over 20 years. The common causes
      of failure of prosthetic joint are infection, loosening, trauma or wear of the prosthesis.
      Currently, a revision surgery is the best option for long term pain relief (analgesics or
      other pain medications are options but are of limited benefit). Surgery may not be feasible
      in patients due to advancing age, other medical conditions and surgical/technical
      difficulties or patient's choice. In addition, the results from revision surgery are not as
      good as the initial knee joint surgery. Therefore, there is a great need for a novel,
      targeted therapy that provides an option to patients who are unfit, unable, or unwilling to
      undergo surgery.

      In the investigators' recent pilot study, a single injection of Botulinum toxin A (Botox) in
      painful natural knee, ankle and shoulder joints of patients with various types of arthritis
      led to significant and durable improvement in pain and function and was safe to use. The
      investigators propose this 6-month study to compare pain relief, improvement of function and
      safety of an injection of Botulinum toxin compared to placebo in patients with a painful
      prosthetic knee joint. Both patients and investigators will be blinded to the treatment
      assignment to a patient until the study is completed. The investigators will assess the
      amount and duration of pain relief, improvement in function and short term safety of
      Botulinum toxin using standard validated measures. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 2
      weeks, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 6-months after a single injection of either placebo or BoNT/A in
      the hip or knee prosthesis. The six-month follow-up is to assess the duration of meaningful
      pain relief. If successful, this will offer a new treatment option for patients with a
      chronically painful knee prosthetic joint, provide more insight into the origin and cause of
      pain in prosthetic joints and direct future investigations in new directions.

      &quot;This 6-month randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial will compare a single
      intra-articular (IA) injection of 100 units of Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT/A) to placebo for
      improvement in pain, function and quality of life (QOL), and safety in patients with painful
      total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Patients will be recruited at the Minneapolis VA Medical
      Center. Patients will be eligible if they are over age 18, have TKA, have pain ≥6/10 on 0-10
      numeric rating scale (NRS) and are not candidates for revision surgery.

      The primary outcome is: (1) proportion with clinically meaningful change in pain severity (on
      0-10 scale) 2 months after IA injection. The choice of 2-month for primary end-point is based
      on previous observations from open-label case series in painful TKA. Secondary outcomes will
      be assessed at each efficacy follow-up (FU) visit. The duration of the trial is 6-months to
      capture the duration of pain relief. Based on other trials of Botulinum toxin, we expect the
      peak effect between 2-8 weeks and expect the effect to wear off between 2-4 months.
      Therefore, for all analyses except duration of pain relief, the efficacy time-points (2 wk, 4
      wk, 2 month) and possibly 3- or 4-month (depending on duration of pain relief) will be used.
      Secondary outcomes include: (1) clinically meaningful pain relief (≥2-point or ≥30% decrease)
      in pain severity (0-10 scale); (2) change in pain severity at 2 months and at all efficacy
      time-points; (3) percent with Minimal Clinically Important Improvement on Western Ontario
      MacMaster Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function sub-scales at 2 months and at all
      efficacy time-points; (4) amount and duration of pain relief; (5) patient and physician
      global assessment of response at 2 months and at all efficacy time-points; (6) QOL assessed
      by WOMAC and Short-form 36 (SF-36) scores at 2 months and at all efficacy time-points; (7)
      change in function by Timed Stands Test (TST) and Timed-up-and-go (TUG) tests at 2 months and
      at all efficacy time-points; (8) change in dose of analgesics during the study. We will
      determine time to onset of and duration of pain relief and time to improvement in function.
      Safety will be assessed by structured interview form for adverse effects, sensory and manual
      muscle strength testing, and index joint examination for swelling, erythema and tenderness.

      At visit #1, after informed consent and screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients
      will undergo: index joint X-ray, laboratory tests; history, physical examination, index joint
      pain history, comorbidity and medication history; patient pain assessments, WOMAC and SF-36;
      and blinded index joint, neurological examination, TST and TUG tests. 50 patients will be
      randomized to receive either IA BoNT/A 100 units or sterile saline in the index joint. FU
      phone interviews at 2 and 4-weeks will include pain assessments, WOMAC, patients' global
      assessment and adverse effects. Interim visits at 2, 3 and 4-months will be identical to
      visit #1, but will also include patients' and physicians' global assessment and there will be
      no joint injection. End of study visit at 6 months will be identical to interim visits with
      the addition of index joint X-ray and laboratory tests.

      Main analyses will include patients with unilateral TKAs. Sensitivity analyses will be done
      by including patients with bilateral knees, accounting for correlatedness of observations.
      Multiple analysis of variance, mixed model regression analyses and/or generalized estimating
      equations will be used for analysis of continuous and categorical outcomes respectively.
      Chi-square tests will be used to compare frequency of adverse events. Analysis will be
      intention-to-treat.
