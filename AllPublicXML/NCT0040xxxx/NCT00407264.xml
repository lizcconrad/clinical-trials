    <textblock>
      Bronchial epithelium exposed to cigarette smoke undergoes a series of histological changes
      that may ultimately lead to invasive cancer. In rats exposed to cigarette smoke inhaled
      corticosteroids reduce the number of lung tumors. The purpose of this study is to assess the
      efficacy of fluticasone on premalignant lesions in volunteers with a smoking history of &gt;10
      pack-years and patients cured of head and neck cancer or lung cancer. Participants are
      screened for premalignant lesions by bronchoscopy and if these are present randomised to
      receive a powder inhalation device containing either fluticasone 500 Î¼g or a placebo. After 6
      months, biopsies are taken from the same locations. Efficacy of treatment is assessed by
      reversal of metaplasia/dysplasia; secondary end-points are reversal of increased p53
      immunoreactivity and hTERT expression.
