  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between
      interferon-gamma levels and the incidence of viral respiratory infections in allergic
      children treated with allergy immunotherapy as compared to those treated with standard
      medical care (nasal steroids, antihistamines) over a 1-year period. The hypotheses to be
      tested are 1) interferon-gamma levels will be significantly increased 3, 6, 9 and 12 months
      in allergic children treated with allergy immunotherapy as compared to those treated with
      standard medical care, 2) the incidence of viral respiratory infections will be reduced at 3,
      6, 9 and 12 months in allergic children treated with allergy immunotherapy as compared to
      those treated with standard medical care.

      This study will consist of five visits. Visit 1 will occur after subjects complete an initial
      clinical evaluation for allergy at this site. Subjects will select their treatment (allergy
      immunotherapy as compared to standard medical care) prior to enrollment in this study.

      Visit 1 will include informed consent, review of inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      phlebotomy for the determination of serum interferon-gamma levels. At the end of this visit,
      diary cards to capture the frequency of symptoms of viral respiratory infections will be
      distributed. Visits 2-5 will occur 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after visit 1 and will include
      review/exchange of diary cards, and phlebotomy for determination of serial serum
      interferon-gamma levels.
