  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of Rimonabant 20mg in comparison to
      placebo, on HDL and VLDL lipoprotein kinetics, over a 12 months period.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To assess effect of Rimonabant on HDL ApoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess effect of Rimonabant on HDL ApoA-I production rate (PR) and on other
           lipoprotein kinetics.

        -  To assess effect of Rimonabant on lipids, glycemic and inflammatory parameters

        -  To assess effect of Rimonabant on body composition

        -  To assess safety of Rimonabant
