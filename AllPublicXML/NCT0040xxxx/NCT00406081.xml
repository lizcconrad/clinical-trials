  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) causes people to be susceptible to skin infection and inflammations.
      The purpose of this study is to determine the immune response to chicken pox vaccine in
      children with or without AD who received the vaccine 2 to 16 weeks prior to the study visit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin infections.
      Children with AD given the smallpox vaccine could develop a life-threatening condition known
      as eczema vaccinatum. This immune response is not currently understood. The purpose of this
      study is to understand the immune response to a viral vaccine in children with AD. This will
      be accomplished by studying immune response to the chicken pox vaccine in children with AD in
      comparison to those without AD.

      This study will consist of one study visit occurring about 2 to 16 weeks after the child
      received the chicken pox vaccination. During this visit, physical and skin exams will occur.
      Personal and family medical histories and blood collection will also occur. The chicken pox
      vaccine will not be given as a part of this study. Subjects will receive the results of
      radioallergosorbent (RAST) testing that will tell if they are allergic to some common items
      (e.g., mold, grass).
