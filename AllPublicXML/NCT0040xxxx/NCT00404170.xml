    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the utility of dopamine transporter imaging in
      monitoring and predicting the progression of Parkinson disease. This study will be performed
      in the PRECEPT cohort, an already existing cohort of 806 subjects recruited to participate in
      the study called, A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Finding Study to
      Assess the Efficacy and Safety of CEP-1347 in Patients With Early Parkinson's Disease -
      (PRECEPT), sponsored by Cephalon and Lundbeck and coordinated by the Parkinson Study Group.
      The imaging data from this long-term PRECEPT follow-up study will allow us to evaluate the
      long-term progression of DAT loss in PD, the long-term follow-up of SWEDD subjects, the
      relationship between long-term clinical and imaging PD outcomes, and the relationship between
      long-term imaging outcomes and genetic and biochemical biomarkers of PD progression.

    <textblock>
      The 800 early PD subjects in this study have already been evaluated clinically and have
      undergone longitudinal dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging with [123I] ß-CIT (baseline and 22
      months). In Follow-up imaging will be performed at 24-month intervals (46 and 70 months
      following PRECEPT baseline). All scanning procedures will be performed at the Institute for
      Neurodegenerative Disorders (IND) using methods previously employed in the PRECEPT study.

      Subjects willing to participate will travel to New Haven for their 46-month imaging visit. At
      IND a study coordinator and a neurologist will evaluate all subjects. The coordinator and
      neurologist will discuss the study procedures and evaluate the patient for eligibility.
      Written informed consent for the study will be obtained prior to performing any study-related
      procedures.

      If eligible, participants will be injected with ß-CIT and 24 hours later an imaging procedure
      will be used to obtain pictures of brain activity using single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT). This 2-day procedure will be repeated at 70 months (following PRECEPT
      baseline).
