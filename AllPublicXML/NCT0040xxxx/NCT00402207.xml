  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Chronic inflammation in peripheral airways plays an important role in the
      pathophysiology of asthma. Extrafine hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) beclometasone is distinguished
      from other ICS because of its fine aerosol characteristics. As a result, there is a greater
      extent of deposition of extrafine HFA-beclometasone in the peripheral airways. Therefore,
      extrafine HFA-beclometasone may have an extra anti-inflammatory effect in children with
      asthma.

      Aim To analyse the potential extra anti-inflammatory effect of extrafine HFA-beclometasone
      compared to HFA-flucticasone in children with asthma by means of alveolar nitric oxide (NO)
      concentration and bronchial NO flux, inflammatory markers in exhaled breath condensate (EBC),
      and conventional parameters.

      Method In a cross-over study design of 6 months, 33 children, aged 6-12 years, with doctor
      diagnosed mild persistent asthma, were treated with extrafine HFA-beclometasone inhaled from
      an autohaler and HFA-flucticasone inhaled from a discus. Primary outcome parameters of this
      study were; alveolar NO concentration and bronchial NO flux. Secondary outcome parameters
      were inflammatory markers in EBC, lung function parameters, symptoms, presence and duration
      of exacerbations and adverse effects. All parameters were recorded at baseline and after each
      treatment period.
