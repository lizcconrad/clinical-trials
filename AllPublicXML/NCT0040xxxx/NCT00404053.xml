  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of its safety profile and the results of clinical trials, clopidogrel has become the
      standard treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and drug eluting
      stent(DES) implantation. Two large studies in patients with ACS shown that pretreatment with
      clopidogrel had beneficial effects. The pretreatment regimens were given a mean of 6 days
      before intervention in the observational PCI-CURE trial and 3 to 24 h in the randomized CREDO
      trial respectively. Accordingly, current clinical practice carries out pretreatment with a
      300mg loading dose of clopidogrel at least 6 h before DES implantation procedure in patients
      with ACS. Compared with the 300mg clopidogrel loading dose, 600mg loading dose exhibited a
      superior antiplatelet effect and improved short-term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing
      DES implantation for ACS according to recent a few publications. But despite clopidogrel
      600mg loading dose and the routine use of 75mg per day as a maintaining dose, recurrent
      ischemic events occurred in some patients. Therefore, the goal of this study will evaluate
      the efficacy of a 600mg loading dose of clopidogrel plus 150mg per day as a maintaining dose
      in patients with ACS undergoing DES implantation.

      ACS patients undergoing DES implantation who receive planned 600mg loading dose clopidogrel
      pretreatment are eligible for the study. All enrolled patients will be randomized to receive
      daily clopidogrel 75 mg or 150mg as maintaining doses starting as soon as post-PCI, in
      addition to daily aspirin 100 mg, and lasted for the first month after DES implantation. One
      month later, all patients receive daily clopidogrel 75mg until 9~12month after DES
      implantation. The primary endpoints include death of all causes, myocardial infarction,
      revascularization of the target lesson, sub-acute and late stent thrombosis one year after
      PCI, The secondary endpoints are major and minor bleeding events. The study will be powered
      to test the hypothesis that higher maintaining dose(150mg) of clopidogrel will reduce major
      adverse cardiac events compared to currently used common dose(75 mg) at one year following
      PCI.
