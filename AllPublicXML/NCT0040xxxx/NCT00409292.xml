  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate if RAD001 is an effective treatment for
      pancreatic cancer that has spread and not responded to treatment. Experiments have shown that
      RAD001 can prevent cells from multiplying. RAD002 has also been tested in laboratory
      experiments imitating cancer conditions and the results have been promising.

      -  Participants taking part in this research study will be given a study medication-dosing
           calendar for each treatment cycle. Each cycle lasts four weeks during which you will be
           taking the study drug, RAD001, orally every day.

        -  Participants will come into the clinic every other week during the time of enrollment.
           At each clinic visit blood work will be taken to monitor the participants health and a
           physical exam will be performed. CT scans will be repeated every 2 months to assess the
           tumor.

        -  Participants will remain on the study as long as they continue to benefit from the study
           medication.

    <measure>To Assess Progression-free Survival of RAD001 at Two Months in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Whose Disease Has Progressed on Gemcitabine Chemotherapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>two months</time_frame>
    <description>The Outcome Measure is reporting the number of participants experiencing Progression-free Survival at 2 months after treatment.
The study was designed with a primary end point of progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from study entry to documentation of progressive disease or death from any cause. On the basis of prior studies of second-line treatment in metastatic pancreatic cancer, we estimated that such treatment has been associated with a median PFS of 2 months. Our study design used a one-stage design with a target accrual of 35 eligible patients, with the assumption that an improvement in PFS at 2 months from 50% to 71% would warrant further study in this patient population.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objectives of the study were to assess tumor response rate and overall survival. Patients were required to have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST, for target lesions assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR) is Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) equals CR + PR.</description>

        <description>The secondary objectives of the study were to assess tumor response rate and overall survival. Patients were required to have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Per RECIST, for target lesions assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR) is Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) equals CR + PR.</description>
        <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
        <population>Of the 33 patients enrolled, 29 reached restaging. Three patients who did not reach restaging were removed from study because of withdrawal of consent. One patient was removed from study after 8 days of treatment because of worsening of a preexisting perirectal fistula, requiring surgical intervention.</population>
