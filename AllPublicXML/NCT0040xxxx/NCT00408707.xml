  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether local infiltration analgesia (LIA) with
      Ropivacaine and adrenaline is effective in the treatment of postoperative pain after total
      knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasingly common in the treatment of osteoarthrosis.
      Despite aggressive analgesic regimes, TKA is associated with moderate to severe postoperative
      pain, delaying mobilization and hospital discharge. A relatively new method for controlling
      postoperative pain after TKA is local infiltration analgesia (LIA) which consists of local
      infiltration with Ropivacaine and adrenaline.3 studies haved showed promising results of LIA,
      but none have documented a superior analgesic effect versus placebo.Patients receiving
      bilateral knee arthroplasty are recruited to receive LIA and placebo infiltration.The aim of
      the study is to demonstrate an analgesic effect of LIA versus placebo.
