      This is an open-label, Phase I study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in subjects
      with unresolving CSC and subfoveal fluid. Patients will be evaluated at baseline with
      ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and color
      photography. Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab
      administered every 28 days (± 2 days) for 3 injections. Thereafter they are to be evaluated
      every month until month 12. Treatment will be administered to patients if there is presence
      of active leakage as determined by fluorescein angiography or persistence presence of sub
      retinal fluid upon OCT examination at that monthly visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of persistent central serous chorioretinopathy present for at least 3 months
             Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 (73 letters on the ETDRS chart) to light
             perception as measured by ETDRS protocol refraction.

          -  No signs of choroidal neovascularization

          -  Documented subfoveal fluid by OCT

          -  Active leak associated with the subfoveal fluid

          -  The ability and willingness to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with laser or PDT

             daily for 14 or more consecutive days at any time within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Previously vitrectomized eyes.

          -  Had allergic reactions to fluorescein dye or lack of venous access.

          -  Any other additional ocular diseases which could irreversibly compromise the visual
             acuity of the study eye including amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
             (AION), age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal detachment, severe cataracts,
             etc.

          -  An anticipated need for ocular surgery during the duration of the trial.

          -  Within 1 month prior to screening, have had intra ocular surgeries (including cataract
             surgery) in the study eye.

          -  Intravitreal triamcinolone or bevacizumab in the previous 2 months

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma (IOP &gt; 24 mmHg) on greater than 3 medications.

          -  Within 1 month prior to screening had YAG laser capsulotomy in the study eye

          -  Have received any other systemic experimental drug within 12 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Rubeosis iridis or neovascular glaucoma

          -  Any untreated rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

          -  A visual acuity of worse than 20/400 in the fellow eye.

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow or comply with all study related procedures.
