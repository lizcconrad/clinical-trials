  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare dose-response effect of three dose levels of
      strontium malonate to placebo on bone resorption quantified by S-CTX-1 following 12 weeks of
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      275 post menopausal women are treated with either 750 mg strontium malonate, 1000 mg
      strontium malonate, 2000 mg strontium malonate, 2 g ProtelosÂ® or placebo.

      Patients are treated for 12 weeks. A follow up period of 4 weeks is planned for the main
      study and a follow up period of 8 weeks is planned for approximately 20% of the patients to
      follow post treatment CTX-1 activity.

      Apart from S-CTS-1 also response on other bio markers are evaluated as well as BMD.
