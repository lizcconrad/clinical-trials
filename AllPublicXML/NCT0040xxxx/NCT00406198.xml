  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) on sepsis-induced multiple organ
      failure severity is controversial. We thus sought to assess the effect of early application
      of haemofiltration on the degree of organ dysfunction and plasma cytokine levels in patients
      with severe sepsis or septic shock.

    <textblock>
      prospective, randomized, open, multicentre study was performed between 1997 and 1999 in 16
      French intensive care units. Patients were enrolled within 24 hours of development of the
      first organ failure related to a new septic insult. They were randomized to group 1 (HF), who
      received haemofiltration for a 96 hr period, or group 2 (C) who were managed conventionally.
      The primary end-point was the number, severity and duration of organ failures at 14 days, as
      evaluated by the SOFA score, on an intention-to-treat analysis. Strict guidelines were
      provided to perform continuous haemofiltration under the same conditions and objectives in
      all centres.
