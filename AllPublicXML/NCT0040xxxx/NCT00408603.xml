  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate, safety and identify
      potential biomarkers in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients treated with voreloxin
      injection given on a 28-day cycle.

      Other objectives of this study are to evaluate Progression-free survival and measure CA-125
      response rate.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (CR+PR) Per Investigator Assessment Based on GOG-RECIST Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>GOG-RECIST assessment obtained on cycle2, 4 and 6 Day 21for patients treated with 48 mg/m2 SNS-595 and Day 28 for patients treated with 60 mg/m2, through 28 (±14) days afte the last treatment at the end of safety follow up period</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was calculated per investigator's tumor assessment based on GOG-RECIST, which includes radiographic imaging, physical examination results, and CA-125 levels. No independent review of CT scans (lesion assessments) was performed. CR: disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Normalization of CA125, if elevated at baseline, is required for ovarian carcinoma studies. PR is &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of LD of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Kaplan-Meier Methods</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first teratment of Vosaroxin to the end of Cycle 6 or 28 days after the last treatment at the end of safety follow up period if continued in the extended treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is the the time between the date the patient first received Vosaroxin and the earliest date of disease progression.
For patients who experienced disease progression, the date of disease progression will be the earliest date on which disease progression is indicated based on the rules.
For patients who died with no indication of disease progression, the date of death will be the earliest date on which death is documented based on the rules.
For patients who have no indication of disease progression or death, the censoring date will be the Date of Confirmed Contact from the last Survival Follow-Up CRF, or if not in survival follow-up, then the Assessment Date from the last GOG-RECIST CRF, or if no response assessment available, Date of Last Visit / Contact from Extended Treatment Completion CRF if in extended treatment, or from Cycle 6 Completion / Early Termination CRF if not in extended treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented epithelial ovarian cancer, primary
             peritoneal carcinoma, or fallopian tube cancer

          -  Completed at least one Platinum Based Therapy (PBT) regimen (carboplatin, cisplatin,
             or another organoplatinum compound).

          -  Evidence of platinum-resistant disease, relapse/progression within 6 months of the
             completion of PBT, or intolerant to PBT (inability to receive PBT due to
             hypersensitivity reactions to platinum)

          -  Patients with primary platinum-resistant disease are allowed to receive no more than
             one nonplatinum cytotoxic regimen and no more than one noncytotoxic regimen for the
             management of recurrent or persistent disease after the development of primary
             platinum-resistance.

          -  Measurable disease per GOG-RECIST criteria

          -  GOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal, cytokine, or targeted therapy, within 3
             weeks (nitrosurea or mitomycin C within 6 weeks) prior to the anticipated first day of
             treatment.

          -  Monoclonal antibody therapy within 4 weeks prior to clinical study entry

          -  Unresolved or impending bowel obstruction

          -  Other active malignancies or other malignancies within the last 12 months except
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia

          -  Prior radiotherapy to more than 25% of the marrow space

          -  Requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis

          -  Myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident/transient ischemic attack within the
             6 months prior to the anticipated first day of treatment

          -  Thromboembolic event (deep vein thrombosis [DVT] or pulmonary embolus [PE]) within 28
             days prior to the anticipated first day of treatment

          -  History of active CNS metastases

          -  Any other medical, psychological, or social condition that would contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety or compliance with
             clinical study procedures.

        Please note: There are additional inclusion/exclusion criteria for this study. Please

        <title>Overall Response Rate (CR+PR) Per Investigator Assessment Based on GOG-RECIST Criteria</title>
        <description>Response rate was calculated per investigator's tumor assessment based on GOG-RECIST, which includes radiographic imaging, physical examination results, and CA-125 levels. No independent review of CT scans (lesion assessments) was performed. CR: disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Normalization of CA125, if elevated at baseline, is required for ovarian carcinoma studies. PR is &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of LD of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required.</description>

        <description>PFS is the the time between the date the patient first received Vosaroxin and the earliest date of disease progression.
For patients who experienced disease progression, the date of disease progression will be the earliest date on which disease progression is indicated based on the rules.
For patients who died with no indication of disease progression, the date of death will be the earliest date on which death is documented based on the rules.
For patients who have no indication of disease progression or death, the censoring date will be the Date of Confirmed Contact from the last Survival Follow-Up CRF, or if not in survival follow-up, then the Assessment Date from the last GOG-RECIST CRF, or if no response assessment available, Date of Last Visit / Contact from Extended Treatment Completion CRF if in extended treatment, or from Cycle 6 Completion / Early Termination CRF if not in extended treatment.</description>
