  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with carboplatin and gemcitabine
      combined with bevacizumab every two weeks will provide increased survival.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with Carboplatin and gemcitabine is one of the most active combination therapies
      used for first-line therapy of NSCLC. The optimum schedule for administration of carboplatin
      and gemcitabine is currently unknown.

      The addition of bevacizumab to another comparable platinum combination showed an overall
      survival advantage and a significantly greater response rate and progression-free survival.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung
             cancer (NSCLC) EXCEPT squamous cell carcinoma or predominantly squamous. Mixed tumors
             will be categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are
             present in which case the patient is ineligible. (Sputum cytology alone is not
             acceptable)

          -  Must have disease that is not curative by standard methods.

          -  Prior adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biological therapy is allowed,
             except for prior use of bevacizumab. If gemcitabine was used, more than six months
             must have elapsed between completion of adjuvant therapy and disease progression.
             Patient must be at least 14 days from previous systemic therapy (at least 30 days for
             investigational agents) and have recovered from the acute toxic effects of the
             treatment as determined by the treating physician prior to study registration. Prior
             therapy other than adjuvant therapy is not allowed.

          -  Prior radiation therapy must be completed at least 14 days of study registration and
             subjects must fully recover from acute toxicities as determined by the treating
             physician. Prior radiation to &gt; 25% of bone marrow is not allowed. Prior radiation
             therapy to the whole pelvis is not allowed.

          -  Disease status must be measurable or non-measurable as defined by Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

          -  Age 18 years or greater

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days of study registration including the following:

               -  Adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L,

                  3.0 × ULN (ALP, AST, and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor
                  involvement)

               -  Renal: Adequate renal function as evidenced by creatinine clearance of &gt;
                  50ml/min, estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation or urine dipstick for
                  proteinuria &lt; 2+ (patients discovered to have ≥2+ proteinuria on dipstick
                  urinalysis at baseline should undergo a 24 hour urine collection and must
                  demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible)

               -  Coagulation: INR &lt; 1.5, PTT &lt; the upper limits of normal (ULN) unless stable on

             study and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intrathoracic lung carcinoma of squamous cell histology. Mixed tumors will be
             categorized by the predominant cell type unless small cell elements are present, in
             which case the patient is ineligible; sputum cytology alone is acceptable for
             inclusion. Subjects with extrathoracic-only squamous cell NSCLC are eligible. Subjects
             with only peripheral lung lesions of any NSCLC histology will also be eligible. A
             peripheral lesion is defined as a lesion in which the epicenter of the tumor is &lt; 2 cm
             from the costal or diaphragmatic pleura in a three-dimensional orientation based on
             each lobe of the lung and is &gt; 2 cm from the trachea, main and lobar bronchi.

             radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as deemed
             appropriate by the treating physician. Subjects with CNS metastases treated by
             radiotherapy within 28 days of Day 1 will be excluded. Subjects treated by
