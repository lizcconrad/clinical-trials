  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities measured in circulating
      lymphocytes in treatment-naive children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      treated for 3 months with either extended release methylphenidate or behavioral therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the administration of extended-release methylphenidate in
      treatment-na√Øve children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects the
      frequency of chromosomal abnormalities.

    <measure>The Number of Chromosomal Aberrations Per 100 Cells Excluding Gaps at Baseline and at the End of Treatment i.e Day 84 (Week 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of chromosomal aberrations per 100 cells excluding gaps at Baseline (n=33, n=32) and at Week 12 (n=33, n=32) was counted in blood samples cultured for 48 hours using a standard protocol. The types of abnormalities included translocations (reciprocal and non-reciprocal), insertions, dicentrics, fragments, inversions, chromatid exchanges (quadriradials and triradials), breaks, and other unusual observations, eg, aneuploidy, tetraploidy or endoreduplication.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and at end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of micronuclei per 1000 binucleated cells was measured at Baseline ( n=34 , n=29 ) and at the end of treatment, Week 12 (n =34, n= 29), in blood cultured for 48 hours using a standard protocol.</description>

    <measure>Number of Sister Chromatoid Exchanges Per Cell</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and at end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood collected at baseline (n=20, n=14) and at the end of treatment, Week 12, (n= 20, n= 14) was cultured for 48 hours using a standard protocol. Giemsa staining and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) chromosome painting was done on the cells in metaphase and the number of chromatoid exchanges per cell was recorded by blinded raters.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment (Week 12) on the Conners' ADHD/DSM-IV Scale for Parents (CADS-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Parents completed the Conners' ADHD/DSM-IV Scale for Parents (CADS-P) consisting of the ADHD Index (12 items) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)( 18 items). Parents rated their child's behavior of the previous week from a list of common problems. When asked &quot;How much of a problem has this been in the last week?&quot; parents selected 0 = none, not at all, seldom, or very infrequently; 3 = very much true, or it occurs very often or frequently; or 1 or 2 for ratings in between. A score of 50 is considered normal and more than 70 markedly atypical.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Treatment (Week 12) on the Global Improvement Rating of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-I) is a clinician-rated instrument designed to assess the overall change of illness relative to baseline. The CGI-I consists of 7 ratings as follows: 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. CGI-I assessments are relative to the patient's status at the Baseline visit.</description>

    <time_frame>From baseline to the end of treatment (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-S) is a clinician-rated instrument designed to assess the severity of illness. The CGI-S rating indicates illness severity at each time-point on a scale as follows: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = extremely ill. CGI-S assessments are relative to the patient's status at the Baseline visit.</description>

        <title>The Number of Chromosomal Aberrations Per 100 Cells Excluding Gaps at Baseline and at the End of Treatment i.e Day 84 (Week 12)</title>
        <description>The number of chromosomal aberrations per 100 cells excluding gaps at Baseline (n=33, n=32) and at Week 12 (n=33, n=32) was counted in blood samples cultured for 48 hours using a standard protocol. The types of abnormalities included translocations (reciprocal and non-reciprocal), insertions, dicentrics, fragments, inversions, chromatid exchanges (quadriradials and triradials), breaks, and other unusual observations, eg, aneuploidy, tetraploidy or endoreduplication.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to the End of Treatment (Week 12) on the Severity of Illness Rating of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI-S)</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI-S) is a clinician-rated instrument designed to assess the severity of illness. The CGI-S rating indicates illness severity at each time-point on a scale as follows: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = extremely ill. CGI-S assessments are relative to the patient‚Äôs status at the Baseline visit.</description>
