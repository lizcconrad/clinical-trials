  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progression of nuclear sclerotic cataract after pars plana vitrectomy has been recognized for
      many years The mechanism for the rapid progression of nuclear sclerotic cataract remains
      unclear. The objective of this trial is to evaluate and compare the level and progression of
      cataract advancement in controls versus eyes that have undergone 20-gauge pars plana
      vitrectomy and 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 105 patients will be recruited to obtain 35 control eyes that have not had pars
      plana vitrectomy and 35 eyes who will have undergone 20-gauge pars plana vitrectomy and 35
      eyes will have undergone 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy. Scheimpflug crystalline lens
      photographs will be taken for evaluation of level and progression of cataract development.
