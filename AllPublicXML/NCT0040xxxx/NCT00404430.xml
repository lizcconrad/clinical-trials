  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the predictive factors of the endothelial
      function to the waning of an acute exacerbation in COPD. It will act to do a multivariate
      analysis to determine the respective weight of the parameters of the systemic inflammation,
      of the oxidative stress of the functional respiratory parameters and then functional
      respiratory parameters.

      In exacerbated Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, there is augmentation
      of hypoxia and the obstructive ventilatory disorders is more important. This is correlated
      with an increase in C-reactive Protein (CRP) and of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative
      stress. It has been demonstrated that there is an endothelial dysfunction in answer to
      hypoxia. Since the exacerbated COPD patients are hypoxic in most cases , we suppose they have
      an endothelial dysfunction during exacerbation. So we think we will find an augmentation of
      vascular resistances ,shown by a peripheral arterial tone too high. And this, certainly, play
      a part in physiopathology of the COPD exacerbation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We want to judge the improvement of the endothelial function remotely to the acute
      exacerbation (6 weeks). And then we would like to correlate this improvement with the
      variations of oxidative stress, muscle strength, respiratory function and systemic
      inflammation.

      We also would like to find a relation between the new hospitalizations for respiratory
      exacerbation and the initial value of endothelial function.

      Then we would like to evaluate the relationship between the cardiovascular risk and the COPD
      severity.
