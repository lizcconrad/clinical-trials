  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cathelicidins are small proteins in the human body that protect against infection. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if the amount of cathelicidins and other small proteins
      found in saliva can predict the amount of these in the skin of people who have acute atopic
      dermatitis (AD) or psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with AD or psoriasis are very sensitive to skin infections and inflammations. A group
      of small proteins known as cathelicidins are known to be responsible for immune defense
      against such infections. People with AD or psoriasis seem to be missing these proteins from
      their skin. The purpose of this study is to determine if the amount of cathelicidins and
      other small proteins in saliva is a predictor for the amount found in the skin.

      This is a single visit observational study. People with AD or psoriasis, as well as healthy
      participants, are being recruited for this study. Participants will provide a detailed
      medical history and undergo a physical examination. In addition, saliva and blood collection,
      and skin punch biopsies will be performed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of typical AD for at least 6 months as defined by ADVN standardized
             diagnostic criteria OR diagnosis of typical plaque psoriasis for at least 6 months

          -  ADEH participants as defined by ADVN standardized diagnostic criteria

          -  Healthy participants with no personal or family history of food allergy, AD, asthma,
             or allergic rhinitis

          -  Persons residing in the US

        Exclusion Criteria for All Participants:

          -  Under 18 or over 70 years of age

          -  Presence of allergic hypersensitivity without stringent AD features, allowing only a
             presumptive diagnosis of AD

          -  Presence of AD or psoriasis in which temporarily stopping current medications would
             cause worsening of the disease (Participants with active ADEH will be allowed to
