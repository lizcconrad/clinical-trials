    <textblock>
      Twenty two first year optometry students were evaluated towards the end of their first
      academic year on a battery of Oculomotor and Survey tests. This occurred during two sessions,
      one Low Stress session and one High Stress session. Sessions were separated by one month.

      Low Stress Session (LS), No Exams or Minor Exams High Stress Session (HS), Final Exam
      Preparation week

      Battery of Surveys:

      Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale for College Students (AMAS-C):

      36 items which probe 4 types of anxiety

        -  Worry/Oversensitivity

        -  Test Anxiety

        -  Physiological Anxiety (Somatic responses to anxiety)

        -  Social Concerns

      Self Perception Profile (SPP):

      45 items which probe 9 domains

        -  Scholastic Competence

        -  Social Acceptance

        -  Athletic Competence

        -  Physical Appearance

        -  Job Competence

        -  Romantic Appeal

        -  Behavioral Conduct

        -  Global Self-worth

      CI Symptom Survey (CISS-15):

      15 items which probe ocular and aesthenopic signs and symptoms

      Students also reported Hours of daily near work (NWhrs).

      Battery of Oculomotor Tests:

      (20/30 ETDRS target used for all) Vergence Tests

        -  Phorias Near and Far (Neutralized Alternate Cover Test)

        -  Vergence Ranges Near and Far (Prism Bar)

        -  Vergence Facility Near and Far (3BI/12BO)

        -  Near Point of Convergence

      Objective Accommodative Tests (SRW-5000autorefractor)

      Monocular Accommodative Responses to:

        -  Near Target (33cm)

        -  Minus Lens (-3D) while viewing distant (6m) target

      Subjective Accommodative Tests:

      Monocular Accommodative Responses to:

        -  Donderâ€™s Push Up Amplitude test

        -  Near Accommodative Facility (+/-2.00, five practice trials)

        -  Distant Accommodative Facility (plano/-2.00, five practice trials)
