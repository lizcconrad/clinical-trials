      The purpose of this study is to test the specific humoral response after an intramuscular and
      intradermal influenza vaccination in lung transplant recipients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza virus is an important cause of morbidity in the lung transplant population and can
      lead to viral and bacterial pneumonia and contribute to the bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome. Although the annual influenza vaccine is recommended for lung transplant patients,
      studies have shown that a single intramuscular (i.m.) dose has poor immunogenicity. There are
      no studies that define the effect of intradermal doses in this population. We plan to study
      the immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of influenza vaccine in 50 lung transplant patients
      during the 2006-2007 season. After the initial i.m. injection, a second dose will be given
      intradermally 4 weeks later. Antibody titers will be evaluated by a standard hemagglutination
      inhibition assay. We hypothesize that the second dose intradermally will significantly
      increase the proportion of vaccine responders.
