  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our previous research, we have shown that women that have breast cancer have a population
      of lymphocytes that recognizes specific antigen and there cytoplasmic matrix goes through
      physical change a short time after exposure in vitro to the same antigen. This change can be
      measured by polarization changes of fluorescent light emitted by FDA (fluorescein diacetate)
      labeled cells. Further test that we performed showed that those differences are also shown in
      a benign situation that known as indicator for a high risk for developing breast cancer
      within 10-15 years. The incidence of the expression of these lymphocytes correlates with the
      histopathological picture as it is related in high risk for the developing the disease.

      In this work we will expand the scope of the procedure to early detection of the cancerous
      process in breast lesions by Fitzgibbon's risk categories for the development invasive
      carcinoma of the breast. In the proposed work we intend to use specific antigen MUC1 for
      breast cancer. This study is a continuation of our published work in the &quot;The Breast &quot;

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Women carrying benign breast lesions will be further divided and analyzed according to the
        Fitzgibbon's risk categories for invasive cancer risk (4). The Fitzgibbon's categories are:

          1. No increased risk group including adenosis (other than sclerotic), duct ectasia
             fibroadenoma without complex features,

          2. slightly increased risk group (1.5-20 times) which includes fibroadenoma with complex
             features, moderate or florid hyperplasia without atypia, sclerosing adenosis,

          3. moderately increased risk group (4.0-5.0 times) includes atypical ductal and lobular
             hyperplasia and

          4. markedly increased risk group (8.0-10.0 times) which includes ductal and lobular
             carcinomas In Situ Following the blood collection, detailed relevant clinical
             information of the patient will be registered in a case record form.

        The data will include: age, country of birth, last menstrual period, lactation, number of
        children, age at first full-term pregnancy, age at onset of menopause, family history,
        medication, mammography findings, FNA results, tumor size, histological findings, biopsies,
        disease staging, and other relevant clinical information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. pregnancy,

          2. experiencing menstruation, or

          3. under hormonal or drug treatment.
