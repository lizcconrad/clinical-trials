      Eight hundred employees of an urban tertiary care hospital, 200 each from the following four
      categories: professional staff, resident physicians, registered nurses, and licensed
      practical nurses comprised the study group. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive: 1) no
      intervention, 2) a reminder letter for flu vaccine, 3) a raffle ticket to win a free
      Caribbean vacation with flu vaccine administration, or 4) both the reminder letter and raffle
      ticket. We compared the proportion of employees receiving vaccination and participating in
      the raffle across groups.
