  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of AMT2003 in cancer patients
      with advanced colorectal carcinoma.

      The primary endpoint is progression free survival rate at 18 weeks after registration

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma that is refractory to
      standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy exists. Eligible patients must
      have had at least second-line chemotherapy.
