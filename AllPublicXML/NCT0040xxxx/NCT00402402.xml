  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to estimate the usefulness of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test for
      the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in liver transplant candidates by correlating
      the test results with risk factors for LTBI

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant
      recipients. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) is recommended for screening of latent
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in all candidates for liver transplantation, the performance of
      the TST in this setting is less than optimal, due to a lack of specificity and a lack of
      sensitivity in a population that is relatively immunocompromised. Recently, a new test named
      QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) has been approved for the diagnosis of LTBI. QFT-G is expected to
      be more specific than TST. However, there are no studies defining the performance of QFT-G in
      a population of patients on a waiting list for liver transplantation. We plan to estimate the
      usefulness of the QFT-G test for the diagnosis of LTBI in a cohort of patients with end-stage
      liver disease. We hypothesize that the QFT-G test will correlate better with the risk of
      LTBI.
