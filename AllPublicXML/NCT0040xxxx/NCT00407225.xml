  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion is
      effective in the treatment of postoperative inflammation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of 0.002% and 0.05% difluprednate
      ophthalmic emulsions in patients with postoperative inflammation after cataract surgery
      (implantation of intraocular lens). In addition, the evaluation system for a future
      dose-finding phase III study of difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion will be established.
