      The investigators are hoping to identify early heart failure in patients who do not have
      symptoms as yet and at the same time assess the usefulness of Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
      in doing this.

      Measuring Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP)and can give us
      useful information about a persons heart function in patients with symptoms such as shortness
      of breath. This is because BNP/NT-proBNP levels rise when the heart is under pressure as it
      is in people with heart disease. However, we don't know if this is a useful test to do in
      people who are at a high risk of developing heart disease but who have no symptoms and have
      not been diagnosed with any heart problems.

      In this study we hope to recruit 3500 participants. This study is being run in conjunction
      with HBA (recently renamed Bupa) and we estimate that 10,000 HBA members will need to be
      contacted by letter and invited to screen for this study to achieve the required 3500
      (protocol amended to include people who meet the entry criteria but who are not insured
      through HBA).

      This protocol has been amended to allow us to invite 50 participants with the lowest
      NT-proBNP levels to also continue in the study and have blood tests, an ECG and
      echocardiography as described below.

      Participants will undergo a routine blood test which will include measuring NT-proBNP. Only
      participants in whom NT-proBNP is elevated will undergo additional blood tests (for cardiac
      markers), an ECG and echocardiography to determine if there is any indication that they do
      have heart disease even though they have not been diagnosed and are not symptomatic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age â‰¥60 years

          2. Have been insured with HBA for 12 months or longer (Protocol amended to remove this
             criteria and allow enrollment of the general public)

          3. Subjects at high-risk of subsequent development of heart failure; comprising at least
             one of:

               -  Prior myocardial infarction (MI) without known left ventricular (LV) dysfunction

               -  Current active ischemic heart disease

               -  Prior Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA)

               -  Known valvular heart disease without known LV dysfunction

               -  Atrial fibrillation

               -  Ventricular arrhythmia resulting in syncope or pre-syncope (protocol amended to
                  remove this entry criteria)

               -  Treated hypertension, of at least 2 years duration

               -  Treated Diabetes mellitus, of at least 2 years duration

               -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;50ml/min

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known systolic or diastolic heart failure

          2. Symptoms suggestive of current heart failure. (protocol amended to remove this
             criteria)

          3. LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography or other objective imaging
             modality.

          4. Medications for treatment of heart failure such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin
             receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers or aldosterone antagonists. Use of such
             medications for approved indications such as hypertension, post-MI management (without
             known LV dysfunction) or for diabetic nephropathy is permitted. (protocol amended to
             remove this criteria)
