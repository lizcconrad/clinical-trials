      This study will examine the effectiveness of a multiple family group mental health service
      delivery strategy in improving mental health service use and outcome for urban, low income
      children of color, ages 7-11 years old with disruptive behaviors and their families.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) are two common childhood
      psychiatric disorders. Children with ODD frequently have temper tantrums, argue excessively
      with adults, deliberately attempt to annoy or upset people, and blame others for their
      mistakes or behavior. Children with CD may exhibit aggression toward people and animals,
      destruction of property, deceitfulness, and rule breaking. The symptoms of these disorders
      can negatively affect children's social, family, and academic lives. Research has shown that
      early, comprehensive treatment leads to better treatment outcomes. Both disorders are
      commonly treated using parent training techniques. A multiple family group therapy setting
      may prove to be more engaging and beneficial than standard care for both parents and
      children. This study will examine the effectiveness of a multiple family group (MFG) mental
      health service delivery strategy in improving mental health service use and treatment outcome
      for urban, low income children of color with ODD or CD.

      Participants in this 18-month, open-label study will be randomly assigned to either receive
      standard of care or participate in an MFG in addition to receiving standard of care.
      Participants assigned to standard of care will receive treatment that is traditionally
      offered to outpatients. Participants in an MFG will meet in their groups once a week for 16
      weeks. Sessions will include adult caregivers and all children over age 6. Each session will
      follow the same procedures, and will proceed through the following stages: creating social
      networks; information exchange; group discussions; individual family practice; and homework
      assignment. Assessments of youth functioning will be held at Weeks 8 and 16 and Months 6 and
      18 post-treatment.
