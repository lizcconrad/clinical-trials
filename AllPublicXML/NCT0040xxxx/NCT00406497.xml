  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion is
      effective in the treatment of postoperative inflammation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to assess efficacy endpoints in comparison with 0.1% BM ophthalmic solution,
      prior to investigation of the efficacy and safety of 0.05% DFBA ophthalmic emulsion in the
      treatment of postoperative intraocular inflammation.

             examination prior to instillation of the investigational product (on the next day of
             surgery) (except instillation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solution
             at 3, 2, 1 and 0.5 hours before surgery)
