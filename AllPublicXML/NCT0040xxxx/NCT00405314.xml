  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of continuous positive airway
      pressure ventilation when applied by paramedics to individuals with severe breathing
      difficulties in the prehospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP) has been shown to be effective in
      avoiding endotracheal intubation (ETI) for patients with acute respiratory failure in
      hospital but despite several case series, the effectiveness of the prehospital application of
      CPAP by paramedics has not been studied in a randomized fashion. We performed a prospective,
      randomized, non blinded trial to determine whether patients in acute respiratory failure
      treated with CPAP in the prehospital setting had lower overall ETI rates than those treated
      with standard care.
