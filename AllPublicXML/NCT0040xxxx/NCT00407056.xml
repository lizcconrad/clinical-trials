  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 3 open-labeled study is to determine if difluprednate ophthalmic
      emulsion is effective in the treatment of severe uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase 3 study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 0.05%
      difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion in patients with severe endogenous anterior uveitis with an
      open-labeled, no-controlled and no-randomized design.

             (criterion for evaluation of signs 4)

          -  Patients requiring more frequent instillation of 0.1% betamethasone sodium phosphate
             ophthalmic solution than the regular frequency specified in its dosage and
             administration (3 - 4 times/day)

          -  Patients aged ≥ 12 years (on the day of obtaining informed consent) who were able to

             within 2 weeks before instillation of the investigational drug

          -  Patients receiving topical injection of any corticosteroid in eyes before instillation
             of the investigational product(solution formulation: within 1 week before instillation

             of the investigational product)

          -  Patients receiving instillation of any corticosteroid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
             ophthalmic solution or antiphologistic enzyme within 12 hours before instillation of
             the investigational drug

          -  Patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension

          -  Patients with corneal erosion or corneal ulcer

          -  Patients with any viral, bacterial or fungal keratoconjunctival disease or suspected
             with eye infection
