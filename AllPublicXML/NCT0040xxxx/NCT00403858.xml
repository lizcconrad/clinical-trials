  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a single centre study comprised of two stages (Parts I and II). Part I was a 9-day
      open label evaluation of Movicol administered to patients in hospital. This study evaluated
      the safety and efficacy of Movicol in treating faecal impaction. Movicol was administered
      over 3 - 7 days to achieve disimpaction.

      Patients received Movicol treatment until disimpaction was achieved according to the
      following regime:

      Day 1: Ages 2 – 4 received 1 (one) sachet whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 2 (two).

      Day 2: Ages 2 – 4 received 2 (two) sachets whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 3 (three).

      Day 3: Ages 2 – 4 received 2 (two) sachets whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 4 (four).

      Day 4: Ages 2 – 4 received 3 *three) sachets whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 5 (five).

      Day 5: Ages 2 – 4 received 3 (three) sachets whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 6 (six).

      Day 6: Ages 2 – 4 received 4 (four) sachets whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 6 (six).

      Day 7: Ages 2 – 4 received 4 (four) sachets whilst 5 – 11 year olds received 6 (six).

      If on day 8 the patient was still impacted they were withdrawn from study and treated
      according to their individual needs. Disimpaction was assessed clinically (loss of faecal
      masses and passage of watery stools).

      Two days following disimpaction patients were randomised (according to the randomisation
      list) to receive Movicol or Lactulose Dry. During bowel retraining the appropriate
      maintenance dose of Movicol or Lactulose Dry was determined. Patients were discharged once
      they were passing regular, painless, bowel actions.
