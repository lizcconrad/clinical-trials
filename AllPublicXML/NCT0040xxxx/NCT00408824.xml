  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome is a highly prevalent disorder, which causes atherosclerotic
      cardiovascular disease and is closely associated with insulin resistance. The alteration of
      the secretion of adipocytokines from accumulated visceral adipose tissue in the obese induces
      insulin resistance. The purpose of this study is to identify gene polymorphisms that confer
      susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome and to make up a new health guidance program based
      on genetic risk assessment. About 25% of male employees over 45 years old in a certain
      company are diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome in medical examination. We, the researchers
      at Nagoya University, will analyze gene polymorphism and various biomarkers of over 3500
      company employees.
