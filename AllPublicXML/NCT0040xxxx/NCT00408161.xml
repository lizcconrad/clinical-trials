      This study evaluates the efficacy of prize contingency management (CM) in reducing in-patient
      detoxification services for chronic recidivist alcohol-dependent patients. 116
      alcohol-dependent patients who have received 4 or more alcohol detoxifications in a calendar
      year will be randomly assigned to one of two 6-month treatment conditions: standard case
      management treatment, or standard case management treatment plus CM. In the CM condition,
      patients earn the chance to win prizes by submitting negative breath samples and by complying
      with steps toward treatment goals, such as attending outpatient substance abuse treatment
      services, attending appointments with low income housing programs, or complying with
      outpatient psychiatric treatment. Treatment services received, alcohol and drug use,
      psychosocial functioning, and HIV risk behaviors will be measured pre-treatment and at months
      1, 3, and 6 (post-treatment), and at follow-ups scheduled for 9, 12, and 18 months after
      intake.
