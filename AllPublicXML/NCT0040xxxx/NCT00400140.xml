  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to establish whether brief periods of high levels of
      acutely imposed myopic defocus can be used to slow the progression of myopia in children, as
      measured by changes in spherical equivalent refraction and axial length.

    <textblock>
      Recent results on animal models of myopia suggest that the eye has the ability to detect the
      overall sign of defocus of images falling on the retina, with myopic defocus imposed by the
      fitting of plus-lenses halting or slowing axial elongation of the eye. In the animal models,
      these STOP growth signals have been shown to be particularly strong - with brief periods of
      high myopic defocus able to outweigh the effects of prolonged periods of imposed hyperopic
      defocus in promoting eye growth. These results therefore suggest a novel strategy for
      preventing the progression of myopia in children - the imposition of high levels of myopia
      for brief periods of time. This approach is conceptually distinct from under-correction,
      which imposes chronic mild myopic defocus.
