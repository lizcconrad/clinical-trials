  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients, who are considered suitable by their physicians to take part in this research, will
      have a physical examination (including an Electrocardiogram (ECG)), blood and urine samples
      taken, as well as a sample of the secretions or tissue around their infection site. In
      addition, the site of the infection will be photographed. The patients will be randomly
      assigned one of the treatments: intravenous (IV)/per oral (PO) moxifloxacin (drug under
      evaluation) or IV piperacillin/tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (i.e.,
      one of the reference treatments for this kind of infection). The maximum treatment duration
      will be 21 days, and the minimum will be 7 days. During the hospitalization, the patients
      will have a physical examination every day. On Day 3-5 during therapy as well as at the end
      of treatment, the patients will have repeated examinations. These tests and evaluations will
      be repeated 14 to 28 days after the end of treatment. During this visit, blood and urine
      samples will be taken only if judged necessary by the physicians.
