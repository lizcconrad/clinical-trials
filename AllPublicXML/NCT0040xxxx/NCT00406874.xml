    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of omega 3 fats plus folic acid with placebo plus folic acid
      on sperm quality and sexual function in infertile men. It will also evaluate the effects on
      sexual fuction of a sub-therapeutic dose of a PDE 5 inhibitor versus placebo in subjects
      continuing on both omega 3 fats and folic acid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infertile men commonly have difficulty timing sexual relations around the time of ovulation.
      There is a high incidence of abnormal sperm morphology in infertile men. Omega 3 fats are
      known to increase the production of nitric oxide, which is the mediator of the male response,
      and folic acid is an important cofactor in the production of nitric oxide. Omega 3 fats are
      also important in the structure and function of cell membranes. There is a high incidence of
      deficient intake of omega 3 fats and folic acid in the U.S. population. Both folic acid and
      omega 3 fats are available as nutritional supplements and the doses used in this study are
      doses commonly recommended as nutritional supplements.

      Comparison: Omega 3 fats plus folic acid will be compared with placebo plus folic acid in men
      age 35 to 55 attempting pregnancy with normal or mildly impaired semen quality. They will
      fill out dietary questionaires, questionaires regarding sexual function, and will have
      measurements of serum nitrates, blood pressure, and semen quality before and during use of
      these nutritional supplements. In men continuing on both omega 3 fats and folic acid, we will
      compare the effects of a sub-therapeutic dose of a PDE 5 inhibitor versus placebo on their
      sexual function.
