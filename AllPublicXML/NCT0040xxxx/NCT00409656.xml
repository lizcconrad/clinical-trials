  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most high risk keratoplasties are currently performed under systemic immunosuppression.
      Immunosuppressants are currently either Cyclosporine A or mycophenolate mofetile,
      administered for around 6 months. Due to potentially severe adverse effects, new
      immunosuppressive exerting less side effects would be desirable. Basiliximab is a monoclonal,
      chimeric antibody, targeted specifically against the Interleukin-2-Rezeptor from activated
      T-cells. This agent is known to specifically inhibit T-cell proliferation upon intravenous
      application only twice following transplantation. Basiliximab has already been demonstrated
      effective in kidney transplantation.

      This investigation is a prospective, randomized clinical trial on orthotopic, high-risk
      penetrating keratoplasty. Basiliximab is evaluated against systemic Cyclosporine A. Primary
      endpoint is graft rejection. Secondary endpoint is clear graft survival.
