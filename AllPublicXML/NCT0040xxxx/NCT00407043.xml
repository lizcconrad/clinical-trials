  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the impact of Lotemax on the initiation of Restasis therapy in patients with dry
      eye.

      It is hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory activity of Lotemax may help mitigate the
      stinging with cyclosporine administration and the dry eye signs and symptoms experienced
      during the initiation of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye is an ocular surface disease that produces discomfort and irritation. Estimated
      prevalence ranges from 20 million people in the US being affected with mild to moderate dry
      eye, to as many as one out of every five Americans.

      A growing body of evidence has associated ocular inflammation with the signs and symptoms of
      dry eye.

      Restasis is indicated to increase tear production in patients whose tear production is
      presumed to be suppressed due to ocular inflammation associated with a condition called
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca. The relief of dry eye signs and symptoms with Restasis therapy is
      often delayed by 1 to 6 months from the initiation of therapy. Stinging on installation,
      particularly when initiating therapy, has been reported.

      Lotemax, an ophthalmic corticosteroid, targets inflammation with a unique, site-active
      mechanism of action.Structural modifications associated with an ester ophthalmic steroid make
      Lotemax highly lipid soluble, enhancing penetration into cells and enabling Lotemax to exert
      anti-inflammatory activity within the eye. Lotemax is indicated for the treatment of steroid
      responsive inflammatory conditions associated with the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva,
      cornea, and anterior segment of the globe.
