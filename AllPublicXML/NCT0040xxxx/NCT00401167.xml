  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by both
      cognitive and behavioural symptoms (&quot;Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia&quot;;
      BPSD). To date, there are only modestly effective treatments for BPSD, and these treatments
      are associated with an increased risk of mortality in elderly dementia patients. We plan to
      study whether treatment with medication memantine improves BPSD in severe AD patients.
      Thirty-two AD patients with significant BPSD, including agitation and aggression, will be
      treated for three months with memantine. Assessments of behavioural symptoms and global
      clinical outcomes will be completed after one, two and three months of treatment.

    <textblock>
      BPSD in institutionalized patients with severe AD is a serious public health problem. The
      effectiveness of current pharmacological management of BPSD with atypical antipsychotics is
      modest at best, and there are serious safety concerns including increased cerebrovascular
      adverse events and increased mortality. Preliminary data with memantine suggests this
      medication may be helpful for treating BPSD in the severe subgroup of the Alzheimer's disease
      patient population. It is for this reason we propose an open-label prospective study of
      memantine in institutionalized patients with severe Alzheimer's disease and significant BPSD.

      The major objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of memantine on behaviour
      with a focus on agitation and aggression. The secondary objective is to determine the effect
      of memantine on nursing burden and prescription medication use. The study would expand
      clinical experience with memantine and provide information on professional caregiver burden
      and prescription medication use in this institutionalized, more severely impaired and frailer
      population. This information could be used to design a randomized placebo controlled
      confirmatory trial.

      The effectiveness of memantine on agitation and aggression in patients with moderate to
      severe Alzheimer's disease will be assessed in a 3-month, open-label study involved 32
      patients residing in long-term care facilities.
