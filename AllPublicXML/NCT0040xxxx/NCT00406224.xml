      Background It has recently been shown that diffuse luminance flicker increases retinal and
      optic nerve head blood flow. This indicates that a neuro-vascular coupling between neural
      activity and blood flow exists as described previously for the brain. Although a lot of
      mediators such as NO, pO2, pCO2, H+ and K+ have been proposed, the mechanism of this coupling
      is still a matter of controversy. However, it has been shown in an animal experiment, that an
      increase in blood flow, evoked by diffuse luminance flicker stimulation is paralleled by an
      decrease in pO2 in the tissue. Thus, in this study we set out to investigate the flicker
      light induced increase in blood flow under elevated blood pO2.

      Study rationale The motive for the investigation of retinal blood flow regulation is to
      enhance our understanding of the coupling mechanism between increased neural activity and
      blood flow in the retina in order to gain new insight in the pathophysiology of several eye
      diseases associated with ocular vascular disorders Study objectives To test the hypothesis
      whether oxygen breathing influences flicker light induced changes in optic nerve head blood
      flow
