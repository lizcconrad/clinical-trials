      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 100mg,
      200mg , 300mg and 400mg once daily of OPC-67683, administered orally for 14 consecutive days,
      in patients with uncomplicated, smear-positive pulmonary TB.

      The four OPC-67683 treatment groups will comprise 12 patients each and the one standard
      therapy (Rifafour e-275) group six patients.

      Trial 242-06-101 is an exploratory and not a confirmatory trial and as such no hypothesis
      will be tested statistically.

      The control group, six patients treated with Rifafour, will serve as an control to confirm
      the microbiological assessments during the trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide written, informed consent prior to all trial-related procedures.

          -  Male and female patients aged between 18 and 64 years, inclusive.

          -  Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, uncomplicated, smear positive, pulmonary TB.

          -  A chest X-ray finding compatible with TB.

          -  Sputum positive on direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) (at least 1+).

          -  Able to produce an adequate volume of sputum (10mL or more estimated overnight
             production).

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must demonstrate a negative pregnancy test
             result. Furthermore they must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception.

          -  Male patients must agree to use an adequate method of contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor general condition where no delay in treatment can be tolerated or where immediate
             hospital admission is warranted.

          -  Rifampicin-resistant bacteria detected in the sputum susceptibility testing at
             Screening.

          -  Treatment received with any drug active against M. tuberculosis within the 3 months
             prior to Screening.

          -  History of allergy to any nitro-imidazole derivates, rifamycin derivatives, isoniazid
             derivatives, pyrazinamide or ethambutol.

          -  Clinical evidence of severe extrathoracic TB (miliary TB, abdominal TB, urogenital TB,
             osteoarthritic TB, TB meningitis).

          -  Evidence of pulmonary silicosis, lung fibrosis, or other lung condition considered as
             severe by the investigator (other than TB).

          -  Presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma.

          -  Any clinically relevant concomitant conditions or renal impairment characterized by
             serum creatinine levels &gt;= 1.5xULN or hepatic impairment or alcohol abuse
             characterized by ALT and/or aspartate transferase (AST) levels 3xULN and/or
             gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels 3xULN of the laboratory reference range.

          -  Known or suspected alcohol or drug abuse, that is, abuse sufficient enough to
             compromise the safety or cooperation of the patient, in the opinion of the
             investigator, and as evident by a positive urine drug screen.

          -  Neuropathy, psychosis or epilepsy.

          -  Any diseases or conditions in which the use of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide or
             ethambutol is contra-indicated.

          -  Any disease or conditions in which any of the medicinal products listed in the
             protocol, is used. Treatment received with quinolones and prednisolone within 3 months
             prior to Screening.

          -  Administration of an IMP within 1 month prior to Screening.

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding, or planning to conceive or father a child within the
             timeframe described in the informed consent form.
