      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of adalimumab for treatment of patients
      with moderate to severe Crohn's Disease (CD) and to measure the effects of treatment on
      patient general well-being, health-related quality of life (QoL), fistula healing, CD-related
      extra-intestinal manifestations, work performance, and overall activity.

      This is an open-label, multi-center, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      adalimumab on inducing and maintaining clinical remission in subjects with moderate to severe
      Crohn's Disease.

      Approximately 1000 subjects with a diagnosis of moderate to severe Crohn's Disease (Harvey
      Bradshaw Index score &gt;= 7) will be enrolled at approximately 200 sites within Europe.
      Enrollment will be dependent on meeting all screening criteria.

      Study medication will be administered by subcutaneous injection. At Baseline (Week 0), all
      subjects will receive a dose of 160 mg adalimumab. At Week 2, all subjects will receive a
      dose of 80 mg adalimumab. Starting at Week 4, all subjects will begin receiving injections of
      adalimumab 40 mg every other week and will continue every other week dosing through Week 20
      except in the case of disease flare or non-response.

      Starting at Week 12, subjects who experience a disease flare (flare is defined by an increase
      in the Harvey Bradshaw Index &gt;=3 and a total Index score of &gt;=7 when compared to Week 4) or
      are not responding to adalimumab treatment (non-response is defined as a decrease in the
      Harvey Bradshaw Index by fewer than 3 points compared to Baseline) will be permitted to
      increase study therapy to adalimumab 40 mg every week.

      If the subject continues to demonstrate a lack of improvement on every week adalimumab
      therapy, they may be withdrawn from the study.

      Prior to Week 8 subjects will not be allowed to increase or decrease Crohn's specific
      concomitant medications except in the event of concomitant Crohn's treatment-related
      toxicities assessed as moderate to severe. Changes in concomitant medications at/after Week 8
      will be at the Investigator's discretion.

      Subjects will be evaluated for safety and efficacy at Baseline (Week 0), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12,
      and 20, and at unscheduled visits. Efficacy evaluations include HBI, Short Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ), Work Productivity Activity Index (WPAI) questionnaire, fistula
      counts, health care resource utilization (HCRU), and evaluation of CD-related
      extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs). Safety assessments include vital signs, physical
      examination, general laboratory analyses, urinalysis, and monitoring of adverse events (AEs).

    <measure>Number of Participants in Clinical Remission at Treatment Week 20. Clinical Remission Defined as Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Score Less Than 5.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>5-items that assess general well-being, abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal mass, and complications. Score is total of 1) subject well-being (0=very well; 4=terrible); 2) abdominal pain (0=none; 3=severe); 3) diarrhea (number of time per day); 4) abdominal mass (0=none; 3=definite and tender); 5) complications (number). Maximum total score for HBI is not specified, is dependent on number of diarrhea times each day and number of complications. Clinical remission = HBI less than 5. Highest total score at Baseline was 47. Missing data were imputed using non-responder imputation (NRI).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Responders at Week 20 of Treatment. A Responder Was Defined as a Participant Who Had a Decrease of 3 or More on the HBI.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>5-items that assess general well-being, abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal mass, and complications. Score is total of 1) subject well-being (0=very well; 4=terrible); 2) abdominal pain (0=none; 3=severe); 3) diarrhea (number of time per day); 4) abdominal mass (0=none; 3=definite and tender); 5) complications (number). Participants who had a decrease from Baseline of at least 3 points in HBI total score were considered responders. Missing data were imputed using non-responder imputation (NRI).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had a Reduction in Number of Draining Fistulas of at Least 50% From Baseline to Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>A count of the number of cutaneous fistulas draining was performed during each physical examination. Among participants who had draining fistulas at Baseline, the number of participants who had a reduction in the number of draining fistulas of at least 50% from Baseline to Week 20 of treatment was determined. Fistulas were classified as abdominal or perianal.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had Extra-intestinal Manifestations (EIM) at Baseline and Resolution by Week 20.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants who had EIM at baseline and had resolution of those manifestations at Week 20. EIM were skin lesions, eye lesions, joint complaints, CD-related hepatic disease, thrombosis, and nephrolithiasis. EIMs were determined by physical examination.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Total Score of Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) From Baseline to Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>10-item assessment of health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Participant marks an option from 1 to 7 for each item. For some items, 1=None of the time; for other items, 1=All of the time. Value for all items are summed. Total score=10 to 70; a high score=good quality of life (QoL). An increase in score indicates improvement. An absolute change in the SIBDQ score of 9 is considered a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for a patient.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Percent Impairment While Working From Baseline to Week 20 of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 20 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percent impairment while working is a component of the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment measure. A score of 0% = no impairment. A decrease in mean score indicates lessening of impairment.</description>

It measures the percentage of overall impairment in work productivity and daily activity due to CD. A WPAI score of 0% = no impairment and a score of 100% = total loss of work productivity or activity. An absolute change in WPAI score of 7% is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID).</description>
