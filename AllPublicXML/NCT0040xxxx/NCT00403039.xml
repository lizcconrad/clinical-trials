      This is an open-label, Phase I study of intravitreally administered ranibizumab in 20
      subjects with macular edema associated with CRVO. Patients will be evaluated at baseline with
      ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography, and color
      photography. Subjects will receive open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5 mg ranibizumab
      administered every 28 ± 2 days for a total of 3 injections. Thereafter they are to be
      evaluated every month until month 12. If the patients have signs of increased intraretinal
      hemorrhage or a persistence / increase in central macular edema as determined by optical
      coherence tomography when compared to their last visit, are eligible for re-injection at that
      monthly visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Clinical evidence of perfused central retinal vein occlusion. A central retinal vein
             occlusion (CRVO) is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhages and a dilated
             retinal venous system in all 4 quadrants. Other evidence of a CRVO may include
             telangiectatic capillary bed and collateral vessels at the optic nerve head. .

          -  Central macular edema present on clinical examination and OCT testing with a central
             point thickness &gt; 250 microns

          -  Visual acuity score greater than or equal to 34 letters (20/200) and less than or
             equal to 73 letters (20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity protocol.

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow OCT
             testing and retinal photography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or known to be pregnant, also premenopausal women
             not using adequate contraception.

          -  Participation in another simultaneous ocular investigation or trial

          -  Patient with uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patient has a condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would preclude
             participation in the study (i.e. chronic alcoholism, drug abuse)

          -  Patient has significant diabetic retinopathy (greater than moderate NPDR) or macular
             edema associated with diabetic retinopathy

          -  Exam or OCT reveals evidence of vitreoretinal interface abnormality that may be
             contributing to the macular edema

          -  Eye that in the investigator has no chance of improvement in visual acuity following
             resolution of macular edema (i.e subretinal fibrosis or geographic atrophy)

          -  Any other additional ocular diseases which could irreversibly compromise the visual
             acuity of the study eye including amblyopia, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
             (AION), age related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal detachment, severe cataracts,
             etc.

          -  Evidence of neovascularization of the iris or retina (presence of ischemic CRVO)

          -  History of Grid/Focal laser or Panretinal laser in the study eye

          -  History of vitreous surgery in the study eye

          -  History of use of intravitreal, peribulbar, or retrobulbar steroids within six months
             of the study.

          -  History of Cataract Surgery within 6 months of enrollment.

          -  History of YAG capsulotomy within 2 months of the surgery.

          -  Visual acuity &lt;20/400 in the fellow eye

          -  Uncontrolled Glaucoma, pressure &gt;30 despite treatment with glaucoma medications.

          -  Use of Bevacizumab in either eye within the past 30 days

          -  Use of Pegaptinib sodium in either eye within the past 6 weeks

          -  Use of Triamcinolone in either eye

          -  Have received any other systemic experimental drug within 12 weeks prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow or comply with all study related procedures.
