      RATIONALE: Collecting samples of tumor tissue and blood from patients with cancer to study in
      the laboratory may help doctors learn how patients respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients receiving
      imatinib mesylate for malignant glioma to see how much imatinib mesylate is found in the
      tumor tissue.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy, of imatinib mesylate, in terms of achieving a therapeutic
           tumor:plasma concentration ratio, in patients with primary malignant glioma.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate tumor grade (low vs high) and/or tumor enhancement on MRI with tumor
           concentration of this drug in these patients.,

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily for 7-12 days. Patients then
      undergo surgical resection.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected at the time of surgery and analyzed for imatinib
      mesylate concentration.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 7 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
