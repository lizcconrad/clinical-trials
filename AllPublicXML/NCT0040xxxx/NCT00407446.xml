      To test the hypothesis that long-term PDE5-inhibition by overexpressing the nitric oxide
      pathway is beneficial in chronic heart failure patients.

      Double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. Primary end-points: quality of life and exercise

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In chronic heart failure (CHF), endothelial function (EF) deterioration and muscle
      underperfusion elicit ergoreflex exercise oversignaling, hyperventilation and breathlessness.
      PDE5 inhibition, by improving EF, might be beneficial. We tested this hypothesis in a
      long-term therapeutic trial. CHF patients were randomly assigned to placebo (23 cases, group
      1) or sildenafil (23 cases, group 2) in addition to their current antifailure therapy, for 6
      months. In group 2 and not in group 1, assessments at 3 and 6 months showed the following
      changes: reduction of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (-25.2 and –29.0 %), ergoreflex
      effect on ventilation (-66.6 and -72.5%), ventilation to CO2 production slope (VE/VCO2, -14.0
      and -16.0%) and breathlessness (-29.6 and -27.1%); increase of brachial artery flow-mediated
      dilatation (FMD, +57.6 and +67.0%), peak exercise O2 uptake (peak VO2, +25.0 and +26.3%) and
      ratio of VO2 to work rate changes (VO2WR, +20.7 and +22.0%). These changes were
      significant at p&lt;0.01. In group 2 and not in group 1, a significant correlation was found, at
      3 and 6 months, between changes in FMD and those in ergoreflex VE. Changes in ergoreflex
      correlated with those in peak VO2 and VE/VCO2 slope. No remarkable side effects were noted,
      but flushing in 3 patients.

      In CHF, benefits of sildenafil are sustained and consist of improvement in EF, modulation in
      ergoreflex signaling, attenuation in exercise hyperventilation and breathlessness, increase
      in aerobic efficiency and exercise performance. Thus, sildenafil can affect peripheral
      mechanisms of breathlessness and may be viewed as an effective and safe adjunct to the
      therapeutic armamentarium of CHF.
