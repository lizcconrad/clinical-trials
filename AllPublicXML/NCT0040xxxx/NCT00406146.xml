  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) are currently recommended for malaria treatment.
      Artemether-lumefantrine(A-L) and Artesunate+amodiaquine (A+A) have been the most commonly
      adopted of the recommended ACT regimens. In Ghana, A+A is the current first-line antimalarial
      treatment in Ghana, but there has been 1 efficacy report of this regimen in Ghana till date.
      Moreover, the safety of repeated treatments with ACT has been little studied. This study aims
      to evaluate the efficacy of A+A vs. A-L, as well as the safety of repeated treatments of
      these regimens in a longitudinal trial in which recruited children will be followed up for 1
      year.
