  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to half of patients with ocular melanoma (also called iris, choroidal or uveal melanoma)
      develop metastasis. We have found that certain molecular features of the eye tumor can be
      detected by gene expression profiling and accurately predict which patients will develop
      metastasis. This molecular test could eventually allow high risk patients to receive
      preventative therapy to delay or prevent the development of metastasis. The goal of this
      study is to prospectively validate the predictive accuracy of the gene expression-based
      molecular test and compare it to monosomy 3, the most common but potentially less accurate
      molecular marker for metastasis in ocular melanoma.

      We have discovered a gene expression profile derived from primary uveal melanomas that
      accurately predicts which patients will develop metastasis. Tumors with a class 1 gene
      expression signature have a very low risk, and those with a class 2 signature have a high
      risk of metastasis. The molecular test was initially performed on tissue obtained from
      enucleated eyes using commercial microarray platforms. We are now able to perform the
      molecular test on fine needle biopsy specimens, and we have developed a customized test that
      has greater dynamic range and sensitivity than commercial microarray platforms. The goal of
      this study is to validate the prognostic accuracy of the customized platform by performing
      the molecular test on primary uveal melanomas obtained from enucleation, local tumor
      resection or fine needle biopsy. Each sample will be diagnosed as either class 1, class 2 or
      indeterminate. Outcomes will be collected and the ability of the molecular diagnosis to
      predict metastasis will be evaluated at regular intervals.
