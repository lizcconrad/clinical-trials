      Subjects with intensively-treated type 1 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0%-10.0%
      in 3 age groups (&gt;25, 15-24, 8-14) will be randomized to a continuous glucose monitoring
      (CGM) group or control group. The primary outcome is change in HbA1c after 26 weeks. A
      parallel randomized trial is being conducted for a second cohort with HbA1c &lt;7.0% that will
      follow an identical protocol to that of the first cohort with HbA1c &gt;=7.0%.

      The &gt;=7.0% trial was specifically designed and statistically powered to compare separately
      the impact of continuous versus standard intensive glucose monitoring in the three age
      groups. Both trials used standardized treatment algorithms and equivalent frequent contacts
      with subjects in both the CGM and control group.

      After completion of the 26-week trial, the CGM group continues to use CGM for another 26
      weeks to evaluate whether any beneficial effect seen in the first 6 months is sustained with
      longer-term use and less intensive contact and the control group initiates CGM use with less
      intensive contact after the first month than was provided at initiation of CGM use in the CGM
      group in the randomized trial.

      1. On the day of enrollment, a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level will be obtained,
           psychosocial questionnaires will be completed, and instructions will be given for use of
           the real time continuous glucose monitoring device (RT-CGM). The study personnel will
           supervise the subject or parent inserting the RT-CGM sensor in the clinic and will
           instruct the subject or parent to insert a second sensor at home as needed. To obtain a
           baseline assessment of glycemic control and variability, the RT-CGM used during the
           first week will be blinded so subjects will not be able to view the data from the
           sensor. The subject will be instructed to complete at least four glucose measurements a
           day using the study home glucose meter (HGM) and as needed to calibrate the RT-CGM.

        2. The subject will return for a second visit about 10 days after the enrollment visit.

             -  Subjects who have been compliant with use of the RT-CGM and HGM will be randomized
                to one of two treatment groups: RT-CGM Group or Control Group.

                  -  Compliance will be defined as use of the RT-CGM for at least 6 out of the 7
                     days prior to the second visit, at least 96 hours of RT-CGM glucose values
                     obtained with at least 24 hours between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., and
                     use of the HGM for testing at least 3 times each day prior to the second
                     visit.

                  -  Subjects who are not compliant will be given another opportunity to complete
                     the baseline requirements at the discretion of the investigator.

             -  For the RT-CGM Group, the RT-CGM, HGM, and pump data (if subject uses an insulin
                pump) will be reviewed and changes will be made to diabetes management as needed.
                Subjects/parents will be taught to use the protocol-developed instructions for
                changes to diabetes management to be used in real time based on RT-CGM and HGM
                data. Instructions for downloading the RT-CGM and HGM will be provided to subjects
                with a home computer.

             -  For the Control Group, a HGM and test strips will be provided. The HGM and pump
                data (if subject uses an insulin pump) will be reviewed and changes made in
                diabetes management as needed. The blinded RT-CGM data will be downloaded but will
                not be reviewed by study personnel until the end of the first 6 months of the
                study. Subjects and parents will be taught to use the protocol-developed
                instructions for how to make changes to diabetes management based on HGM data.

        3. Both groups will have follow-up visits at 1, 4, 8, 13, 19, and 26 weeks (+/- 1 week)
           plus one phone contact between each visit (including one phone contact between the
           second visit and the one week visit) to review their diabetes management.

             -  Both groups will download device data on a weekly basis (if the subject has a
                computer). Subjects with email access will be instructed to email the downloaded
                data to the clinical center prior to each phone contact.

             -  For both groups, at each visit, the HGM and pump (if subject uses an insulin pump)
                will be downloaded and for the RT-CGM Group, the RT-CGM will be downloaded.

        4. In the 13th and 26th weeks, the Control Group will use a blinded RT-CGM for one week.
           The RT-CGM Group will continue to use the unblinded RT-CGM. The Control Group will
           return the blinded RT-CGM to the clinic after a week. The data will be reviewed by
           personnel who are not involved in the care of the subject to determine if additional
           blinded sensor data are needed. The blinded data will not be reviewed by study personnel
           for management decisions until the end of the first 6 months of the study.

        5. Following the 26-week visit:

             -  Subjects in the RT-CGM Group will continue to use the RT-CGM.

             -  Subjects in the Control Group will be provided with a RT-CGM and sensors after the
                week of blinded use and will have visits after 1 week and 4 weeks, with a phone
                contact during the first and third weeks.

             -  Both groups will have visits after 13 weeks and 26 weeks (study time 9 and 12
                months).

    <description>Investigators reported time spent with patients on CGM training and diabetes management excluding research time. Adult patients (or caregivers of children) self-reported health service utilization including routine office visits, after-hours clinic visits, emergency room visits, 911 calls, and hospitalizations. The daily cost of CGM technology was calculated based on FDA recommended frequency of sensor replacement and the expected frequency of receiver and transmitter replacement. The costs of the three devices used during the trial were averaged to arrive at a daily cost of CGM of $13.85. This daily cost was multiplied by the reported weekly use of CGM to arrive at an overall cost of CGM technology. Indirect costs: self-reported number of hours devoted to diabetes care per day, number of days missed from work or school due to diabetes, and number of days of work underperformance.

          -  Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months (if the subject is a minor, for
             either the subject or the subject's primary care giver).

          -  Home use of RT-CGM in past 6 months

               -  Use of a CGMS or GlucoWatch does not exclude subjects from enrollment

          -  Participation in an intervention study (including psychological studies) in past 6
             weeks.

          -  Another member of the same household is participating in this study.

          -  For females, pregnant or intending to become pregnant during the next year Pregnancy
             is an exclusion because of uncertainty about the lag between interstitial fluid
             glucose and blood glucose during pregnancy, which might affect the accuracy of the
             sensor. Subjects who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued from the
             study.

        <description>Quality Adjusted Life Weeks: We collected experienced utility data by eliciting time tradeoff (TTO) utilities for overall experience. Patients were asked to consider their current state of health in comparison to life in perfect health. Experienced utilities were elicited at baseline, 13 weeks, and 26 weeks. For children aged &lt;18 years, parents served as surrogates. The total quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs) were calculated as the area under the quality-of-life time trends under each arm.</description>

        <title>Total Costs: Direct and Indirect Costs</title>
        <description>Investigators reported time spent with patients on CGM training and diabetes management excluding research time. Adult patients (or caregivers of children) self-reported health service utilization including routine office visits, after-hours clinic visits, emergency room visits, 911 calls, and hospitalizations. The daily cost of CGM technology was calculated based on FDA recommended frequency of sensor replacement and the expected frequency of receiver and transmitter replacement. The costs of the three devices used during the trial were averaged to arrive at a daily cost of CGM of $13.85. This daily cost was multiplied by the reported weekly use of CGM to arrive at an overall cost of CGM technology. Indirect costs: self-reported number of hours devoted to diabetes care per day, number of days missed from work or school due to diabetes, and number of days of work underperformance. Unit costs available at: http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09–2042/DC1 (Table 1).</description>
