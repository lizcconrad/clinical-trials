  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who experience a traumatic injury often have a significant amount of blood loss
      and may require a blood transfusion. In some individuals who receive a blood transfusion,
      white blood cells from the donor's blood may remain in the body for years, a condition known
      as microchimerism. This study will examine the reasons why microchimerism occurs in some
      blood transfusion recipients and not others.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20% of individuals who suffer a traumatic injury require a blood transfusion;
      of these, 10% to 15% experience a condition known as transfusion-associated microchimerism.
      This occurs when white blood cells, or leukocytes, from the donor's blood persist in the
      recipient long after the transfusion occurs. The genetically distinct donor cells can remain
      in the individual for decades, and may account for as many as 4% of the white blood cells in
      the recipient's body. This suggests that the donor cells are tolerated by the recipient's
      immune system. The purpose of this study is to examine the specific factors that predispose
      some blood transfusion recipients to develop microchimerism.

      In this study, blood samples will be collected from injured individuals who arrive at the
      University of California at Davis Medical Center. Individuals who receive a blood
      transfusion, as well as a control group of individuals who do not receive a transfusion, will
      be approached to enroll in the study. Individuals who agree to participate will have their
      blood collected at Days 7, 14, and 28 and Months 3 and 6. Study researchers will analyze the
      blood for evidence of microchimerism. Participants with microchimerism will undergo
      additional blood collection at Months 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36. Information will be collected
      from all participants on health status, injury characteristics, hospital care, blood
      transfusion details, and blood donor characteristics.
