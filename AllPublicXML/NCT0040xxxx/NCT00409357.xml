  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the dose-response relationship of SL77.0499 10 (alfuzosin
      hydrochloride) 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and placebo once daily during a 12-week oral
      administration period for the efficacy in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)
      related to BPH.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of each dose of alfuzosin as compared with
      placebo and to assess the safety of each dose of alfuzosin.
