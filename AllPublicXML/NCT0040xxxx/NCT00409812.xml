      The study will be undertaken at the ENT department of the Leicester Royal Infirmary and in a
      research laboratory at the University of Leicester and also in the ENT department at the West
      Suffolk Hospital. One hundred subjects will be recruited. Subjects will be invited to undergo
      a series of smell tests using graded concentrations of 4 odours in 120ml bottles (1). This
      test has been described and validated by our previous work (2). The test will be fully
      explained to the subject beforehand by the researcher who will test the patient. The subject
      will be started with the smallest concentration of each odour and will ascend through the
      bottles until they detect 2 in a row, at which point the weaker concentration of the odour
      will be taken as their threshold. They will have a threshold levels determined for the odours
      phenethyl alcohol (roses), mercaptan (gas), acetic acid (vinegar) and eucalyptol (menthol).

      Then, the subject will undergo a sodium citrate nasal douche at a specific concentration or
      will douche with sterile water. There will be three concentrations used (3%, 6% and 9%) and a
      control solution (sterile water). Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the four
      groups using a coded bottle system. Both patient and tester will be blinded to the solution
      used as these will be made in the pharmacy and coded for anonymity – the code will be broken
      at the end of the trial. Subjects will then be retested with the bottles and threshold levels
      will be observed for the four odours at 15 minute intervals over 2 hours. The purpose of the
      repeated tests is to determine the length of the effect (if present) of the citrate on the
      olfactory ability of the patients.

      (N.B. Sodium citrate is a licensed product for use in body cavities (e.g. stomach, bladder)
      and can be found in the British National Formulary – the concentrations proposed do not
      exceed those used elsewhere.)
