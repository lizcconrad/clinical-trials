  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of spinal fusion is to relieve pain and/or increase stability in painful or unstable
      spine joints. A patient may or may not receive rods and screws with the use of bone graft
      materials to facilitate bone growth and a fusion thus preventing movement of the bones of the
      spine.

      In this research study, bone graft substitute material called Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2
      known as BMP-2 Infuse will be used. No hip bone will be used. The surgical procedure will
      consist of BMP-2 Infuse with or without the use of rods and screws.

      In this study we will be using BMP-2 Infuse instead of the iliac crest bone graft for the
      spinal fusion. The BMP-2 Infuse has been researched in the only completed clinical trial for
      spinal fusions. It has demonstrated equivalence to the iliac crest bone graft with regard to
      both fusion rate and clinical outcome.

      Currently, the acceptable standard of care for spinal fusion surgery requires instrumented or
      non-instrumented procedure with the use of bone graft materials, to facilitate bone growth,
      and a fusion, thus eliminating movement between the inciting vertebrae.

      In this study, the surgical procedure will be BMP-2 Infuse with instrumentation or BMP-2
      Infuse alone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patient not currently participating in a drug or medical clinical trial.

          -  Patient signed informed consent.

          -  Patient is willing to be available for each examination scheduled over the study
             duration.

          -  Patient has clinical and radiologic history of degenerative disc disease or
             spondylolisthesis (no greater than grade 1 utilizing Meyerding's classification
             (Meyerding HW, 1932)); spinal stenosis for which conservative treatment has failed and
             lumbar spinal fusion is indicated.

          -  Eligible for non-instrumented or instrumented surgical procedure

          -  Has one or two levels (contiguous) involvement from L1-S1 requiring fusion

          -  Has preoperative Oswestry score greater than 30

          -  Has not responded to non-operative treatment for a period of 6 months (bed rest,
             physical therapy, medication, manipulations, spinal injections, other).

          -  Is at least 20 years of age inclusive at the day of surgery

          -  If female of childbearing potential, patient is non-pregnant, non-nursing, and agrees
             to use adequate contraception for one year following surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a systemic infection.

          -  Patient has had more than one previous non-fusion spinal surgery at the involved
             level.

          -  Patient requires fusion at more than 2 levels.

          -  Patient has pseudoarthroses from a previous fusion attempt.

             active tuberculosis, venereal disease, active hepatitis). A note to file written by
             the investigator will permit a patient into the study who experiences a mild case
             which will not affect the outcome of the study.

          -  Has been previously diagnosed with osteopenia, osteoporosis, or osteomalacia to a
             degree that spinal instrumentation would be contraindicated

          -  Has received drugs which may interfere with bone metabolism within two weeks prior to
             the planned surgery

             such as steroids.

          -  Has history of endocrine or metabolic disorder known to affect osteogenesis (e.g.
