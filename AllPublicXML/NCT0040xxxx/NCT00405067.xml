    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination
      therapy BMS-201038 (AEGR-733) plus ezetimibe vs. each agent given alone on LDL cholesterol
      and other lipoproteins over 12 weeks of therapy.

      Subjects will participate in this study for approximately 14-17 weeks. This study has 2
      periods: 1) a 1-2-week screening period with 2 visits where baseline cholesterol and other
      characteristics will be evaluated to determine study eligibility. This period also includes a
      4-week washout for patients on prior lipid-lowering therapies; and 2) a 12-week treatment
      period with interim visits at weeks 4 and 8.

      85 subjects were randomized into one of 3 treatment arms with equal probability. In treatment
      arm 1, subjects will receive BMS-201038 (AEGR-733) 5 mg plus ezetimibe placebo. In treatment
      arm 2, subjects will receive BMS-201038 (AEGR-733) placebo plus 10 mg of ezetimibe. In
      treatment arm 3, subjects will receive BMS-201038 (AEGR-733) 5 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg. After
      4 weeks of treatment, subjects in arms 1 and 3 will be force-titrated to BMS-201038
      (AEGR-733) 7.5 mg. After another 4 weeks of treatment, subjects in arms 1 and 3 will then be
      force-titrated to BMS-201038 (AEGR-733) 10 mg for 4 more additional weeks of treatment.
      Subjects in arm 2 will continue to receive BMS-201038 (AEGR-733) matching placebo for the
      entire 12 weeks of treatment. Subjects randomized to ezetimibe 10 mg in arms 2 and 3 and
      ezetimibe placebo in arm 1 will remain on these doses for the entire 12-week treatment
      period.
