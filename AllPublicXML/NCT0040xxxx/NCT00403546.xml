    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to assess tolerability of ziprasidone dose escalation to
      320 milligrams per day (mg/d) compared to continued standard treatment (placebo) as measured
      by the Side Effect Checklist, Simpson Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS), Barnes
      Akathisia Scale (BAS), serum prolactin concentrations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (EKG)
      and completion rates and to assess whether ziprasidone dose escalation improves overall
      psychopathology compared to continued standard treatment as measured by the change from
      baseline in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score and response rates
      as defined by a 20% or greater reduction in PANSS total score.

      The secondary aims of this study are to assess whether ziprasidone dose escalation improves
      psychotic symptoms compared to continued standard treatment as measured by the Positive
      Symptom Subscale of the PANSS, to assess whether ziprasidone dose escalation improves
      negative symptoms compared to standard treatment as measured by the Negative Symptom Subscale
      of the PANSS, to assess whether ziprasidone dose escalation improves depressive symptoms
      compared to continued standard treatment as measured by the Calgary Depression Rating Scale
      (CDRS), and to assess whether ziprasidone dose escalation improves overall functioning with
      the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S), Clinical Global Impression - Improvement
      (CGI-I), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Schizophrenia Cognition Rating Scale
      (SCoRS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>BAS is a rating scale that is administered by physicians to assess the severity of drug-induced akathisia, which is a movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in constant motion, as well as by actions such as rocking while standing or sitting, lifting the feet as if marching on the spot, and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting. The following subcategories are scored: objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness and subjective distress related to restlessness and are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 - 3. In addition, the global clinical assessment of akathisia uses a 6-point scale ranging from 0 - 5. Total score ranges from 0 to 14 with a higher score indicating increased severity. A positive change from baseline indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Response was defined as a reduction in the PANSS total score from baseline by 20% or greater, calculated by first subtracting 30 (the PANSS minimum possible total score). Response rate is the percentage of participants with a response.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS is a rating scale measuring involuntary movements known as tardive dyskinesia, that sometimes develop as a side effect of long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications. The AIMS score was calculated as the sum of questions 1 through 7 of the AIMS instrument, which includes assessments of involuntary movements in the face, lips, jaw, tongue, upper and lower extremities, and neck/shoulders/hips. Each item is rated on a five-point scale of severity from 0-4 with 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). Total scores range from 0 to 28. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events During Randomized Trial</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Serious adverse event (SAE): significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution, which fulfilled any of the following criteria: fatal (resulted in death), life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was medically significant or required intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes listed here.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Upon signing informed consent participants not already taking ziprasidone were instructed to start open-label ziprasidone for 3 weeks. Of 131 participants who signed informed consent 75 started ziprasidone and 56 were already on ziprasidone. Those completing open-label and those on ziprasidone were then screened.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Upon signing informed consent participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, who were not yet taking ziprasidone could initiate open-label standard treatment ziprasidone (160 milligrams per day [160 mg/d]: 80 mg twice daily) for a minimum of 3 weeks to be eligible for screening to enter the randomized trial. Participants who were already taking standard treatment ziprasidone for 3 weeks or longer at time of enrollment were eligible for screening, as well.</description>

        <description>The SAS is a 10-item testing instrument used to evaluate drug-related extrapyramidal syndromes. The following items are included in the SAS: gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, glabella reflex, tremor, and salivation. Total score ranges from 0 to 40 with a higher score indicating increased severity. A positive change from baseline indicates a worse outcome.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Simpson Angus Scale for Extrapyramidal Symptoms (SAS)</title>
          <description>The SAS is a 10-item testing instrument used to evaluate drug-related extrapyramidal syndromes. The following items are included in the SAS: gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, glabella reflex, tremor, and salivation. Total score ranges from 0 to 40 with a higher score indicating increased severity. A positive change from baseline indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>BAS is a rating scale that is administered by physicians to assess the severity of drug-induced akathisia, which is a movement disorder characterized by a feeling of inner restlessness and a compelling need to be in constant motion, as well as by actions such as rocking while standing or sitting, lifting the feet as if marching on the spot, and crossing and uncrossing the legs while sitting. The following subcategories are scored: objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness and subjective distress related to restlessness and are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 – 3. In addition, the global clinical assessment of akathisia uses a 6-point scale ranging from 0 – 5. Total score ranges from 0 to 14 with a higher score indicating increased severity. A positive change from baseline indicates a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With High and Low Levels in Serum Prolactin Concentration</title>
        <description>Blood samples were taken at baseline and Week 8 to measure serum prolactin concentrations. Normal range for females (non-pregnant) is 2-29 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) and for males 2-18 ng/dL. Values above the normal range were reported as High and values below the normal range were reported as Low. Reported here is the number of participants with high prolactin concentration and the number of participants with low prolactin concentration.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score</title>
        <description>AIMS is a rating scale measuring involuntary movements known as tardive dyskinesia, that sometimes develop as a side effect of long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications. The AIMS score was calculated as the sum of questions 1 through 7 of the AIMS instrument, which includes assessments of involuntary movements in the face, lips, jaw, tongue, upper and lower extremities, and neck/shoulders/hips. Each item is rated on a five-point scale of severity from 0–4 with 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). Total scores range from 0 to 28. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events During Randomized Trial</title>
        <description>Adverse event: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Serious adverse event (SAE): significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution, which fulfilled any of the following criteria: fatal (resulted in death), life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was medically significant or required intervention to prevent any of the other outcomes listed here.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive Subscale Score of PANSS</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a medical scale and was used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia in this study. Positive symptoms as defined by the American Psychiatric Association refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions and include the following 7 items: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution and hostility. Score ranges from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Negative Subscale Score</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a medical scale and was used for measuring symptom severity of participants with schizophrenia in this study. Negative symptoms as defined by the American Psychiatric Association represent a diminution or loss of normal functions and include the following 7 items: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation and stereotyped thinking. Score ranges from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
