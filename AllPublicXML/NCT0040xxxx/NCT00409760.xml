          -  Female patients must be either post-menopausal for one year or surgically sterile, or
             using effective contraceptive methods such as barrier method with spermicide or an
             intra-uterine device. Hormonal contraceptive use is disallowed.

          -  Patients with mild to moderate essential diastolic hypertension (grades 1 and 2 WHO
             classification) measured by calibrated standard sphygmomanometer.

          -  Patients must have a MSDBP &gt;= 90 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg at Visit 1 (week -2 to -4), and a
             MSDBP &gt;= 95 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg at Visit 2 (week 0).

          -  Patients must have an absolute difference of =&lt; 10 mmHg in their average sitting
             diastolic blood pressure between Visits 1 and 2.

          -  Patients who are eligible and able to participate in the study, and who consent to do
             so after the purpose and nature of the investigation has been clearly explained to
             them (written informed consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe hypertension (grade 3 WHO classification; MSDBP &gt;=110 mmHg diastolic and/or
             MSSBP &gt;= 180 mmHg systolic).

          -  Inability to discontinue all prior anti-hypertensive medications safely for a period
             of 14 weeks).

          -  Known Keith-Wagener grade III or IV hypertensive retinopathy.

          -  History of hypertensive encephalopathy or cerebrovascular accident at anytime prior to
             Visit 1 (week -2 to -4).

          -  Transient ischemic cerebral attack during the last 12 months prior to Visit 1 (week -2
             to -4).

          -  Evidence of a secondary form of hypertension, such as coarctation of the aorta,
             hyperaldosteronism, unilateral renal artery stenosis, or pheochromocytoma, etc.

          -  Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.

          -  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with poor glucose control as defined by fasting glycosylated
             hemoglobin (HbA1c) &gt;8% at Visit 1 (week -2 to -4).

          -  Administration of any agent indicated for the treatment of hypertension within a
             minimum 4 weeks prior to randomization into the study (Visit 2, week 0), with the
             permitted exception of those anti-hypertensive medications requiring tapering down
             commencing at Visit 0 (week -4 to -6).

          -  Known or suspected contraindications, including history of allergy to angiotensin
             receptor blockers or calcium channel blockers.
