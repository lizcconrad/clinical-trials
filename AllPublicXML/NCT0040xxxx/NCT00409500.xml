      This study will evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of individual oral doses
      of AQW051 in Japanese healthy male subjects, and will also evaluate the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics of AQW051.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese healthy male subjects age 20 to 45 years of age, and in good health

          -  At screening and baseline, the subjects must be in good health as determined by past
             medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, laboratory tests and
             urinalysis.

          -  Body mass index within the range of 17 to 25 kg/m2 and weigh at least 50 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will
             be measured during screening for all subjects. Smokers will be defined as any subject
             who reports tobacco use or has a urine cotinine ‘high’ level in checking by NicCheck®
             I.

          -  Use of any prescription drugs within 4 weeks prior dosing, or over-the-counter
             medication (vitamins, herbal supplements, dietary supplements) within 2 weeks prior to
             dosing. Acetaminophen is acceptable.

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 months prior to study start.

          -  Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 3 months; donation or loss of 200
             mL or more of blood within 1 month; or donation of component blood within 2 weeks
             prior to study start.

          -  Subjects considered unsuitable for participation in the study within 2 weeks prior to
             dosing.

          -  A past medical history of clinically significant abnormality detected during
             electrocardiogram (ECG) examination or an evident family history (grandparents,
             parents and siblings) of a ECG abnormality (i.e. prolonged QT-interval syndrome).

          -  History of fainting, hypotension when standing up, arrhythmia.

          -  History of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, treated or not treated).

          -  History of clinically significant drug allergy, history or presence of atopic allergy
             (asthma, urticaria, eczematous dermatitis) unless inactive seasonal allergy, or
             history of food allergy. A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drugs similar
             to the study drug.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or which may jeopardize the subject in
             case of participation in the study.

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV test result.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis C or Syphilis test result.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to study participation or
             evidence of such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted at screening.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
