  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is about the effect of an exercise program using stationary bicycling for children
      with the spastic diplegic form of cerebral palsy. Spastic diplegia is a type of cerebral
      palsy that involves spasticity or &quot;tightness&quot; of the leg muscles. We hope to learn whether
      this type of exercise will allow the children to develop improved strength in the muscles
      that bend and straighten their knees, enhance their level of physical fitness, improve their
      ability to walk and improve their ability to perform other activities that are important to
      them. We hypothesize that children who participate in the stationary cycling intervention
      will gain strength in the muscles that bend and straighten their knees, will be able to
      complete a 600 yard walk run test (a test of endurance) more rapidly, and will improve their
      score on a test of function called the Gross Motor Function Measure (a test designed
      specifically for children with cerebral palsy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  between the ages of 7 and 16 years and engaged in regular education as their primary
             academic path (children receiving resource help will not be excluded); - ability to
             follow simple verbal directions;

          -  good or fair selective motor control for at least one limb; and

          -  ability to walk independently, with or without assistive devices, for short distances.
             The lowest level of walking ability for inclusion is independent walking indoors but
             limitations outdoors and in the community, requiring the use of a wheelchair in these
             settings. These criteria for walking ability place subjects in Levels I-III of the
             Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) (Palisano et al., 1997).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  musculoskeletal or neurosurgical surgery or baclofen pump implantation within the past
             year;

          -  botulinum toxin injections within the past 6 months;

          -  serial casting or new orthotics within the past 3 months;

          -  initiating or increasing oral medications that affect the neuromuscular system, e.g.
             baclofen, within the past 3 months;

          -  onset of physical therapy, exercise, sport activity, or change in assistive devices
             for walking within the past 3 months;

          -  inability or unwillingness to maintain age appropriate behavior;

          -  serious medical conditions such as cardiac disease, diabetes, asthma, or uncontrolled
             seizures;

          -  current participation in a fitness program, that includes a cardiorespiratory
             endurance exercise, at least one time per week;

          -  significant hip joint contractures so that the hip cannot be passively moved
             throughout an excursion between 30 and 80 degrees;

          -  significant knee joint contractures so that the knee cannot be passively moved
             throughout an excursion between 40 and 110 degrees; and

          -  significant ankle joint contractures so that the ankle cannot be passively moved
             throughout an excursion of -10 to 20 degrees of plantarflexion. Exclusion criteria 8 -
             10 are based on passive joint excursions necessary to perform stationary cycling
             (Ericson et al., 1988) allowing for some hip and knee joint compensation for subjects
             without ankle dorsiflexion range of motion.
