  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients on the GP asthma database in one practice were invited for an asthma
      physical-therapy assessment, at baseline. Volunteers satisfying the inclusion criteria ie -
      aged between 16 and 70, able to understand, read and write English, give informed consent,
      willing to attend the surgery to take part in the trial and with no other serious conditions
      - were invited to participate in the study. Patients were randomised either to a control
      group, receiving 2 more assessments at 6 and 12 months, or for comparison to a group
      receiving 5 physical-therapy treatments of integrated breathing and relaxation exercises
      (known as the Papworth Method (PM)). The two groups would then be compared at 6 and 12
      months.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The PM of breathing and relaxation training would improve the quality of life for adult
           patients with asthma in primary care, compared with patients only receiving usual
           medical care.

        2. Anxiety and depression, and symptoms from dysfunctional breathing would reduce compared
           with the control group.

        3. Respiratory function measurements would improve compared with the control group.
