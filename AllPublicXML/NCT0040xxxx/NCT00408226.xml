      To determine the toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose of
      MKC-1 when administered orally, twice daily for 14 days followed by 7 days without dosing, in
      combination with pemetrexed (delivered at its recommended single agent dose) to patients with
      advanced solid tumor malignancies. Also, to determine the antitumor activity, based on the
      objective response rate and median Progression Free Survival (&quot;PFS&quot;), of oral MKC-1,
      administered on this schedule in combination with pemetrexed to patients with non small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must satisfy this criteria based on the portion of the study for which they
             are being considered for enrollment:

             Dose Escalating Phase: Patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies for whom
             single-agent pemetrexed therapy would not be contraindicated. Measurable disease not
             required.

             Phase 2 portion: Current diagnosis of Stage IIIb (due to malignant pleural effusion or
             supraclavicular lymph node involvement only) or Stage IV histologically and/or
             cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer according to staging system of the
             American Joint Committee on Cancer.

             (i) Patient has received maximally feasible surgical resection and/or radiotherapy for
             initial disease.

             (ii) Either disease progression following treatment with one prior chemotherapy
             regimen used for the treatment of metastatic disease or disease progression following
             adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy within one year of last dose of chemotherapy or (for
             those patients with disease progression following adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy &gt;1 year
             of last dose of chemotherapy) disease progression following one additional
             chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease.

             (iii) Radiographic or physical examination evidence of at least one site of
             unidimensionally-measurable disease, using the RECIST criteria with disease assessed
             within 28 days prior to treatment initiation.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years.

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          4. All acute toxicity of any prior chemotherapy, surgery or radiotherapy must have
             resolved to NCI CTCAE Grade ≤ 1, except for alopecia.

          5. The following laboratory results, within 10 days of MKC-1 administration:

             Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 75 x
             109/L Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) Creatinine clearance ≥ 45
             mL/min AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN Serum albumin ≥ LLN (lower limit of normal) or 3.5 g/dL Total
             bilirubin ≤ ULN

          6. Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pre-existing hepatomegaly with disease measured as ≥ 2 cm below the costal margin,
             secondary to malignancy.

          2. Uncontrolled pleural effusions (defined as more than 2 pleuracenteses within 4 weeks
             of the first dose of study drug)

          3. Administration of cancer-specific therapy within the following periods prior to study

                  receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s);

               -  less than 2 weeks prior: oral EGF-R receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s).

             agree to use an acceptable method of contraception.

          5. Known CNS or leptomeningeal metastases unless treated, clinically stable and not

          8. Serious cardiac condition (Class III/IV congestive heart failure according to New York
             Heart Association classification); documented acute myocardial infarction within the
             previous 6 months.

          9. Any medical conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, would impose excessive
             risk to the patient. Examples of such conditions include congestive heart failure of
             Class III or IV of the NYHA classification, infection requiring parenteral or oral
             anti-infective treatment, any altered mental status or any psychiatric condition that
             would interfere with the understanding of the informed consent.

         10. Patients with active secondary malignancies.

         11. Treatment with antiretroviral therapy metabolized through CYP3A4 (including indinavir,
