      To evaluate the prophylactic activity of orally administered DB289 against Plasmodium
      falciparum in non-immune healthy volunteers who are challenged by the bite of five P.
      falciparum-infected Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes

      The primary endpoint of this study is the appearance of erythrocytic parasites (parasitemia),
      which indicates a prophylaxis failure. Parasitemia will be sought by multiple means,
      including blood culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Quantitative Buffy Coat (QBC)
      analysis, and thick and thin blood smears (detailed methods,Appendix II).

      QBC and giemsa-stained blood smears will be analyzed in real time and a positive result in
      any one of them is sufficient to initiate chloroquine treatment. All positive QBC analyses or
      blood smears will be confirmed by two experienced observers. On smears, the location of
      parasites will be recorded using a stage micrometer, and slides will be archived and
      available for later re-examination. PCR samples will be collected and stored for later
      analysis; cultures will be inoculated at once and maintained for 70 days.

      A positive result in any one of these tests constitutes a drug failure.
