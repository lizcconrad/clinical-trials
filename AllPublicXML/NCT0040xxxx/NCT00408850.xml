  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An abdominal distribution of fat is associated with the greatest heart disease risk, because
      commonly, several risk factors of metabolic origin cluster in these individuals. When this
      occurs the condition is called the 'metabolic syndrome'.

      Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in enhanced release of the
      stress hormone 'noradrenaline', may be one mechanism by which adverse cardiovascular and
      metabolic sequela of the metabolic syndrome might be mediated. Impaired insulin action may be
      one factor contributing to increased noradrenaline release.

      The aim of this Study is to determine whether treatment with a drug called pioglitazone which
      is known to improve insulin action, results in reduced sympathetic nervous system activity
      and stress hormone release when compared to treatment with a dummy drug (placebo).

      The rapidly growing burden of obesity together with a population that is becoming older
      raises the importance of effective strategies for the primary prevention and treatment of the
      metabolic syndrome in order to combat the epidemic of type 2 diabetes and to reduce the
      increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.

      Increased sympathetic nervous system activity may participate in the pathogenesis and
      complications of the metabolic syndrome. This Study will use a randomised controlled design
      to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone treatment on sympathetic activity in middle-aged
      subjects with the metabolic syndrome.The results will generate new information on the
      neuroadrenergic effects of thiazolidinediones in this clinical setting. This is relevant to
      the understanding of the pathophysiology of the metabolic syndrome and to its clinical
      management.
