      The objective of this trial is to determine the safety and effect on pulmonary function of 14
      days of inhaled L-arginine versus placebo administered over a period of 14 days in a cohort
      of CF patients.

    <textblock>
      Despite the inflammatory nature of lung disease in CF, nitric oxide (NO) formation as well as
      the expression of NOS2 has been found to be decreased in CF airways. While the reasons for
      impaired airway NO formation remain incompletely understood, there is evidence that low NO
      formation contributes to lung pathophysiology in CF. Constitutive endogenous formation of
      Nitric oxide (NO) in airways is thought to play a role in neurotransmission, smooth muscle
      relaxation and bronchodilation. Previous animal experiments have shown that the addition of
      L-arginine, the precursor of enzymatic NO formation, resulted in a significantly greater
      relaxation of tracheas. There is also evidence that a single dose of inhaled L-arginine
      improves pulmonary function in CF. In this study we will assess the effect of L-arginine
      inhalation on lung function, nitric oxide formation, airway inflammation and bacterial
      infection in CF patients.

    <description>Group 1 will receive the active treatment followed by the inactive treatment. The active treatment phase will consist of L-arginine 250 mg/ml dispensed in 2.2 ml vials, from which the patient will take 2ml (500mg) and dilute with 3ml of sterile water to give 5ml of a 100mg/ml solution. Dosing in the inactive treatment phase will consist of a placebo of similar osmolarity and appearance will be formulated and dosed in a similar fashion. It will consist of 2.2ml vials of 1110mmol/L hypertonic saline. Again, the patient will take 2ml and dilute with 3ml of sterile water to give a 445mmol/L solution which has similar tonicity (10%) to the L-arginine. Both treatment phases will be administered by inhalation with a PARI eFLOW device.</description>
