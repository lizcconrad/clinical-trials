  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to further validate a clinical treatment plan to lower LDL values
      using non-prescription supplements combined with a lifestyle change and education program
      which could represent an alternative approach to improve compliance in group of people who
      are unable to take traditional medication to lower cholesterol.

    <textblock>
      Up to 70 participants will be randomized into 2 groups. Each shall have similar total and LDL
      cholesterol values obtained prior to the study. Study Group 1 will participate in the Change
      of Heart Program (an intensive program to make therapeutic lifestyle changes) and take a
      placebo pill. Study Group 2 will also participate in Change of Heart. Group 2 will be
      provided an over the counter supplement consisting of red rice yeast 2.4-3.6 gms day)

      Blood work consisting of a lipid panel, cardiac CRP, CPK, liver function panel and TSH will
      be obtained prior to study, and at 12 and 26 wks. Questionnaires will be administered
      regarding quality of life indexes, and ancillary symptom relief (i.e. degree of arthritis
      discomfort, generalized weakness) before, 12 and 26 weeks. After the Change of Heart program
      ends (12 weeks), participants will continue on study medication for a total of 6 months. A
      final questionnaire and final blood work will be obtained at 6 months, and at that point,
      medications can be discontinued.
