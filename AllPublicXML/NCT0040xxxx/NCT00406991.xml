  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to find mechanisms for the abnormal retinal blood flow that in diabetic
      patients often precedes any evidence of clinical retinopathy and may contribute to the
      development of retinopathy.

      Specifically, the projects tests the hypothesis that reduced retinal blood flow found in
      young patients with type 1 diabetes reflects increased resistance in the small vessels of the
      retina caused by the formation of small blood clots, called microthrombi; and that
      antiplatelet agents normalize the reduced retinal blood flow.

      The ultimate goal of this research is to contribute to the development of strategies to
      prevent diabetic retinopathy. This project will test the hypothesis that antiplatelet agents
      normalize the reduced blood flow observed early in the course of type 1 diabetes. If the
      hypothesis is proven correct, the results will indicate that the formation of small blood
      clots (microthrombi) occurs early in diabetic retinal vessels. In turn, because
      microthrombosis could readily account for the occlusive microangiopathy that causes the
      sight-threatening stages of diabetic retinopathy, the results will propose the desirability
      of antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of diabetic retinopathy.

      We have three specific aims:

        1. To confirm that, under basal conditions, retinal blood flow measured with the laser
           Doppler method in a group of type 1 diabetic patients with no or minimal retinopathy
           differs from the flow measured in age- and sex-matched nondiabetic control subjects;

        2. To determine whether the response of retinal blood flow to low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day)
           administered for 2 months versus placebo, differs between type 1 diabetic patients with
           no or minimal retinopathy and age- and sex-matched nondiabetic control subjects;

        3. To determine whether in type 1 diabetic patients with no or minimal retinopathy the
           response of retinal blood flow to low-dose aspirin differs from the response to
           clopidogrel, a drug that interferes with platelet function downstream of the site of
           aspirin action.
