  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with malignancies are at high risk of developing a thromboembolic complication and
      their treatment with chemo- and or radiation therapy further enhances this risk.

      Conventional haemostatic tests are not suitable as a screening tool of a hypercoagulable
      state. A hypercoagulable profile identified with the whole blood Thrombelastograph (TEG)
      Analyzer parameter maximal amplitude (MA) is reported to correlate with thrombotic events in
      patients undergoing major non-cardial surgery and recurrent ischemic events in patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

      In this study we investigate the correlation between TEG measurements and thromboembolic
      events in patients with newly diagnosed malignancies.

      The hypotheses of this study are:

        1. Patients with malignancies and hypercoagulability, defined as a TEG MA&gt;69 mm and /or R&lt;4
           min is at increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications as compared to those
           with a MA&lt;69 mm and/or a R&gt;4 min.

        2. Hypercoagulability and hence TEG R and MA values are affected by the treatment
           instituted in these patients (chemo and radiation therapy) rendering the patients more
           hypercoagulable and hence at increased risk of developing thrombotic complications.
