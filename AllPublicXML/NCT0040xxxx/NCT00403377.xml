      RATIONALE: Understanding why sunbathers use or don't use sunless tanning products may help
      doctors plan effective ways to prevent skin cancer caused by sunbathing.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying attitudes about the use of sunless tanning
      products and how well sunless tanning products work as a substitute for sunbathing in healthy
      participants.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine participants' attitudes regarding the benefits and barriers to using sunless
           tanning products after having sampled them. (Phase I)

        -  Determine participants' opinions, suggestions, and preferences regarding use of sunless
           tanning products. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the validity and reliability of the Sunless Tanning Attitudes Survey.

        -  Determine time spent sunbathing in random beach-goers. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine sunburn frequency in random beach-goers. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the use of a sunless tanner in these participants. (Phase II)

        -  Determine sun protection use in these participants. (Phase II)

        -  Determine perceptions of sun protection, susceptibility to photoaging, benefits of
           sunbathing, and severity of photoaging. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label phase I study followed by a pilot, randomized, controlled
      phase II study.

        -  Phase I (focus group): Participants complete the Sunless Tanning Attitudes (STA) survey,
           Sun Behavior (SB) survey, and the Decisional Balance for Sun Exposure and Sun Protection
           Questionnaire. Participants who have used a sunless tanner in the past also complete the
           Sunless Tanner Users (STU) survey. Participants receive sunless tanning lotion and
           instructions for its use. Participants are instructed to use the sunless tanner for 2
           weeks (≥ 3 applications). Participants then complete the STA, SB, and STU surveys and
           participate in a focus group.

        -  Phase II:Participants are stratified by beach location and randomized to 1 of 2
           intervention arms.

             -  Arm I: Participants complete surveys as in phase I. Photographs are taken of the
                participants and they then receive sunscreen lotion and sunless tanning lotion and
                instructions and benefits for using both. Participants also receive an educational
                pamphlet regarding skin cancer.

             -  Arm II: Participants complete surveys as in phase I. A souvenir photograph is taken
                of the participants and they then receive product samples that are irrelevant to
                skin cancer risk reduction (e.g., skin moisturizer, hair gel, chewing gum).
                Participants also receive educational materials at the completion of the study.

      In both arms, participants complete surveys again at 2 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 330 participants will be accrued for this study.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Focus Group</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of the initial developmental phase of the present study is to determine the acceptability of sunless tanning as a substitute for sunbathing. Using focus groups comprised of sunbathers given the opportunity to sample sunless tanning products, we will identify perceived barriers and benefits of sunless tanning products, develop motivational messages encouraging the use of sunless tanning products, and preview intervention materials.</description>

    <measure>Phase II PO: Effectiveness of a beach-based pilot intervention (sun exposure at 2-, and 12- months follow-up)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2-, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The intervention will include sun damage imaging, sun safety and sunless tanning education/instruction, and the provision of samples of both sunscreen and sunless tanning products. Feasibility of the intervention, measures, and follow-up procedures will be assessed. The primary outcome for effectiveness will be sun exposure at 2-, and 12- months follow-up and a questionnaire only control group will be employed for comparison.</description>

    <measure>Phase 1 SO: The second goal of the initial developmental phase will be to develop psychometrically sound measures of sunless tanner attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Focus Group</time_frame>
    <description>To achieve this aim, psychometric analyses including inter-item analyses, autocorrelations, internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity will be conducted, and survey items will be added/revised (if necessary) based on content of focus group discussions.</description>

    <measure>Phase II SO: Sunburn frequency in random beach goers at 2 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2-, and 12-months</time_frame>
    <description>The intervention will include sun damage imaging, sun safety and sunless tanning education/instruction, and the provision of samples of both sunscreen and sunless tanning products. Feasibility of the intervention, measures, and follow-up procedures will be assessed. Secondary outcomes will include frequency of sunburns, use of sunless tanning products, sun protection behavior, and perceived benefits/barriers to sunbathing/sun protection.</description>
