  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is characterized by a lack of pelvic floor support causing the pelvic
      organs and vaginal walls to protrude. For decades, suture repair techniques have been the
      primary choice of surgical treatment when indicated.

      The notion of reinforcing pelvic floor defects using biomaterial implants is not an
      exclusively contemporary idea. Traditional surgical techniques are frequently associated with
      unsatisfying anatomical recurrence rates and over the years sporadic attempts have been made
      to introduce novel surgical techniques using a variety of biomaterials as support with
      varying success. It is plausible that inherently weak, or damaged, pelvic floor supportive
      tissues need to be reinforced by a permanent support to avoid the high rates of recurrences
      commonly described using traditional techniques. However, use of biomaterials in pelvic
      reconstructive surgery has become widespread in just a few years despite a lack of clinical
      safety data, or compelling clinical evidence demonstrating that it improves outcomes compared
      to traditional suture techniques.

      It is likely that biomaterials need to be &quot;anchored&quot; in tissues not afflicted by the disease,
      in order to provide the intended pelvic floor support. This has given rise to transvaginal
      surgical techniques using a transobturator approach passing the mesh through the arcus
      tendineous fascia pelvis, or the sacrospinous ligaments through a transgluteal approach.
      Already commercially available implant materials are in need of patient safety documentation,
      both when considering the surgical techniques by which these materials are placed in the body
      as well as the actual materials. Complication rates and perioperative morbidity using these
      surgical routes in pelvic organ prolapse surgery are generally unknown.

      The aim of the present study was to assess the long term morbidity, and describe the
      complications, associated with transvaginal mesh repair of pelvic organ prolapse using the
      PROLIFT®-system.

      Main objective:

      - To describe short and long-term complications associated with pelvic organ prolapse repair
      using macroporous polypropylene transvaginal mesh (TVM) using a transobturator or
      transgluteal approach.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe anatomical restoration of the pelvic floor following transvaginal mesh
           repair of pelvic organ prolapse using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system
           (POP-Q).

        -  To describe subjective patient outcomes using validated questionnaires with regard to
           pelvic organ function (UDI), sexual function (PISQ) and quality of life (IIQ).

      Study design:

      - A prospective multicenter open labeled single cohort study.

      Study protocol:

        -  At baseline patients receive oral and written information about the study.

        -  Following informed consent, patients are included in the study if pelvic organ prolapse
           surgery is indicated and all inclusion, and no exclusion, criteria are fulfilled.

        -  Preoperatively all patients answer a detailed self reported questionnaire on health
           history, previous surgery, obstetrical history and current diseases and medications. The
           questionnaire also includes questions on symptoms from the pelvic organs and pelvic
           floor.

        -  Preoperatively all patients undergo a clinical examination using the POP-Q system, as
           well as, a validated clinical inflammatory grading of the vaginal compartments.

        -  Patients undergo the TVM procedure in a standardised manner with all participating
           surgeons having undergone pretrial surgical training and adopting the same surgical
           technique. All patients receive standardised intraoperative antibiotics.

        -  Complications during the immediate peri- and postoperative hospital stay are registered
           in hospital charts.

        -  All patients receive a clinical follow-up appointment 2 months, 1 year and 3 years after
           surgery. At follow-up identical self reported questionnaires are used for subjective
           assessment. Clinical examinations are performed as preoperatively suing the POP-Q system
           and macroscopic inflammatory grading. Complications are registered in a specific
           protocol and hospital charts.

        -  All protocols are to be submitted after the 2 months follow-up for an interrim safety
           analysis. The study chair is responsible for stopping the study if the rate, or
           seriousness, of complications exceed the expected.

        -  Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any point.
