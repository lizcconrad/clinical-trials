  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment in the home and hospice of long-term care facilities, particularly for
      non-ambulatory patients, could provide significant advantages for patients and for the
      region. The Calgary Health Region has a unique resource in the home parenteral therapy
      program (HPTP). With the assistance of HPTP, patients requiring bisphosphonate treatment for
      the management of tumor-induced hypercalcemia (TIH) or malignant bone pain (MBP) could be
      treated in the community (ie at home). However, the resources required and the costs
      associated with community-based (homes, hospices, long-term care facilities) treatment of TIH
      and MBP need to be identified and evaluated so as to guide future regional decision making.
