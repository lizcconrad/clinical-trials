  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of different
      doses and several exposure times of intravitreal microplasmin in the setting of pars plana
      vitrectomy for vitreomacular traction maculopathy.

      Study drug will be administered in the mid-vitreous by injection. Patients will be enrolled
      into the cohorts in a sequential dose/time-escalating fashion. To ensure that enrolment is
      evenly balanced across eligible conditions, enrolment of any specific underlying disease type
      into any cohort will be capped at five (5) patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with vitreomacular traction maculopathy for whom vitrectomy is indicated,
             according to the principal investigator, including:

               -  Macular edema associated with vitreomacular traction (DME, VMTS);

               -  Stage II-III macular hole of &lt; 6 months duration since symptom onset;

               -  Demonstration of vitreomacular adhesion (based on preoperative optic coherence
                  tomography [OCT]) in the study eye;

               -  OCT - presence of posterior hyaloid membrane inserting on to the macula, but with
                  some area of clear separation visible between the retina and the posterior
                  hyaloid.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of fibrocellular proliferation characterized by whitish epimacular tissue
             (surface wrinkling is not an exclusion criterion).

          -  Patients with vitreous hemorrhage which precludes either of the following:
             visualization of the posterior pole by visual inspection OR adequate assessment of the
             macula by either OCT and/or fluorescein angiogram in the study eye.

          -  Patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, proliferative vitreoretinopathy
             (PVR), or retinal degenerative changes in the study eye.

          -  Patients with high myopia or aphakia in the study eye

          -  Patients with history of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the fellow eye or family
             history of retinal detachment

          -  Patients who are considered likely to require intraocular surgery in the study eye for
             any reason other than vitreomacular traction maculopathy/macular edema in the coming
             three months.

          -  Patients who have had ocular surgery in the study eye in the prior three months.

          -  Patients who have had a vitrectomy in the study eye at any time.

          -  Patients with a history of uveitis or significant trauma in the study eye.

          -  Patients who are currently being treated for glaucoma in the study eye.

          -  Patients who have had laser photocoagulation treatment in the study eye in the
             previous 3 months.

          -  Intravitreal injection of any drug in the study eye in the previous 6 months or during
             the study.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or of child-bearing potential not utilizing a form of
             contraception acceptable to the investigator.

          -  Patients who, in the investigator's view, will not complete all visits and
             investigations, including the exit visit at 6 months.

          -  Patients who have participated in an investigational drug study within the past 30
             days.

          -  HgA1c &gt; 9%.

          -  Patients with hypertension (either systolic blood pressure [SBP] &gt; 170 or diastolic
             blood pressure [DBP] &gt; 100 mm Hg).

          -  Patients with a life-expectancy less than 6 months.

          -  Patients who have previously participated in this trial.
