      This Phase I/II, multi-centered, non-randomized, trial is designed to determine a safe dose
      of PT-523 for subjects, and to make preliminary evaluations on the activity of PT-523 as
      therapy in subjects with refractory leukemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Relapsed/refractory leukemias including acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (AML), acute
             lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic
             myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP) for which no standard therapies are
             anticipated to result in a durable remission; or poor-risk myelodysplasia (MDS)
             patients to include refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or excess blasts in
             transformation (RAEBT) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who are either
             relapsed/refractory or who refuse/are not eligible for frontline therapy.

          -  Only patients with refractory ALL or CML in lymphoid blastic phase are eligible for
             phase II.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

          -  Adequate organ function and bone marrow reserve.

          -  At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from the time of major surgery.

          -  Use of appropriate contraceptive method.

          -  Signed patient informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             uncontrolled congestive heart failure.

          -  Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their leukemia
             other than corticosteriods, hydroxyurea, and 6-mercaptopurine.

          -  Any medical condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at
             an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.
