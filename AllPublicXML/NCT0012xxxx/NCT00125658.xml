    <textblock>
      The results of this study will provide sound, scientific evidence of physiologic mechanisms
      responsible for upper-extremity weakness; evidence of the processes involved in neuromuscular
      adaptation; and will elucidate the relationship between impairment and motor disability in
      post-stroke hemiparesis.

      This proposal extends the work accomplished in our initial study (project #B2405R, 'Effects
      of Strength Training on Upper-limb Function in Post-stroke Hemiparesis'). In the present
      study we will conduct a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of staged rehabilitation for
      the upper-extremity involving sequential delivery of functional therapy and high intensity
      resistance training. Therefore, this proposal directly compares the effects of functional and
      resistance training delivered individually. The researchers' previous work investigated a
      hybrid therapy of functional and resistance training against functional training alone. All
      subjects will participate in a 5 week run-in period of no treatment. This no-treatment block
      will afford multiple baseline measurements and, in addition, will provide information
      regarding the rate and magnitude of any spontaneous recovery without treatment. Following the
      second baseline measurement, all subjects will be randomized to upper-extremity
      rehabilitation in either: Order A - 10 weeks of functional task practice training (FTP)
      followed by 10 weeks of high-intensity resistance training (Power) or Order B - resistance
      training (Power) followed by FTP. Re-evaluation will occur following each block of
      treatment,and retention effects will be evaluated after 6 and 12 months with no additional
      treatment. Subjects will be evaluated with: outcome measures used broadly in Clinical
      Neurology and Rehabilitation, a battery of biomechanical performance measures including:
      strength, muscle activation, reflex modulation, and motor coordination, and with kinematics
      of free reaching movements. The researchers will investigate persons in the intermediate
      phase of recovery which they define as between 6 and 18 months post-stroke , having completed
      all inpatient and outpatient therapies, with remaining residual motor deficits.

    <measure>Change in Trunk Displacement</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Distance (in cm) of trunk lean while performing reach-to-grasp. This information is obtained from kinematics/3D motion capture and is used to inform regarding compensatory use of the trunk as compared to active motion of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand, during reach-to-grasp. Change scores are expressed relative to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment is a standardized scale used to measure the magnitude of motor impairment (severity) following stroke. There are separate sub-scales for the upper and lower extremities. Here we used the upper-extremity component; the full range of the scale is 0 - 66 points. Higher scores approaching 66 represent better, and lower scores approaching 0 worse, motor function. There is a significant ceiling effect with the FMA, thus a score of 66 points does not mean an individual with stroke has fully recovered. Data are change scores expressed relative to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Movement Accuracy (Reach Path Ratio, RPR)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measure is derived from kinematics/motion analysis. RPR = ratio of actual reach trajectory relative to an idealized straight line. Data are change scores, expressed relative to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Smoothness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 10 weeks, 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Movement smoothness is determined by assessing the number of sub movements (i.e., starts and stops) that can be identified during performance of a task. Here the task was reach-to-grasp. Sub movement are identified from kinematics/3D motion analysis. Sub-movements represent discontinuities or &quot;jerky&quot; movements. For example, skilled reaching is smooth and may reveal a single movement unit; in contrast, unskilled movements will reveal multiple movement units (i.e., starts and stops). As a performer practices and learns the movement, the number of sub movements is reduced. Sub movements can also present in persons with pathology. The unit of sub movements is whole numbers, or counts, of the sub movements. Data are change scores, expressed relative to baseline.</description>

        <title>Upper-extremity Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment</title>
        <description>The Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment is a standardized scale used to measure the magnitude of motor impairment (severity) following stroke. There are separate sub-scales for the upper and lower extremities. Here we used the upper-extremity component; the full range of the scale is 0 - 66 points. Higher scores approaching 66 represent better, and lower scores approaching 0 worse, motor function. There is a significant ceiling effect with the FMA, thus a score of 66 points does not mean an individual with stroke has fully recovered. Data are change scores expressed relative to baseline.</description>

        <title>Movement Smoothness</title>
        <description>Movement smoothness is determined by assessing the number of sub movements (i.e., starts and stops) that can be identified during performance of a task. Here the task was reach-to-grasp. Sub movement are identified from kinematics/3D motion analysis. Sub-movements represent discontinuities or &quot;jerky&quot; movements. For example, skilled reaching is smooth and may reveal a single movement unit; in contrast, unskilled movements will reveal multiple movement units (i.e., starts and stops). As a performer practices and learns the movement, the number of sub movements is reduced. Sub movements can also present in persons with pathology. The unit of sub movements is whole numbers, or counts, of the sub movements. Data are change scores, expressed relative to baseline.</description>
