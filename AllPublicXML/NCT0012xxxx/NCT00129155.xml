    <textblock>
      In this study, treosulfan is evaluated for conditioning in allogenic stem cell
      transplantation. The procedure and the follow-up are the same as in standard allogenic
      transplant.

      The donor is unrelated (identical HLA). The graft is haematological peripheral blood stem
      cell.

      The conditioning with reduced intensity is: fludarabine (from day -6 to day -2), treosulfan
      (from day -6 to day -4) and thymoglobuline (from day -2 to day -1).
