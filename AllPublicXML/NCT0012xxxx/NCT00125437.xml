  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist
      spironolactone combined with a lower dose of an ACE inhibitor is more effective in reverse
      left ventricular remodeling in severe congestive heart failure in patients with nonischemic
      cardiomyopathy.

    <textblock>
      In the investigators' recent daily clinical practice, they found that the larger dose of the
      aldosterone antagonist spironolactone combined with a lower dose of an ACE inhibitor and the
      highest tolerable dose of beta blockers could reverse left ventricular remodeling more
      effectively than a smaller dose of spironolactone. The ventricular remodeling could get back
      to normal, especially in patients with none-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The investigators
      hypothesize that long term use of a larger dose of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone
      could reverse left ventricular remodeling by stimulating new myocyte formation. Thus, they
      designed this study to verify its efficacy and safety in reversing left ventricular
      remodeling in severe congestive heart failure in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. To
      avoid hyperkalemia, the investigators routinely use larger doses of diuretics in combination
      with a lower dose of an ACE inhibitor to offset the potassium-sparing effects of
      spironolactone and follow the patients closely.
