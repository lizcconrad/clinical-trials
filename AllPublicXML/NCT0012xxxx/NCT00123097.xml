      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new rubber material used to make prosthetic
      replacements of the face lost to cancer, trauma, or birth defects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maxillofacial prosthetics is a subspecialty of prosthodontics, providing the clinical
      rehabilitation treatment of patients who have lost parts of the face due to cancer, trauma,
      or birth defects. It is an orphan field that:

        -  treats few patients, making the subspecialty unprofitable for manufacturers to develop
           new materials;

        -  offers fundamental rehabilitation and improvement in the quality of life to patients who
           may have exhausted personal or third party funding; and

        -  provides a dental solution to an essentially medical problem.

      Silicone rubber materials have been used for facial rehabilitation for more than 4 decades
      with few improvements. There is a clear need for new, alternative, and more economic
      materials for extraoral maxillofacial prostheses. Research at Gulf South Research Institute
      in New Orleans by the Principal Investigator and others in the 1970s and 1980s developed an
      alternative low-cost thermoplastic industrial rubber material (chlorinated polyethylene, CPE)
      that met all toxicological (safety) and physical (effectiveness) requirements. A Phase 2
      clinical trial at the time yielded equivocal results when compared to conventional but costly
      silicone rubber products.

      This research is a controlled, randomized, single-crossover, double-blinded
      investigator-initiated multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial treating 100 patients that
      evaluates:

        -  experimental thermoplastic CPE; and

        -  control silicone (Silastic Adhesive A/MDX4-4210) materials for non-inferiority of CPE
           based on functional and subjective characteristics, and on the quality of life.

      The clinical centers of the trial are at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and
      at the Toronto Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada.
