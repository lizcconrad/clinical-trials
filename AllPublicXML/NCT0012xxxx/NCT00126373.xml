  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the hypothesis that Wellbutrin (bupropion) can give a clinical
      remission in Crohn's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wellbutrin (bupropion) is approved for use as an antidepressant. There have been some cases
      in which people on Wellbutrin had significant improvement clinically in their Crohn's
      disease. In this trial, the hypothesis that Wellbutrin can induce clinical remission in
      Crohn's disease will be tested. The investigators will also be looking to see if Wellbutrin
      can lower levels of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate to severe Crohn's disease with 220 &lt; CDAI &lt; 400.

          -  All patients in the study must have not had any anti-TNF antibodies for at least eight
             weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they have fulminant Crohn's disease
             requiring parenteral steroid treatment, hospitalization, or need of surgery
             imminently.

          -  Patients with serious infections in the preceding three months, opportunistic
             infections within one month, or current signs or symptoms of severe, progressive or
             uncontrolled renal, hepatic, hematologic, endocrine, pulmonary, cardiac, neurological,
             or cerebral disease will be excluded.

          -  Patients will also be excluded from the study if they have a history of a seizure,
             epilepsy, presumed current central nervous system tumor, have or have had anorexia
             nervosa or bulimia, are currently taking or have taken in the last four weeks any drug
             in the monoamine oxidase inhibitor class, or are allergic to Wellbutrin.

          -  Patients with active major depression or suicidal ideation will be excluded, as will
             patients with a score of 19 or higher on the Beck depression inventory.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they are currently or have taken a medicine in the
             selective serotonin reuptake class, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, a tricyclic

             weeks.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they are currently abusing alcohol or have alcohol
             dependence.

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if their baseline liver function tests are
             greater than twice the upper limit of normal, or if a clinical investigator believes
             that their baseline chemistry, liver function tests or complete blood count
             contraindicates entry into the study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females are excluded.
