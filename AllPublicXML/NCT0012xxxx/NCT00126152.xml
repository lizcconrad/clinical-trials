      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a best practice model for
      senior falls prevention when implemented in a community setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure differences in the incidence of falls and fall risk factors among
      subjects assigned to an intervention group and a control group. Subjects in the intervention
      group will receive a multi-faceted intervention based on best practices. Subjects in the
      control group will receive written fall prevention education materials. Fall monitoring will
      be conducted for subjects in both groups.

      Specific components of the intervention will include:

        -  an individual fall risk assessment;

        -  exercise with balance and strength training;

        -  education on how to reduce falls and fall risk factors; and

        -  recommendations for medical care management of identified fall risk factors.
