      This study will evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of lamivudine therapy and the
      possibility of stopping therapy in patients whose hepatitis B is chronic, that is, long
      lasting, and which has responded to treatment. Chronic hepatitis B, caused by a virus, is a
      common form of liver disease affecting about 1 million Americans and about 5 percent of the
      world's population. Health effects include a continuous state of being infectious and the
      risk of transmitting hepatitis to other people, symptoms of liver disease, and development of
      cirrhosis-that is, severe damage to the liver-and liver cancer. Lamivudine is a medication
      that blocks hepatitis B effectively but does not make it disappear completely. Scientists
      believe that the immune system must also be active to rid the body of the last traces of
      hepatitis B.

      Patients ages 18 and older who have chronic hepatitis B and are being treated with lamivudine
      may be eligible to participate in this study. They will undergo a medical history and
      physical examination and will be given lamivudine in 100 mg tablets to be taken as one
      tablet, once each day. Patients will be asked to return to the outpatient clinic every 3
      months, when they will undergo a brief interview and measurement of vital signs-such as blood
      pressure, pulse, and body weight. During the visits, they will fill out questionnaires about
      any symptoms or side effects they have, and they will be seen by a doctor and have a brief
      medical history and examination. There will be a collection of blood for complete blood
      counts, liver enzymes, and hepatitis B virus. Extra blood tests may be done to analyze
      patients' immune reactions to hepatitis B. Patients will also receive refills of their
      lamivudine tablets. They will continue to be treated with lamivudine as long as it seems to
      control the hepatitis infection and liver disease.

      At intervals of about 1 year, patients will have ultrasound examinations, lasting about 1
      hour, of the liver and abdomen. Then at intervals of about 5 years, patients will undergo
      liver biopsies, which require a hospital stay of 2 to 3 days. A liver biopsy is done by
      passing a needle through the skin into the liver to obtain a piece of liver about 2 inches
      long and 1/16-inch in diameter. A small amount of bleeding probably occurs with most liver
      biopsies. Internal bleeding is a risk, which may require that the patient stay in the
      hospital a few days longer, for rest, observation and pain medicine. The biopsy provides
      information that proves whether lamivudine is controlling the liver disease and preventing it
      from worsening or progressing to cirrhosis.

      Side effects of lamivudine include fatigue, muscle aches, fever and chills, sore throat,
      nausea, stomach pain or cramps, and diarrhea. Serious side effects are rare, occurring in
      less than 1% of people taking lamivudine. They include inflammation of the pancreas, nerve
      damage, and buildup of lactic acid in the blood. About 25% of patients experience a temporary
      worsening, or flare, of hepatitis during the first few months of treatment. If flares are
      severe, it is important for researchers to determine whether they are caused by resistance to
      lamivudine or by the immune system acting against the hepatitis B virus or another liver
      condition. A flare of hepatitis can also occur when lamivudine is stopped, that is, a
      withdrawal. In such situations, testing for hepatitis B virus levels and other liver
      conditions is important. It may lead to other treatments or stopping lamivudine and taking
      another medication instead. While patients are participating in the study, they will have a
      careful evaluation of their hepatitis and general condition. They may have an improvement in
      their disease as a result of long-term lamivudine therapy.

      The major aims of this study are to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lamivudine
      therapy and the possibility of stopping therapy in a cohort of patients with chronic
      hepatitis B who have a maintained response to treatment. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue
      with potent activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is approved for use in the United
      States and is used extensively throughout the world to treat HBV and HIV infection.
      Lamivudine is well tolerated and adverse events are rare. Its major shortcoming is the
      development of antiviral resistance after prolonged therapy which results in loss of
      effectiveness, marked by rise in viral levels and return of disease activity. Some patients,
      however, have a maintained response to lamivudine therapy and in these individuals treatment
      is continued indefinitely or until hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is lost and therapy
      can be permanently stopped. This protocol will allow for the long-term treatment and
      evaluation of these patients. Patients will be maintained on lamivudine at a dose of 100 mg
      daily and seen every three months for interim medical history and serum testing for
      aminotransferase levels and hepatitis B markers, with liver biopsies done every 5 years.
      Lamivudine will be stopped if HBsAg is lost. The protocol also includes an option to attempt
      withdrawal of therapy under controlled conditions focusing on inducing immune reactivity to
      HBV and clearance of HBsAg. Patients will stop lamivudine for short periods (1 week, and
      later for 2, 4 and 8 weeks) and be monitored during and for 12 weeks afterwards for
      aminotransferase levels, HBV DNA levels and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to HBV antigens.
      Patients who demonstrate significant worsening of hepatitis will not undergo further attempts
      at withdrawal. The endpoint to successful therapy is defined as loss of hepatitis B surface
      antigen (HBsAg) and development of antibody (anti-HBs).
