  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, phase III trial. Patients will be stratified
      after breast surgery, as per investigational site; menopausal status; node negative
      diagnosis, as per sentinel-node technique versus lymphadenectomy; hormone receptor status
      (positive versus negative). Patients will be randomized to:

        -  FAC x 6 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 + cyclophosphamide 500
           mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, for 6 cycles.

        -  FAC x 4 (cycles) → Taxol® x 8 (cycles): 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 + doxorubicin 50 mg/m2
           + cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1, every 3 weeks, for 4 cycles, followed by 8
           administrations of weekly paclitaxel 100 mg/m2

      Premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors must receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily
      for 5 years, after the end of chemotherapy.

      Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors are allowed to receive aromatase
      inhibitors as initial adjuvant hormone therapy or after tamoxifen.

      All patients with breast conservative surgery must receive radiotherapy.

      Estimated 5-year disease-free survival in the control arm (FAC x 6) is expected to be 80%. It
      is expected that disease-free survival will increase by 5% in the experimental arm
      (FAC-paclitaxel). 906 patients per arm must be recruited, to detect this difference with an
      alpha error of 0.05 and 80% power. Assuming a 6% post-randomization drop-out rate, 960
      patients per arm are needed, 1920 in total.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             Tumors must be HER2 negative. Patients must be free of disease in the axilla (node
             negative). If lymphadenectomy is done, at least 10 nodes must be examined. If sentinel
             node technique is used, sentinel node must be free of disease. Patients must present
             at least one high risk criterion (St. Gallen, 1998) as follows:

               -  Tumor size &gt; 2 cm; and/or

               -  ER and PgR negative; and/or

               -  Histological grade 2-3; and/or

          -  Time window between surgery and study randomization must be less than 60 days.

          -  Surgery must consist of mastectomy or conservative surgery. Margins free of disease
             and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are required. Lobular carcinoma is not considered
             a positive margin.

          -  Patients must not present evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Status of hormone receptors in primary tumor. Results must be available before the end
             of adjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Status of HER2 in primary tumor, known before randomization. Patients with immune
             histochemistry (IHC) 0 or +1 are eligible. For patients with ICH 2+, fluorescent in
             situ hybridization (FISH) is mandatory and result must be negative.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 70 years old.

          -  Performance status (Karnofsky index) &gt;= 80.

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (EKG) in the 12 weeks prior to randomization. If needed,

                  10 mg/dl;

               -  Hepatic function: total bilirubin &lt;= 1 upper normal limit (UNL); SGOT and SGPT &lt;=
                  2.5 UNL; alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 2.5 UNL. If values of SGOT and SGPT &gt; 1.5 UNL
                  are associated with alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 UNL, patient is not eligible.

               -  Renal function: creatinine &lt;= 175 mmol/l (2 mg/dl); creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
                  ml/min.

          -  Complete stage workup during the 12 weeks prior to randomization (mammograms are
             allowed within a 20 week time window). All patients must have a bilateral mammogram,
             thorax x-ray, abdominal echography and/or computed tomography (CT)-scan. If bone pain,
             and/or alkaline phosphatase elevation, a bone scintigraphy is mandatory. This test is
             recommended for all patients. Other tests, as clinically indicated.

          -  Patients able to comply with treatment and study follow-up.
