    <textblock>
      Patients who have been treated in study protocol BAP089 may have responded to treatment, and
      subsequently relapsed to &gt;75% of the baseline disease severity, will be investigated for
      response to further treatment with alitretinoin. Also, patients who have responded with mild
      or moderate disease will be investigated for additional treatment effect after prolongated
      treatment.
