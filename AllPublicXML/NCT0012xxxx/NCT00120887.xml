  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease, specifically from atherosclerosis, is the major cause of mortality in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in developed countries. Coronary artery disease and stroke
      contribute to long-term morbidity in surviving patients. Atherosclerosis in SLE is
      multifactorial, with immune/inflammatory endothelial damage, traditional cardiovascular risk
      factors, and prothrombotic factors all playing important roles. Multiple groups have shown
      that hyperlipidemia is predictive of later atherosclerosis in SLE. In the general population,
      statins have become the drug of choice in preventing atherosclerotic events, through two
      mechanisms: lipid lowering that helps to prevent progression, and stabilization of plaques to
      prevent rupture. In the Lupus Atherosclerosis Prevention Trial we will determine if
      atorvastatin reduces the progression of atherosclerosis on helical computed tomography (CT)
      and carotid duplex. Recent work has confirmed that statins have an immunomodulatory role.
      This study will also determine whether statins improve clinical lupus activity or lupus
      serologies (anti-dsDNA and complement).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of SLE, confirmed by a faculty rheumatologist at
             Johns Hopkins.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  SLE patients with a known atherosclerotic event, such as angina, myocardial
             infarction, or stroke, with an abnormal lipid profile for which a statin would be
             standard of care, are excluded.

          -  Pregnant patients (or patients planning to become pregnant in the next two years) are
             excluded.

          -  Patients who have known chronic liver disease, have unexplained elevation of their
             liver enzymes greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal , or an elevated CPK
             greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal value for the patientâ€™s racial
             group, are excluded.

          -  Patients with triglycerides greater than 500 mg/dl or LDL greater than 190 in the
             absence of 2 risk factors (and who are unwilling to participate in a formal
             nutritional/lifestyle modification program that we recommend for them) are excluded.
