  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)
      as a treatment of chronic tinnitus in people with limited hearing loss. The study design is
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, with repeated measures. The null hypothesis states
      there will be no difference in subjective measures of tinnitus severity between subjects
      treated with standard TRT and subjects treated with sham TRT.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of TRT in reducing the objective magnitude of tinnitus.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of TRT in reducing the subjective awareness and impact of
           tinnitus.

        -  Determine the therapeutic time course of improvement in tinnitus.

        -  Determine the long-term improvement in tinnitus derived from TRT.
