      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effect on the pressure inside the eye
      when Brinzolamide Ophthalmic Suspension, 1% (Azopt), a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and
      Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15% (Alphagan-P), an alpha 2 agonist, are added
      to Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% (Travatan), a prostaglandin, in patients with
      primary open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension and pseudoexfoliation syndrome. Brinzolamide
      Ophthalmic Suspension, 1% (Azopt), Brimonidine Tartrate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.15%
      (Alphagan-P), and Travoprost Ophthalmic Solution, 0.004% (Travatan) are all currently
      approved by the FDA and on the market, being used by patients. Even though all three
      medications are currently approved for the purpose of the study they will be considered study
      medicines.

      Glaucoma, Ocular Hypertension and Pseudoexfoliation syndrome have been treated with
      IOP-lowering medications or surgery to lower the pressure inside the eye to reduce the risk
      of visual field loss. Today, common treatments for a patient often begins with the
      prescription of a prostaglandin (Travoprost). If the prostaglandin does not lower the
      pressure inside the eye enough, a second drug is usually added. Topical carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitors (Brinzolamide) and alpha 2 agonists (Brimonidine) are common choices as additive
      medicines.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Minimum age: 35 years

          -  Uni or bilateral primary open angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension or pseudoexfoliation
             syndrome (POAG is defined as having VF and optic nerve changes consistent with
             glaucomatous disease)

          -  Insufficient response to monotherapy: defined as IOP &gt; 18mm Hg (mean diurnal) and less
             than 32 mm Hg on Travatan at baseline

          -  Informed consent and HIPPA consent obtained at screening visit prior to any study
             events

          -  Ability to adhere to study treatment visit plan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Closed, occluded, or potentially occludable angle

          -  History of angle closure

          -  Previous intraocular surgery, except uncomplicated clear cornea phacoemulsification or
             argon laser trabeculoplasty

          -  Argon laser trabeculoplasty or phacoemulsification within the last 3 months

          -  Central corneal thickness outside the 500 â€“ 600 (inclusive) micron range as measured
             by ultrasonic pachymetry

          -  Ocular or periocular inflammation within 3 months prior to study (except blepharitis
             related or seasonal allergic conjunctivitis)

          -  History of uveitis or previous intraocular inflammation (other than post-operatively)

          -  Hypersensitivity to sulfa, alpha agonists or benzalkonium chloride

          -  History of use of any steroids for over 1 week within 3 months of screening or likely
             need for any corticosteroids during the study (except inhaled, nasal or topical
