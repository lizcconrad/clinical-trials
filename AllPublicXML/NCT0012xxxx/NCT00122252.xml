    <textblock>
      The clinical outcome after external beam irradiation for prostate cancer is disappointing in
      the advanced tumor stages. There are indications that an increase in radiation dose to the
      tumor will improve outcome significantly, especially to the biologically active tumour parts
      within the cancer area. Until recently no imaging equipment was available to define both the
      anatomic and biologically active tumor parts. Now, at the Center for Biological Imaging and
      Adaptive Radiotherapy, equipment is at hand that will be able to visualise the areas
      mentioned above. When combining the data of these imaging modalities it might be possible to
      create an optimised irradiation plan. This study is a planning study in which, on 15
      patients, the different anatomical and biological imaging data per patient will be evaluated,
      matched and finally a theoretical improved irradiation treatment plan will be made. This
      research complies with the current opinion on radiation development. Progress in functional
      imaging is likely to provide the tools required for individualised risk-adapted radiotherapy.

      Proposal:

      To investigate the possibilities to improve Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and Gross Tumour
      Volume (GTV) delineation by using the latest biological imaging modalities on 15 patients
      with prostate cancer. Our ultimate goal is to set new GTV and CTV definitions and redefine
      the choice of irradiation margins in Intensity Modulated RadioTherapy (IMRT) for prostate
      cancer. Furthermore, try to translate the functional imaging data into a Tomotherapy IMRT
      plan.

      Rationale:

      Treatment results after standard dose external beam irradiation of locally advanced prostate
      cancer are insufficient. According to RTOG-8531, RTOG-8610 and EORTC series on T1 to T4
      tumours, 5-year overall survival ranges 60 - 73% and 5-year disease free survival ranges 15 -
      67%.

      Local control can be enhanced by adjuvant androgen suppression, the 5-year disease free
      survival increases significantly to 36 - 89%. Unfortunately, androgen suppression
      significantly deteriorates quality of life.

      Increasing the irradiation dose also improves local control. However, local toxicity,
      especially rectal and bladder complications, restrict the dose which can be given with
      conformal external beam irradiation with population based uncertainty margins. Setup
      inaccuracy and organ movement determine the irradiation margins needed. Modern position
      verification techniques, e.g. using fiducial markers in the prostate in combination with
      megavoltage imaging techniques, allow a reduction of the margins and offer the possibility
      for dose escalation in the prostate. Studies of IMRT have utilised these sophisticated
      position verification techniques and this approach appears feasible. A further reduction of
      the margins, and thus a possible further increasing of the irradiation dose, can be expected
      from improving the delineation of the prostate contour. Imaging can be performed to delineate
      anatomic structures or biological processes within the intraprostatic malignant lesion.

      CT is commonly used for anatomy delineation, based on early studies. Although the image
      quality has improved gradually, unfortunately, CT still severely overestimates the prostate
      volume. Furthermore, Teh et al found in 712 prostatectomy patients large mean differences
      between CT-based estimates of the GTV and PTV and Pathological Prostate Volume (PPV). Rasch
      et al found an average ratio between CT and MRI volumes of 1.4. Also the MRI technique
      improved and now produces a much better imaging quality, e.g. by increasing Tesla, by using
      the present phased array coils and by using thinner slice thickness. The accuracy of
      detecting extracapsular extension in prostate carcinoma with endorectal and phased-array coil
      MR imaging reaches 77% for experienced readers. Concluding, MRI is superior to CT in GTV
      contouring, but MRI alone (using combined T1 SE and T2 TSE) may not be sufficient for
      visualisation of the GTV. It is expected that biological imaging will improve GTV delineation
      further. Within the GTV a Biological Target Volume (BTV) will become visible, which may
      further improve the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy.

      In biological imaging the use of the different imaging techniques have yet to be explored.
      Currently, there are two topics of importance. The first topic is perfusion. In prostate
      cancer, the degree of vascularisation appears to correlate with aggressive behaviour and risk
      of metastasis. In prostate cancer approximately two times as many microvessels exist in the
      malignant tissue compared to normal tissues. Furthermore, in benign tissues the capillaries
      are restricted for the most part to the periglandular stroma immediately adjacent to the
      epithelium, whereas the distribution in carcinoma appears to be more random. Differences in
      perfusion have been shown to correlate with active prostate cancer areas. Dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI is able to show the microvessel density (MVD) in the prostate. Second
      is the metabolic activity in prostate cancer. The ratios of choline and creatine (normal
      value 0.22 +/- 0.13 ppm) reveals metabolic active prostate cancer tissue. Increased choline
      and/or a reduced citrate indicate prostate cancer. The ratio of choline and creatine-to
      citrate is related to the Gleason score of the tumour. Concluding, MRI and MRS allow combined
      structural and metabolic evaluation of prostate cancer location, aggressiveness and stage.
      The same could be performed using combined CT and PET. Sutinen et al found a clear evidence
      for detecting areas with [11C] choline in prostate cancer using PET. To our knowledge no data
      exist comparing [11C] choline PET and MRS in prostate cancer. The technology for biological
      imaging remains in evolution, and continued advances in accuracy and can be expected.

      Therefore, given the current inadequacies in the state of art of defining GTV and CTV in
      prostate cancer, we propose a study on prostate visualisation using the latest anatomical and
      biological (metabolic) imaging modalities. Combining the information of different imaging
      techniques by introducing a BTV and through image fusion is likely to improve CTV and GTV
      delineation. This will allow us to redefine the choice of margins. Finally, this will result
      in an improved IMRT plan, where dose painting and dose escalation of the GTV is the ultimate
      goal. This complies with the current opinion on radiation development. Progress in functional
      imaging is likely to provide the tools required for individualised risk-adapted radiotherapy.

      By introducing a BTV within the GTV a non-uniform CTV delineation can be used and thus
      margins can be minimised. This allows further escalation of the dose. Setup inaccuracy and
      organ movement further determine the irradiation margins needed. Therefore, controlling day
      to day position variability together with the delivery of optimised conformal irradiation
      will be the next goals to set. Helical Tomotherapy is a novel approach to the delivery of
      radiation for cancer treatment, which will be able to do both. It relies on a 6 MV linear
      accelerator for treatment purposes and a 3.5 MV-CT scan for imaging purposes. Both are
      mounted on a ring gantry that rotates around the patient as he advances through the ring. A
      64-leaf collimator defines the radiation fan beam. In a theoretical study Helical Tomotherapy
      plans required minimal operator interaction and resulted in excellent sparing of normal
      structures in prostate IMRT. Therefore, in this study we also propose to fuse the anatomic an
      biologic imaging data with a Tomotherapy MV-CT and make a inverse IMRT Tomotherapy plan. This
      planning exercise will precede a feasibility study on functional imaging and individualised
      day to day adapted radiotherapy by Tomotherapy.

      Hypotheses:

        -  It will be possible, using biological (MRS) imaging data and anatomical (CT and MRI)
           imaging data, to define a BTV within the GTV.

        -  By introducing a BTV within the GTV a non-uniform CTV delineation can be used and
           margins can be minimised.

        -  It will be possible to translate the fused anatomic and biologic imaging data into a
           clinically sufficient Tomotherapy IMRT plan.

      Patients and methods:

      Patients who are to receive external beam irradiation for prostate cancer (Stage T1-4 N0/x
      M0), preferably not treated with anti-androgens and without metal hip prosthesis will be
      approached to participate in this pilot study. The study will be performed on 15 patients who
      will receive imaging additionally to the irradiation treatment.

      Before start of treatment patients will receive a 3T MRI (T1 SE and T2 TSE), an MRS
      determining the choline creatine levels in the prostate. Furthermore, an MV-CT will be made
      as a prelude to future position verification studies. All images (CT, MRI and MRS) will be
      matched. These combined data will be used to determine an optimal Tomotherapy IMRT plan.

      Patients will be treated according to the current department protocol. This study is only an
      imaging / treatment planning study. No changes in treatment will be made based on the
      obtained imaging data set. The risk for the patients will be negligible. From the MV-CT
      approximately 1 cGy. The MRI will be performed without contrast (so no dynamic gadolinium
      enhanced MRI to evaluate perfusion distribution) to limit the patient burden and risk.
      Regarding the total irradiation dose of 7200 till 8200 cGy to the patient this additional
      risk is negligible. The current waiting time for the patient to start with radiotherapy is
      approximately 5 to 6 weeks. In this waiting time the imaging studies will be performed, so
      participation to the study will not result in any treatment delay for the patient. The MV-CT
      scan will take approximately 30 minutes to perform and the combined MRI/MRS approximately 1
      hour.

      The Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton facilitates all necessary imaging techniques: a 3T
      MRI, MRS and a Helical Tomotherapy Unit (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison).

      It is not necessary to determine specificity and accuracy of the imaging modalities. The
      imaging here is only meant to assist in determining the metabolic and anatomic tumour areas
      in the prostate. Missing a tumour part is not a problem yet because the whole prostate is
      being treated to the minimal required dose. Overdosage on prostate tissue is not a clinical
      problem.
