      The purpose of this study is to obtain data investigating the safety and efficacy of
      eszopiclone for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related sleep
      disturbance and the impact of improved sleep with eszopiclone treatment on neuroendocrine
      correlates of PTSD. The investigators hypothesize that eszopiclone will be significantly more
      effective than placebo and well tolerated for PTSD-related sleep disturbance, improvement in
      sleep will be associated with improvement in overall PTSD symptoms, and patients with
      PTSD-related sleep disturbances will have abnormal levels of stress hormones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by three symptom groupings:
      re-experiencing symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive memories;
      physiological hyperarousal; and avoidance symptoms. Of the three major categories of symptoms
      in PTSD listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, sleep-related
      problems are listed in two of them: difficulty falling asleep is considered an aspect of
      hyperarousal symptoms, and nightmares are a type of re-experiencing symptom. Both are found
      commonly in PTSD. Little is known about the relationship of neuroendocrine dysregulation in
      PTSD and sleep disturbance. It is possible that successful treatment of sleep disturbance in
      PTSD may alter an abnormal stress hormone pattern. The novel cyclopyrrolone hypnotic
      eszopiclone thus presents an intriguing opportunity to examine the treatment of sleep
      disturbances and nightmares in PTSD. This study will determine the safety, efficacy and
      impact on neuroendocrine parameters of eszopiclone compared to placebo for sleep disturbance
      and overall PTSD symptoms in individuals with PTSD and reported sleep disturbance.

    <description>The SPRINT is a 8-item, clinician-administered scale assessing core and related symptoms of PTSD. Symptoms are rates on 5 point scales from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) where a higher value indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a highly detailed measure of the presence and severity of the DSM-IV PTSD criteria. The severity score was calculated by adding up the frequency score (scale 0 = &quot;none of the time&quot; to 4 = &quot;most or all of the time&quot;) and an intensity score (scale 0 = &quot;none&quot; to 4 = &quot;extreme&quot;), which can then be summed for all 17 symptom questions and/or for the three symptom clusters. Scores range from 0 to 136, where greater than or equal to 80 represents extreme PTSD symptomatology. In this case, the total score for all 17 symptom questions, which is also the sum of the three symptom clusters, is used.</description>

        <title>Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</title>
        <description>The CAPS is a highly detailed measure of the presence and severity of the DSM-IV PTSD criteria. The severity score was calculated by adding up the frequency score (scale 0 = &quot;none of the time&quot; to 4 = &quot;most or all of the time&quot;) and an intensity score (scale 0 = &quot;none&quot; to 4 = &quot;extreme&quot;), which can then be summed for all 17 symptom questions and/or for the three symptom clusters. Scores range from 0 to 136, where greater than or equal to 80 represents extreme PTSD symptomatology. In this case, the total score for all 17 symptom questions, which is also the sum of the three symptom clusters, is used.</description>
