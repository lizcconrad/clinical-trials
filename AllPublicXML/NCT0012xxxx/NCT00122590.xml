  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Cophar2 study is a trial which evaluates repeated early therapeutic drug monitoring,
      from weeks 2 to 24, after the initiation of HAART including either indinavir/r, lopinavir/r
      or the new 625 mg formulation of nelfinavir twice-a-day (bid). If trough concentrations were
      out of the range given for each protease inhibitor (PI), the PI dose was adjusted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the large pharmacokinetic inter-patient variability of protease inhibitors (PI),
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of protease inhibitor (PI) has been proposed to improve
      efficacy and tolerance of PI-containing HAART. The objective of the Cophar2 trial is to
      evaluate the feasibility and the impact of an early therapeutic drug monitoring in PI-naive
      HIV-1 infected patients in order to warrant virological success and safety of HAART.

      It is a prospective, open, multicenter trial with repeated early TDM (weeks 2, 8 or 16, 24)
      after the initiation of HAART including either indinavir/r (IDV), lopinavir/r (LPV) or the
      new 625 mg formulation of nelfinavir (NFV) bid. It was planned to include 99 PI-na√Øve HIV-1
      infected patients over 18 years old, 33 for each PI. Concentrations were measured by HPLC in
      each center. If trough concentrations were out of the range of 150-500, 2500-7000 or
      1500-5500 ng/ml for IDV, LPV and NFV respectively, the PI doses were adjusted possibly more
      than once during the first 24 weeks of follow-up. Adjustments were done by steps of one pill
      (200, 133/33 or 250 mg for IDV, LPV/r or NFV, respectively) bid. Failure of the strategy was
      defined by either two consecutive viral loads over 200 copies/ml between weeks 16 and 48, or
      a validated PI-related adverse event grade III or IV or a grade II diarrhoea or renal
      lithiasis. Patients without adverse events before week 16 were defined as assessable if they
      had at least the virological assessment of week 16.
