  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Myobloc in ALS patients
      who are having excessive drooling.

      The primary goal of the study is to determine if the patient perceives a benefit from the
      Myobloc in controlling excessive drooling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary goals of this study are to:

        -  determine the safety of bilateral injections of Myobloc into the parotid and
           submandibular glands as an effort to control sialorrhea;

        -  determine by objective measures if the Myobloc injection decreases the saliva produced;

        -  determine caregiver perceived benefit from Myobloc injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of probable or definite ALS based on current World Federation of Neurology
             criteria

          -  Between the ages of 21-85, inclusive

          -  Sialorrhea refractory to treatment with at least two anticholinergic medications OR
             has been intolerant of anticholinergic medications due to side effects

          -  Capable of giving informed consent

          -  Must be able to attend all study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has any uncontrolled significant medical, psychiatric or neurological disease
             (other than ALS) over the past 30 days

          -  History of ongoing substance abuse

          -  History of non-compliance with treatment in other experimental protocols

          -  Cannot provide informed consent or comply with evaluation procedures

          -  Has received any form of botulinum toxin in the past for any indication

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or of child bearing potential not using an adequate
             form of birth control

          -  Currently being treated with coumadin

          -  Forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;40% of predicted unless the tidal volume is &gt; 600cc, as
             patients with significant bulbar weakness may show a falsely low FVC due to bulbar
             muscle spasticity
