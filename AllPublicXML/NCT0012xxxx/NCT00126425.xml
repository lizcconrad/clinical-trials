    <textblock>
      The study is designed to study the utility of 123I-mIBG as a diagnostic imaging agent to
      predict cardiac outcomes in subjects with heart failure and in comparison to subjects without
      cardiovascular disease.

    <measure>Relationship Between the Occurrence of Adverse Cardiac Event and 123I-mIBG Uptake on Planar Scintigraphy Categorized as High or Low Heart to Mediastinum (H/M) Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 months from the date of administration of 123I-mIBG</time_frame>
    <description>H/M ratio for 123I-mIBG uptake at 3 hours 50 minutes post administration was calculated by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium region of interest (ROI) by the counts/pixel in the 7x7 pixel mediastinal ROI. Assessments were done by 3 independent readers. H/M ratios were categorized as 'Low' and 'High' based on being &lt;1.6 or ≥1.6 respectively. The efficacy of 123I-mIBG was based on the prognostic value of the imaging data collected relative to time to adverse cardiac events.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Of 587 participants, 6 were withdrawn prior to receiving investigational medicinal product (IMP). A total of 581 participants (533 Heart Failure [HF] and 48 control), were dosed at the 54 centers. However, one of these participants was administered 123I-mIBG not manufactured by the sponsor, and therefore excluded from all analyses.</pre_assignment_details>

            <groups_desc>Analysis based on Reader A readings. Data analysis to assess the relative hazard of an adverse cardiac event was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard (risk) of an event for a participant with low H/M at time “t” was expressed as Hl (t)/ Hh (t) = Ψ, where Hl (t) and Hh (t) denote the hazard of an event at time t for participants with low H/M and high H/M respectively.</groups_desc>
