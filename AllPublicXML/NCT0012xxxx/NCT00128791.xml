  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction, there is a total occlusion of a
      coronary artery. Even after emergency catheterization and angioplasty, in some patients, the
      resumed blood flow is suboptimal and impacts on heart function. The study is aimed at
      examining whether nitroprusside, an anti-hypertension medication, given directly into the
      coronary artery, can improve the blood flow after the removal of the obstruction that caused
      the infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate myocardial tissue perfusion despite successful relief of the culprit occlusion and
      restoration of epicardial coronary flow for ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) results in poor outcome. The investigators hypothesized that nitroprusside (NTP)
      injected intracoronary immediately before angioplasty might prevent no-reflow and improve
      vessel flow and myocardial perfusion.
