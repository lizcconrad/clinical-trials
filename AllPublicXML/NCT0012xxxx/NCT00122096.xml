  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery initiates a complex cascade of events involving the release of chemical compounds
      from nerve endings and damaged tissue which leads to an inflammatory and pain response. The
      purpose of this investigation is to measure various chemical mediators in the blood and
      cerebrospinal fluid, and to test the hypothesis that they will be decreased in patients
      treated with a COX-2 inhibitor.

      Surgery initiates a complex cascade of events involving the release of nociceptive compounds
      from nerve endings and damaged tissue which leads to an inflammatory and hyperalgesic
      response. COX-2 inhibitors are often used for treating pain. This is a double-blind
      randomized study in surgical patients receiving a spinal drain for surgical purposes. The
      hypothesis is that valdecoxib will reach therapeutic concentrations in CSF, and will decrease
      plasma and CSF concentrations of inflammatory mediators. Subjects will receive valdecoxib 40
      mg or placebo approximately 1 hr prior to surgery. Serial blood and CSF samples will be
      obtained. Valdecoxib and cytokine concentrations will be measured.
