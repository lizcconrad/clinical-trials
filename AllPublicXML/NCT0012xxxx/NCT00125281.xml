  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) on itching and fatigue in
      patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, a disease of the small bile ducts in the liver.
      Ursodiol, the only currently available treatment for biliary cirrhosis, does not cure the
      disease, and many people continue to have symptoms or liver test abnormalities despite
      treatment. SAMe is a naturally occurring substance found in most cells of the body. The
      highest levels of the substance are produced by the liver, where it helps to rid the body of
      toxins and breakdown products of metabolism. Studies in Europe suggest that SAMe may help to:
      1) decrease the fatigue and itching that are common in persons with liver problems, and 2)
      decrease levels of liver enzymes in the blood, suggesting that it may decrease the amount of
      liver injury.

      Patients 21 years of age or older with primary biliary cirrhosis who are taking ursodiol and
      have symptoms of itching or fatigue may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened
      with a medical history, physical examination, review of medical records, routine blood tests,
      and a symptoms rating scale.

      Participants stop all medications for itching 4 weeks before starting the study, but continue
      to take ursodiol during the 42-week trial. On entering the study, patients are assigned to
      take either SAMe or placebo tablets twice a day for 12 weeks. While taking the medications,
      they are followed in the clinic every 2 weeks for the first month and then every 4 weeks to
      fill out symptoms questionnaires and have a short medical evaluation and blood tests. At the
      end of 12 weeks, treatment is interrupted for a 2-week &quot;wash-out&quot; period, after which
      patients begin a 12-week crossover treatment; that is, patients who were taking SAMe are
      switched to placebo, and those who were taking placebo are switched to SAMe.

      After completing the second 12-week treatment course, patients come to the clinic at 4, 8,
      and 12 weeks to fill out symptoms questionnaires and have a medical evaluation and blood
      tests. At the last visit, patients are told which type of tablet they received during the two
      courses of treatment. SAMe is available without prescription in many forms as an
      over-the-counter medication.

      To assess the efficacy of S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) in symptomatic relief of primary
      biliary cirrhosis (PBC), we will treat up to 50 patients with either SAM-e (800 mg BID) or
      placebo for 12 weeks in a cross-over, double-blind placebo-controlled study.

      S-adenosyl methionine is a nutritional supplement which is available as an over-the-counter
      formula and is used for treatment of depression and arthritic pain. SAMe is produced in
      virtually all cells and participates in many biochemical pathways as a major methyl
      contributor. Intracellular levels of SAMe are often decreased in advanced liver disease. At
      present SAMe is undergoing extensive evaluation in a large multicenter, randomized controlled
      trial as an adjunctive therapy of alcoholic liver disease. SAMe has also been evaluated in
      patients with intrahepatic cholestasis and cholestasis of pregnancy with promising effects of
      relieving pruritus and fatigue and improving serum liver associated enzymes.

      In this study, we will recruit patients with PBC who have pruritus or fatigue despite therapy
      with ursodiol (the currently recommended therapy of PBC which is partially effective in
      relieving pruritus and fatigue). After medical evaluation and a brief period of monitoring,
      patients will be randomized to receive either SAMe or placebo given in oral form in similar
      appearing capsules twice daily. Patients will be followed at regular intervals for symptoms
      as monitored by validated questionnaires as well as for side effects and serum biochemical
      and hematological tests. After 12 weeks, therapy will be withdrawn for 2 weeks and patients
      will then be switched to the alternative capsules, either SAMe or placebo, for another 12
      weeks. The primary endpoints of therapy will be improvements in symptoms of pruritus or
      fatigue or both. Secondary endpoints will be improvements in serum biochemical liver related
      enzymes.
