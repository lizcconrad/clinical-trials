  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to determine if injections of leptin would improve vascular
      function in normal-weight, healthy volunteers.

      The researchers plan to enroll a total of 15 non-obese (BMI &lt; 27 kg/m2) otherwise healthy
      adults into a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study of the impact of recombinant
      methionyl human leptin 0.2 mg/kg SC, hereafter called rL, (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, Calif)
      versus placebo SC (sorbitol and sodium acetate, pH 4.0 of same volume) in 15 non-obese
      adults. Subjects will have baseline vascular studies performed by brachial artery
      ultrasonography-flow-mediated dilatation and nitroglycerin mediated dilatation and blood
      drawn for measures of leptin levels. They will then receive rL SC or placebo SC (randomized
      order). They will then have vascular studies performed and blood levels drawn every 2 hours
      for 6 hours total. After completion of day 1, patients will return 1-4 weeks later and repeat
      the protocol crossed-over to the alternate intervention (rL or placebo).
