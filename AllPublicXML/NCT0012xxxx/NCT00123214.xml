  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      This pilot study included 18 medical residents at two academic medical centers in New York
      City. All residents who participated in the study were assigned to work a night shift
      schedule for two weeks, and began the study on the morning prior to their first evening
      shift. The study subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups:

        -  Intervention diet -- consisting of 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fat with 2.4g
           of long chain fatty acid supplements (n=9) Total calories for males was 1600/day, and
           1200/day for females

        -  Control group -- ad lib diet.

      Main outcome measures included:

        -  weight

        -  resting metabolic rate

        -  percent body fat

        -  lipid profile

        -  CRP

        -  fasting glucose and insulin levels

        -  urinary neurotransmitter levels

        -  salivary cortisol

        -  six cognitive tests of memory, attention, and executive function.

      Subjects were tested on day 1, 7, and 14 of the study.
