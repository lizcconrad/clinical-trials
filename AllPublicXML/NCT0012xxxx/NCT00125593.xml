  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chief aim of SHARP was to determine whether lowering blood LDL cholesterol with
      simvastatin (20mg) plus ezetimibe (10mg) daily could safely reduce the risk of coronary heart
      disease, non-hemorrhagic stroke and the need for revascularization procedures in patients
      with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It also aimed to assess whether lowering LDL cholesterol
      reduced the rate of loss of renal function in people with CKD who had not commenced dialysis
      treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SHARP (Study of Heart and Renal Protection) was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial
      which aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of reducing LDL cholesterol in more than 9,000
      patients with chronic kidney disease (about 3,000 of whom were on dialysis at randomization).

      Patients were randomly assigned to simvastatin 20 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus
      matching placebo (a subset of these patients had previously received simvastatin 20mg only
      and were then randomly re-assigned to receive simvastatin 20mg plus ezetimibe 10mg or placebo
      at one year). Details of the SHARP trial design and methods have been reported previously
      (reference: Am Heart J 2010; 160:785-94.).

      SHARP was overseen by an independent Steering Committee that included nephrologists,
      cardiologists, clinical trialists, and statisticians, with 2 non-voting observers from the
      main funder (Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals). The independent sponsor was the
      University of Oxford, and the trial was funded by Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, the
      Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation and the
      UK Medical Research Council.

      In October 2009, the Steering Committee decided (blind to the effects of study treatment on
      clinical outcomes) to change the original protocol-specified primary outcome to a revised key
      outcome of major atherosclerotic events, defined as the combination of non-fatal myocardial
      infarction, coronary death, ischemic stroke, or any revascularization procedure (i.e.
      exclusion of non-coronary cardiac deaths and strokes confirmed to be hemorrhagic from the
      original major vascular event outcome). These and other changes are described in the revised
      statistical analysis plan for SHARP (reference: Am Heart J 2010; 160:785-94.). Accordingly,
      the chief emphasis of the published results (reference: Lancet 2011; 377:2181-92) is on the
      revised pre-specified key outcome of first major atherosclerotic events.

    <description>Major coronary events defined as coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction adjudicated based on the presence of serial changes in cardiac biomarkers (e.g. troponin, creatine kinase), typical ECG changes and typical cardiac symptoms. If myocardial infarction was fatal and post-mortem examination findings were available, this information was also assessed. All potential coronary events were adjudicated, using pre-specified objective criteria, by clinicians blinded to study treatment allocation and lipid levels.

    <description>Stroke was defined as rapid onset of focal or global neurological deficit, with duration greater than 24 hours. Clinical notes and brain imaging were sought to determine the stroke etiology, and if the stroke was fatal and post-mortem examination findings were available, this information was also assessed. All potential stroke events (including transient ischemic attack and intracerebral hemorrhage) were adjudicated, using pre-specified objective criteria, by clinicians blinded to study treatment allocation and lipid levels.

    <description>Revascularization included any arterial revascularization procedure, whether surgical or percutaneous, but excluded revascularization performed for hemodialysis vascular access (e.g. fistuloplasty) or to the donor kidney transplant artery. Revascularization included amputations for vascular disease (rather than for trauma or infection). All potential revascularization events (including angiography) were adjudicated, using pre-specified objective criteria, by clinicians blinded to study treatment allocation and lipid levels.

        <description>Major coronary events defined as coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction adjudicated based on the presence of serial changes in cardiac biomarkers (e.g. troponin, creatine kinase), typical ECG changes and typical cardiac symptoms. If myocardial infarction was fatal and post-mortem examination findings were available, this information was also assessed. All potential coronary events were adjudicated, using pre-specified objective criteria, by clinicians blinded to study treatment allocation and lipid levels.

        <description>Stroke was defined as rapid onset of focal or global neurological deficit, with duration greater than 24 hours. Clinical notes and brain imaging were sought to determine the stroke etiology, and if the stroke was fatal and post-mortem examination findings were available, this information was also assessed. All potential stroke events (including transient ischemic attack and intracerebral hemorrhage) were adjudicated, using pre-specified objective criteria, by clinicians blinded to study treatment allocation and lipid levels.
