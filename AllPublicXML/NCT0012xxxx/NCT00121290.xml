    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of SJG-136 in treating patients
      with solid tumors that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of SJG-136 in patients
      with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      II. Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug and its metabolites in these
      patients.

      II. Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with clinical effects of this drug in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes once daily on days 1-3. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic
             or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective

          -  Prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy allowed

          -  Time interval must be at least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, 6
             weeks if the last regimen included BCNU or mitomycin C

          -  Radiation therapy to &lt; 25% of hematopoietic bone marrow is allowed

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than three months

          -  Recovered from prior therapy

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study

             symptoms are considered clinically insignificant or irrelevant to this study),
             patients may not have baseline organ dysfunction or symptoms that qualify as Grade 2
             or greater by CTC AE v. 3.0

          -  No other chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery for cancer (including
             resection of any metastases), specific antitumor therapy, or experimental medications
             will be permitted while the patients are participating in this study

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Palliative radiation therapy is not allowed
