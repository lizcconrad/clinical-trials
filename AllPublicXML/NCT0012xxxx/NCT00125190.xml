      This study is intended to assess the effects of once daily dosing of recombinant human
      insulin-like growth factor (rhIGF-1) in increasing height velocity.

      Growth failure associated with primary IGF-1 deficiency (IGFD). Primary IGFD is a term that
      has been used to describe patients with intrinsic cellular defects in growth hormone (GH)
      action. In this protocol, primary IGFD is defined as short stature (&lt;-2 standard deviations
      [SDs] below the mean for age and gender), and abnormal serum IGF-1 (&lt;-2 SDs below the mean
      for age and gender).

      The trial is an open-label, concentration-controlled trial conducted at up to 20 centers
      throughout the United States.
