  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the effects of two new anticancer drugs,
      erlotinib (Tarceva) and bexarotene (Targretin), when treating patients with advanced lung
      cancer.

      Erlotinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bexarotene is approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This combination of drugs is experimental.

      This is a single institution open label phase II trial. Consecutive, eligible patients
      presenting with the diagnosis of advanced NSCLC are to be enrolled in this study. All
      eligible patients will receive continuous daily oral erlotinib 150 mg (Tarceva™) with daily
      bexarotene oral capsules 400 mg/m2 (Targretin®). The two agents will be taken at the same
      time. We anticipate the maximum accrual of 40 patients to this trial.

      Patients will be evaluated by history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment every
      4 weeks. Radiographic disease assessments by chest radiograph will be obtained every 4 weeks
      and computer tomography every 8 weeks or longer if clinically indicated. Whole body PET scan
      will be obtained at 10 days and 8 weeks. All radiographic studies will be sent to Medical
      Metrix Solutions (MMS) for an independent radiographic review of tumor response.
