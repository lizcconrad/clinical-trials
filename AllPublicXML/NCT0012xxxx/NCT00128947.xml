  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how people differ in the way their bodies process and eliminate
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), a drug that is used to treat problems affecting the eye and
      immune system and to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients. MMF is metabolized by a
      group of enzymes called UGTs, each of which is made by a different gene. This study will
      investigate whether people with different UGT genes differ in how well their bodies use and
      remove MMF. The results may help scientists learn the best way to give MMF to patients.

      Normal healthy volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine
      tests, including a blood test for analysis of genes that control and regulate UGTs. Pregnant
      women and nursing mothers are excluded from the study. Women who are able to have a child and
      men who can father a child must either abstain from sex or use two reliable forms of birth
      control during the study and for 3 months after its completion.

      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center at 6:30 a.m. on the first day of the study and
      stay in the outpatient clinic for 12 hours. The next 4 mornings, they return to the Clinical
      Center for a single blood collection. The procedures for the 5 days are as follows:

      Day 1

      Upon arrival at the Clinical Center a catheter is inserted into the subject's arm vein. At
      7:00 AM, the subject takes one dose of MMF by mouth with a glass of water. Small blood
      samples are collected through the catheter before the MMF dose and again at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2,
      3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after taking the drug. Heart rate and blood pressure are
      measured before the blood collection and then every 4 hours. After the last blood sample is
      collected, the volunteer can return home.

      Days 2-5

      Volunteers come to the Clinical Center at 7:00 AM on study days 2, 3, 4, and 5 for a single
      blood draw, collected using a needle.

      Volunteers are contacted by telephone 1, 2, and 3 months after completing the study to see
      how they are doing and to check on their pregnancy status and use of appropriate birth
      control.

    <textblock>
      The immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is metabolized by several uridine
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), among which UGT1A9 is the most important enzyme.
      Two commonly occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the
      UGT1A9 gene have been shown to enhance UGT1A9 protein level and activity in vitro. This study
      is to investigate the potential in vivo effects of these two SNPs on the metabolism and hence
      the pharmacokinetics of MMF metabolites. One hundred and thirty healthy volunteers will be
      screened for the presence of UGT1A9 C-2152T and T-275A polymorphisms. Seventeen subjects who
      carry the variant alleles, along with 17 others who do not have the polymorphisms, will be
      selected to participate in the pharmacokinetic study. Pharmacokinetics of the metabolites
      mycophenolic acid (active) and mycophenolate 7-O-phenolic glucuronide (inactive) will be
      determined, and parameter values will be compared between the two groups. It is hypothesized
      that the metabolism of MMF is enhanced in subjects with the two SNPs, resulting in an
      increase in clearance and a decrease in the exposure of mycophenolic acid.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Normal healthy volunteers who are in good health as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, and baseline laboratory tests

          -  Age 18 - 55

             bearing potential, and for sexually active males who have the potential to father a
             child. Barrier or non-hormonal methods will be allowed during the study, whereas the
             use of oral, injectable, or implantable hormones will be prohibited since drug
             interaction is known to occur between oral contraceptives and mycophenolate mofetil.
