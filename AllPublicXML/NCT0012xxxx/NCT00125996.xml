  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-center, randomised, single-blind (physician), prospective, controlled study to
      assess the acute (8 weeks) and chronic (16 weeks) effects of intravenous (IV) iron sucrose
      supplementation in anaemic and non-anaemic iron deficient patients with chronic heart failure
      (CHF).

      The hypotheses are:

        -  Treatment of anaemic and non-anaemic iron-deficient CHF patients with IV iron sucrose
           improves exercise capacity as measured by peak VO2.

        -  IV iron sucrose is safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe CHF.

      Study Phase and Design:

      Prospective two-centre, randomized, controlled, open-label, observer-blinded, parallel-group
      study

      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) iron supplementation on exercise tolerance, as
      determined by peak VO2.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effects of IV iron supplementation on exercise duration, left
           ventricular (LV) structure and function, symptom status (NYHA class, Minnesota Living
           with Heart Failure Questionnaire [MLHFQ], and subjective fatigue score), and
           haematological and biochemical (haemoglobin [Hb], haematocrit [Hct], iron status, N-BNP,
           cytokines and oxidative stress) indices.

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of IV iron in subjects with moderate to severe CHF.

      Sample Size:

      42 subjects (28 IV iron, 14 placebo); 50% anaemic and 50% non-anaemic
