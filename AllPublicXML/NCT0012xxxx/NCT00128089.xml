      This is a preliminary trial of a new dietary approach to the treatment of obesity related
      type 2 diabetes.

      Study terminated December 19, 2005 for administrative reasons.

      Traditional dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes is complicated and often fails.

      This is a dietary treatment that uses fingerstick testing of blood sugars and a remarkably
      simple algorithm to promptly lower the blood glucose to treatment goals.

      A series of 10 overweight type 2 diabetic patients not well controlled, or needing medication
      for control, will be recruited to follow this plan; followup is to be until 6 months after
      the last patient is enrolled, or when all patients have normal A1Cs with no medication,
      whichever comes first.

      Primary endpoints to be measured are A1C, weight loss (in pounds and BMI reduction) and
      medication reduction. Secondary endpoints are occurrences of hypoglycemia, reduction of
      medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and patient satisfaction. As this is a Phase
      1 trial, the only control group is historical controls (the patients themselves and the
      medical literature).
