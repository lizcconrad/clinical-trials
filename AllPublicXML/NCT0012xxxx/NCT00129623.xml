  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Bonviva 150mg once monthly
      compared with placebo in post-menopausal women with osteopenia. Patients will be randomized
      to receive either Bonviva 150mg po monthly, or placebo monthly. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is 1-2 years, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Relative Change From Baseline in Mean Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of the Lumbar Spine (L2 to L4) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>BMD was measured by a single dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the lumbar spine at the time of screening and at Month 12. A BMD measurement was considered unsuitable in case of detection of a fracture, an osteoarthritic process, or a scanning artifact that could not be removed to such a degree that accurate measurement of BMD would be considered jeopardized by the central reading center. The change in BMD was defined as the relative difference between the last individual measurement available at 12 months and Baseline, using the following formula: Relative change = 100 x (BMD at 1 year - BMD at baseline) / (BMD at baseline)</description>

    <description>BMD was measured by a single dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the lumbar spine at the time of screening and at Month 12. A BMD measurement was considered unsuitable in case of detection of a fracture, an osteoarthritic process, or a scanning artifact that could not be removed to such a degree that accurate measurement of BMD would be considered jeopardized by the central reading center. The absolute change from Baseline in mean BMD of the lumbar spine (L2-L4) was measured as g/cm^2 and summarized using descriptive statistics.</description>

    <measure>Relative Change From Baseline in Mean Proximal Femur BMD at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>BMD was measured by a single DEXA scan of the proximal femur at the time of screening and at Month 12. The relative (%) change from Baseline in BMD of the proximal femur (total hip, trochanter, femoral neck) at Month 12 was summarized using descriptive statistics. BMD of fractured bones that could impact the scan area were not taken into account.</description>

    <measure>Relative Change From Baseline in Serum C-telopeptide Crosslinks of Type 1 Collagen (CTX)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of serum CTX (sCTX), which is a biochemical marker of bone resorption. Relative change from baseline of sCTX after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment was summarized using descriptive statistics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Responders</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent responders were defined as follows: Participants with a) lumbar spine (LS) BMD, equal to or above Baseline at Month 12 b) proximal femur BMD, equal to or above Baseline at Month 12 c) Both lumbar spine and proximal femur BMD, equal or above Baseline at Month 12. BMD of the lumbar spine was defined as the BMD of at least two vertebrae (L2-L4) that were not fractured and not affected by an osteoarthritic process, or a scanning artifact that could not be removed to such a degree that accurate measurement of BMD would be considered jeopardized by the central reading center. Proximal femur included total hip, trochanter and femoral neck sites.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 days after end of study treatment (Approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who is administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Marked Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood for laboratory tests was taken at screening and immediately before participants received their monthly study medication at months 3, 6, and 12. The laboratory tests included: Hematology [white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, hematocrit, and hemoglobin] and Chemistry [albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total calcium, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and chloride].</description>

        <title>Relative Change From Baseline in Mean Bone Mineral Density (BMD) of the Lumbar Spine (L2 to L4) at Month 12</title>
        <description>BMD was measured by a single dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan of the lumbar spine at the time of screening and at Month 12. A BMD measurement was considered unsuitable in case of detection of a fracture, an osteoarthritic process, or a scanning artifact that could not be removed to such a degree that accurate measurement of BMD would be considered jeopardized by the central reading center. The change in BMD was defined as the relative difference between the last individual measurement available at 12 months and Baseline, using the following formula: Relative change = 100 x (BMD at 1 year - BMD at baseline) / (BMD at baseline)</description>

        <description>Fasting blood samples were collected from participants for analysis of serum CTX (sCTX), which is a biochemical marker of bone resorption. Relative change from baseline of sCTX after 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment was summarized using descriptive statistics.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who is administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, are life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity, and congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
