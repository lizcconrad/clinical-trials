  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is designed to investigate the effectiveness of Tarceva (OSI-774)
      combined with capecitabine in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated once daily with Tarceva, twice daily with capecitabine for 14
      consecutive days, followed by 7 days off of capecitabine (a cycle is 21 days). At week 1 of
      each cycle a physical exam and blood work will be performed. Reassessment of tumor size will
      be conducted at 6 weeks (2 cycles), 12 weeks (4 cycles) and then every 9 weeks thereafter.
      Patients will remain on treatment until one of the following occur: disease progression,
      illness that prevents further treatment or unacceptable adverse events.

             must have recovered from any related toxicities

          -  &gt;4 weeks must have elapsed from the participation in any investigational drug study

          -  Laboratory values:
