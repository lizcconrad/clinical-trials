  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this topical NF-kappaB Decoy candidate is
      safe in persons with atopic dermatitis. Preliminary evidence of efficacy (whether it is
      working) will also be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study to
      evaluate the safety of repeated application of three concentrations of NF-kappaB Decoy in
      approximately 75 subjects with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. The face, hands, feet,
      scalp, or groin may NOT be treated.

      Other treatment agents are currently available for atopic dermatitis but present significant
      potential side effects (topical steroids) or are potent immunosuppressives (topical
      calcineurin inhibitors) with pending longer-term safety data.

      NF-kappaB Decoy is a double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) oligodeoxynucleotide that
      mimics the NF-kappaB binding sequence on the chromosomal DNA, thereby inhibiting the
      production of the inflammatory response triggered by NF-kappaB. This mechanism of action
      presents a unique treatment modality.

      A comprehensive series of nonclinical data have produced promising results.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have concomitant dermatologic or medical condition(s) which may interfere with the

          -  Have immunocompromised status (such as known human immunodeficiency virus infection)

          -  Have any clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory test results at Screening

          -  Have a history of malignancy not in remission for at least 5 years excluding basal
             cell carcinoma and nonperiorificial squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Have an active intercurrent infection

          -  Have applied any topical medication (including corticosteroid, calcineurin inhibitor,
             topical H1 and H2 antihistamines, topical antimicrobials, other medicated topical
             agents) or herbal preparation to the area selected for treatment within 1 week of the
             Day 1 visit; have used any systemic antibiotic within 1 week prior to the Day 1 visit;
             have used any systemic treatment for atopic dermatitis (including systemic
             corticosteroids, nonsteroidal immunosuppressants, or treatment with light) within 4
             weeks prior to the Day 1 visit; have used an investigational drug for any reason
             within 4 weeks of the Day 1 visit; have used intranasal and/or inhaled corticosteroids
             at doses &gt; 2 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 4 weeks of the Day 1 visit; or
             have used immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs such as etanercept, alefacept,
             or infliximab within 16 weeks prior to Day 1

          -  Have a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to parabens or any other

          -  Have any reason which, in the opinion of the investigator, interferes with the ability
             of the subject to participate in or complete the trial, or which places the subject at
             undue risk
