  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the first line treatment for acromegaly is surgery, in order to remove the adenoma
      causing overproduction of growth hormone which leads to acromegaly. Octreotide LAR is
      approved for treatment of acromegaly after surgery if the disease is not controlled. This
      study was aimed to test the safety and efficacy of octreotide LAR in acromegalic patients who
      did not have any previous treatment for acromegaly.
