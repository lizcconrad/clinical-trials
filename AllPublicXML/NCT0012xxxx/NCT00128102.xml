    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor effectiveness of an
      oral investigational drug, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, in the treatment of advanced
      malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      Treatment Extension Phase: Participants in this study will be eligible to enroll in an
      open-label treatment extension phase if they: a) were originally randomized to the vorinostat
      arm and have not experienced disease progression; b) were randomized to the placebo arm and
      meet the &quot;Extension Phase Inclusion Criteria for Participants in the Placebo Arm&quot; below; or
      c) were originally randomized to the vorinostat arm and discontinued study therapy for
      reasons other than progression and the investigator believes that it is in the participant's
      best interest to resume vorinostat treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  Participant must be 18 years or older with confirmed diagnosis of malignant pleural
             mesothelioma

          -  In countries where pemetrexed an approved mesothelioma treatment, the participant's
             disease has progressed or relapsed following treatment with at least one prior
             chemotherapy regimen with pemetrexed and either cisplatin or carboplatin OR In
             countries where pemetrexed is not approved for mesothelioma, the participant's disease
             has progressed or relapsed following treatment with at least one prior chemotherapy
             regimen OR Pemetrexed is not the preferred therapy for the participant and the
             participant's disease has progressed or relapsed following treatment with at least one
             prior chemotherapy regimen

          -  Participants must have received no more than 2 prior systemic therapy regimens

          -  Participant has a Karnofsky performance scale status of ≥70

          -  Participant must have adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function and adequate
             coagulation (per prespecified laboratory values)

        Extension Phase Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are receiving treatment with vorinostat and have not experienced
             progression of mesothelioma

          -  Participants who were randomized to the placebo arm and are: 1) have a Karnofsky
             performance scale status of ≥70; and 2) have adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney
             function and adequate coagulation (per prespecified laboratory values)

          -  Participants assigned to vorinostat who have discontinued study therapy for reasons
             other than progression of mesothelioma, if the investigator is of the opinion that the
             potential benefit outweighs potential risks associated with using vorinostat

        Exclusion Criteria :

          -  Participant has been treated with a Histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitor

          -  Participant has an active infection for which they received treatment with intravenous
             antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal medications within 2 weeks of the start of study
             drug.

          -  Participants with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy. A malignancy is not
             considered &quot;currently active&quot; if participants have completed therapy for the second
             malignancy and are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years

          -  Participant has uncontrolled brain metastases

          -  Participant has a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or HIV-related
             malignancy

          -  Participant is pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Participant has a history of gastrointestinal surgery or other procedures that might
             interfere with the absorption or swallowing of the study drug

          -  Participants taking part in the pre-dose spot and post-first dose 24-hour urine
             collections must exclude medications containing acetominophen or paracetamol for one
             week prior to the start of vorinostat therapy and during the entire period of urine
             collection

          -  Participants taking part in the pre-dose spot and post-first dose 24-hour urine
             collections may not be using hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis
