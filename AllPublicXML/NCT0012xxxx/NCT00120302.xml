      This study is not being conducted in the US.

      The study consists of a 4 week double blind treatment period. All patients meeting the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will enter the study at day 0 and be randomized into either
      pimecrolimus cream 1% or vehicle treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will return to
      clinic on days 7,14 and 28 for assessments of disease severity. Patients who experience an
      unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, will attend an unscheduled visit and be withdrawn from the
      study.

      Assessments of eligibility include an Investigator's Global Assessment and Pruritus score.
      Treatment history will be collected at baseline and Quality of Life Questionnaires will be
      carried out at every visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females aged 18 years or older

          -  Active Moderate Facial AE at baseline (Facial IGA score of 3), within 3 days of a
             deterioration in symptoms that necessitates further treatment.

          -  Diagnosis of AE fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Williams (Williams, et al. 1994)
             outlined below: *Must have an itchy skin condition plus 3 or more of the following 5
             items listed below:

               1. History of involvement of the skin creases such as folds or elbows, behind the
                  knees, fronts of ankles or around the neck;

               2. A personal history of asthma or hay fever;

               3. A history of a general dry skin in the last year;

               4. Visible flexural edema;

               5. Onset under the age of 2

          -  Pruritus score of 2 or above at baseline

          -  Patients in whom further use of TCS is clinically inappropriate due to:

               -  burning, stinging, allergic reaction or other adverse event that prevents the
                  patient from using topical corticosteroids to successfully treat an AE flare on
                  the face;

               -  presence of rosacea, telangiectasia, skin atrophy or glaucoma as a result of
                  topical corticosteroid usage on the face;

               -  presence of AE on the eyelids Or patients where previous treatment has been
