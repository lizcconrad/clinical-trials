  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of sorafenib, gemcitabine,
      and capecitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with unresectable and/or
      metastatic kidney cancer. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      sorafenib together with gemcitabine and capecitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of sorafenib
      administered in combination with gemictabine and capecitabine in patients with advanced renal
      cell carcinoma.

      II. Determine the objective response rate for sorafenib in combination with gemictabine and
      capecitabine in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.

      III. Determine the duration of overall survival and progression free survival in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, non-randomized, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a
      phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive sorafenib* orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21, gemcitabine
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of sorafenib, gemcitabine, and capecitabine
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6
      patients are treated at the MTD.

      Note: *Patients who complete at least 3 courses of treatment with objective response or
      stable disease but are deemed poor candidates for continued chemotherapy may continue
      treatment with sorafenib

      PHASE II: Patients receive sorafenib, gemcitabine, and capecitabine as in phase I at the MTD
      determined in phase I.

      After completion of study treatment patients are followed periodically.

             sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma are eligible, but those with pure sarcomas are not;
             histologic documentation of metastatic disease is not required; clinical confirmation,
             but not pathologic staging, of metastatic disease is required

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=

             scan

          -  Patients may have received one prior immunotherapy based regimen (i.e. interleukin-2
             or interferon alpha) ending &gt;= 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Patients may have received up to 2 prior regimens containing mitogen-activated protein
             kinases (MAPK), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway inhibitors (e.g.
             sunitinib or bevacizumab) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (e.g.
             temsirolimus) ending &gt;= 4 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Life expectancy of more than 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =&lt; 2 OR Karnofsky &gt;= 60%

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3000/uL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase

             with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  The effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because raf kinase inhibitor agents as well as
             other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have received prior chemotherapy; if patients have had prior
             definitive or other surgery, prior radiation therapy, they must have fully recovered
             from the effects of therapy with at least 4 weeks recovery time; for patients who have
             had a surgical biopsy only, they must have simply recovered

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical
             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events; previously treated brain metastases are allowed if they show no
             evidence of progression on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at least 8 weeks
             after completion of surgery and/or radiotherapy

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to sorafenib, gemcitabine and capecitabine

          -  No concurrent megestrol is permitted; no megestrol therapy within 4 weeks prior to
             protocol treatment is allowed; no concurrent cytochrome P450 enzyme-inducing
             antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, phenobarbitol or carbamazepine), rifampin, or St.
             John's wort

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled
             hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary disease including asthma,
             chronic bronchitis, emphysema with requirements for chronic oxygen use or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with sorafenib; the potential risks may apply to other agents used
             in this study

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV)-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded
             from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with sorafenib,
             gemcitabine, or capecitabine administered during the study; appropriate studies will
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination ant-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Any swallowing dysfunction leading to difficulty taking the investigational therapy or
             capecitabine

          -  Prior treatment with sorafenib

          -  Patients with any history or evidence of a bleeding diathesis

          -  Patients on therapeutic anticoagulation with coumarins (e.g. warfarin); prophylactic
             coumarin-based anticoagulation (i.e. low dose warfarin) for venous or arterial access
             devices is allowed provided that the requirements for prothrombin time (PT),
             international normalization ratio (INR) and/or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are
             met; prophylactic or therapeutic low molecular weight heparin is allowed; patients
             with known brain metastases are excluded (even if treated and stable) if they are also
             on therapeutic doses of anticoagulation

          -  Patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency
