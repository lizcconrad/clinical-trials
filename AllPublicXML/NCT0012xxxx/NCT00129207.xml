    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how ketoconazole (Nizoral) affects the
      pharmacokinetics (how the study drug is affected by the body and broken down) and
      pharmacodynamics (how the study drug acts on the body) of the active ingredient in the study
      drug Velcade (bortezomib).
