  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking can contribute to many health problems for mothers and their babies. In developing
      countries, there is little information about the number of pregnant women that smoke and the
      reasons why some pregnant women choose to smoke. The purpose of this multi-site tobacco use
      survey is to obtain information on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors among pregnant women in
      diverse populations regarding tobacco products.

      Smoking is regarded as one of the few potentially preventable factors associated with low
      birth weight, very preterm birth and perinatal death. In an effort to determine the
      prevalence of tobacco use (smoking and smokeless tobacco) and to collect relevant data in
      support of a potential smoking prevention or cessation intervention, a multi-site tobacco use
      survey is being conducted in several countries. The survey will be used to obtain information
      on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors among pregnant women in diverse populations regarding
      tobacco products.

      The primary outcome is tobacco use status during pregnancy. Secondary outcomes include:
      knowledge and attitudes regarding tobacco products, health hazards of tobacco use and
      environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure.

      Sample size of 750 per country was calculated under the assumptions that the prevalence of
      tobacco use could be as low as 0.05 with a coefficient of variation of approximately 15% and
      a prevalence of 0.10 with a CV of approximately 11%.
