      Intramuscular (IM) administration of HIV lipopeptide vaccines have been shown to be able to
      induce HIV-1-specific T cell-mediated immune responses. The objective of this trial was to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of LIPO-4 vaccine (HIV lipopeptides including 4
      peptides from Gag, Pol, RT and Nef HIV-1 proteins, each peptide linked to TT) intradermally
      (ID) compared to IM administration.

      Dose-sparing strategies that use intradermal (ID) delivery of vaccines may be one approach
      for improving a vaccines immunogenicity and reducing the cost of vaccines.

      In this study, 68 HIV-negative healthy adult volunteers, 21-55 years old, all belonging to
      the &quot;Volunteers for a Vaccine&quot; network set up by ANRS, were randomized to receive at weeks 0,
      4, and 12, either 3 IM doses of 0.5 ml of LIPO-4 containing 500 µg of each peptide (n= 35
      volunteers), or 3 ID doses of 0.1 ml, containing 100 µg of each peptide (n=33 volunteers).
      Total follow-up was 48 weeks. Safety was assessed clinically and by laboratory tests.
      Participants were given diary cards to record adverse events. HIV-1 immune responses were
      assessed by ELISPOT and lymphoproliferative assay at weeks 0, 2, 6, 14, 24, and 48
