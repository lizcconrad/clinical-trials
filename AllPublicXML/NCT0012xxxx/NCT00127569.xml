  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is aimed to study the efficacy of 4 weekly cycles of rituximab in HIV-infected
      patients with multicentric Castleman disease (giant lymph node hyperplasia) dependent on
      chemotherapy. Efficacy is assessed by the complete response rate at day 60. The patients are
      followed until day 365.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-related multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) is a lymphoproliferative disorder
      characterized by lymphadenopathy with angiofollicular hyperplasia and plasma cell
      infiltration, associated with KSHV/HHV-8. Patients typically have systemic manifestations
      such as fever associated with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory symptoms,
      peripheral edema, cytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and high levels of
      serum C reactive protein (CRP). Symptoms correlate with an important increase of KSHV/HHV-8
      DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV-MCD is characterized by a rapidly progressive
      and often fatal course. HIV-MCD is often refractory to treatment. Vinca alkaloids produce
      frequent but short-lived responses, and most patients remain dependant upon chemotherapy.

      Lymph nodes of patients with HIV-MCD specifically harbor the virus in B cells located in the
      mantle zone, which stain positively for the CD20 surface antigen. Rituximab, a humanized
      monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, has been reported to be effective in some cases, with
      conflicting data in other cases. The optimal schedule of infusions remains unclear.

      Kaposi's sarcoma is often associated with HIV-MCD, and the development of aggressive
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not a rare outcome.
