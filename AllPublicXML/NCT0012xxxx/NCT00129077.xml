      The purpose of this study is to identify the incidence of scratches on the surface of the eye
      in children who cannot blink due to medication use and to identify how best to reduce the
      risk of a scratch on the surface of the eye when patients are using specific medicines.

      Critically ill children may require neuromuscular blockade as a treatment modality. These
      children require careful eye care to prevent corneal abrasions. However, current evidence
      does not exist to guide best practices on eye care. This research study will evaluate 2 types
      of eye care therapy. The eyes will be randomly assigned to the control or experimental eye
      care therapy group. The control eye will receive lubricating ointment every 6 hours. The
      experimental eye will receive lubricating ointment every 6 hours and have a plastic covering
      to create a moisture chamber. Using daily fluorescein staining to detect corneal abrasions,
      each child will be studied for up to 9 days. Children who develop corneal abrasions will be
      discharged from the study and the primary care team will be notified. The two groups will
      then be compared to determine the therapy associated with the lowest incidence of corneal
      abrasions.
