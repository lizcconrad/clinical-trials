  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An electronic referral application will be developed and integrated into the existing
      outpatient information system. The primary goal of this software is to improve the quality
      and coordination of patient care by increasing physician-to-physician communication. The
      investigators anticipate that improved communications will also enhance physician and patient
      satisfaction and provide cost savings. These outcomes will be formally evaluated following
      implementation of the application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A trial will be performed to test and quantify the benefits of electronic referrals. Primary
      care physicians (PCPs) from 2 community-based clinics will be recruited for enrollment. The
      control group will initiate referrals using the pre-existing paper forms;
      physician-to-physician communication can occur by e-mail, phone, or mail at the discretion of
      the referring physician as is currently the standard. Physicians randomized to the
      intervention arm will be asked to use the electronic application for every referral during
      the study period. For 6 months, every new referral initiated within the study groups will be
      assessed for the completeness of patient information and timing of feedback to the referring
      physician via physician surveys. In addition, a subgroup of patients in the control and
      intervention arms will be surveyed to assess the impact of the intervention on patient
      satisfaction with the referral process.
