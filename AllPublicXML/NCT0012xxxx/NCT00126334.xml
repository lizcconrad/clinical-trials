      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether a conservative or a liberal blood
      transfusion strategy is better for patients with a heart attack and a low blood count.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard of care for patients with heart attacks is to transfuse red blood cells
      when the hematocrit (red blood cell count) drops below 30 percent. However, there is little
      scientific basis for this current standard, and recent research has demonstrated that it is
      safe to allow the hematocrit (red blood cell count) to drop significantly lower in severely
      ill medical patients and in patients with heart disease undergoing major surgery. The
      investigators therefore propose this pilot trial to begin to determine whether or not it is
      safe to apply a more conservative blood transfusion strategy to patients with heart attacks.

      In this study, patients who are within 72 hours of the onset of a heart attack and who are
      anemic (have a low red blood cell count) will be randomly assigned to one of two transfusion
      strategies while they are in the hospital: a liberal strategy of transfusing blood when the
      hematocrit falls below 30 percent (the current standard) or a conservative strategy of
      transfusing blood only when the hematocrit falls below 24 percent. It will then be determined
      which group fares better over the next 30 days.

      The plan is to enroll 92 patients in this pilot trial in order to allow the researchers to
      plan for a much larger, definitive trial of this important question. It is anticipated that
      the conservative transfusion strategy will be similar to the standard (liberal) strategy in
      terms of patient outcomes.
