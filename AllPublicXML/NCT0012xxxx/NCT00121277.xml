      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vorinostat and capecitabine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Vorinostat may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and
      capecitabine in treating patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of vorinostat (SAHA)
           and capecitabine in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the clinical effects with the pharmacokinetic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat (SAHA) once or twice daily and oral capecitabine twice daily
      on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR)
      receive 2 courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients achieving a partial response receive 2
      courses beyond documentation of best response.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SAHA and capecitabine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients are
      treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3-4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-10
      months.
