      The purpose of this investigation is to study the effectiveness of longer wavelength UVA1
      (340-400nm) or shorter wavelength ultraviolet B [UVB] (290-320nm) irradiation in the
      treatment of inflammatory skin conditions (such as: atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, mycosis
      fungoides, alopecia areata, stretch marks and urticaria).

      This research study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an investigational device which is
      similar in appearance to a &quot;tanning bed&quot; but which emits ultraviolet irradiation of a
      specific wavelength known as UVA1. This device has not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for general use in this country, as of yet, but it has been used quite
      successfully in Europe for several years in treating such conditions as scleroderma, atopic
      dermatitis, urticaria pigmentosa and other skin conditions.

      Instead of UVA1 therapy, patients may receive ultraviolet radiation of a specific wavelength
      known as UVB. UVA1 light is a longer wavelength and therefore a lower energy wavelength than
      UVB. UVB light is often the light associated with getting a sunburn since it has a higher
      level of energy. UVB light has been used successfully in the treatment of many skin
      conditions.

      The purpose of this investigation is to study the effectiveness of longer wavelength UVA1
      (340-400nm) or shorter wavelength UVB (290-320nm) irradiation in the treatment of
      inflammatory skin conditions. Inflammatory dermatoses refer to conditions like atopic
      dermatitis (eczema) and psoriasis in which circulating leukocytes (T cells, neutrophils, and
      monocytes) infiltrate the skin. The infiltrating cells may be of malignant phenotype as in
      mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T cell lymphoma-CTCL). Up to 50 patients with one of these
      diagnoses or related conditions will participate in this study. The affected areas on the
      body will be treated with UVA1 or UVB for up to 5 times per week for 16 weeks. The UVA1 dose
      will be up to 130 J/cm2. The maximum UVB dose will be 4000 mJ/cm2. This UVA1 dosing schedule
      has been safely used in Germany for treating patients with atopic dermatitis, mycosis
      fungoides, granuloma annulare, scleroderma, and urticaria pigmentosa. Subjects will be
      evaluated clinically at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, and then at monthly intervals. More frequent
      evaluation may be required depending on the condition being studied. Paired skin biopsies may
      be taken from involved and uninvolved (or treated and untreated) areas before and during UV
      therapy.
