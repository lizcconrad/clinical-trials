      This study will determine the effectiveness of the herb black cohosh for treating
      menopause-related anxiety symptoms in women.

      Study hypotheses: 1) Black cohosh will have a superior anti-anxiety effect compared to
      placebo. 2) Black cohosh will have a comparable safety profile to that of placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During menopause, up to 90% of women will experience symptoms of anxiety, such as
      nervousness, irritability, fatigue, muscle aches, depression, and low libido. Concern over
      the safety and effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for relieving these symptoms has
      caused many women to seek alternative medical treatments. Data suggest that black cohosh has
      a direct effect on the neurotransmitters and receptors involved in anxiety. This study will
      determine whether black cohosh can effectively treat anxiety symptoms in menopausal women.

      This study will last 12 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either black
      cohosh or placebo daily for the duration of the study. Self-report scales will be used to
      assess participants' anxiety symptoms and quality of life at the beginning and end of the
      study.
