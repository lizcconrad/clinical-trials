      This is a phase 2, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study to establish the safety and
      efficacy of Troxatyl™ (troxacitabine) administered as a continuous infusion for 5 days to
      subjects with AML. The study will primarily assess the complete response (CR) rate of a 5-day
      continuous infusion of troxacitabine at 12 mg/m2/day given as second salvage therapy in adult
      patients with AML, with secondary objectives to determine the overall, relapse-free and
      event-free survival and remission duration; to determine the duration of response; to
      determine the complete response with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) rate; to evaluate the
      tolerability and safety of 5-day continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of troxacitabine; and
      to determine the relationship between troxacitabine plasma concentrations, anti-leukemic
      activity and adverse events. Additional cycles of treatment may be given at the
      investigator’s discretion, provided that the subject does not have progressive disease or
      experience a dose limiting toxicity. Bone marrow transplantation in responding subjects will
      be allowed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the second salvage setting:
             refractory to two prior courses of therapy or primary refractory without response to
             two previous courses of leukemia therapy.

          -  Patients must have received at least two previous courses of induction chemotherapy to
             be considered in the second salvage setting.

          -  Patients who are in second relapse, must have had a duration of their second CR or CRp
             of less than six months.

          -  Subjects must have adequate organ and immune function as indicated by the following
             laboratory values:

               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min and ≤ 125 mL/min;

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (≤ 34.2 µmol/L);

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

               -  Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
                  status of &lt; 2, and an estimated life expectancy of at least eight weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement

          -  Active and uncontrolled infection

          -  Uncontrolled medical problems unrelated to the malignancy that impair patient ability
             to give informed consent or unacceptably reduce the safety of the proposed treatment

          -  Neurologic or psychiatric disorders that would interfere with informed consent or
             study follow-up

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to Troxatyl® or closely related
             compounds such as lamivudine or any of the stated ingredients

          -  A recent history of alcohol or other substance abuse

          -  Subjects who have used another investigational agent or participated in a clinical
             trial within the last 14 days prior to enrolment

          -  Females with a positive pregnancy test at screening

          -  Subjects who have previously been enrolled into this study and subsequently withdrew
