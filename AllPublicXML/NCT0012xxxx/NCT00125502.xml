      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine (CMV
      gB/MF59) can safely prevent mothers from catching CMV infection between pregnancies. This
      study includes 464 women, ages 14-40 years, who delivered a newborn infant within 12 months
      prior to the study. Participants must live within the Birmingham metropolitan area or the
      Tuscaloosa county area and they cannot have had CMV infection previously. CMV vaccine or
      placebo (substance containing no medication) will be given at 3 study visits. Participants
      fill out diary cards for 7 days after each vaccination. Blood samples will be collected.
      Urine samples will be collected several times and pregnancy tests will be performed.
      Participants who tested positive for CMV will have urine, vaginal swab, and saliva specimens
      collected. Each participant will be followed for 3 years after the third dose of vaccine.
      Infants born to participants in the study will be checked for CMV infection.

      The objective of this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study is to
      determine whether a recombinant subunit vaccine comprised of cytomegalovirus (CMV) envelope
      glycoprotein B (gB) with MF59 adjuvant can prevent maternal CMV infection between pregnancies
      in a high risk population of women of childbearing age. This study will also permit
      determination of whether the approach used is a feasible one for a large scale efficacy trial
      with prevention of congenital CMV as the endpoint. CMV gB vaccine is comprised of a
      recombinant CMV envelope glycoprotein produced in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The CMV
      gB is combined with a novel adjuvant, MF59, a proprietary oil-in-water emulsion. Vaccines
      will be administered at 0, 1, and 6 months by intramuscular injection in the left deltoid.
      Placebo recipients will be given a normal saline solution. Study participants were recruited
      from postpartum wards and from the community. Potential participants were screened for
      antibody to CMV; those who were seronegative were invited to participate in the vaccine
      study. Participants received their initial immunization 1.5 to 12 months postpartum. A total
      of 464, seronegative women who were willing to participate and met enrollment inclusion and
      exclusion criteria were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: Group I participants received 20
      micrograms of gB with MF59; Group II participants received placebo (normal saline). During
      the immunization period local and systemic reactogenicity was assessed by a 7-day diary card
      completed after each dose of vaccine. Adverse events are tabulated. Safety is assessed by
      comparing the local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse event rates between vaccine and
      placebo recipients. Study participants are screened for CMV infection every three months,
      beginning three months after the first dose of vaccine, using a CMV IgG antibody assay with
      preabsorption of sera with purified recombinant CMV gB (vaccine antigen). CMV infection will
      be confirmed by either isolation of virus or detection of CMV DNA in body fluids. After the 3
      dose vaccine schedule has been completed, participants are followed every 3 months. The
      primary endpoint is the time to CMV infection. The rate of congenital CMV infection in
      offspring of immunized mothers is a secondary endpoint. The rate of congenital CMV infection
      will be compared between offspring of vaccine and placebo recipients. Each subject will be
      followed for 3 years from the third dose of vaccine. Specific information will be collected
      on the following pregnancy outcomes: pregnancy report, pregnancy follow-up, abnormal
      pregnancy outcome-mother, and abnormal pregnancy outcome-infant.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mothers, 14 to 40 years of age (inclusive), who have delivered a newborn infant within
             the previous 12 months, reside within the Birmingham metropolitan area or the
             Tuscaloosa county area, and sign an informed consent form following a detailed
             explanation of the study.

          -  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative as determined by the AxsymÂ® System CMV IgG antibody
             assay (Abbott Diagnostics) performed within 14 weeks prior to the first immunization.

          -  In good health as judged by medical history obtained by patient interview and physical
             examination.

          -  Willing to participate with 4 follow-up visits per year for 3 years after the third
             dose of vaccine.

          -  Volunteers must be willing to use an effective means of contraception of their choice
             from the first dose of vaccine up to 2 months after the third dose of the vaccine.

        Methods that were considered effective for the purposes of this clinical trial included any
        hormonal contraceptive, double barrier methods and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known maternal immune disorder such as HIV infection, collagen vascular disease,
             immune deficiency, or chronic disease requiring treatment with immunosuppressive
             medication.

          -  Chronic disease such as diabetes, sickle cell disease, heart disease, fibromyalgia,
             arthritis or asthma requiring medication.

        Patients with a diagnosis of asthma or past asthma were allowed to enroll if they did not
        currently take medication for asthma and were off asthma medication and free from asthma
        symptoms for at least 2 years. Patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension on
        medication were allowed if their blood pressure was controlled within the normal range for
        at least one month.

          -  Positive rapid test for HIV antibody. All subjects were tested for HIV antibody using
             a rapid serologic test at the time of enrollment beginning with protocol version 1.7.
             Prior to that only subjects who had a history of a negative screening test for HIV
             during their most recent pregnancy were included. Subjects given HIV rapid serologic
             tests in this study were provided pre-test counseling before the test was performed
             and post-test counseling when the subject was informed of the test results. This
             counseling is provided by the study nurses according to CDC guidelines [Centers for
             Disease Control and Prevention. Revised Guidelines for HIV Counseling, Testing and
             Referral and Revised Recommendations for HIV Screening of Pregnant Women. Subjects who
             are eligible for this study were considered very unlikely to be HIV positive because
             almost all adults who are HIV positive are also CMV positive and almost all potential
             enrollees will have received HIV screening during their recent pregnancy.

          -  Maternal sterilization procedure planned in the postpartum period.

          -  Current use of steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

          -  Maternal drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Mothers who are nursing their infants.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial of another investigational vaccine or drug, if they
             have received the investigational drug or vaccine within 6 months prior to enrollment
             date for this trial.

          -  A history of anaphylaxis or serious vaccine reactions.

          -  Previous receipt of CMV vaccine.

          -  Receipt of blood products within 3 months prior to study enrollment.
