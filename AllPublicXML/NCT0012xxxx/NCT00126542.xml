  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with erlotinib works in
      treating patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cavity cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth
      in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may
      also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Erlotinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      bevacizumab together with erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial,
      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the median
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive oral
      erlotinib once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients experiencing unacceptable toxicity due to 1 of the study drugs may continue
      treatment with the remaining study drug alone in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
