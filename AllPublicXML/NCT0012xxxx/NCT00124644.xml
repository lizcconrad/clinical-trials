      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving combination chemotherapy together with
      tipifarnib may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when
      given together with combination chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute
      myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tipifarnib when given in combination with
           induction therapy comprising cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide followed by
           consolidation therapy comprising high-dose cytarabine in patients with newly diagnosed
           high-risk acute myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen, in terms of
           organ specificity, time course, predictability, and reversibility, in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of complete remission in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the remission duration, overall survival, and relapse-free and event-free
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacodynamic measurements and levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha with
           clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7; daunorubicin
           IV and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 5-7; and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days
           5-12.

      Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy on day 17 OR days 17 and 24 (if day 17 bone marrow biopsy
      shows suspicious disease). Patients achieving a complete remission (CR) proceed to
      consolidation therapy. Patients with residual disease, defined as &gt; 5% leukemic blasts in a
      bone marrow of ≥ 20% cellularity, receive a second course of induction therapy comprising
      cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-5; daunorubicin IV and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days
      4 and 5; and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 4-9. Patients achieving a CR after a second
      course of induction therapy proceed to consolidation therapy. Patients not achieving a CR
      after a second course of induction therapy are removed from the study.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients are treated at the
      MTD.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Patients receive high-dose cytarabine IV twice daily on days 1,
           3, and 5. Treatment repeats approximately every 6-8 weeks for 4 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-15
      months.
