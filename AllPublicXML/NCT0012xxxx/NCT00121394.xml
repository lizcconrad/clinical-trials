      Infection is a major health problem during birth in Pakistan. This study will look at the
      possibility of using a septic wash to help improve health during birth in Karachi, Pakistan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis in mother and infant is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in
      low-resource settings. Several studies have investigated the likelihood that an
      anti-bacterial agent, chlorhexidine, administered during labor and delivery to mother and
      infant could reduce the risk of infection and of subsequent maternal and infant morbidity and
      mortality. In this trial, chlorhexidine wash and placebo will be randomly administered to
      women in labor and newborn infants in a public hospital in Karachi, Pakistan.

      Delivery attendants will administer 0.6% chlorhexidine solution every four hours until
      delivery (4 washes maximum) and one neonatal wash with the same solution. The control group
      will receive 200 ml of sterile physiologic saline solution. A total of 5000 women will be
      randomized in the hospital study, 2500 control and 2500 intervention. All women and infants
      will be evaluated 24 hours post delivery and at a 7-day follow-up. Women who delivered at
      home will also receive a 28 days post-partum assessment. Women will be carefully monitored
      for side effects to the dosage. In addition a community-based feasibility trial of 200
      patients (100 CHX, 100 control) will be completed.
