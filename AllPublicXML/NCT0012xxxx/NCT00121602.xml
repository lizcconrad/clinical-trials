      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the efficacy of darbepoetin alfa SF is
      equivalent to that of darbepoetin alfa RB for the treatment of anemia in patients with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis.

    <description>Initial dose, frequency and route of administration of study drug will be the same as that administered for darbepoetin alfa prior to enrollment. Frequency either once a week or once every two weeks, frequency may not change for duration of study. Route of administration either subcutaneous or intravenous, route of administration may not change for duration of study. Study drug provided in pre-filled syringes at the following unit doses: 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 or 150 ug.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: - Diagnosis of CKD and receiving hemodialysis for greater than or equal
        to 3 months before enrollment - No prior exposure to EPREX® or NeoRecorman® - Baseline
        hemoglobin (Hb) between 10 and 13 g/dL - On stable weekly or once every other week
        intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) darbepoetin therapy for at least 6 weeks prior to
        screening (stable is defined as less than 25% change in weekly dose and no change in
        frequency) - Adequate iron stores (serum ferritin equal to or greater than 100 mg/L) -
        Before any study-specific procedure, the appropriate written informed consent must be
        obtained Exclusion Criteria: - Scheduled to receive a kidney transplant - Uncontrolled
        hypertension, defined as a pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 180
        and/or diastolic BP of greater than 110 - Acute myocardial ischemia; hospitalization for
        congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular
        event (stroke or transient ischemic attack) within 12 weeks before enrollment - Parathyroid
        hormone (PTH) level greater than 1500 pg/mL - Major surgery within 12 weeks before
        enrollment (excluding vascular access surgery) - Currently receiving antibiotic therapy for
        systemic infection - Known positive HIV antibody or positive hepatitis B surface antigen -

        with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical
        intraepithelial neoplasia - Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions within 8 weeks before
        enrollment - Androgen therapy within 8 weeks before enrollment - Systemic hematologic
        disease (e.g., sickle cell anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, hematologic malignancy;
        myeloma; hemolytic anemia) - Any disorder that may impact (in the judgment of the
        investigator) the ability to give informed consent for participation in this study -
        Pregnant or breast-feeding women. All subjects must practice adequate contraception (in the
        judgment of the investigator) throughout this trial. - Treatment with an investigational
        agent or device within 30 days before enrollment or scheduled to receive an investigational
        agent other than those specified by this protocol during the course of this study - Subject
        has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during dosing.
