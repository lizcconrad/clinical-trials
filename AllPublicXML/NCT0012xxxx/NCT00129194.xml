      The primary purpose of the study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of KP-1461
      given every 12 hours for 14 days when administered to HIV+ patients who have failed multiple
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimens. Patients currently on HAART will be
      required to discontinue all HAART medications for up to 6 weeks after screening eligibility
      has been determined.

    <textblock>
      KP-1461 is a carbamate prodrug of the active nucleoside, KP-1212. KP-1212 is incorporated
      into the proviral DNA. After multiple rounds of replication, KP-1212 increases the high
      inherent mutation rate of HIV beyond the threshold of viability, a process called &quot;viral
      decay acceleration&quot;. KP-1212 is unique from conventional nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors in that it inserts mutations randomly across the entire 10,000 nucleotide HIV
      genome and does not exert selective pressure by targeting a specific viral or cellular
      process, thus potentially avoiding drug resistance.
