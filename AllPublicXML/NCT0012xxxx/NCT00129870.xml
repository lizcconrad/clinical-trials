  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary rationale for this study is to develop an optimized schedule of administration of
      FOLFOX + bevacizumab that maximizes the efficacy and safety of this regimen when administered
      to patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The hypothesis is that the use of an
      intermittent oxaliplatin (IO) schedule of FOLFOX/bevacizumab will allow these patients to
      continue on treatment for a longer period of time by reducing the proportion of patients who
      discontinue therapy early because of treatment-related toxicities and thus increasing the
      possibility of a longer time to progression.

      The primary objective is:

        -  To test the hypothesis that an intermittent oxaliplatin (IO) schedule of
           FOLFOX/bevacizumab will allow patients to remain on therapy for a longer period of time
           compared to a conventional &quot;treat-to-failure&quot; schedule, by reducing the proportion of
           patients who discontinue therapy for treatment-related toxicities.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the impact of calcium/magnesium infusions on the incidence and severity of
           neurotoxicity in subjects receiving either the IO or conventional FOLFOX/bevacizumab
           treatment schedules as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the IO versus the conventional schedule + calcium
           and magnesium infusions, as part of oxaliplatin-based first-line therapy for metastatic
           colorectal cancer.

    Unplanned interim analysis by DSMB indicated possible reduced response rate with the addition
    of Ca/Mg in pooled population. Further analysis pending.
