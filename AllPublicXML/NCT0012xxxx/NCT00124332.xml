    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if rimonabant 20 mg once daily (od) administered
      during 18-20 months will reduce progression of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) when administered on top of standard behavioral and
      pharmacological therapy given as needed, in patients with abdominal obesity associated with
      current smoking and/or metabolic syndrome.

             blood pressure (&gt;= 140 mmHg systolic and/or &gt;= 90 mmHg diastolic) at Screening visit,
             or current treatment by anti-hypertensive medication; *b) Currently smoking (&gt; 10
             cigarettes /day) and willing to stop

          -  Angiographic evidence of coronary heart disease as defined by at least 1 lesion in a
             native coronary artery that has &gt;= 20% reduction in lumen diameter by angiographic
             visual estimation

          -  Presence of at least one coronary artery complying with the definition of &quot;target
             vessel&quot; for IVUS assessment

          -  Acceptation of the Baseline IVUS tape by the IVUS Core Laboratory

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  History of very low-calorie diet or surgical procedures for weight loss (eg, stomach
             stapling, bypass) within 6 months prior to screening visit

          -  Severe congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III or IV)

          -  Clinically significant heart disease which in the opinion of the Investigator is
             likely to require coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous coronary
             intervention (PCI), cardiac transplantation, surgical repair and/or replacement during
             the course of the study

          -  Angioplasty of a non-qualifying artery which is considered at high risk of acute
             complication or restenosis, during baseline catheterization

          -  &gt;50% reduction in lumen diameter of the left main coronary artery by visual
             angiographic estimation

          -  Recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) &lt;= 72 hours prior to randomization
