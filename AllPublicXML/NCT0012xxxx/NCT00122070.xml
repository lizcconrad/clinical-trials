      Objective:

      The objective of this study is to quantitatively examine the efficacy of Seroquel (active
      ingredient quetiapine fumarate) in subjects with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). A
      secondary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of utilizing quetiapine in
      patients with Borderline Personality Disorder.

      Design:

      Investigator initiated, 6-week, non-placebo controlled, non-randomized, open-label, single
      drug, single-center, medication trial.

      Participants:

      Volunteers (n = 15) diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder using the Structured
      Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorders (SCID-II).

      Interventions:

      Subjects with Borderline Personality Disorder are washed out of all other medications. The
      subjects are then given the study drug at a dose within the drug's known therapeutic range.

      criteria are met, subjects will be administered quetiapine at the baseline visit. Enrollment
      will be 15 subjects. Enrollment is expected to last for a 6 month period.

           Personality Disorders (SCID-II). Those items screened positive by the subject on the
           Personality questionnaire will be further evaluated by pertinent subsections of the
           SKID-II.

      Concomitant Therapy

      Antipsychotic agents other than quetiapine will not be allowed during the study period.
      Patients who are taking other antipsychotic medication will require at least a three day
      washout period prior to the baseline visit.

      Patients on anticonvulsants, lithium and benzodiazepines will be allowed to enter the study
      if they have been on the same dose of these agents for three months prior to the baseline
      visit

      How Will the Study Be Analyzed

      Laboratory Studies: Studies will be done at baseline and will screen for liver disease,
      kidney disease, electrolyte imbalance, thyroid or parathyroid dysfunction, respiratory
      acidosis or alkalosis, anemia, adequate blood cell and platelet count, pregnancy, and
      presence of illegal drugs. Any subjects with significant laboratory abnormalities will be
      excluded from the study.

      Adverse Events: Subjects will be screened for the following side effects of quetiapine which
      are dizziness (10%), postural hypotension (7%), dry mouth (7%), and dyspepsia (6%),
      tachycardia (7%) and somnolence (18%). Patients will be also be monitored for other rare
      events including seizures, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
      Other less common side effects (&gt; 1%) include headache (19% vs placebo 17%), asthenia (3% vs
      2%), abdominal pain (3% vs 1%), back pain (2% vs 1%), fever (2% vs 1%), constipation (9% vs
      5%),w eight gain (2% vs 0%), rash (4% vs 3%), rhinitis (3% vs 1%), and ear pain (1% vs 0%).

      Data Analysis

      The following will be reported and statistically analyzed:

        -  Number of patients who begin and complete the study (maximum n = 15).

        -  Patients who dropout of the study or are terminated with reasons.

        -  Demographic characteristics of the patients.

        -  Number of patients who had personality disorders in addition to Borderline Personality
           Disorder.

        -  The final average dose of quetiapine.

        -  The total score and percentage change of each scale and subscale utilized in the study
           and whether there was a statistically significant increase or reduction during the
           period of quetiapine administration.

        -  Movement Disorder side effects as assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
           and the Simpson-Angus Scale and whether there was a statistically significant increase
           or reduction during the period of quetiapine administration.

        -  The number and percentage of adverse events that occurred during the period of
           quetiapine administration.

        -  The number and percentage of any abnormal laboratory results that occurred during the
           period of quetiapine administration.

      After completion of data collection, the data will be analyzed to determine appropriate
      parametric analyses. As the N for this study will be 15, a T-test analysis may be applicable
      if the data permit. We anticipate a preliminary demonstration of treatment effect. Individual
      weekly scores will serve as dependent variables which lend themselves to a one-way analysis
      to demonstrate difference between baseline and 6 weeks of active treatment. If our data
      permit, a two-way T-test will also be employed to demonstrate statistically significant
      differences in treatment effect. As our data will likely require the utilization of multiple
      two-way analyses, our data will be Bonferroni corrected in order to adjust for the
      possibility of false positive (type II) errors. Other parametric analyses will be employed as
      the data warrant.
