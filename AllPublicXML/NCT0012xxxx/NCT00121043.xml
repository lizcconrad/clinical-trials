  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the ease-of-use of SimpleJectTM compared to
      pre-filled syringe(s) when using Kineret® in RA subjects. The secondary purpose of this study
      is to assess the level of fear and anxiety associated with the use of both injection methods,
      to assess safety when using SimpleJectTM and to evaluate the Ease-of-Administration
      Questionnaire (EAQ) in terms of the quality of items, item performance, and the instrument
      reliability.

        infliximab treatment - Subject is currently enrolled in other clinical trial, is receiving
        other investigational agent(s), or at least a 30 day period has not elapsed since
        completion of other investigational trials with device(s) or drug(s) - Subject currently
        has an infection requiring systemic anti-infective therapy - Baseline neutropenia (less
        than 1.5 x 10^9/l) - Subjects with severe renal impairment (CLCR less than 30 ml/minute) -

        study - Planned administration of live vaccines during study period - Subject is not
        available for follow-up assessments - Subjects with a known sensitivity to Kineret® or any
        of the excipients of E. coli derived proteins - Pre-existing malignancies - Any other
        condition that in the investigators opinion would preclude the subject from participating
