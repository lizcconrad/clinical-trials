  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the best ways to help young people stop smoking. Bupropion (a
      medication marketed as Wellbutrin or Zyban) has proved helpful in treating adult smokers. The
      purpose of this study is to determine if bupropion is also effective in treating smokers
      between the ages of 12 and 25 years old. This study also compares the effectiveness of
      bupropion used as a supplement to behavioral treatment versus behavioral treatment used
      alone. In addition, the study evaluates whether hormonal response to stress measured prior to
      the start of treatment predicts whether individuals respond well to treatment with
      medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco exposure are one of the leading preventable
      causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Most smokers begin smoking during
      adolescence, and though they seem motivated to quit smoking, they frequently fail. Although
      behavioral treatments are available, they have not been very successful in past studies.

      Depressed adults may have more difficulty quitting smoking than non depressed adults; this
      finding may also apply to depressed youth. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effectiveness of bupropion in combination with standard behavioral treatment in helping young
      smokers quit, as compared to behavioral treatment alone. Finally, the study examines whether
      hormonal response to stress measured prior to treatment initiation predicts whether
      individuals respond well to treatment with bupropion.

      Participants in this double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either bupropion
      or placebo. Both groups will receive behavioral treatment. The trial will last for 9 weeks,
      with weekly study visits. Study visits will last 30 minutes to 1 hour and will include
      medication monitoring, self-reported and biological measures of smoking, and behavioral
      treatment. Participants will have follow-up visits six months after completion of treatment.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants between ages 12 and 25 years who smoked at least 10 cigarettes per day over a period of 6 months were recruited between 2004 and 2010 through advertisements in local newspapers and flyers in local community agencies and primary care clinics.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants completed an assessment for nicotine dependence and psychiatric disorders, and a laboratory stress study to assess baseline salivary cortisol over 2 hours and cortisol responses to a psychosocial stressor (public speaking and arithmetic tasks). Those who continued to meet study criteria were then randomized to active drug or placebo.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Active Drug (Burpropion-SR)</title>
          <description>In total 172 participants were recruited, and 144 were randomized.
Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, participants were randomized to active drug or placebo using the modified Efron’s biased coin toss method to ensure that the drug/placebo cells are balanced with respect to severe depression, presence of nicotine dependence symptoms and gender.
Participants received active treatment with Bupropion-SR (150 mg. twice daily) in conjunction with cognitive-behavior therapy (weekly sessions) for smoking cessation over a 9-week period.
The participants had weekly visits with the target quitting date set for Day 8. The medication checks lasted about 30-45 minutes. The focus was on elicitation of smoking status, nicotine craving and withdrawal symptoms, depressive symptoms and side effects. Body weight and vital signs were measured as well as expired air for CO and urine cotinine levels. Plasma drug levels were obtained at 5 and 9 weeks of treatment.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="P2">
          <title>Matching Placebo</title>
          <description>This arm included placebo treatment twice daily for 9 weeks. Drug and placebo were compounded to look identical, masking both drug type and dosage.
All participants (both drug and placebo groups) received a modified version of the brief office intervention program for adolescent smokers, developed by the American Medical Association. Subjects met with a research counselor for 10 consecutive weekly sessions. The initial session (baseline visit) was 60 min. while the remaining sessions were 20-30 min. Each session was individualized to the needs of the adolescent, based on information gathered at the baseline assessment. The brief office intervention materials include checklists and guidelines for each session to assist the counselor in tailoring the session to the needs of the youth. It involved motivational interviewing, incorporating stages of change, peer and parental and other social influences; negative affect and other psychological factors, addiction and self-efficacy.</description>
