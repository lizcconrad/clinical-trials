      providing relief of non-malignant chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of the matrix fentanyl patch. The study will be conducted
      in opioid-tolerant patients with moderate to severe non-malignant chronic pain currently
      taking an around-the-clock opioid. Patients will discontinue their current opioid regimen and
      begin using ZR-02-01 as soon as possible under the direction of the physician investigator
      upon entry into the study. Patient's dose of ZR 02 01 will be determined by the investigator
      using sponsor-provided conversion. Pain therapy will be under the supervision of the
      physician investigator.

    <description>Patient will rate pain intensity using a 100 mm VAS in which &quot;0&quot; equals &quot;No Pain&quot; and &quot;100&quot; equals &quot;The Worst Pain You Can Imagine.&quot; Patients will be instructed on how to use the VAS and will base their response on the average pain that they experienced over the previous 24 hours. VAS will be collected at all study visits except screening.</description>

    <description>ZR-02-01 patch contains fentanyl dispersed in a solid matrix, and was available in 25, 50,75 and 100 mcg/hr patches. For patients who were using transdermal fentanyl (ie,DuragesicÂ®), the initial dose of ZR-02-01 was the same as their current Duragesic dose. For patients who were taking oral opioids, the initial dose of ZR-02-01 was determined by the investigator using sponsor-provided conversion guidelines. The patches were worn on the chest or upper arm and an overlay was placed over the patch. Patches (and overlays) were replaced every 3 days</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is at least 18 and no older than 75 years of age

          -  Patient has moderate to severe, non-malignant chronic pain that is expected to last

             his/her pain

          -  Patient is already receiving opioid therapy, has demonstrated opioid tolerance, and
             requires a total daily dose of opioids at least equivalent to 25 mcg/hr of transdermal
             fentanyl. Patients who are considered opioid-tolerant are those who have been taking a
             daily dose of at least 30 mg of oral morphine or morphine equivalent opioid for at
             least 2 weeks.
