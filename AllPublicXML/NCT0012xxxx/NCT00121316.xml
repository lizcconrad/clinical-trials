  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is not being conducted in the United States.

      Patients who are intolerant of topical corticosteroids (TCS) have either experienced an
      adverse event resulting from the use of TCS, or require unacceptable levels of exposure to
      TCS in order to control their AD. This is of particular concern for patients with recurrent
      flares on delicate skin areas such as the head and neck.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pimecrolimus cream 1%, a non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug, is efficacious in treating mild to moderate head and neck AD in
      patients who are intolerant of, or dependent on topical corticosteroids.

          -  Patients intolerant of, or dependent on, topical corticosteroids

          -  Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis by the Hanifin and Rajka criteria

          -  For female patients, a negative pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant or who are
             breast-feeding may not be included in the study. Women of child-bearing potential must

        Exclusion Criteria:

        At baseline and throughout the study, patients:

          -  Who have AD on greater than 30% of total body surface area in addition to facial
             eczema

          -  Who have concurrent skin disease (e.g. acne) in the study area or active skin
             infections (active bacterial, viral or fungal infections or infestations, herpes
             simplex, herpes zoster, chicken pox), or other conditions that may interfere with the
             evaluation (e.g. generalized erythroderma, Netherton's syndrome)

          -  Who are immunocompromised (e.g. Lymphoma, AIDS, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome) or have a
             history of malignant disease (with the exception of treated basal-cell carcinoma)

          -  Who have previously reported poor, no clinical response, or hypersensitivity to
             topical pimecrolimus cream (Elidel)

          -  Who have received phototherapy (e.g. UVA, UVB) or systemic therapy
             (e.g.immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, cytostatics) known or suspected to have an
             effect on AD within 4 weeks of Visit 2

          -  Who have received investigational drugs within 8 weeks of first application of study
             drug or planned use of other investigational drugs during participation of this study

          -  Who are unlikely to comply with therapy
