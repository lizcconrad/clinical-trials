  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive radiation therapy often have fatigue or a decrease in feeling well
      causing a &quot;wasting&quot; away. For patients with advanced disease of lung cancer, prostate cancer,
      or cancer that has spread to the bone, it is hoped that this drug may decrease this. If
      patients feel better during treatments they can complete the therapy without any breaks in
      treatment. For treatment to be most effective, it should be given in the amount needed, on a
      particular schedule.

      Subjects will be placed in a group to receive either the drug enbrel, or a placebo. The
      radiation therapy treatments are as they would be given if the person was not on a research
      study. The selection of the group a patient is in is done by random, like flipping a coin.
      The doctor is not able to influence which group anyone is selected for. As is done routinely,
      radiation therapy is given Monday through Friday for about 4 to 6 weeks.The injections of
      enbrel or placebo are given two times a week. The enbrel or placebo is given as an injection
      directly under the skin with a small needle.
