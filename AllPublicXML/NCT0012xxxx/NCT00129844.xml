  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of MGd in non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) when given alone, and to evaluate the difference between two dosing regimens.

      Outline:

      Two-arm, open-label, randomized, 2-stage Phase II trial. Patients will be randomized on the
      first stage to 1 of 2 treatment arms:

      Arm A - 10 mg/kg MGd once per week

      Arm B - 15 mg/kg MGd once every 3 weeks

      Patients will be treated on 3 week cycles, up to a maximum of 8 cycles (24 weeks). Patients
      with either objective response or stable disease after 2 cycles will receive up to 8 cycles
      of therapy. Patients with progressive disease will be terminated from the study.

      At the end of Stage I, both treatment arms will be evaluated, and only the arm(s) that
      demonstrate at least one response (Complete Response or Partial Response) will proceed to
      Stage II. If both arms demonstrate a response, then both will proceed to Stage II.
