  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assist busy primary care clinicians in VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in
      managing complex patients by providing a single, interactive, and personalized source of
      information regarding applicable guidelines for post-MI patients. Specifically, 1) the
      investigators will identify barriers to provider adherence to guidelines within VHA clinics;
      2) Apply guideline-based performance measures to electronic medical records (CPRS) and
      associated administrative data; 3) Implement the interactive Internet intervention developed
      by the NHLBI study, after inclusion of VA-specific components, including performance feedback
      for CBOC clinicians; and 4) Test hypotheses on the intervention's effectiveness,
      sustainability, and cost-effectiveness in both the VA and Medicare populations. This will
      include a randomized controlled trial with the CBOC as a unit of randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some 7.1 million Americans and an estimated 250,000 Veterans actively using VHA are
      Myocardial Infarction (MI) survivors. To date, most guideline interventions focus on a single
      patient condition, but ambulatory post-MI patients are frequently more complex, multiple
      comorbidities, and conflicting guidelines applicable to them. For example, whereas JNC-6
      guidelines for the treatment of hypertension suggest pharmacological treatment at blood
      pressures above 140/80 mm Hg, to be initiated with diuretics or beta-blockers as first line
      agents, other guidance suggests that for post-MI patients with diabetes, treatment cut-offs
      should be lower and ACE-inhibitors may be considered as optimal first-line agents. On October
      1, 2002, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) began a study funded by the National
      Heart, Lung, and Blood institute (NHLBI) as an RO1 (Kiefe, PI (25%), Weissman, co-PI (20%))
      to conduct a randomized trial, MI-plus to increase provider adherence to guidelines for
      post-MI patients. That NHLBI-funded study targets Medicare beneficiaries and their primary
      care providers in Alabama. Its primary goal is to develop and test with a randomized
      controlled trial, an Internet-based multimodal guideline implementation strategy. The
      investigators propose, herewith, to extend and adapt this study to a nationwide sample of VA
      post-MI patients and their primary care providers in the VA.

    <measure>Primary Outcome Was the Performance of Each Provider on Each of Seven Clinical Indicators</measure>
    <time_frame>1/1/02 - 12/31/08</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators used an intent-to-treat approach for our main analysis, basing our outcome measures on provider's eligible patient population in each of the clinics. Performance improvement was calculated at the change (before vs after the intervention) the percentage of provider's patients with each clinical indicator. 1) change in the percentage of patients with improvements in LDL. Improvement defined as LDL-C level &lt; previous 18 mos; 2) Change in the percentage of patients with improvements in A1c. Improvement defined as HbA1c level &lt; previous 18 mos; 3) Change in percentage of patients prescribed Beta Blockers; 4) Change in the percentage of patients prescribed Statins; 5) Change in the percentage of patients prescribed ACEI or ARB; 6) Change in percentage of patients reaching target goal for LDL-C (&lt;100mg/dL); 7) Change in percentage of patients reaching target goal for HbA1c (&lt;8%).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects are defined as any VA-employed physician, PA, or CRNP who is a CBOC
        provider. All such providers will be offered the opportunity to participate and will have
        the option to agree to participate or not. Performance measure data from records of post-MI
        patients of the above providers will be extracted to test the experimental intervention.
        (Note: No individually identifying patient information will be extracted.) All VA-employed
        CBOC providers (physicians, PAs, CRNPs) will be offered the opportunity to participate in
        this study. Any subject may refuse to participate or to discontinue participation at will
        at any point in the study without consequence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential subjects must be VA-employed physician, PA, or CRNP who is a CBOC provider. No
        such healthcare providers will be excluded from the study.

        <description>The investigators used an intent-to-treat approach for our main analysis, basing our outcome measures on provider's eligible patient population in each of the clinics. Performance improvement was calculated at the change (before vs after the intervention) the percentage of provider's patients with each clinical indicator. 1) change in the percentage of patients with improvements in LDL. Improvement defined as LDL-C level &lt; previous 18 mos; 2) Change in the percentage of patients with improvements in A1c.
