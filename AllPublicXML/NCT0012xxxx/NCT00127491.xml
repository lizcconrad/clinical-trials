    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether esophageal pressure (PES) measurements will allow
      the investigators to choose the best method of mechanical ventilation in patients with acute
      lung injury (ALI).

      The current standard of practice for ventilating patients with acute respiratory distress
      syndrome (ARDS) is the ARDSnet protocol (N Engl J Med 2000; 342:1301-1308) which has been
      shown to improve survival by limiting tidal volumes and thus preventing over distention of
      the lungs. However, the lungs can also be damaged by under-inflation during mechanical
      ventilation, and current practice ignores the effects of chest wall compression of the lungs,
      which can cause under-inflation. The investigators have observed that a fraction of
      critically ill patients with apparent ARDS have lung function abnormalities caused by
      extrinsic compression which can be estimated by PES measurements. Changing ventilator
      settings to apply normal physiological pressure to the lung has been beneficial in many such
      patients. This protocol will formally test the clinical utility of PES measurements in
      patients with ARDS.

      This is a randomized controlled trial of therapy directed by esophageal balloon measurements
      (PES) versus therapy directed by ARDSnet protocol, the current standard of care.

    <description>All patients will have an esophageal balloon placed for the purpose of obtaining transpulmonary pressure measurements. The intervention group will undergo transpulmonary pressure-directed controlled mechanical ventilation using parameters directed by the initial balloon measurements. Driving pressures will be adjusted to maintain a transpulmonary plateau pressure of less then 30. The PEEP setting will be set to achieve a transpulmonary end expiratory pressure of 0. Repeat PES measurements will be done at 24, 48 and 72 hours following the initial measurements. Additional measurements will be taken as clinically indicated. Ventilator management by PES measurements will continue for a period of 72 hours.</description>

    <description>All patients will have an esophageal balloon placed for the purpose of obtaining transpulmonary pressure measurements. The control group will be managed using the low tidal volume strategy laid out by the NIHBLI ARDSnet study. These recommendations include a set tidal volume of 6 ml/ kg. Respiratory rate and PEEP are set to maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation. These settings will be continued for a period of 72 hours.</description>

    <description>In both groups an esophageal balloon will be placed and baseline measurements recorded. In the EP group the mechanical ventilation settings will be determined based on these measurements. In the control group measurements will be recorded but ventilation will be based in the existing standard of care wich is the ARDSnet low tidal volume ventilation study. measurements will be repeated at 24, 48 and 72 hours or as needed.</description>
