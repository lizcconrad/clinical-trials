    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long term safety and effectiveness of three doses
      of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to placebo in lowering overall blood glucose
      levels in people with type 2 diabetes who have not previously been treated with drug therapy
      to lower their blood sugar.
