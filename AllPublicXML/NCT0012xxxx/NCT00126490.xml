  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with interleukin-2 works
      in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the white blood cells to kill tumor cells.
      Giving bevacizumab together with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the frequency of major response in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer
      treated with bevacizumab and interleukin-2.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Compare the median progression-free survival and median overall
      survival of patients treated with this regimen with risk-stratified historical controls from
      published risk models.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.
      Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously on days 1-5 in weeks 5-10. Treatment
      repeats every 12 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease then receive bevacizumab
      alone in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Courses with bevacizumab alone repeat every 12 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days and then every 3 months
      for at least 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 10-38 patients will be accrued for this study within 21
      months.
