  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a melanoma vaccine (5 melanoma peptides) is given with either Montanide or
      dendritic cells as adjuvants. This randomized trial will establish the safety of both
      vaccines and compare the 2 vaccine adjuvants in their efficacy to induce immune responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will examine whether DCs pulsed with candidate melanoma-specific peptides
      and KLH can boost CTL responses to melanoma antigens in melanoma patients who are clinically
      free of disease but at high risk for recurrence. This vaccine will be compared to direct
      injection of the same peptides with KLH and Montanide as adjuvant.

    <description>Upon entry into the study, patients randomized to the dendritic cell arm will undergo a complete baseline evaluation and leukapheresis 0.5 to 3 x 106 DCs per peptide antigen (total not to exceed 18 x 106 cells) will be administered intradermally as per injection SOP. They will receive up to 3 booster DC injections (total not to exceed 18 x 10 6 cells per injection) at monthly intervals for a total of 4 injections. The booster injections will not contain KLH, as our volunteer studies have shown that priming occurs following a single injection of DCs</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the Montanide arm will also undergo complete baseline evaluation but not leukapheresis. The peptides will be mixed with the adjuvant, Montanide, and administered subcutaneously at a dose of 100 microgram of each peptide +100 microgram KLH mixed with an equal volume of Montanide. They will receive up to 3 booster injections at monthly intervals for a total of 4 injections. The booster injections will not contain KLH.</description>
