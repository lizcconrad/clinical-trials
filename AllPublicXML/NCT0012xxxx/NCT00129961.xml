    <measure>New Biopsy-Confirmed Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) Lesions Per Subject Per Year</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of new biopsy-confirmed NMSC lesions per subject per year was calculated by summarizing the total number of new BCC and SCC lesions reported over the observation period and standardizing it to an annual rate by multiplying by 365 and dividing by days on study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to First Biopsy Confirmed New NMSC Lesion.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The time to first biopsy confirmed new NMSC lesion starts at 1 day post randomization to biopsy and/or treatment of newly confirmed NMSC lesion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Lesion Free Subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The overall number of subjects who were lesion free were compared between treatment groups with the Cochran Mantel Haenszel test stratified by baseline NMSC stratum. Within each stratum, the Fisher exact test was used to compare the proportions of lesion free subjects between treatment groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nankivell-Calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 months (week 104)</time_frame>
    <description>GFR is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. For this study, GFR was calculated using Nankivell. A normal GFR is &gt; 90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 is consistent with kidney failure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Creatinine Level</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24 months (Week 104)</time_frame>
    <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatinine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine are 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL for females and 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for males, however the normal values are age-dependent as elderly patients typically have smaller muscle mass.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Screening and baseline evaluations were performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization. Randomization assignments by site were stratified by the number of new NMSC lesions in the 12 months prior to enrollment (0-5 lesions vs 6-20 lesions).</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Sirolimus (SRL) Based Regimen</title>
          <description>All subjects discontinued Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) after the morning dose on day 1. SRL was initiated with a loading dose of 6-12mg on day 1, followed by 2-4mg daily and was adjusted to maintain a whole blood trough concentration of 5-15ng/mL (high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Once the SRL trough concentration was ≥ 5ng/mL, subjects receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), or azathioprine (AZA) at randomization had doses reduced to ≤1.5 g/day, ≤1080 mg/day or ≤75 mg/day respectively. If warranted subjects could be switched between MMF, MPS, or AZA or their doses decreased, temporarily withheld, or discontinued. Subjects receiving corticosteroids (CS) at time of randomization or if MMF, MPS, or AZA was discontinued, had to receive CS ≥2.5mg/day of prednisone. Subjects not receiving MMF, MPS, or AZA at time of randomization remained on a minimum of double therapy (SRL and CS). Addition of MMF, MPS, or AZA was permitted.</description>

          <description>Baseline CNI therapy was continued after randomization and doses could be adjusted throughout the study as indicated, but therapy could not be withdrawn. Cyclosporine could be switched to tacrolimus, and vice versa. If warranted subjects could be switched between MMF, MPS, or AZA or their doses could be decreased, temporarily withheld, or discontinued. Subjects undergoing discontinuation of MMF, MPS, or AZA had to receive CS ≥2.5 mg/day of prednisone or the equivalent thereof. If subjects were not receiving MMF, MPS, or AZA at the time of randomization, the addition of MMF, MPS, or AZA was permitted if clinically indicated. If subjects were receiving CS at the time of randomization, CS was maintained at ≥2.5 mg/day of prednisone or the equivalent thereof. CS withdrawal was prohibited. If subjects were not receiving CS at the time of randomization, treatment could be initiated during the conduct of the study if clinically indicated.</description>

SRL was initiated with a loading dose of 6-12mg on day 1, followed by 2-4mg daily and was adjusted to maintain a whole blood trough concentration of 5-15ng/mL (high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Once the SRL trough concentration was ≥ 5ng/mL, subjects receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), or azathioprine (AZA) at randomization had doses reduced to ≤1.5 g/day, ≤1080 mg/day or ≤75 mg/day respectively. If warranted subjects could be switched between MMF, MPS, or AZA or their doses decreased, temporarily withheld, or discontinued. Subjects receiving corticosteroids (CS) at time of randomization or if MMF, MPS, or AZA was discontinued, had to receive CS ≥2.5mg/day of prednisone. Subjects not receiving MMF, MPS, or AZA at time of randomization remained on a minimum of double therapy (SRL and CS). Addition of MMF, MPS, or AZA was permitted.</description>

            <description>All subjects discontinued Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) after the morning dose on day 1. SRL was initiated with a loading dose of 6-12mg on day 1, followed by 2-4mg daily and was adjusted to maintain a whole blood trough concentration of 5-15ng/mL (high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Once the SRL trough concentration was ≥ 5ng/mL, subjects receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), or azathioprine (AZA) at randomization had doses reduced to ≤1.5 g/day, ≤1080 mg/day or ≤75 mg/day respectively. If warranted subjects could be switched between MMF, MPS, or AZA or their doses decreased, temporarily withheld, or discontinued. Subjects receiving corticosteroids (CS) at time of randomization or if MMF, MPS, or AZA was discontinued, had to receive CS ≥2.5mg/day of prednisone. Subjects not receiving MMF, MPS, or AZA at time of randomization remained on a minimum of double therapy (SRL and CS). Addition of MMF, MPS, or AZA was permitted.</description>

        <title>Nankivell-Calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)</title>
        <description>GFR is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR can be measured directly or estimated using established formulas. For this study, GFR was calculated using Nankivell. A normal GFR is &gt; 90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicate poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 is consistent with kidney failure.</description>
        <time_frame>At 24 months (week 104)</time_frame>
        <population>Intention to Treat: All randomly assigned subjects with at least 1 dose of study medication, includes data of subjects on therapy, those off therapy, and those who completed follow-up. For the intention to treat analysis, a GFR of 0 was imputed for graft loss or death, and last observation carried forward (LOCF) for missing values.</population>

SRL was initiated with a loading dose of 6-12mg on day 1, followed by 2-4mg daily and was adjusted to maintain a whole blood trough concentration of 5-15ng/mL (high performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]). Once the SRL trough concentration was ≥ 5ng/mL, subjects receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolate sodium (MPS), or azathioprine (AZA) at randomization had doses reduced to ≤1.5 g/day, ≤1080 mg/day or ≤75 mg/day respectively. If warranted subjects could be switched between MMF, MPS, or AZA or their doses decreased, temporarily withheld, or discontinued. Subjects receiving corticosteroids (CS) at time of randomization or if MMF, MPS, or AZA was discontinued, had to receive CS ≥2.5mg/day of prednisone. Subjects not receiving MMF, MPS, or AZA at time of randomization remained on a minimum of double therapy (SRL and CS). Addition of MMF, MPS, or AZA was permitted.</description>

        <title>Serum Creatinine Level</title>
        <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatinine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine are 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL for females and 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for males, however the normal values are age-dependent as elderly patients typically have smaller muscle mass.</description>
