  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no one standard of care for older patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
      (NHL). The study will examine the tolerability and feasibility to the combination of
      Cyclophosphamide, Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone (CDOP) plus
      Rituximab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly NHL patients tend to tolerate the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) less well when compared to the younger population.
      Cardiotoxicity, as well as neutropenia, are the most common side effects in the elderly
      population with age being a risk factor for doxorubicin induced cardiac toxicity. Treatment
      related toxicity in the older population can preclude adequate therapy and potentially
      contribute to poor outcomes. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin has shown similar efficacy with
      a significant lower incidence of cardiotoxicity ad significantly fewer cardiac events
      compared with conventional doxorubicin. Exploration of alternative regimens to maximize
      tolerability and thus enhance overall efficacy in this population is warranted. Both safety
      and efficacy will be evaluated.
