          -  Patients presenting with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in the absence of major
             depressive disorder (MDD). Patients must suffer from GAD and not from an adjustment
             disorder or anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS). Symptoms of GAD should not
             be situational in nature.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any current and primary diagnosis other than GAD. Patients diagnosed with or who have
             a history of MDD within the past 6 months OR patients diagnosed with or who have a
             history of panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or an eating
             disorder within the past year OR patients who have been diagnosed with obsessive-
             compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar affective disorder, psychosis, factitious disorder
             or somatoform disorders during their lifetime.

          -  History of alcohol or any psychoactive substance abuse of dependence (as defined in

             laboratory abnormality that is not stabilized or is anticipated to require
             hospitalization within 6 months, in the opinion of the investigator. Clinically
             significant laboratory abnormalities are those, that, in the judgement of the
             investigator, indicate a serious medical problem.

          -  Acute liver injury (such as hepatitis) or severe cirrhosis (Child- Pugh Class C)
