      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the adjunctional of interferon alfa to
      structured treatment interruptions correlated with a long time off treatment in HIV-1
      infection.

      The limitations of the drugs used against HIV include their toxicity, their tolerability,
      their propensity to induce resistance when not taken with absolute regularity and their cost.
      Treatment interruption in patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in the setting of
      chronic infection is associated with viral rebound and rapid CD4 T cell decrease conducting
      to antiretroviral therapy restart. In patients with high CD4+ cell counts (patients receiving
      treatment of chronic infection with controlled viremia and patients who are receiving highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) now in whom treatment would not have been started based
      on current guidelines), the investigators evaluated whether the adjunctional of interferon
      alfa 2b to 3 structured treatment interruptions correlated with a long time off treatment.
      HAART was interrupted for 4 weeks, restarted and continued for 12 weeks. After 3 such cycles
      treatment was indefinitely suspended 48 weeks after study entry. Another aim of this study
      was to assess the immunological and virological factors associated with the duration of
      treatment interruption (proviral HIV DNA at baseline and during follow-up, plasma HIV RNA at
      baseline and during follow-up, CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell HIV specific responses at baseline
      and after 6 months of interruption).
