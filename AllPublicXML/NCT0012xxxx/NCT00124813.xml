  <brief_summary>

      Background: In some studies, thalidomide in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to
      be effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In this study,
      the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis.

      Induction therapy: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide, cyclophosphamide,
      oral idarubicin and dexamethasone (T-CID) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma.

      Maintenance therapy: Randomized trial to compare efficacy and toxicity of thalidomide and
      thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy in patients with at least stable
      disease after T-CID.

      the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis.

      After 3-8 cycles of T-CID patients with at least stable disease will be randomized to receive
      thalidomide or thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy for at least one year
      or until progression.
