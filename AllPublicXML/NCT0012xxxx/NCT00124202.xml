      This study is to determine if a fatty meal would improve the ERCP procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A fatty meal is a potent stimulator of cholecystikinin (CCK) in human body. The biological
      effect of CCK is increasing bile secretion and relaxing the sphincter of Oddi. Theoretically,
      a fatty meal should facilitate the effect on cannulation at ERCP. If a fatty meal can make
      the major papilla cannulation easier, it may significantly shorten the procedure time for
      ERCP and even decrease complications of the procedure, since the complication rate of
      post-ERCP is positively related to the time of the procedure.

      Comparison: Approximately one hour before ERCP procedure, patient will have a fatty meal in
      the study group and normal saline in control group.
