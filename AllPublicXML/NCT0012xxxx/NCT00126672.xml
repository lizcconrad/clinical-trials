      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as sirolimus, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sirolimus works in treating patients with
      angiomyolipoma of the kidney.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of sirolimus, in terms of objective response rate, in patients
           with angiomyolipoma of the kidney secondary to tuberous sclerosis (TSC) or
           lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine changes in other TSC lesions (e.g., tubers, subependymal giant cell
           astrocytomas, facial angiofibromas, or kidney cysts) in patients with TSC treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine changes in pulmonary disease in patients with LAM treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sirolimus once daily for 12 months in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months and 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-30
      months.
