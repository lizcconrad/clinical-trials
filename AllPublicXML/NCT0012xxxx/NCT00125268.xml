  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if near infrared light therapy is effective in
      decreasing pain in patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. The hypothesis of the study
      was that the percentage of subjects with at least 40% improvement in visual analog scale
      score for pain after 4 weeks of treatment is higher for Monochromatic Near-infrared
      Photoenergy (MIRE) treatment than for sham treatment.

      Pain is a very common symptom, between 65-80%, in patients with peripheral neuropathy. This
      study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of monochromatic near infrared photoenergy
      therapy (MIRE) in the treatment of pain in axonal peripheral neuropathy. This will be
      compared with a placebo (sham) device.

      The MIRE is a FDA approved, drug-free, non-invasive, medical therapeutic device that uses
      near-infrared light emitting diodes to deliver monochromatic near infrared photoenergy (MIRE)
      through contact with the skin. The effect of MIRE is believed to increase local blood
      circulation by dilating vessels and to reduce pain by decreasing local swelling and
      inflammation. MIRE is also thought to increase local levels of nitric oxide (NO) which may
      decrease pain levels.

      Study subjects will receive treatment with the device or the placebo device 3 times per week
      for 4 weeks. Response will be measured during and after the treatment period.

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects That Have a Greater Than or Equal to Forty Percent Decrease on the Visual Analog Pain Scale at the End of Four Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was measured by a 10 cm long Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes. On this scale 0 means no pain and 10 cm means extreme pain. The investigator measures the mark made by the subject in cm and records this for the value of pain.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects That Have a Forty Percent Reduction of Pain Measured by the Neuropathic Pain Scale at the End of Four Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The neuropathic pain scale consists of 10 questions with individual answers rated from 1 to 10, with 0 = no pain to 10 = the most intense pain imaginable. The overall score could range from 0 to 100, with 0 = no pain to 100 = the most intense pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>The SF-8 Health Survey has 8 questions, each question measuring each of the eight domains of health. Scores are calibrated so that 50 is the average score or norm. A lower score indicates poorer health, and a higher score indicates excellent health.</description>

    <description>Monochromatic near infrared photo energy (MIRE). A 30-minute application of MIRE results in a radiant exposure of 43.2 joules per square centimeter (J/cm^2). The design of the flexible pads allows the infrared energy to be delivered perpendicular to and in contact with the involved site. MIRE applied to the skin facilitates the release of a small molecule of the free radical nitric oxide from hemoglobin and other proteins in surrounding tissue. Increased levels of nitric oxide improve the circulation of blood enhancing wound healing and reducing pain.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects That Have a Greater Than or Equal to Forty Percent Decrease on the Visual Analog Pain Scale at the End of Four Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Pain was measured by a 10 cm long Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS does not have any pre-set marks between the extremes. On this scale 0 means no pain and 10 cm means extreme pain. The investigator measures the mark made by the subject in cm and records this for the value of pain.</description>
