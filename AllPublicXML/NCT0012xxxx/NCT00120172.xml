  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there is no one standard of care for older patients with metastatic colorectal
      cancer. The study will examine the tumor response to capecitabine, oxaliplatin, plus
      bevacizumab. The study will also gather information on the usefulness and side effects of
      this treatment combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is primarily a disease of the elderly, with the median age in the United
      States of 70 years. Age greater than 65 years at presentation is not a contraindication to
      standard therapies; acceptable morbidity and mortality, as well as long term survival, are
      achieved in this patient population. However, studies evaluating combination therapy have
      generally involved younger patients with high performance status scores. Given the
      non-over-lapping safety profiles of the proposed study agents and the potential synergy, it
      would be of benefit to explore the combination of oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and bevacizumab
      in the treatment of older patients with colorectal cancer. Time to progression, overall
      response, duration of response, and toxicity profile will be evaluated. The feasibility of
      using a self-report geriatric assessment tool will also be assessed.
