  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if assisted embryo hatching can improve pregnancy
      rates for good prognosis patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with day 3 embryo
      transfer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Assisted hatching is a procedure in which a hole is made in the hard covering of a developing
      embryo to allow the embryo to hatch more easily from this shell. This procedure is sometimes
      used before transferring embryos to patients after in vitro fertilization (IVF) in an attempt
      to improve resulting pregnancy rates. Assisted hatching has been shown to improve outcomes
      among certain groups of patients, such as older patients or patients with a history of IVF
      treatment and embryo transfer without success. Whether this procedure could benefit the
      broader patient population remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
      potential benefits of assisted hatching for good prognosis patients who would not typically
      be treated with assisted hatching under current standard protocols. Pregnancy rates were
      compared between good prognosis patients undergoing IVF with day-3 embryo transfer with or
      without assisted hatching of the transferred embryos.
