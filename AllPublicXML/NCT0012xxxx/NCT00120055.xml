  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and/or
      its metabolites is altered in patients with confirmed atorvastatin-induced myopathy compared
      to healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 24 hour pharmacokinetic investigation of atorvastatin and metabolites will be performed in
      15 patients with a history of atorvastatin -induced myotoxicity. The possible link to
      relevant mutations in SLCO1B1, CYP3A5 and MDR1 will be also be investigated
