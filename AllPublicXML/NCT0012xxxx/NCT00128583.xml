      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying vaccine therapy to see how well it works in treating
      patients with malignant melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response in patients with in-transit cutaneous malignant melanoma treated
           with active immunotherapy comprising polyvalent melanoma vaccine (Canvaxin™).

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive polyvalent melanoma vaccine (Canvaxin™) subcutaneously to the armpit and
      groin areas every 2 weeks for approximately 10 weeks (5 doses) and then every 4 weeks for up
      to approximately 1 year of total treatment (total of 15 doses). Patients with no evidence of
      response at week 24 receive no further treatment. Patients whose disease continues to respond
      after completion of study treatment are eligible for a new study in which they will continue
      treatment with polyvalent melanoma vaccine (Canvaxin™).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
