      Complications resulting from medications, or adverse drug events (ADEs), are prevalent and
      are a major source of excess morbidity and costs. ADEs are particularly problematic in older
      patients because of their higher burden of comorbidity and diminished physiologic reserve. In
      addition, older patients are more likely to be exposed to polypharmacy, a major risk factor
      for ADEs. While ADEs may be idiosyncratic, many result from medical errors and inadequate
      systems for ensuring the safe and effective use of medications.

      The goal of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a potentially potent intervention
      to improve the use of medications in older outpatients enrolled in VA primary care clinics.
      The intervention-Enhanced Pharmacy Care-involves a formal, multi-dimensional evaluation of
      patients� medication regimens by a trained clinical pharmacist and board-certified
      geriatrician.

      Background:

      Complications resulting from medications, or adverse drug events (ADEs), are prevalent and
      are a major source of excess morbidity and costs. ADEs are particularly problematic in older
      patients because of their higher burden of comorbidity and diminished physiologic reserve. In
      addition, older patients are more likely to be exposed to polypharmacy, a major risk factor
      for ADEs. While ADEs may be idiosyncratic, many result from medical errors and inadequate
      systems for ensuring the safe and effective use of medications.

      The goal of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of a potentially potent intervention
      to improve the use of medications in older outpatients enrolled in VA primary care clinics.
      The intervention-Enhanced Pharmacy Care-involves a formal, multi-dimensional evaluation of
      patients� medication regimens by a trained clinical pharmacist and board-certified
      geriatrician.

      Objectives:

      The study has the following six aims: 1) Compare changes in prescribing practices-as measured
      by medication appropriateness, number of medications, and cost of prescribed
      medications-between baseline and follow-up in patients randomized to Enhanced Pharmacy Care
      and patients randomized to usual care; 2) Compare other medication-based endpoints in the two
      groups, including the occurrence of potential ADEs, medication compliance, and patient
      knowledge of medications; 3) Compare changes in health-related-quality-of-life in the two
      groups; 4) Compare patient perceptions of the quality of VA outpatient care in the two
      groups; 5) Compare health care utilization during the one-year study period in the two
      groups; and 6) Examine attitudes of primary care providers (PCPs) about the intervention.

      Methods:

      Patients were eligible for the trial if they were 65 years and older and receiving
      prescriptions for &gt; 5 medications in a VA primary care clinic. Patients were randomized to
      usual care or to the intervention, which included a structured medication history and medical
      records review. For intervention patients, therapeutic recommendations were developed and
      presented to primary care providers. Baseline and 3-month measures were obtained and change
      was assessed by analysis of covariance.

      Status:

      493 patients have been enrolled in the trial and 12-month follow-up has been completed on
      over 95% of patients. Preliminary results have been evaluated and abstracts have been
      submitted to national meetings, including the 2004 VA HSR&amp;D and 2004 SGIM Annual Meetings
      where it will be presented as an oral presentation. We are completing all the data cleaning
      and will be performing final analyses on the data, with manuscript preparation. Final outcome
      assessment using the Medication Appropriateness Index is in the final stage.
