      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of single doses of
      QAB149 up to 3000 µg delivered via a single-dose, dry powder inhaler in patients with mild to
      moderate COPD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and/or female patients with mild to moderate stable COPD, diagnosed according to
             the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines; 40-75
             years of age

          -  Prebronchodilator baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 30-80% of the
             Quanjer predicted normal value (Quanjer et al. 1993) and at least 0.75 L with
             FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 70% of predicted [GOLD guidelines].

          -  Previous smokers (&gt;10 pack-years). Ten pack years are defined as: 20 cigarettes a day
             for 10 years; 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years; or 40 cigarettes a day for 5 years.
             Current smokers, with &gt;10 pack year history, can be included under certain conditions.

          -  Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting measured in the supine position) which are within
             the following ranges:

               -  oral body temperature between 35.0-37.5 °C;

               -  systolic blood pressure, 100-170 mm Hg;

               -  diastolic blood pressure, 50-100 mm Hg;

               -  pulse rate, 50 - 90 beats per minute (bpm).

          -  Patients must weigh a minimum of 50 kg to participate in this study.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent prior to study participation.

          -  Able to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          -  Patients with a QTc interval above 0.43 seconds for males and 0.45 seconds for females
             at the screening visit. If pre-treatment values on Day 1 of the treatment periods
             exceed 0.45 and 0.47 seconds for males and females respectively the visit may be
             re-scheduled once.

          -  Patients with a history of prolonged QTc intervals, or a family history of prolonged
             QT syndrome.

          -  Predominant diagnosis of asthma. (Patients must present without evidence of active
             asthma.)

          -  Patients who have been hospitalized or had emergency treatment for acute COPD
             exacerbation in the one month prior to or during screening.

          -  Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection within one month prior to
             screening.

          -  Patients with concomitant pulmonary disease, including a history of cancer

        Other exclusion criteria apply.
