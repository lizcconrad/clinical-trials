  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objectives of this protocol are to develop a multi-center prospective data
      collection process to identify risk factors for progression of Necrotizing Enterocolitis
      (NEC). These data will be used as a basis for identifying management strategies appropriate
      for further evaluation (randomized controlled trials), to develop evidence-based standards of
      care, and as a tool to facilitate quality-assessment at individual centers through comparison
      of outcomes with the entire database.
