      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a new test of ability to understand speech
      in noise and an associated counseling program can improve hearing aid satisfaction.
      Participants complete routine hearing tests, some hearing-related questionnaires and the new
      speech test. One group of participants receives the new form of counseling, the second group
      does not. Hearing aid satisfaction following 10 weeks hearing aid use is compared across the
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing aid dissatisfaction continues to be disappointingly high, even though hearing aid
      technology has improved dramatically over the last 10 years or so. Unfortunately, the results
      of most commonly used self-report measures cannot be directly compared with the results from
      performance measures since the modes of testing are very different. Thus, it is hard for
      clinicians to reconcile data from individuals reporting more handicap or less hearing aid
      satisfaction than would be expected from their performance.

      In this study, the investigators use a test known as the Performance-Perceptual Test (PPT) to
      determine whether simple counseling based upon discussion of PPT results can be used to
      better align perceived and measured ability to understand speech-in-noise; and, more
      importantly, whether such counseling can decrease reported handicap and improve hearing aid
      satisfaction.

      Hearing aid users complete the PPT for aided and unaided listening, along with standardized
      questionnaires measuring reported auditory disability, handicap and hearing aid satisfaction.
      Following this, subjects are randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subjects in Group 1
      receive counseling from the experimenter in the form of an explanation and discussion of
      their PPT results. Subjects in Group 2 also participate in a discussion with the
      experimenter, but it does not include an explanation of the PPT. Two weeks after enrollment
      in the study subjects complete a second set of questionnaires. Ten weeks after study
      enrollment subjects return to the laboratory to rerun the test battery. The impact of the
      counseling upon PPT values, reported handicap and hearing aid satisfaction and benefit will
      be compared across the two groups.

    <measure>Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 70 (end of study) only</time_frame>
    <description>PIADS: The PIADS measures the psychosocial impact of any assistive device(s). Here that is a hearing aid. The PIADS is a 26-item self-rating scale. The user rates each item on a seven-point scale that ranges from negative 3 (maximum negative impact) to positive 3 (maximum positive impact). The midpoint, zero, indicates no impact or no perceived change resulting from device use. It measures three quality-of-life domains: (1) Adaptability that reflects the inclination or motivation to participate socially and take risks; (2) Competence that reflects perceived functional capability, independence, and performance; and (3) Self-esteem that reflects self-confidence, self esteem, and emotional well-being.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 70 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>HHI: The HHI for the elderly is for individuals over age 65 years; the HHI for adults is for individuals aged 65 years and younger. Both are 25-item questionnaires that assess the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. The versions differ in the wording of three questions. Items are answered on a scale of Yes (4 points), Sometimes (2 points), and No (0 points) with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing handicap. Scores can range from 0 (no handicap) to 100 (maximum handicap).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 70 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>APHAB: The APHAB is a 24-item questionnaire that documents hearing difficulties in specified listening situations. Items are answered on a seven-point scale from ' Always ' to ' Never ' with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing disability. The questionnaire has four subscales: Ease of communication, Reverberation, Background noise, and Aversiveness, from which a global score is computed by averaging the Ease of communication, Reverberation, and Background noise scale scores. Questions are answered for unaided and aided listening. By subtracting aided scores from unaided scores a measure of reported aided benefit is obtained. Scores can range from 0 (no disability) to 99 (maximum disability).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 70 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The IOI-HA is a seven-item questionnaire for which hearing-aid use, hearing-aid benefit, residual activity limitation, hearing-aid satisfaction, residual participation restriction, impact on others, and quality of life are rated on a five-point scale. An overall IOI-HA score is generated by averaging responses to all seven items. Higher scores reflect better self-reported outcome. Scores can range from 7 (poorest outcome) to 35 (best outcome).</description>

        <title>Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS)</title>
        <description>PIADS: The PIADS measures the psychosocial impact of any assistive device(s). Here that is a hearing aid. The PIADS is a 26-item self-rating scale. The user rates each item on a seven-point scale that ranges from negative 3 (maximum negative impact) to positive 3 (maximum positive impact). The midpoint, zero, indicates no impact or no perceived change resulting from device use. It measures three quality-of-life domains: (1) Adaptability that reflects the inclination or motivation to participate socially and take risks; (2) Competence that reflects perceived functional capability, independence, and performance; and (3) Self-esteem that reflects self-confidence, self esteem, and emotional well-being.</description>

Both are 25-item questionnaires that assess the social and emotional consequences of hearing loss. The versions differ in the wording of three questions. Items are answered on a scale of Yes (4 points), Sometimes (2 points), and No (0 points) with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing handicap. Scores can range from 0 (no handicap) to 100 (maximum handicap).</description>

        <title>Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB)</title>
        <description>APHAB: The APHAB is a 24-item questionnaire that documents hearing difficulties in specified listening situations. Items are answered on a seven-point scale from ‘ Always ’ to ‘ Never ’ with higher scores indicating greater reported hearing disability. The questionnaire has four subscales: Ease of communication, Reverberation, Background noise, and Aversiveness, from which a global score is computed by averaging the Ease of communication, Reverberation, and Background noise scale scores. Questions are answered for unaided and aided listening. By subtracting aided scores from unaided scores a measure of reported aided benefit is obtained. Scores can range from 0 (no disability) to 99 (maximum disability).</description>

        <description>The IOI-HA is a seven-item questionnaire for which hearing-aid use, hearing-aid benefit, residual activity limitation, hearing-aid satisfaction, residual participation restriction, impact on others, and quality of life are rated on a five-point scale. An overall IOI-HA score is generated by averaging responses to all seven items. Higher scores reflect better self-reported outcome. Scores can range from 7 (poorest outcome) to 35 (best outcome).</description>
