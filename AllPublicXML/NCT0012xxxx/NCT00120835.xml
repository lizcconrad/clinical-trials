  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted in treatment-naive patients (no previous hepatitis C treatment)
      to evaluate the safety of valopicitabine (NM283) alone and together with pegylated
      interferon, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      hepatitis C infection. This study is also evaluating the ability of valopicitabine to
      decrease the amount of hepatitis C virus in the body. The results for patients taking
      valopicitabine alone will be compared with the results for patients taking valopicitabine
      together with pegylated interferon.
