  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions
      surgically treated with curettage, followed by imiquimod 5% cream as postsurgical adjuvant
      therapy, will have an improved cure rate over the ED/C historical norm of approximately 70%
      at 1-year posttreatment follow-up. A secondary objective is to assess cosmetic outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, phase IIIb, multicenter, single arm, historical-controlled study.
      Biopsy-confirmed BCC lesions (1 per subject) were excised by curettage, with no
      electrodessication. Approximately 1 week later, treatment with imiquimod 5% cream was
      initiated. Imiquimod was applied to the target BCC once daily, 5 times per week (5x/week) for
      up to 6 weeks. Rest periods were allowed as needed. Subjects reported to the study center at
      treatment weeks 1, 2, and 6, and posttreatment at weeks 12, 26, and 52. At treatment week 6
      and all posttreatment visits, the investigator clinically assessed the target site for tumor
      clearance and cosmetic outcome. A template made at initiation and created from clear plastic
      overlay aided in locating the target tumor site. If the investigator identified a lesion that
      had occurred or recurred at the target site, the subject was discontinued from the study and
      counted as a recurrence/persistence (R/P).

    <measure>Cosmetic outcome of the target lesion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The cosmetic outcome of the target lesion at 1 year posttreatment was the secondary efficacy measurement. The investigator judged cosmetic outcome by using a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the parameters of hypo- and hyperpigmentation,roughness, scarring, and overall skin health and appearance.</description>
