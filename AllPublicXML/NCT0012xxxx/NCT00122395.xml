  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, acceptability and ease of the
      administration of two screening methods, a pen and paper questionnaire and an audiotape with
      headsets, for screening for intimate partner violence in a pediatric emergency department
      (ED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant health problem, affecting 2 - 4 million
      women each year. Over half of the homes in which women are abused contain children, with 3.3
      - 10 million children witnessing IPV each year. In 1998, the American Academy of Pediatrics
      (AAP) issued guidelines stating that “identifying and intervening on behalf of battered women
      may be one of the most effective means of preventing child abuse,” and recommending that
      pediatricians perform routine IPV screening. Because of the substantial number of families
      seen in the emergency department (ED), this setting could provide an important site in which
      to implement universal screening. Exactly how to implement screening in this busy environment
      is unclear. One possible approach involves the use of an audiotape with a headset with a
      prerecorded screening questionnaire that prompts the respondent to circle “yes” or “no”
      answers on an otherwise blank sheet of paper. This method of screening has the potential
      benefits of:

        -  Providing a more private method of screening;

        -  Improving screening of women who cannot read well;

        -  Enhancing the rate of screening by removing the burden of screening from providers.

      Comparison: Female caregivers in a pediatric ED will be randomized to answering domestic
      violence (DV) screening questions either via pen and paper or via audiotape. After answering
      these screening questions, all women will be asked standardized questions about the
      acceptability, safety and ease of use of the method to which they are randomized.
