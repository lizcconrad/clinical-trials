      The study is designed to study the effectiveness of 123I-mIBG as a diagnostic imaging agent
      in evaluating patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma or phaeochromocytoma.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Subject must either have:

               1. known or suspected neuroblastoma OR

               2. known or suspected phaeochromocytoma

          -  Subjects are not eligible for the study if they have any clinically active, serious,
             life-threatening disease other than neuroblastoma or phaeochromocytoma with a life
             expectancy of less than 30 days or where participation in the study might compromise
             the management of the subject or other reason that in the judgement of the
             investigator(s) makes the subject unsuitable for participation in the study.
