  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with abnormal kidney function are at increased risk for complications following
      heart surgery, including worsening kidney function possibly requiring dialysis, a prolonged
      stay in the critical care unit and hospital, and the increased risk of death. Prior attempts
      at kidney protection for heart surgery patients have had mixed results. Two medicines,
      fenoldopam and N-acetylcysteine, have been shown to protect kidney function in other
      circumstances that cause kidney stress. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      these medications will help to maintain the function of diseased kidneys during heart
      surgery.

      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate fenoldopam and
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) individually, and together, as renal protective agents for patients
      with renal insufficiency undergoing heart surgery. Subjects have chronic renal insufficiency
      with creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt;/= 40cc/min but not on pre-operative dialysis, and receive:
      NAC 600 mg by mouth (po) twice a day (bid) or placebo starting 24 hours pre-operative and
      continuing through the day of surgery; and/or fenoldopam 0.1 mcg/kg/min intravenous (IV) or
      saline placebo at anesthetic induction and continuing for 48 hours. Outcome data include:
      nadir, post-operative day 3 and post-operative day 14 CrCl, time to CrCl nadir, length of
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, length of post-operative hospital stay, hospital costs,
      mortality, and the need for hemodialysis. Intraoperative and post-operative pressor use is
      being monitored. The enrollment will include 80 patients (20 in each group).
