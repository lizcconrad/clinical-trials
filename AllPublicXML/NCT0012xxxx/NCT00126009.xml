      The primary objective is:

        -  To compare the efficacy of the association valproate-amisulpride (400 to 800 mg/day) to
           the association valproate-haloperidol (5 to 15 mg/day) in bipolar I patients suffering
           from a manic episode according to DSM IV TR (American Psychiatric Association [APA]
           2000) and treated for a 3-month period.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the clinical and biological safety of the association valproate-amisulpride
           to the association valproate-haloperidol;

        -  To assess the patient status 3 weeks and 3 months after inclusion; and

        -  To assess patient satisfaction at 3 months.

          -  A minimum total score of 20 on the Young Mania Rating Scale at D0

          -  A score of &gt; or = 3 for 2 of the following Y-MRS items: elevated mood; increased motor
             activity energy; sleep; content (grandiosity).

          -  A score of &gt; or = 5 on the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale for the severity
             of mania items at D0

          -  Using an effective contraception method (women of childbearing age only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria on D-3:

          -  Potentially significant alterations of laboratory tests on D0:

               -  ASAT or ALAT &gt; 2 upper limit of normal (ULN). If ASAT or ALAT values range
                  between 1.5 ULN and 2 ULN, the patient can be randomized and a new test will be
                  performed 7 days after randomization;

               -  Alkaline phosphatase levels or bilirubin levels not within normal reference
                  range.

          -  QTc prolongation on D0; QTc Bazett &gt; 450ms in male patients and QTc &gt; 470ms in female
