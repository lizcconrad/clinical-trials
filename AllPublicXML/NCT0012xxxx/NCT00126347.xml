  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reducing the increase in plasma
      homocysteine concentrations following an oral methionine load affects vascular function in
      healthy volunteers, irrespective of the homocysteine-lowering agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high plasma homocysteine is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death.
      However, it remains uncertain whether homocysteine per se, low status of folate, or other
      factors related to methionine metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
      disease. Previous studies have shown that a high concentration of homocysteine in blood is
      related to an impaired vascular function in the arteries, an indicator of cardiovascular
      disease risk. Virtually all intervention trials used folic acid as a homocysteine-lowering
      agent, which may however affect vascular function through mechanisms not related to
      homocysteine. The researchers investigated whether reduction in homocysteine concentrations
      following a methionine load, via supplementation with serine, betaine or folic acid improves
      vascular function in healthy volunteers, in order to distinguish between effects of folic
      acid and of homocysteine-lowering per se.

      Comparison: The effects of supplementation with serine, folic acid and betaine (all together
      with an oral methionine load) were compared to the effects of a placebo (together with a
      methionine load) on plasma homocysteine concentrations and on vascular function following
      methionine loading in healthy volunteers.
