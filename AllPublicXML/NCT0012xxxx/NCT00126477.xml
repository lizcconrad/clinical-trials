      RATIONALE: Studying quality of life in cancer survivors may help determine the long-term
      effects of hematologic cancer and may help improve the quality of life for future cancer
      survivors.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the quality of life of adult cancer survivors who
      have undergone a previous bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplant for a childhood
      hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the extent to which adult cancer survivors who have undergone prior bone
           marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for a pediatric hematologic
           malignancy require ongoing health care and whether these needs change with increasing
           time after transplantation.

        -  Correlate physical capabilities, body image, physical limitations, including sexuality
           issues which alter or influence lifestyle, with time after transplantation in these
           patients.

        -  Determine whether cognitive abilities relative to memory and neurobehavioral ratings
           change with increasing time after transplantation in these patients.

        -  Correlate social and relationship abilities with length of time after transplantation in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients and siblings complete a self-report quality of life questionnaire,
      including outcome assessments of neuroendocrine function, cognitive abilities, physical
      capability, and psychosocial behavior.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 750 patients (375 adult cancer survivors [case group] and
      375 siblings [control group]) will be accrued for this study within 7 years.
