  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the proposed pilot study is to assess the effects of fast food meals,
      varying in serving size and rate of delivery, on energy (calorie) intake in adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a three-period crossover design, the investigators will evaluate three acute feeding
      conditions.

        -  Under Condition A, the total amount of food in a large fast food meal will be delivered
           on a single tray at Time 0 (start of meal).

        -  Under Condition B, the same fast food meal will be equally divided among 4 separate
           portions, with all portions delivered at Time 0.

        -  Under Condition C, the meal again will be equally divided among 4 separate portions, but
           the portions will be delivered at 15-minute time intervals (Time 0, 15 minutes, 30
           minutes, 45 minutes).
