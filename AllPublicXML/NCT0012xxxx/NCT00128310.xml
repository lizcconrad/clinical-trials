  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assume that progression-free survival mean time for patients treated with
      vinorelbine will be 3 months, and for patients treated with gemcitabine plus vinorelbine will
      be 5 months. That implies a reduction in risk ratio of 40% (Hazard ratio = 1,67). Assuming a
      bilateral alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 10%, and the number of events needed if 60%
      of patients have progressed after 1 year, the number of patients needed per treatment arm is
      114. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out, the final number of patients is 252 (126
      per arm).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnoses of breast cancer, with metastases.

          -  Metastatic lesions should not be curable with surgery or radiotherapy.

          -  Women of age &gt; 18.

          -  To have received a previous treatment with anthracyclines and taxanes.

          -  A maximum of 2 previous chemotherapy treatment lines for metastatic disease.

          -  Previous radiotherapy is allowed, whenever the radiated area is not the only disease
             location.

          -  At least 4 weeks since the last previous antineoplastic treatment; patient must have
             recovered from all previous toxicities.

          -  Performance status &lt; 2 in World Health Organization (WHO) scale.

          -  Clinically measurable, non measurable or really non measurable disease, as per
             Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients able to comply and to receive an adequate follow-up.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: neutrophils ≥ 2 x 10^9/L; platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L;
             hemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L.

          -  Calcium within normal limits.

          -  Premenopausal women must adopt an adequate contraceptive method during the study and
             up to 3 months after treatment finalization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection or serious concomitant disease (investigator’s criteria).

          -  Clinical evidence of metastases in the central nervous system (CNS).

          -  Blastic bone lesions as only disease.

          -  Previous neurological toxicity grade 3-4 (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity
             Criteria [NCI-CTC] v.2.0).

          -  Previous treatment with gemcitabine and/or vinorelbine.

          -  More than 2 previous chemotherapy treatment lines for metastatic disease.

          -  Abnormal liver function (bilirubin &gt; 2.0-fold upper normal limit (UNL); ALT and AST
             &gt;2.5-fold UNL). In patients with hepatic metastasis, a value of ALT and AST of up to
             5-fold UNL is permitted.

          -  Unpaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL).

          -  Pregnancy or lactating.

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent in the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Second malignancy (except for cervix carcinoma in situ or skin carcinoma – no
             melanoma- with an adequate treatment). Previous malignancies are allowed if
             disease-free survival is superior to 5 years, except for renal carcinoma or melanoma.

          -  Males.
