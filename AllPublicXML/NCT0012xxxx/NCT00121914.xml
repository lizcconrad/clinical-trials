  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a consequence of liver cirrhosis. In early tumour stages,
      tumour resection or liver transplantation are therapeutic options; later tumour stages may be
      treated with locally ablative treatments such as percutaneous ethanol instillation (PEI),
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or radio-frequency thermoablation. This randomized
      study investigates the effect of PEI on survival of patients with HCC. All patients will
      receive hormonal treatment (long-acting somatostatin intramuscularly [i.m.]) and will be
      randomized for treatment with PEI or no additional treatment.

      This is a randomized two-arm parallel group study.

        -  Study group: PEI + long-acting somatostatin

        -  Control group: long-acting somatostatin alone

      Aims of the study:

        -  Does treatment with PEI+ long-acting somatostatin prolong survival as compared to
           treatment with long-acting somatostatin alone?

        -  Can time to tumour progression be extended in patients treated with PEI + long-acting
           somatostatin as compared to treatment with long-acting somatostatin alone?
