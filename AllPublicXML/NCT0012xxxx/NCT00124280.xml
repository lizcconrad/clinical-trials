  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of everolimus treatment of patients with
      advanced NSCLC. The rationale for investigating everolimus in advanced NSCLC previously
      treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus EGFR inhibitors, like gefitinib or erlotinib,
      is based on following:

        -  The medical need for the better therapy for advanced NSCLC and limited efficacy of the
           currently available therapy in advanced NSCLC.

        -  Postulated association of relevant cell-signaling pathways targeted by everolimus with
           different aspects of oncogenesis, disease progression, and response/resistance to
           treatment.

        -  Effectiveness of everolimus and rapamycin in preclinical models of lung cancer

        -  Early reports of clinical responses to monotherapy with mTOR inhibitors in advanced
           NSCLC.

      There is evidence that an enhanced PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is inhibited by everolimus,
      may be one of the key changes accounting for different aspects of oncogenesis, disease
      progression, and response/resistance to NSCLC cancer treatment. The use of the mTOR inhibitor
      everolimus in treatment of advanced NSCLC would be a novel therapeutic approach that proposes
      to logically manipulate the cell's regulatory pathways to enable control of tumor growth.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) NSCLC

          -  Tissue sample of the metastatic or primary tumor available for pathology evaluation
             and molecular marker analyses

          -  Patients who have received ≤ 2 chemotherapy regimens, one of which must have included
             cisplatinum or carboplatin, and who have documented evidence of tumor progression (Arm
             1)

          -  Patients who have received ≤ 2 chemotherapy regimens, one of which must have included
             cisplatinum or carboplatin as well as a small molecule EGFR inhibitor (as a separate
             regimen) with documented tumor progression despite at least 4 weeks therapy with
             either gefitinib or erlotinib (Arm 2)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent therapy with agents used otherwise as anticancer therapy (for example,
             methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Any investigational drug, other than EGFR inhibitor (Arm 2), within the preceding 4
             weeks

          -  Chronic treatment with steroids or another immunosuppressive agent

          -  Uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to
             require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
