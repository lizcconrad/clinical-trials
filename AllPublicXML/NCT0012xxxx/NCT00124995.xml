  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although widely used for the treatment of pediatric status asthmaticus, intravenous
      terbutaline has potentially significant side effects; may not improve outcomes; and may
      increase Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay. This study is designed to test the
      efficacy of intravenous terbutaline for the treatment of status asthmaticus by adding
      intravenous terbutaline or placebo to standard asthma treatment. The dose of terbutaline or
      placebo will be titrated according to severity of illness as quantified by a validated
      clinical asthma score. Differences in outcomes between the study groups, such as length of
      stay, hospital costs, and lung function will be compared.
