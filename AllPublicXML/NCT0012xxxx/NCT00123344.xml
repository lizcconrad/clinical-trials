  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with
      substantial morbidity and mortality. Present treatment strategies are aimed at termination of
      AF and prevention of AF recurrence using antiarrhythmic drugs or heart rate control drugs.
      Drugs are not always well tolerated, so atrial pacing as a strategy for prevention of atrial
      tachyarrhythmias is being explored.

      The AT501 pacemaker has both &quot;prevention&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot; algorithms for atrial
      tachyarrhythmias. The investigators wish to determine whether these special features, over
      the long term, decrease the amount of time the person experiences AF.

      There are some clinical and experimental data to suggest that atrial overdrive pacing should
      prevent AF. In our pacemaker population with tachy-brady syndrome, and in the PA3 study
      population, we observed that AF frequently clusters and may recur early following an episode
      of AF.

      We are conducting a randomized trial of both prevention algorithms and antitachycardia pacing
      (ATP) therapies for the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias and thereby prevention of AF
      over the longterm.

      Patients with a history of paroxysmal AF who received an AT501 pacemaker for the treatment of
      bradycardia will be randomized to having both the prevention and therapy algorithms &quot;ON&quot;,
      both &quot;OFF&quot; or having only the therapy algorithms &quot;ON&quot;. They will be followed every 3 months
      for 1 year, then every 6 months for an 2 additional years. Recurrence and frequency of AF
      will be determined over time based on data retrieved from the device at each follow-up visit.
