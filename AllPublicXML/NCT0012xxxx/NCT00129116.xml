  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine
      and 1 formulation of Hib-MenC-TT vaccine compared to a control group receiving licensed
      meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine, each administered at 2, 3, and 4 months of age.
      Antibody persistence and immune responses to booster vaccinations were additionally assessed
      at 12 to 18 months of age.

At 12-18 months of age (at study Month 0 of the booster phase), subjects received a booster dose of the two vaccines administered in the primary vaccination course. Menjugate and Infanrix-hexa vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left and right anterolateral thigh, respectively.</description>

Vaccines were administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (at study Months 0, 1 and 2 of the primary phase). At 12-18 months of age (at study Month 0 of the booster phase), subjects received a booster dose of the two vaccines administered in the primary vaccination course. Menjugate and Infanrix-hexa vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left and right anterolateral thigh, respectively.</description>

Vaccines were administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (at study Months 0, 1 and 2 of the primary phase). At 12-18 months of age (at study Month 0 of the booster phase), subjects received a booster dose of the two vaccines administered in the primary vaccination course. Menjugate and Infanrix-hexa vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left and right anterolateral thigh, respectively.</description>

Vaccines were administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (at study Months 0, 1 and 2 of the primary phase). At 12-18 months of age (at study Month 0 of the booster phase), subjects received a booster dose of the two vaccines administered in the primary vaccination course. Menjugate and Infanrix-hexa vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left and right anterolateral thigh, respectively.</description>

Vaccines were administered as a 3-dose primary vaccination course at 2, 3 and 4 months of age (at study Months 0, 1 and 2 of the primary phase). At 12-18 months of age (at study Month 0 of the booster phase), subjects received a booster dose of the two vaccines administered in the primary vaccination course. Menjugate and Infanrix-hexa vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the left and right anterolateral thigh, respectively.</description>

        <description>Vaccine response rates are defined as appearance of antibodies in subjects who were initially seronegative (i.e., with concentrations &lt; cut-off value) or at least maintenance of pre-vaccination antibody concentrations in subjects who were initially seropositive (i.e., with concentrations ≥ cut-off value), taking into consideration the decreasing maternal antibodies.</description>
