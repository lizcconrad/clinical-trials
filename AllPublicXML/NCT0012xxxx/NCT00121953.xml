      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of rosiglitazone versus placebo on soluble
      proinflammatory markers in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis.

      The overall goal of this proposal is to assess modulation of immune mechanisms in
      endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common ailment affecting approximately five million
      reproductive-aged American women. We will test the efficacy of a novel immunomodulatory drug
      (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, PPAR-gamma, agonist), rosiglitazone, to
      reduce peritoneal fluid cytokine concentrations in women with endometriosis compared with
      placebo controls (randomized controlled trial). Based on prior studies done by the
      investigator highlighting the major role of cytokines and the immune system in the genesis or
      propagation of endometriosis, these experiments could lead to improved translational
      treatment strategies and a better understanding of endometriosis. Acting through PPAR-gamma,
      TZDs inhibit proinflammatory cytokines as well as NF-kB, an important nuclear transcription
      factor for the production of many cytokines. Accordingly, since human endometrial epithelial
      and stromal cells contain PPAR-gamma, we felt it would be useful to evaluate the influence of
      a PPAR-gamma ligand, rosiglitazone, on the concentration of specific peritoneal fluid
      cytokines.

      Comparison: After the pre-trial screening, eligible subjects with presumed endometriosis and
      age 18-45 will be consented and randomly assigned to receive either placebo (control) or
      rosiglitazone, Avandia®, 4 mg daily for 2 weeks. Peritoneal fluid will be collected at the
      time of surgery and the volume measured. All patients enrolled in the study will have their
      surgery during the follicular phase of the cycle in order to minimize differences in volume
      and cytokine concentration due to the cyclical changes. The primary measure will be the
      peritoneal fluid concentration comparisons of the two groups assessing six different
      cytokines: interleukin-1 beta, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and vascular endothelial
      growth factor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy women ages 18 - 45 years.

          -  Regular menstrual cycles (24-35 days).

          -  Pelvic pain ≥3 months

          -  Negative pregnancy test

          -  Non-lactating

          -  No prior (&lt;3 months) use of hormonal therapy (&lt;6 mos for depoprovera users)

          -  No history of liver disease

          -  Consent to participate in the study

          -  Endometriosis diagnosed from surgical specimen by routine hematoxylin and eosin
             staining and histological evaluation (within the past 4 years)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major psychiatric conditions or the abuse of alcohol or drugs which would make it
             difficult for the subject to complete study procedures.

          -  Active or prior infection with hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection, or history of high-risk activities (e.g., intravenous [IV] drug abuse)
             which would increase risk to laboratory personnel. Of note, no testing for hepatitis
             or HIV will be performed as part of this study and all tissues will be handled and
             discarded as if they were potentially infected.

          -  Patients with liver dysfunction (elevated liver enzymes &gt;2 times upper limit of
             normal).

          -  Presence of pre-existing malignancy, including carcinoma of the breast or uterus.

          -  Women with other causes of chronic pelvic pain including infectious, gastrointestinal,
             musculoskeletal, neurologic or psychiatric.

          -  Elevated white blood cell (WBC) count.

          -  NYHA functional class I-IV heart failure.

          -  Diabetes mellitus.

          -  Known pregnancy or positive pregnancy test.
