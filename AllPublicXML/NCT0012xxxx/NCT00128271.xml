  <brief_title>Study of Bavituximab in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 1 Study of Chimeric Anti-Phosphatidylserine Monoclonal Antibody (Bavituximab) in Patients Chronically Infected With Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Who Are Non-Responders or Relapsers After Treatment With Pegylated Interferon Plus Ribavirin</official_title>

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab when
      administered via a vein as a single infusion and to examine how bavituximab behaves in the
      body and how it affects the amount of hepatitis C virus in individuals with chronic
      infection.

    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a world wide public health concern and is the most
      common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States and the leading indication for liver
      transplantation. Laboratory and animal studies have demonstrated that bavituximab binds
      viruses and virally infected cells and prolongs survival in infected animals. This study will
      examine the safety and tolerability of bavituximab when administered to patients with chronic
      HCV infection who do not respond to or relapse after treatment with pegylated interferon plus
      ribavirin combination therapy. Groups of patients will be treated with escalating doses and
      followed for 12 weeks.
