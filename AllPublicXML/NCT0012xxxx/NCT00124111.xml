      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative dose intensity (RDI) of intravenous (IV)
      CMF on a Day 1 and 8 schedule given every 28 days with pegfilgrastim support in subjects with
      stage I-III breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed breast cancer Stage I, II or III - Candidate
        for IV CMF chemotherapy (every 4 weeks) for a total of 6 cycles - Chemotherapy naïve (prior
        treatment with hormone therapy or with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody therapy is permitted
        as long as treatment has been stopped prior to enrollment into the study) - Absolute
        neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x 10^9/L - Platelet count greater than
        or equal to 100 x 10^9/L - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
        0-2 - Written informed consent before any study specific procedure Exclusion Criteria: -
        AST and/or ALT greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) concomitant with alkaline
        phosphatase greater than 2.5 x ULN according to institutional standard - Bilirubin greater
        than 2 x ULN according to institutional standard - Inadequate renal function (creatinine
        greater than 1.5 x ULN according to institutional standard) - Any premalignant myeloid
        condition or any malignancy with myeloid characteristics (e.g., myelodysplastic syndromes,
        acute or chronic myelogenous leukaemias) - History of prior malignancy other than breast
        cancer with the exception of curatively treated basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of
        the skin, in situ cervical carcinoma, or other surgically cured malignancy - Prior
        radiotherapy - Scheduled concomitant radiotherapy (e.g., radiotherapy administration while
        on study) - Documented active infection at the time of enrolment requiring use of systemic
        anti- infectives - Documented positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
        infection - Known hypersensitivity to E coli derived products [e.g., Filgrastim
        (Neupogen®), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®), HUMULIN® Insulin, L-Asparaginase, HUMATROPE® Growth
        Hormone, INTRON A®] - Subject is currently enrolled in or 30 days have not passed since
        completing other investigational device or drug trial(s) or is receiving other
        investigational agent(s) other than placebo (confirmation of prior treatment must be
        documented) - Pregnant or breast-feeding (for subjects of child bearing potential) - Not
        using adequate contraception (for subjects of child bearing potential) - Previous
        participation in this study - Inability or unwillingness to comply with the protocol
