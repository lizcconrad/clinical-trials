      This study is an open-label trial of trihexyphenidyl in children with upper extremity
      dystonia due to cerebral palsy. It is hypothesized that trihexyphenidyl in doses up to
      0.75mg/kg/day would be well-tolerated and show significant changes on the Melbourne scale of
      upper extremity function.

      BACKGROUND: Although trihexyphenidyl has been used to treat both primary and secondary
      dystonia in children, previous studies have not investigated efficacy in secondary dystonia.
      We describe the results of a prospective, open-label, multi-center trial of high-dose
      trihexyphenidyl in children with secondary dystonia of the arms due to cerebral palsy.

      METHODS: Twenty-six children age 4-15 years with cerebral palsy and dystonia that impairs
      function of the dominant upper extremity were enrolled. All children were given
      trihexyphenidyl at increasing doses over 9 weeks up to 0.75mg/kg/day. Trihexyphenidyl was
      subsequently tapered over 5 weeks. Visits occurred at baseline, 9 weeks, and 15 weeks. The
      primary outcome measure was the Melbourne assessment of upper extremity function, tested in
      the dominant arm.

      RESULTS: Three children withdrew due to non-serious adverse events (chorea, drug rash,
      hyperactivity). 3 children reduced dosage due to non-serious adverse events. The 23 children
      who completed the study showed a significant improvement in arm function at 15 weeks
      (p=0.045) but not at 9 weeks. Post-hoc analysis showed that a subgroup (N=10) with
      hyperkinetic dystonia worsened at 9 weeks (p=0.04) but subsequently returned to baseline
      following taper of the medicine.

      CONCLUSIONS: Trihexyphenidyl appears to be safe and effective for treatment of arm dystonia
      in children with cerebral palsy. Children with hyperkinetic dystonia may worsen. A larger
      randomized prospective trial is needed to confirm these results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Dystonia in the dominant upper extremity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete absence of voluntary movement in the affected hands, wrists, and elbows

          -  Severe weakness in the dominant upper extremity (MRC grade &lt; 4)

          -  Passive range of motion at the hand, wrist or elbow less than 80% of normal

          -  Current use of medications for dystonia (anticholinergics, L-dopa, baclofen, diazepam,
             tizanidine, tetrabenazine, reserpine, and others)

          -  Changes in the subject's physical therapy regimen for the duration of the 15-week
             study

          -  Prior use of trihexyphenidyl or other anticholinergic therapy for dystonia.

          -  History of surgery on the dominant upper extremity or cervical spine

          -  Botulinum toxin injection in the dominant upper extremity within the previous 6 months

          -  Current or prior implantation of an intrathecal baclofen pump, deep brain stimulator,
             or other device to treat dystonia or spasticity

          -  Concurrent acute or chronic medical condition (such as frequent seizures, heart
             disease, or asthma) that could adversely affect motor performance or the safety of
             testing

          -  Presence of diurnal fluctuations or other clinical signs and symptoms suggesting an
             inborn error of metabolism, a family history of dystonia suggesting a genetic
             dystonia, or dystonia due to injury after the neonatal period (including toxin
             exposure, trauma, or medication-induced)

          -  History of allergic or adverse reaction to trihexyphenidyl or other anticholinergic
             medications

          -  Current complaint of urinary retention requiring treatment.

          -  History of glaucoma, or family history of glaucoma with onset before age 40
