  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are in the intensive care unit after surgery and require mechanical breathing
      support (intubation and ventilation) usually require sedation to avoid agitation and
      excessive stress responses. Short-acting sedatives such as midazolam and propofol are the
      drugs typically used for this. Propofol provides for fast sedation and fast recovery from
      sedation. Midazolam is slower to sedation and slower for recovery, but may provide some
      advantages over propofol, such as a lower incidence of hypotension (low blood pressure). This
      study will look at propofol compared to a product with fast sedation and recovery like that
      of propofol but with less of a chance for hypotension like with midazolam. Patients will be
      treated with the product for up to 8 hours and then will be monitored for 8 hours following
      treatment.

      Patients who are intubated and ventilated and will require up to 8 hours of sedation in the
      ICU are eligible for participation in this study. Patients will be randomized to receive 1 of
      3 treatments. One treatment is standard of care, a propofol infusion. The other two treatment
      arms are infusions of GPI 15715 (AQUAVAN), one with a bolus and one without.

      Patients will be treated for up to 8 hours and monitored for eight hours post treatment. If
      there are signs of agitation during the up to 8 hour treatment period, the infusion of the
      sedative medicine will be increased according to protocol.

      Blood samples will be obtained periodically during the course of the study for safety
      evaluation and pharmacokinetic assessments. When the patient is ready for extubation or the
      end of the 8 hour study period has been reached, the infusion of the sedative agent will be
      discontinued and the patient will be monitored for 8 hours post treatment.
