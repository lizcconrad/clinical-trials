  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare labor outcomes in women accompanied by an additional
      support person (doula group) with outcomes in women who did not have this additional support
      person (control group).

      The current study was designed with the benefits of continuous labor support in mind as well
      as the need for a cost-effective, affordable program to provide those services for low-income
      women. Its purpose was to evaluate the effects of continuous labor support provided by a
      female companion of the pregnant person's choosing who, with the mother, had participated in
      an educational program to teach her how to provide continuous labor support.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of a female companion in labor who
      had been chosen by a nulliparous, underinsured, low-income woman and who had received brief
      training in supportive labor techniques. The objective was to compare labor outcomes,
      specifically cesarean section rates, in women accompanied by this additional support person
      (doula group) with outcomes in women who did not have this additional support person (control
      group).
