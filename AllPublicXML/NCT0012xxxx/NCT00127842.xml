    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Improvement of ≥ 0.50 Units From Baseline to Month 24 in the HAQ DI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ DI is a questionnaire which measures functional status in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The questionnaire addresses health-related quality of life issues related to psoriatic arthritis such as dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 24 in the Health and Labour Questionnaire (HLQ) Absence From Work Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HLQ collects quantitative data on the relation between illness and treatment and work performance. The instrument is divided into 4 modules to collect data about absence from work, reduced productivity at paid work, unpaid labor production and impediments to paid and unpaid labor. The absence from work module asks participants to indicate how many days in the past 2 weeks they missed work due to health problems. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline value indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 24 in the HLQ Reduced Productivity at Paid Work Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HLQ collects quantitative data on the relation between illness and treatment and work performance. The instrument is divided into 4 modules to collect data about absence from work, reduced productivity at paid work, unpaid labor production and impediments to paid and unpaid labor. In the reduced productivity at work module participants were asked to estimate the number of additional hours required to compensate for production losses due to illness on working days over the past 2 weeks.
Change from Baseline was calculated as the Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline value indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 24 in the HLQ Unpaid Labour Production Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HLQ collects quantitative data on the relation between illness and treatment and work performance. The instrument is divided into 4 modules to collect data about absence from work, reduced productivity at paid work, unpaid labor production and impediments to paid and unpaid labor. The Unpaid Labour Production Module assesses the amount of hours of unpaid work (including household work, shopping, caring for children and odd jobs around the house), normally performed by the participant, that were taken over by other members of the household, family or friends (unpaid help), and/or by paid workers due to health problems of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline value indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 24 in the HLQ Impediments to Paid and Unpaid Labour Module</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 24</time_frame>
    <description>In the HLQ impediments to paid and unpaid labor module participants were asked &quot;Were you hindered by health problems at your paid work over the past two weeks?&quot; and answered according to the following: 'no not at all = 0', 'yes, a little = 1', 'yes, very = 2'. Participants were also asked whether they had performed 4 unpaid activities (household work, shopping, odd jobs / chores, and childcare), and answered according to the following: Did do, hindered = 1; Did do, not hindered = 0; Did not do, due to health problems = 2; Did not do, due to other reasons = 0. The aggregated score ranges from 0 (no impediments) to 8 (unable to do any of the surveyed activities). Change from Baseline was calculated as the Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline value indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 24 in the Physician Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The physician global assessment of disease activity asks the physician to assess how the participant is doing since their last visit on a scale from 1 (very good, asymptomatic, no limitations in normal activities) to 5 (very poor, severe symptoms that are intolerable, inability to carry out all normal activites). Change from Baseline was calculated as Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to Month 24 in Physician Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The physician global assessment of disease activity asks the physician to assess how the participant is doing since their last visit on a scale from 1 (very good, asymptomatic, no limitations in normal activities) to 5 (very poor, severe symptoms that are intolerable, inability to carry out all normal activites).
Percent change from Baseline was calculated as (Baseline value - Month 24 value) / Baseline value * 100. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 24 in Patient Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The patient global assessment of disease activity is a 5-point scale that asks how the participant is doing since their last visit with regard to their rheumatoid arthritis. Participants answer on a scale from 1 (very good, asymptomatic, no limitation in normal activites) to 5 (very poor, very severe symptoms that are intolerable, inability to perform all normal activites). Change from Baseline was calculated as Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Improvement of ≥ 75 Percent From Baseline to Month 24 in the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI was is a method for quantifying the intensity of psoriasis, and for evaluating its improvement with treatment. This index is based on the quantitative assessment of three typical signs of psoriatic lesions: erythema, infiltration, and desquamation, combined with the skin surface area involvement. The index has a range from 0.0 to 72.0, with higher scores indicating worse psoriasis.</description>

        <description>The HAQ DI is a questionnaire which measures functional status in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The questionnaire addresses health-related quality of life issues related to psoriatic arthritis such as dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task were summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability.</description>

The Unpaid Labour Production Module assesses the amount of hours of unpaid work (including household work, shopping, caring for children and odd jobs around the house), normally performed by the participant, that were taken over by other members of the household, family or friends (unpaid help), and/or by paid workers due to health problems of the participant. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Baseline value - Month 24 value. A positive change from Baseline value indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>In the HLQ impediments to paid and unpaid labor module participants were asked &quot;Were you hindered by health problems at your paid work over the past two weeks?&quot; and answered according to the following: 'no not at all = 0', ‘yes, a little = 1’, ‘yes, very = 2’. Participants were also asked whether they had performed 4 unpaid activities (household work, shopping, odd jobs / chores, and childcare), and answered according to the following: Did do, hindered = 1; Did do, not hindered = 0; Did not do, due to health problems = 2; Did not do, due to other reasons = 0. The aggregated score ranges from 0 (no impediments) to 8 (unable to do any of the surveyed activities). Change from Baseline was calculated as the Baseline value - Month 24 value.

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results aftercompletion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
