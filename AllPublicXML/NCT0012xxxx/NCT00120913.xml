  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While there may be a decrease in the total number of bleeding days women experience with
      continuous-dosed COCs (no menstrual withdrawal week), these regimens frequently result in an
      increased number of “breakthrough” or non-scheduled bleeding days. Breakthrough bleeding is
      among the main reasons cited for discontinuation of combined COCs dosed traditionally (3
      weeks of active pill, 1 week of placebo) or continuously, and may offset the perceived
      benefit of fewer withdrawal bleeding events for many women taking continuous-dosed COCs. The
      exact mechanisms responsible for breakthrough bleeding patterns during hormonal contraception
      are unknown and may be related to the pill formulation. This study is to determine whether
      progestin type or estrogen dose influences bleeding patterns, side effects, or satisfaction
      with combined oral contraceptives (COC) dosed continuously.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 to 49 years old

          -  Good general health

          -  No medical contraindications to combined COC therapy.

          -  In addition, all participants were required to have taken cyclic COCs for at least
             three months at the time of enrollment, in order to avoid common transition bleeding
             with the initiation of COCs.
