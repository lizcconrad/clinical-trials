  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether using the diaphragm and a lubricant get can
      reduce women's risk of acquiring an HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site randomized, controlled trial will measure the effectiveness of the diaphragm
      in preventing heterosexual acquisition of HIV infection among women. This Phase III study is
      powered to detect effectiveness (biological efficacy combined with adherence) of 33 percent.
      Women in South Africa and Zimbabwe (N=4,500) at risk of contracting HIV will be invited to
      participate and will be followed for up to 24 months, with a total study duration of 4 years.
      All women will receive safer-sex counseling, free male condoms and diagnosis and treatment of
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Half of the participants will be randomly selected to
      receive an Ortho All-Flex latex diaphragm and Replens lubricant gel. We will assess whether
      women using diaphragms and lubricant gel have lower rates of HIV or STI infection than do
      their non-diaphragm and gel counterparts. Additionally, we will investigate the long-term
      acceptability of the diaphragm in this study population.

          -  HIV negative based on testing within two weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae negative based on testing within 30
             days prior to enrollment or if positive, completes treatment before enrollment

          -  Planning to live in the study area for the next 24 months

          -  Willing to be randomly assigned either to use or not use a latex diaphragm with
             lubricant gel during participation in the study, and to follow the protocol, including
             being tested for HIV and STIs

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known sensitivity or allergy to latex

             infection requiring treatment at enrollment

          -  Within six weeks of any pelvic surgery or last pregnancy outcome at the time of
             screening and enrollment

          -  Presence of clinically apparent lesion(s) with epithelial disruption at enrollment
             (may enroll after lesion(s) has healed, if otherwise eligible)

          -  Injected illicit drugs in the 12 months prior to screening and enrollment

             concurrently running research studies may be conducted if necessary.

          -  Unable to speak English, Zulu, Shona, or Sotho

          -  Other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would constitute
