      The purpose of this study is to determine whether chromium supplements can reduce symptoms of
      metabolic syndrome, a collection of symptoms that increase one's risk for developing heart
      disease, stroke, and diabetes.

      Metabolic syndrome is a serious condition that may lead to a number of life-threatening
      diseases. A reduction in the symptoms of metabolic syndrome could result in decreased
      morbidity and health care costs and increased quality of life.

      Chromium is an essential mineral that is used in the breakdown of fats, protein, and
      carbohydrates. The cholesterol-lowering and blood sugar-stabilizing properties of chromium
      make the supplement a strong candidate for reducing the symptoms of metabolic syndrome. This
      study will determine whether chromium supplements can reduce symptoms of metabolic syndrome
      in abdominally obese individuals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either chromium supplements or placebo
      daily for 16 weeks. Participants will have study visits at study start and at Months 2 and 4.
      A follow-up visit will occur 5 months after the end of the intervention period. Blood tests,
      urine tests, and nail clippings will be used to assess lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin
      response to glucose, lean body mass, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and chromium levels in
      participants.
