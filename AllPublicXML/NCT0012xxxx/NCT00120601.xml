  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two anti-craving medications,
      naltrexone versus acamprosate, in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physical, psychological and social consequences of alcohol abuse remain a critical health
      problem. Every year in Australia, excessive consumption is responsible for 3,000 - 6,000
      deaths and costs the community $6 billion. Approximately 15% of Australians abuse alcohol and
      5% of men and 3% of women are alcohol dependent (addicted to alcohol). Better treatment for
      alcohol dependence is urgently needed. Treatment for alcohol dependence remains
      unsatisfactory. Most treatments lead to abstinence in only 1 out of 3 cases, and
      approximately 50% of these will relapse within 3 months of completing treatment. Two drugs
      (naltrexone and acamprosate) appear to interfere with the effects of alcohol on the brain
      that promote addiction. There is evidence that both drugs are beneficial in the treatment of
      alcohol dependence and both are now available in Australia. At present, no data have been
      reported comparing the effectiveness of these two drugs. The proposed project will compare
      naltrexone and acamprosate in a large, carefully performed, study. The study will help
      determine which subjects are likely to benefit from one or the other of these agents.
