      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the matrix fentanyl patch ZR-02-01 in
      providing relief of cancer pain.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of the matrix fentanyl patch. The study will be conducted
      in opioid-tolerant patients with moderate to severe cancer pain currently taking an
      around-the-clock opioid. Patients will discontinue their current opioid regimen and begin
      using ZR-02-01 as soon as possible under the direction of the physician investigator upon
      entry into the study. Patient's dose of ZR-02-01 will be determined by the investigator using
      sponsor-provided conversion. Pain therapy will be under the supervision of the physician
      investigator.

    <description>ZR-02-01 patch contains fentanyl dispersed in a solid matrix, and will be available in 25, 50, 75 and 100 mcg/hr patches. The patches will be worn on the chest or upper arm and an overlay will be placed over the patch. Patches (and overlays) will be replaced every 3 days by the patient and/or responsible caregiver. If a patient experiences end-of-dose-failure, the dosing interval may be changed by the physician investigator to every 2 days. The maximum dose allowed in this study is 300 mcg/hr.</description>
