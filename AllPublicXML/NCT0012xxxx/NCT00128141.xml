  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two groups of preterm infants with birth weight equal to or less than 1500 grams will be
      studied. One group will receive the standard care and the other will receive standard care
      plus maternal special tactile stimulation. Gain of weight, length and head circumference,
      date of the beginning of enteral feedings, length of time to recover birth weight and age of
      hospital discharge will be recorded and compared between both groups.

    <textblock>
      Preterm infants birth weight equal or less than 1500 grams and gestational age equal or less
      than 32 weeks will be randomized in two groups: standard care that will receive the usual
      treatment applied to all infants admitted to our unit and a second groups that will receive
      standard care plus maternal tactile and kinesthetic stimuli that will be taught to the
      mothers. Randomization will be performed among those that accept to participate in the study.
      Growth (birth, length and head circumference), age of life to start receiving enteral
      feedings, length of hospital stay, time to recover birth weight will be recorded and compared
      between both groups.
