  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of the intrauterine device
      (IUD) called Mirena when compared to the Provera tablets used in treating this condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial hyperplasia without atypia is a condition usually caused by excessive stimulation
      of the uterine lining (endometrium) by estrogens, and may cause irregular bleeding as a
      presenting symptom, but rarely may progress to endometrial cancer, which makes treatment
      important. The only treatment approved so far is medroxyprogesterone acetate tablets
      (progesterone), also known as Provera.
