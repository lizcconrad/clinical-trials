    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if AMG 706 will have clinically meaningful
      anti-tumor activity in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer who are
      not candidates for radioactive iodine therapy or local therapies.

        Inclusion Criteria: - Histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic thyroid
        cancer - Measurable disease - Normal blood pressure (if history of hypertension, blood
        pressure must be controlled with medication) - Evidence of disease progression within 6
        months before starting study (for differentiated thyroid cancer subjects) - Evidence of
        disease progression within 6 months before starting study OR symptomatic disease (for
        medullary thyroid cancer subjects) - Not a candidate for surgical resection, external beam
        radiotherapy, radioiodine therapy, or other local therapy - At least 18 years of age
        Exclusion Criteria: - Undifferentiated/anaplastic thyroid cancer - Untreated or symptomatic
        brain metastases - Prior malignancy, unless cured with treatment and no evidence of disease
        for greater than or equal to 3 years before starting study (history of thyroid cancer, in
        situ cervical cancer, or basal cell cancer of skin are exceptions) - Myocardial infarction
        or any unstable cardiac condition (e.g., congestive heart failure, unstable angina) within
        1 year before starting study - Arterial thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis within 1 year
        before starting study
