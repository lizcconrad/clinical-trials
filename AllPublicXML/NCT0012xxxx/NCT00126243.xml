  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most treatment procedures in AIDS-related lymphomas disclose a relatively poor outcome for
      patients with low response rates, high number of relapses and AIDS events. The addition of
      rituximab to the standard regimen - CHOP could improve the outcome of these patients. The aim
      of the trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab when added to the CHOP
      regimen in patients with newly diagnosed AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      HIV infection is associated with a high incidence of AIDS-related lymphomas (ARL). Since the
      use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of AIDS-defining illnesses
      has decreased, leading to a significant improvement in survival of HIV-infected patients. The
      incidence of ARL has decreased in a lower degree and lymphoma remains the major cause of
      death of HIV patients. Most treatment procedures disclose a relatively poor outcome of
      patients with low response rates, high number of relapses and AIDS events. Since the majority
      of HIV-associated NHL are CD20-positive the addition of rituximab to the standard regimen -
      CHOP could improve the outcome of these patients
