  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that arginine-vasopressin could be more effective in the
      treatment of cardiac arrests. The last published study did not outline obvious improvements
      in the prognosis of all cardiac arrests but pointed out a possible increased survival rate
      when arginine-vasopressin is associated with epinephrine. The aim of this study is to compare
      the efficacy of two successive injections of epinephrine (1 mg) with two successive
      injections of epinephrine associated with arginine-vasopressin (40 UI) in out-of-hospital
      cardiac arrests occurring in adult patients. The primary endpoint is the survival rate at
      hospital admission. The inclusion period lasts 18 months and 2416 patients are planned to be
      enrolled.
