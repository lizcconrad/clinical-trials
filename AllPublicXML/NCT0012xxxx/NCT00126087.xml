  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to improve the learning of motor skills by pharmacological means
      (dopamine), and by noninvasive brain stimulation. They will study both healthy subjects and
      chronic stroke patients. In addition, they want to study the mechanisms of enhanced learning,
      on the molecular and the systems level.

    <textblock>
      Adaptive behavior requires procedural motor learning, i.e. the acquisition of motor skills.
      Procedural learning is particularly critical in the rehabilitation of chronic motor deficits
      after stroke. A potent modulator of motor function and learning is found in the endogenous
      dopaminergic system. The investigator's own work could demonstrate that formation of an
      elementary motor memory, which constitutes the first step in acquiring more complex motor
      skills, can be enhanced in both healthy subjects and chronic stroke patients by
      pre-medication with levodopa. The aim of the present proposal is to:

        -  expand these exciting findings to procedural motor learning;

        -  explore the interaction with age, brain lesions, add-on interventions such as
           transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); and

        -  illuminate the underlying mechanisms.

      The effect of levodopa +/- tDCS on procedural motor learning and cortical excitability will
      be studied in healthy volunteers and stroke patients. Then the investigator plans to
      delineate the underlying mechanisms of this effect by exploring N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA)
      receptor-dependency of levodopa-enhanced learning and changes in activation and connectivity
      (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) in the respective neural networks resulting
      from the interaction of learning and dopaminergic neuromodulation.
