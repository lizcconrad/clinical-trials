      The purpose of this study is to study the safety of E7080 administered to patients with solid
      tumors or lymphomas.

      Please note: this study is now recruiting patients with advanced and/or metastatic melanoma
      only.

      In the current phase of this study, To determine the MTD and the pharmacokinetic profile of
      E7080 when given as continuous daily (qd) dosing in combination with temozolomide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with a histologically and/or cytologically confirmed solid tumor or lymphoma who
        are resistant/refractory to approved therapies or for whom no curative therapies are
        available All previous treatment (including surgery and radiotherapy) must have been
        completed at least four weeks prior to study entry and any acute toxicities must have
        resolved Aged 18 years. Because of the potential additional risk to children suggested by
        preclinical models of dysplasia in growing epiphyseal growth plates, enrollment will be
        limited to adult patients ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1 Written informed consent
        prior to any study specific screening procedures with the understanding that the patient
        may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice Willing and able to comply with the
        protocol guidelines for the duration of the study For patients in the Schedule 2 Expanded
        Melanoma Cohort only: histologically and/or cytologically confirmed advanced and/or
        metastatic melanoma who are resistant/refractory to approved therapies or for whom no
        curative therapies are available. In addition, patients must have melanoma lesions amenable
        to tissue biopsy and must agree to undergo biopsies of malignant and adjacent non-malignant
        tissue pretreatment and at the end of Cycle 1 of treatment For patients in the Melanoma
        Combination Cohort only: histologically and/or cytologically confirmed melanoma that is
        advanced and/or metastatic

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Untreated or unstable metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Patients who
        have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of steroids for this indication
        at least 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment and in whom stability has been proven by at
        least 2 CT or MRI scans obtained at least 4 weeks apart are permitted Any of the following
        laboratory parameters: hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL (5.6 mmol/L); neutrophils &lt;1.5 x 109/L;
        platelets &lt;100 x 109/L; serum bilirubin &gt;25 mol/L (1.5 mg/dL); liver function tests with
        values &gt;3 x upper limit of normal (ULN); renal function with serum creatinine &gt;1.5 ULN or
        creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min Positive history of HIV, active hepatitis B or active
        hepatitis C or severe/uncontrolled intercurrent illness or infection Patients with
        centrally located non-small cell lung cancers and squamous cell lung cancers Clinically
        significant cardiac impairment or unstable ischemic heart disease including a myocardial
        infarction within six months of study start Patients with marked Baseline prolongation of
        QT/QTc interval (QTc interval &gt; 450 msec for males or &gt; 470 msec for females) using the
        Fridericia method for QTc analysis Bleeding or thrombotic disorders, or using therapeutic
        dosages of anticoagulants, such as warfarin. Occasional use of NSAIDs and antiplatelet
        agents such as aspirin, clopidogrel, aggrenox and dipyridamole are not considered
        exclusionary if taken &lt;7 days per 28 days. However, if the patient requires chronic use
        (&gt;/=7 days out of 28 days) of full doses of aspirin or NSAIDs then the patient is excluded.
        Concomitant antiplatelet agents and NSAIDs should be used with caution Requirement for
        chronic use of full dose aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Poorly
        controlled hypertension (defined as requiring changes in any hypertensive regimen within 1
        week three months of study entry) or patients diagnosed with hypertension based on repeat
        blood pressure measurements of &gt;160/90 mmHg at Screening &gt;1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick
        testing or 30 mg/dL A history of gastrointestinal malabsorption or having undergone surgery
        requiring gastrointestinal anastomoses within four weeks of starting therapy or who have
        not recovered from major surgery within three weeks of starting therapy History of
        alcoholism, drug addiction, or any psychiatric or psychological condition which, in the
        opinion of the Investigator, would impair study compliance Any treatment with
        investigational drugs within 30 days before the start of the study Previous treatment with
        E7080 Known intolerance to temozolomide (or any of the excipients) Women who are pregnant
        or breast-feeding; women of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test at
        Screening or no pregnancy test. Women of childbearing potential unless (1) surgically
        sterile or (2) using adequate measures of contraception (including two forms of
        contraception, one of which must be a barrier method) in the opinion of the Investigator
        (revised per Amendment 04). Perimenopausal women must be amenorrheic for at least 12 months
        to be considered of non-childbearing potential Fertile males with female partners who are
        not willing to use contraception or whose female partners are not using adequate
        contraceptive protection Legal incapacity
