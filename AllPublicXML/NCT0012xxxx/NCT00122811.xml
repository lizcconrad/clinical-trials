      The purpose of this study is to assess the benefits and risks of treating very elderly (those
      aged 80 or older) individuals with hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefit to risk ratio of treating hypertensives aged 80 or older has not been
      established. It has been suggested that at this age for each stroke prevented there is one
      non-stroke death. HYVET is designed to help clarify this.

      HYVET is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hypertensive subjects aged
      80 or older. Active treatment consists of indapamide 1.5mg SR with the addition of
      perindopril 2mg - 4mg to reach a target blood pressure (BP) of &lt;150/80 mmHg. Entry criteria
      include a systolic blood pressure of 160-199 mmHg. Patients with isolated systolic
      hypertension (ISH) have been recruited since August 2003.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 80 or older

          -  Sitting systolic BP 160-199 mmHg AND sitting diastolic BP &lt; 110 mmHg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known accelerated hypertension (retinal haemorrhages or exudates or papilloedema).

          -  Overt clinical congestive heart failure requiring treatment with a diuretic or
             angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Subjects allowed if treated with digoxin
             only.

          -  Renal failure (serum creatinine of more than 150 Âµmol/l).

          -  Previous documented cerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage in the last 6 months.
             (Ischaemic cerebral and cardiac events do not exclude, although the patient must be
             neurologically and cardiologically stable.)

          -  Condition expected to severely limit survival, e.g. terminal illness.

          -  Known secondary hypertension (e.g. renal artery stenosis, chronic renal insufficiency,
             and endocrine cause).

          -  Gout.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of dementia.

          -  Resident in a nursing home, i.e. where the dependency and care requirements of the
             patients are such that they require the regular input of qualified nurses and
             therefore the majority of staff in the home are nurses (other forms of residential
             care are acceptable).

          -  Unable to stand up or walk

          -  Participation in a drug trial within the past month preceding selection.

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Less than 2 months placebo run-in.

          -  Contraindications to use of trial drugs
