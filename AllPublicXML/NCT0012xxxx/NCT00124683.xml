  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenic individuals are typically nicotine dependent smokers who find it difficult to
      quit smoking. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of bupropion SR
      (commonly known as Zyban) in combination with a nicotine transdermal patch (NTP), in helping
      schizophrenic individuals quit smoking. In addition, this study will evaluate how the
      combination of bupropion SR and NTP affects psychiatric symptoms and medication side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past research on the use of the NTP, atypical antipsychotics, and bupropion in schizophrenic
      individuals to aid in smoking cessation has been encouraging. The purpose of this study is to
      compare bupropion SR to a placebo to determine its effectiveness when used in combination
      with an NTP to help schizophrenic individuals quit smoking.

      Participants in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study will be randomly assigned to
      receive either the NTP (21 mg/day) and placebo or the NTP and bupropion SR (300 mg/day).
      Participants will begin taking one pill each day of bupropion SR (150 mg/day) or placebo at
      the start of the second week of the study. After three days, the dose of bupropion SR or
      placebo will increase to 2 pills each day. Participants will continue this dosing regimen
      until the end of Week 10. Throughout the 10-week study, participants will receive weekly
      group therapy.
