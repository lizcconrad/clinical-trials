  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, non-randomized, Phase I dose finding study of the
      investigational, oral cytotoxic drug, satraplatin (JM-216), in combination with docetaxel in
      patients with advanced solid tumors for whom curative therapy is not available. Please refer
      to the Eligibility Criteria below for key inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of this trial is to determine a tolerable dose and schedule for the
      combination of satraplatin and docetaxel when given to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN: Satraplatin is an oral, investigational anticancer drug that is a member
      of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based drugs have been clinically
      proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer therapies. Unlike the currently
      marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given orally.
