  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advancing age in itself is associated with changes in body composition. However, during
      transitional life stages, such as retirement, detrimental changes on diet and physical
      activity may occur. This might lead to weight gain and accumulation of abdominal fat.

      To prevent these changes, participants receive a low-intensity intervention on energy balance
      and related behaviours.

      After six months, one and two years, the effects will be studied by comparing the
      intervention group with the control group.
