    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal phase II, multicenter, open-label trial, designed to compare the efficacy
      of exemestane versus anastrozole as a first line treatment for advanced breast cancer. One
      hundred postmenopausal patients, with metastatic, positive hormone receptor breast cancer
      will be enrolled in this trial.

      The primary study endpoint is objective response rate. The study has been designed following
      Simon's test, with a p1-p0=0.15. p1 is the optimum level of activity of the experimental
      treatment (exemestane), and p0 is the minimum expected activity. In this study, p1 is 25%
      (25% of RR) and p0 is 10% (10% of RR). With an alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.1,
      Simon test establishes a first step of 21 patients per treatment arm. If at least 2 objective
      responses are observed in exemestane arm, recruitment will continue until 100 patients have
      been recruited. After this second recruitment phase, at least 7 objective responses must be
      observed to confirm the expected exemestane level of activity.
