    <textblock>
      This research study is being performed to find out more information about the safety and
      effectiveness of injecting bone marrow progenitor cells (BMPCs) from one's own hip bone into
      one's heart muscle. The BMPCs are the cells from which the different types of blood and other
      cells grow.

      In patients with heart failure, the heart muscle does not pump well. Over a period of years,
      this continues to get worse until the patient dies of heart failure. The investigators are
      trying to find out if the injection of these BMPCs can make a change in the functioning of
      these areas of the heart muscle. Data from studies around the world have suggested that when
      patients with heart failure receive these cells by direct injection into their hearts they
      show signs of recovered heart function, however, there has been no evidence from actual
      studies of the cells of the patient's hearts to show how this process works. It is the
      investigator's plan to inject an eligible participant's heart with cells that are from one's
      own bone marrow during an operation to receive a ventricular assist device (VAD) or partial
      artificial heart and then to study the function of the heart while awaiting a heart
      transplant. The investigators will then examine the heart after it has been removed as part
      of the regular heart transplant operation for any microscopic changes (changes too small to
      be seen by the unaided eye but large enough to be studied under a microscope) at the site
      where the cells are injected. Participants will have no change in the chances of receiving a
      heart transplant by agreeing to participate in this study. There will also be no delay in
      receiving a VAD operation while waiting to participate in this study. This Phase I study has
      been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enroll and treat patients. The
      Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Investigational New Drug number (IND BB #) is
      12304. (A Phase I trial is a research study using techniques or products in the first-stage
      or for the first time in human subjects).
