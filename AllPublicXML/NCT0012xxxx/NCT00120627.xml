  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With ongoing war in Iraq, the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat
      veterans is increasing. Creation, implementation, and testing of new and innovative
      interventions are needed to provide additional options for enhancing the mental health of
      those with PTSD. Surveys indicate that veterans are interested in complementary approaches to
      health care. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of the Mantram Repetition
      Program (MRP) delivered as a brief, 6-week, complementary and portable intervention. It
      includes frequent, silent repetitions of a mantram (mantra), a word or phrase with spiritual
      associations, to manage PTSD symptoms and improve quality of life military veterans with
      trauma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Mantram Repetition Program (MRP) is an innovative, portable meditation-based group
      intervention. In this study, the MRP was delivered in addition to usual care (defined as case
      management and medication) in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting. The MRP was compared
      to usual care only.

      This 4-year study employed a mixed-methods, prospective, randomized controlled trial with
      qualitative phone interviews at 3 months post-intervention to explore ways that the
      intervention was used. Outpatient Veterans (N=146) with military-related PTSD were recruited
      from a single VA site and randomly assigned to the experimental arm (n=71) which consisted of
      usual care and the mantram program versus usual care only control group (n=76).

    <measure>Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS) From DSM-IVTR</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is used to determine PTSD symptom severity and the presence or absence of a PTSD diagnosis. The total score is obtained by summing the frequency and intensity ratings for 17 items using a 5-point scale. Scores are summed and range from 0-136. The items for frequency are rated from 0=&quot;never&quot; to 4=&quot;daily or almost everyday.&quot; The items for intensity are rated from 0=&quot;none&quot; to 4=&quot;extreme.&quot; Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. Total scores greater than 45 indicate the presence of a PTSD diagnosis.
The CAPS also has 3 subscales: 1) Criterion B (re-experiencing) has 5 items that are summed and scores range from 0 to 40; 2) Criterion C (avoidance) has 7 items that are summed and scores range from 0 to 56; and 3) Criterion D (hyper-arousal) has 5 items that are summed and scores range from 0 - 40. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>The MRP teaches 3 strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: Mantram Repetition, Slowing Down and One-Pointed Attention. A &quot;mantram&quot; is a self-selected, sacred word or phrase that is meaningful to the participant. Slowing down refers to setting priorities and doing things carefully so one is not rushed or does not make mistakes. One-pointed attention refers to concentrating on one thing at a time (similar to mindfulness). These three tools are presented to work together synergistically and cumulatively to interrupt negative thoughts and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and hyper-arousal. The unique focus on spiritual words is linked to what one might call inner spiritual resources. MRP was delivered in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting.</description>

        <title>Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Scale (CAPS) From DSM-IVTR</title>
        <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is used to determine PTSD symptom severity and the presence or absence of a PTSD diagnosis. The total score is obtained by summing the frequency and intensity ratings for 17 items using a 5-point scale. Scores are summed and range from 0-136. The items for frequency are rated from 0=&quot;never&quot; to 4=&quot;daily or almost everyday.&quot; The items for intensity are rated from 0=&quot;none&quot; to 4=&quot;extreme.&quot; Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. Total scores greater than 45 indicate the presence of a PTSD diagnosis.
The CAPS also has 3 subscales: 1) Criterion B (re-experiencing) has 5 items that are summed and scores range from 0 to 40; 2) Criterion C (avoidance) has 7 items that are summed and scores range from 0 to 56; and 3) Criterion D (hyper-arousal) has 5 items that are summed and scores range from 0 - 40. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>

            <description>The Mantram Repetition Program teaches 3 strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: Mantram Repetition, Slowing Down and One-Pointed Attention. A &quot;mantram&quot; is a self-selected, sacred word or phrase that is meaningful to the participant. Slowing down refers to setting priorities and doing things carefully so one is not rushed or does not make mistakes. One-pointed attention refers to concentrating on one thing at a time (similar to mindfulness). These three tools are presented to work together synergistically and cumulatively to interrupt negative thoughts and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and hyper-arousal. The unique focus on spiritual words is linked to what one might call inner spiritual resources. MRP was delivered in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting.</description>

The subscale SF12 Norm-Based Mental Component Summary Score rates mental health functioning. Items include &quot;feeling calm and peaceful, having alot of energy, feeling downhearted and blue&quot; -- all rated on a frequency scale from 1= &quot;all of the time&quot; to 6=&quot;none of the time.&quot; Other items ask if emotional problems such as feeling anxious or depressed interfere with (1) &quot;accomplishing less than you like&quot; and (2) &quot;not doing work or activies as carefully as usual&quot; (yes or no). Items are weighted and summed, and then converted to a 0 to 100 scale with higher scores indicating greater improvements.</description>

            <description>The Mantram Repetition Program teaches 3 strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: Mantram Repetition, Slowing Down and One-Pointed Attention. A &quot;mantram&quot; is a self-selected, sacred word or phrase that is meaningful to the participant. Slowing down refers to setting priorities and doing things carefully so one is not rushed or does not make mistakes. One-pointed attention refers to concentrating on one thing at a time (similar to mindfulness). These three tools are presented to work together synergistically and cumulatively to interrupt negative thoughts and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and hyper-arousal. The unique focus on spiritual words is linked to what one might call inner spiritual resources. MRP was delivered in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting.</description>

Score are summed for a total subscale score ranging from 0 to 56, higher scores indicating greater levels of symptoms.</description>

        <description>Hyper-arousal Subscale (Criterion D) assesses symptoms of difficulty falling or staying asleep, irritability or outbursts of anger, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. Items are rated by frequency on a scale of 0 (never) to 4 (daily or almost every day) and on intensity on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (extreme, incapacitating distress). Scores are summed for a total subscale score ranging from 0 to 40, higher scores indicating greater levels of symptoms.</description>

            <title>Arm 1: Mantram + Usual Care</title>
            <description>Mantram Repetition Program for PTSD was delivered in this study as 6-week, 90-minute per week group that targeted PTSD symptoms. It was offered as an adjunct to usual care consisting of medication and case-management.
The MRP teaches 3 strategies to train attention and manage symptoms: Mantram Repetition, Slowing Down and One-Pointed Attention. A &quot;mantram&quot; is a self-selected, sacred word or phrase that is meaningful to the participant. Slowing down refers to setting priorities and doing things carefully so one is not rushed or does not make mistakes. One-pointed attention refers to concentrating on one thing at a time (similar to mindfulness). These three tools are presented to work together synergistically and cumulatively to interrupt negative thoughts and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and hyper-arousal.</description>

These three tools are presented to work together synergistically and cumulatively to interrupt negative thoughts and emotional states such as anger, rage, irritability and hyper-arousal. The unique focus on spiritual words is linked to what one might call inner spiritual resources. MRP was delivered in a 6-week (90 minutes/week) group setting.</description>
