  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of motavizumab to
      palivizumab when administered monthly by intramuscular (IM) injection for the reduction of
      the incidence of RSV hospitalization among children at high risk for serious RSV disease. A
      secondary objective was to compare the incidence of medically-attended lower respiratory
      infections (LRIs) between treatment groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, palivizumab-controlled, multi-center, multi-national trial
      conducted during 2 Northern Hemisphere RSV seasons with an intervening season in the Southern
      Hemisphere. Each child only participated during a single RSV season. Approximately 6,600
      children at risk for serious RSV disease were to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either 15 mg/kg of palivizumab or motavizumab by IM injection every 30 days for a total of 5
      doses.
