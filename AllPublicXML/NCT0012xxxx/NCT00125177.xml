  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IRIS project stands for Incontinence Research Intervention Study. The purpose of this
      research project is to develop an effective behavioral therapy for urinary incontinence and
      specifically to test Knack therapy, a self-help treatment. The Knack therapy involves
      learning the skill of performing a pelvic muscle contraction simultaneously with an event
      known to trigger leakage, in order to stop that leakage.

      This proposal aims to develop and test, in a general population of women with stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI), a model for predicting who will succeed in overcoming incontinence
      long-term (1-year) by simply using Knack therapy (thus avoiding invasive and costly surgery
      and time consuming Kegel's exercises). Specific Aims are to:

        -  develop a logistic regression model to predict success with the Knack;

        -  validate the model by determining the proportion of people who succeed according to who
           is predicted to succeed; and

        -  develop long-term effectiveness of the Knack (1-year).

      The project will be implemented in three phases: model development (n=160 women), model
      validation (n~160), and long-term follow-up of women who demonstrate response. This will be
      evaluated immediately and at 1 month and at 3-months and 1-year.

    <measure>The short-term outcome of &quot;positive response&quot; is defined as able to reduce leakage during coughing to under 2 ml or 50% decrease from baseline (whichever is more stringent). This will be evaluated immediately at 1 month.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Long-term success (3-months and 1-year) is defined both by the paper towel test criteria and by documentation of at least 50% reduction of leakage in diary to reflect success at home.</measure>
