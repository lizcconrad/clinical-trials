      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the Thoratec
      HeartMate II Left Ventricular Assist System (LVAS) as Destination Therapy in end-stage heart
      failure patients who do not qualify for cardiac transplantation.

      The Destination Therapy indication for use was approved by FDA on January 20, 2010 (ref. PMA
      P060040/S005).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HeartMate II is a high speed, electric, axial flow, rotary blood pump. The pump drains
      blood from the left ventricular apex via a rigid inlet cannula and ejects into the aortic
      root via an outflow cannula joined to the aorta with an end to side anastomosis. Power and
      control of the pump are delivered through a percutaneous cable from the pump to the belt-worn
      System Driver.

      The Destination Therapy trial is a prospective, randomized, unblinded, non-inferiority
      evaluation of the HeartMate II LVAS, compared to the HeartMate XVE.

    <measure>Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire(MLWHF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 1,3,6,12</time_frame>
    <description>MLWHF is a validated instrument to self assess how heart failure and its treatment affect the key physical, emotional, social and psychological dimensions of quality of life. The instrument is made up of 21 items that assess the patient's perception of these dimensions on a scale ranging from no (0) to very much (5). The total MLWHF score is calculated by adding the scores for all 21 items (range, 0-105). A lower score indicates a better quality of life. The patients' scores at Baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 Months post-implant are presented and indicate improved quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Neurocognitive Assessments, Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-LM and WMS-LM Delayed)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 month), 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WMS-LM is a measure of auditory attention and memory. This contextual memory task requires patients to recall a passage read by the examiner. Their memory tasks are avoided during the intervening time so as not to disrupt recall. The WMS-LM test provides a comparision for immediate recall and the WMS-LM Delayed provides a comparison for recall that is delayed 30 minutes. The test is scored in a range from 0-50, where the higher score is considered better</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (1 month), 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WMS-VR is a measure of visual memory. This is a graphic memory task requiring both immediate recall and after a 30 minute delay (WMS-VR Delayed). The scoring range is 0-104 where the higher score is better.</description>

Patients urgently transplanted due to device failure are failures. Patients electively transplanted after reversal of co-morbidity will be considered success if they achieve 2 years of survival from day of VAD implant and no stroke.

        <title>Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire(MLWHF)</title>
        <description>MLWHF is a validated instrument to self assess how heart failure and its treatment affect the key physical, emotional, social and psychological dimensions of quality of life. The instrument is made up of 21 items that assess the patient's perception of these dimensions on a scale ranging from no (0) to very much (5). The total MLWHF score is calculated by adding the scores for all 21 items (range, 0-105). A lower score indicates a better quality of life. The patients' scores at Baseline, 1, 3, 6 and 12 Months post-implant are presented and indicate improved quality of life.</description>

        <title>Neurocognitive Assessments, Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-LM and WMS-LM Delayed)</title>
        <description>The WMS-LM is a measure of auditory attention and memory. This contextual memory task requires patients to recall a passage read by the examiner. Their memory tasks are avoided during the intervening time so as not to disrupt recall. The WMS-LM test provides a comparision for immediate recall and the WMS-LM Delayed provides a comparison for recall that is delayed 30 minutes. The test is scored in a range from 0-50, where the higher score is considered better</description>
