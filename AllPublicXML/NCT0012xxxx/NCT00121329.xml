  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have investigated the use of local anesthetics (i.e. lidocaine, mepivacaine)
      to lessen the pain experienced with minor gynecologic procedures such as endometrial biopsy
      and office hysteroscopy. Local anesthetic injected into the uterine cavity has been
      demonstrated effective in some studies at decreasing patient pain associated with these
      intrauterine procedures at an anesthetic concentration of at least 2%. Based on this
      evidence, we hypothesized that an intrauterine lidocaine infusion may reduce patient pain
      during first trimester abortions.
