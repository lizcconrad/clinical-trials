      The investigators implemented a structured chain of acute stroke care with early integrated
      rehabilitation. The mortality at 6 months was lower (12%) compared to 23% in the
      International Stroke Trial (IST) and 39% (67%) of the patients were dead or dependent, which
      is superior compared to international data.

      Background/Aim of the study: To further reduce the 6 months stroke morbidity and mortality in
      a high volume stroke hospital and to compare the results with national and international
      data.

      Methods: 204 consecutive stroke patients are analyzed in a prospective study in a single
      center teaching institution. The intervention consists of a structured therapeutic chain of
      290 collaborating GPs, a standardised acute hospital proceeding overlapping with an early
      integrated neurovascular rehabilitation within the same institution. Primary endpoints
      include death and dependence at 6 months, secondary endpoints are the length of hospital stay
      (LOS) and the quantitative analysis of physical and psychosocial impairments. The data are
      directly compared with the same endpoints of the Swiss subgroup of the international stroke
      trial (IST) and recent international data.

      Results: At 6 months, mortality is significantly lower with 12 % (compared to 23 % in the IST
      trial) and only 39 % (67 %) of the patients are dead or dependent. Stroke severity is similar
      as in other study populations. Median LOS is 15 days in the acute clinic and 39 days in the
      rehabilitation institution. The psychosocial outcome compares favorably to a matched control
      group.

      Conclusions: A structured chain of acute stroke treatment overlapping with an early
      integrated rehabilitation is superior compared to national and international ischemic stroke
      trial data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An acute cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke or intra-cerebral bleeding (ICB)) with
             the signs and symptoms of an acute stroke according to the World Health Organisation
             definition of acute stroke within the last 12 hours without the need or possibility of
             a neurosurgical intervention;

          -  No thrombolytic therapy within the first 3 hours (in order to allow the correct
             comparison with the Swiss cohort of the IST trial)

          -  The informed consent of the patient or, if not possible, of the next of kindred

          -  Living at home before the event

          -  Lack of participation in another trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Transient ischemic attack (TIA) resp. full recovery within 24 hours after the event
