  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' Hib-MenCY-TT
      vaccine compared to a control group receiving licensed Hib conjugate vaccine, each
      administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, and compared to licensed meningococcal serogroups
      A, C, Y, and W-135 polysaccharide vaccine administered at 3 to 5 years of age.

      The safety and immunogenicity of a booster dose of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine will be compared to a
      booster dose of licensed Hib conjugate vaccine, each administered at 12 to 15 months of age.
      The group primed with the Hib conjugate vaccine will re-randomized at 12-15 months of age to
      receive a booster dose of Hib-MenCY-TT or a booster dose of the Hib conjugate vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The non-inferiority of the immunogenicity, safety, and antibody persistence of Hib-MenCY-TT
      vaccine will be compared to ActHIB®, a monovalent Hib conjugate vaccine licensed in the US.

      All subjects will be vaccinated at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months. The immunogenicity of the
      MenC and MenY antigens will be summarized.

      MenC and MenY immunogenicity will be compared to Menomune® (a quadrivalent meningococcal A,
      C, Y, and W-135 plain polysaccharide vaccine licensed in the US) administered to children 3
      to 5 years of age.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>In a Primary Phase (study 101858), 3 groups, MenHibrix, ActiHIB and Menomune, were followed from Day 0 to either Month (M) 7 or 10, depending on vaccination. Then, in a Fourth-Dose Phase (study 102015), 3 groups (MenHibrix, ActiHIB/ActHIB and ActiHIB/MenHibrix) were followed from M10-13 to study end (M16-19). Treatment allocation: primary phase:</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>MenHibrix Group was followed during the entire study period, from Day 0 to M16-19). ActiHIB Group was followed as ActiHIB Group up to M10-13, when it was split into the ActHIB/ActHIB and ActHIB/MenHibrix groups, these latter being followed from M10-13 to study end. Menomune Group was followed up to M7.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>MenHibrix Group</title>
          <description>Subjects in the Group were followed during the entire study period, from Day 0 up to study end 6 months post fourth dose vaccination. During Primary Phase (Study 101858), subjects in this group, aged 6-12 weeks at enrolment, received 3 doses of MenHibrix™ co-administered with Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ (at Day 0 and Months 2 and 4). During Fourth-Dose Phase (Study 102015), subjects primed with 3 doses of MenHibrix™ during the Primary Phase received one dose of MenHibrix™ and one concomitant dose of Prevnar™ at Month 10-13. During Primary Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the right upper thigh, and Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ IM in the left upper and lower thighs, respectively. During Fourth-Dose Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered by the same route and at the same site as during Primary Phase, and Prevnar™ was administered IM in the left upper thigh.</description>

          <title>ActHIB Group</title>
          <description>During Primary Phase (Study 101858), subjects in this group, aged 6-12 weeks at enrolment, received 3 doses of ActHIB™ vaccine co-administered with the Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ vaccines (at Day 0 and Months 2 and 4). Subjects in this Group were followed from Day 0 up to Month 10-13 solely. During Fourth-Dose Phase (Study 102015), these subjects were followed as subjects either in the ActHIB/MenHibrix Group or in the ActHIB/ActHIB Group, receiving then one dose of either MenHibrix™ or ActHIB™ concomitantly with one dose of Prevnar™. During Primary Phase, ActHIB™ was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the right upper thigh, and the Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ vaccines IM in the left upper and lower thighs, respectively.</description>

During Primary Phase (Study 101858), subjects in this group, aged 6-12 weeks at enrolment, received 3 doses of MenHibrix™ co-administered with Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ (at Day 0 and Months 2 and 4). During Fourth-Dose Phase (Study 102015), subjects primed with 3 doses of MenHibrix™ during the Primary Phase received one dose of MenHibrix™ and one concomitant dose of Prevnar™ at Month 10-13. During Primary Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the right upper thigh, and Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ IM in the left upper and lower thighs, respectively. During Fourth-Dose Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered by the same route and at the same site as during Primary Phase, and Prevnar™ was administered IM in the left upper thigh.</description>

During Primary Phase (Study 101858), subjects in this group, aged 6-12 weeks at enrolment, received 3 doses of MenHibrix™ co-administered with Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ (at Day 0 and Months 2 and 4). During Fourth-Dose Phase (Study 102015), subjects primed with 3 doses of MenHibrix™ during the Primary Phase received one dose of MenHibrix™ and one concomitant dose of Prevnar™ at Month 10-13. During Primary Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the right upper thigh, and Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ IM in the left upper and lower thighs, respectively. During Fourth-Dose Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered by the same route and at the same site as during Primary Phase, and Prevnar™ was administered IM in the left upper thigh.</description>

During Primary Phase (Study 101858), subjects in this group, aged 6-12 weeks at enrolment, received 3 doses of MenHibrix™ co-administered with Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ (at Day 0 and Months 2 and 4). During Fourth-Dose Phase (Study 102015), subjects primed with 3 doses of MenHibrix™ during the Primary Phase received one dose of MenHibrix™ and one concomitant dose of Prevnar™ at Month 10-13. During Primary Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered intramuscularly (IM) in the right upper thigh, and Pediarix™ and Prevnar™ IM in the left upper and lower thighs, respectively. During Fourth-Dose Phase, MenHibrix™ was administered by the same route and at the same site as during Primary Phase, and Prevnar™ was administered IM in the left upper thigh.</description>
