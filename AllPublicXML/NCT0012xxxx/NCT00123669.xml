      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of primary progesterone on overall and
      disease free survival in women with operable breast cancer. The study addresses two issues
      related to breast cancer surgery:

        -  Circulating progesterone at the time of surgery might counteract the detrimental effect
           of estrogen on survival of women with operable breast cancer.

        -  Events at the time of surgery may have an impact on the natural history of breast cancer

      This protocol addresses the issue of pre-operative hormone manipulation in women with
      operable breast cancer. The study has been designed after careful review of literature to
      assess the effect of unopposed oestrogen at the time of surgery and collect evidence that
      events at the time of surgery may have impact on the long-term survival of breast cancer
      patients. The meta-analysis of 37 studies on timing of surgery during the menstrual cycle
      showed a 15% + 3 improvement in survival for women who had undergone surgery during the
      luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. Three of the 37 studies where progesterone levels were
      estimated at the time of surgery showed 52% + 26 improvement in survival when circulating
      progesterone were &gt; 1.5 ng/ml. The study aims to produce luteal milieu by injecting Hydroxy-
      progesterone 500 mg IM at the time of surgery. The timing of administration of progesterone
      in the neo-adjuvant setting is decided after collating data from large data-bases and
      randomised trials of screening suggesting that events at the time of surgery may alter the
      behavior of micro-metastases.
