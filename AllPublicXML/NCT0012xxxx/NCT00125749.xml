      The purpose of this study is to test a novel dendritic cell (DC) vaccine in patients with
      Stage IV melanoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A novel dendritic cell vaccine has been developed at the Baylor Institute for Immunology
      Research (BIIR). Pre-clinical studies have found that this dendritic cell vaccine is more
      efficient in inducing a tumor specific immunity than other dendritic cell vaccines. Further
      studies in the BIIR have been done with dendritic cells that were loaded with killed melanoma
      cells from a melanoma cell line treated with heat before loading. Both studies have shown
      that DCs manufactured in this novel way were more efficient in priming the melanoma specific
      CD8+ cells. Thus, the strategy for this clinical trial will be to test recent laboratory
      findings in the clinical setting. An additional objective of the study will be to determine
      the effectiveness of a frozen vaccine product which differs from previous vaccines that were
      manufactured &quot;fresh&quot;.

      This clinical trial will evaluate the novel dendritic cell vaccine in patients with Stage IV
      melanoma. The trial will accrue a total of 30 subjects. The primary goal of this trial will
      be to test the safety/tolerability/feasibility of the vaccine preparation and the rate of
      objective clinical response. A 15% objective response rate will be accepted in patients who
      have failed previous therapy with IL-2 and/or dacarbazine (DTIC) and/or temozolomide which
      are standard treatments for patients with malignant melanoma.

      Each subject will be given 7 initial injections in a fixed dose amount. The first 4 doses
      will be given at 2-week intervals (Weeks 0, 2, 4 and 6); the last 3 doses will be given at
      4-week intervals (Weeks 10, 14, and 18). Those patients who exhibit stable disease, partial
      response or complete response after 7 injections will be given 4 more vaccinations. Each of
      these additional 4 vaccinations will be given 3 months apart (Weeks 36, 48, 72 and 96). Scans
      and re-staging tests will be performed at scheduled intervals throughout the study.
