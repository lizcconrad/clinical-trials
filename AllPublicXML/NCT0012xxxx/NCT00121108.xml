    <textblock>
      This study (MI-CP117) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
      designed to determine if MEDI-524 compared to placebo will result in clinical efficacy in the
      reduction of RSV hospitalization in otherwise healthy Native American Indian Infants in the
      Southwestern United States during their first RSV season.

             10 days)

          -  Active RSV infection (a child with signs/symptoms of respiratory infection must have
             negative RSV testing) or known prior history of RSV infection

          -  A documented wheezing episode before enrollment

             hemodynamically)

          -  Known immunodeficiency

          -  Mother with HIV infection (unless the child has been proven to be not infected)
