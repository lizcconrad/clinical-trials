  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RAVE study will compare renal revascularization to medical management for people with
      atherosclerotic renal vascular disease (ARVD) and the indication for revascularization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is uncertain whether patients with renal vascular disease will have renal or mortality
      benefits from re-establishing renal blood flow with renal revascularization procedures.
      Patients will be assessed for the standard nephrology research outcomes of progression to
      doubling of creatinine, need for dialysis, and death, as well as other cardiovascular
      outcomes. The investigators will also establish whether the use of a new inexpensive, simple
      and available ultrasound test, the renal resistance index (RRI), can identify patients with
      renal vascular disease who will not benefit from renal revascularization procedures.
