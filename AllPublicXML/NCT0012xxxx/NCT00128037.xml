  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the trimodality
      (concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection) approach in superior sulcus
      tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative radiotherapy has long been the community standard in Pancoast, or superior
      sulcus tumor. However, both complete resection rate (-50%) and long-term survival (-30%) are
      poor and unchanged for 40 years. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be beneficial
      in unresectable stage III non-small cell cancer. Surgery after induction chemoradiotherapy
      thus is a promising treatment strategy, and in fact, SWOG reported favorable results of this
      trimodality approach in superior sulcus tumor. The current trial is a Japanese, cooperative,
      multi-center, prospective one to evaluate its safety and efficacy.
