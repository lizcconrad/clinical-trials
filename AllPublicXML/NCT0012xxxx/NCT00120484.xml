  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles that influence natural functions in the body such as
      heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. Circadian rhythms provide the body with an
      internal clock and affect sleep patterns. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      effects of vitamin B12 supplements on circadian rhythms and sleep-wake regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with circadian rhythm sleep disorder suffer from recurrent patterns of disrupted
      sleep that can significantly affect their daily functioning. Evidence suggests that vitamin
      B12 supplements may have a beneficial effect on sleep patterns. However, research on the
      effects of vitamin B12 supplements on sleep is limited. This study will determine the effects
      of vitamin B12 supplements on circadian rhythms and sleep-wake regulation.

      This study will last 47 days. Participants will undergo a 3-week medical and psychological
      screening prior to study entry. Eligible participants will be admitted to the General
      Clinical Research Center where they will live in a private study room for the duration of the
      study. The room will be a time-free environment with no windows, clocks, television, or
      radio. Participants will not be able to make or receive telephone calls, and their bedtimes,
      wake times, and mealtimes will be determined by study researchers. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive three capsules of either vitamin B12 or placebo daily. Blood and
      saliva collection will occur daily to determine core body temperature and hormone levels.
      Performance tests to determine participants' cognitive abilities will be administered at
      regular intervals throughout each day. Participants' sleep will be recorded every night with
      polysomnography, which will monitor brain and muscle activity and breathing patterns during
      sleep.
