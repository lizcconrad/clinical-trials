  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteopenia and osteoporosis are being described more frequently in people with HIV infection.
      This study will test the efficacy of alendronate in comparison with a placebo after 2 years,
      in people with primary osteoporosis. People will receive the recommended adequate intake of
      calcium and vitamin D.

      The purposes of this trial are:

        -  To study the efficacy of alendronate in HIV-associated osteoporosis

        -  To measure the prevalence of osteoporosis in HIV patients and to detect risk factors in
           a large cohort of HIV patients from the screening phase
