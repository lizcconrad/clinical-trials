  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irofulven is an investigational chemotherapeutic agent being studied in a variety of solid
      tumors. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      irofulven/capecitabine combination therapy in patients with anaplastic, medullary, or locally
      advanced/metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Cancer of the thyroid confirmed by a biopsy sample. Specific types of thyroid cancer
             included in this study are anaplastic, differentiated (papillary, follicular, or
             Hürthle cell), and medullary thyroid cancers.

          -  For patients with differentiated (papillary, follicular, or Hürthle cell) thyroid
             cancer, no more than 1 prior chemotherapy treatment is allowed.

          -  Measurable disease is required (at least one lesion at least 2 cm in length by
             conventional computed tomography (CT) techniques or at least 1 cm by spiral CT scan).

          -  Any prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy must be stopped at least 4 weeks before
             the first dose of study treatment. Prior radioiodine (I131) therapy must be stopped at
             least 3 (or 6) months before first dose of study treatment (depending on
             responsiveness to this therapy).

          -  Recovery from any toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery.

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use a medically acceptable contraceptive
             method. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of retinopathy.

          -  Serious ongoing medical or psychiatric disorder (as determined by the clinical
             investigator).

          -  External beam radiation therapy to &gt;30% of the bone marrow at any time prior to study
             entry.

          -  Prior treatment with irofulven or capecitabine, or protracted infusion of
             5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (infusion duration greater than or equal to 5 days) or other
             fluoropyrimidines.

          -  Therapeutic doses of coumarin derivatives (warfarin) 14 days prior to receiving the
             first dose of study treatment or during the study period.

        Please note: There are additional criteria that must be met in order to be eligible for
        this study.
