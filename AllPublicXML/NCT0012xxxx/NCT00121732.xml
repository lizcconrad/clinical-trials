    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974
      administered as an intravenous bolus dose on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm A) or
      on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Arm B) to patients with solid tumors that have progressed
      following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.

      This is a two-arm, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study to determine the MTD of
      E7974 administered as an intravenous bolus dose on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (Arm
      A) or on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle (Arm B) to patients with solid tumors that have
      progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists. Response and
      progression will be evaluated in this study using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

          1. Patients must have a pathologically diagnosed, histologically or cytologically
             confirmed solid tumor that has progressed following effective therapy or for which no
             effective therapy exists (including surgery or radiation therapy).

          2. Patients must be &gt;= 18 years of age.

          4. Patients must have a life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months.

          5. Patients must have adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5
             mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;= 40 mL/minute (min).

          6. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil
             count &gt;= 1,500/µL, hemoglobin of &gt;= 9 g/dL (may be transfused), and platelet count
             (not transfused) &gt;= 100,000/µL.

          7. Patients must have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL and
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 3 times the
             upper limits of normal (ULN), unless related to liver involvement by tumor, in which
             case &lt;= 5.0 times ULN.

          8. Patients must be willing and able to sign written informed consent and be able to
