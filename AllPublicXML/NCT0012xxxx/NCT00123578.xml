  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is a powerful central nervous system depressant. The number of
      individuals seeking treatment for GHB abuse has been steadily increasing in the United
      States. Currently, lorazepam and pentobarbital are two medications used to treat individuals
      who experience GHB-withdrawal symptoms. The purpose of this study is to describe the signs
      and symptoms of GHB withdrawal and to identify predictors of withdrawal severity. The study
      will also evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatment with lorazepam versus
      pentobarbital for GHB detoxification.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GHB and GHB precursors such as 1,4-butanediol and gamma-butylrolactone (GBL) have become
      popular drugs of abuse. In cases of severe withdrawal, delirium, confusion, hallucinations,
      and agitation can occur. There has been a sharp rise in the number of GHB related emergency
      room visits over the past few years, yet little is known about the effective treatment of GHB
      withdrawal and dependence. The purpose of this study is to describe the signs and symptoms of
      GHB withdrawal, identify predictors of withdrawal severity, and evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of treatment for GHB detoxification. There will be compensation for screening
      assessments.

      The study includes two phases. The open-label Phase 1 will aim to determine the safety of
      lorazepam for the treatment of mild GHB withdrawal. Participants who progress into moderate
      or severe withdrawal will enter the controlled Phase 2. In Phase 2, participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either lorazepam or pentobarbital in order to determine which
      drug is more effective in treating GHB withdrawal.

      The study will consist of 1 to 2 outpatient screening visits, followed by up to 15 days of
      inpatient detoxification treatment and assessment. After hospital discharge from inpatient
      treatment, measures of protracted GHB withdrawal and psychiatric symptoms will be obtained on
      an outpatient weekly basis for 8 weeks. Repeat measures of cognitive functioning will be
      obtained at baseline, termination of treatment, and at 30, 60, and 90-day follow-up intervals
      in order to assess long-term neurocognitive effects of GHB withdrawal and use.
