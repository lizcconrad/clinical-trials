      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate an improvement in physical functional recovery,
      following administration of Drug for 24 weeks, in patients who have recently experienced a
      hip fracture. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of Drug.

      This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is proprietary and not
      publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants).

                  anti-hyperglycemic medication

               2. Patient is currently receiving insulin. Note: A short-term course of insulin
                  required for glycemic control post hip fracture surgery is not exclusionary
