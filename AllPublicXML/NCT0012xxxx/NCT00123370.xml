      plus a tailored cognitive behavioural therapy program in the treatment of methamphetamine
      dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Modafinil is a novel wake promoting agent approved in Australia for the treatment of
      narcolepsy. Preliminary studies have suggested that modafinil may have value in the treatment
      of psychostimulant dependence through positive effects on mood, sleep patterns,
      concentration, fatigue and drug craving. It appears to be well tolerated with a low abuse
      potential. Sixty dependent methamphetamine users will be allocated to 2 equal groups. The
      experimental group will receive modafinil 200 mg/day for 10 weeks and a tailored cognitive
      behavioural therapy program. The control group will receive placebo under equivalent
      conditions. Primary outcome will be a between group comparison of methamphetamine negative
      urine samples over the 10 week study period. Adverse events, side effects, compliance,
      retention and self reported health, psychosocial and drug use will also be compared between
      the study groups.
