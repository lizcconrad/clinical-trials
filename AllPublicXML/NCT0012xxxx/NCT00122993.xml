    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a two-year multi-component
      environmental intervention to prevent weight gain among city bus drivers at four bus garages.

      It is hypothesized that transit employees in the intervention garages will gain less weight
      compared to the transit employees in the control garages.

      BACKGROUND:

      Environmental influences that support less healthful food choices and sedentary behaviors
      have contributed to the epidemic increase in overweight and obesity among U.S. adults.
      Worksite settings are an effective channel through which to reach adults with interventions
      designed to prevent excess weight gain and obesity.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study will implement and evaluate a multi-component environmental intervention to
      prevent excess weight gain among 1200 bus drivers working in four garages in a major
      metropolitan area. Four garages will be randomized to the intervention or control group for a
      two-year period. The environmental interventions are based on a social ecological framework
      and target four worksite environmental areas: 1) food availability and incentives; 2)
      physical activity opportunities and incentives; 3) the social environment; and 4)
      media/promotion related to health food choices, physical activity, and body weight.
