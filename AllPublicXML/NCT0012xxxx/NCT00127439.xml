    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data comparing two means of providing locomotor
      training: manual and robotic and the possible differential effects it may have on walking
      ability for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most disabling health problems facing adults today,
      with one of the consequences often being inability to walk or difficulty walking. Recent
      studies suggest that intensive step training on a treadmill using body-weight support (BWS)
      and manual assistance that provides repetitive task-specific sensory cues to the neural axis
      can improve the recovery of walking for persons with incomplete SCI. More recently, robotics
      have been developed as an alternative to manually-assisted training. Robotic-assisted
      training may allow for increased intensity of training, improve the reproducibility and
      consistency of training, and reduce the personnel needed to implement the training. However,
      the effects of robotic-assisted training compared to manually-assisted training are not
      known. An improved understanding of these differential effects and the mechanisms of
      improvement in walking can facilitate continued advances in evidenced-based practice of
      neuro-rehabilitation, therefore improving the treatment of persons with SCI.

      The primary objective of this project is to assess and compare the effects of
      robotic-assisted versus manually-assisted locomotor training (LT) using the body-weight
      support (BWS) on sub-tasks of walking. Specifically, we believe that at least four sub-tasks
      of walking are differentially affected by the robotic-assisted training when compared to
      manually-assisted training (propulsion, transition from stance to step, stepping, and
      equilibrium). The investigators hypothesize that robotic-assisted training will have a
      greater effect on improving propulsion, transition and equilibrium. The effect of these two
      modalities on adaptability, a fifth sub-task of walking, is unclear; therefore, a development
      component of the pilot project will involve establishing a quantitative measure of
      adaptability and assessing differential effects of training. Participants will be randomized
      to one of two training groups: robotic-assisted or manually-assisted, and evaluated for
      performance on sub-tasks of walking.

    <measure>Self Selected Velocity on Treadmill</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects walk on a treadmill with overhead safety mounted to laboratory ceiling while wearing a harness. Treadmill speeds adjusted to lower than overground walking speeds and adjusted to patient reaches a comfortable speed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stepping: Foot Trajectory Toe-Off</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Foot angle in a global reference frame at the start of swing phase during treadmill walking at self-selected speed. The kinematic outcomes were first standardized as deviations from control subjects who walk at similar speed (i.e., deviation from the control mean divided by SD among control). Stepping was quantified by the change in orientation of the foot angle (in a global reference frame) from the beginning to the end of the swing phase (i.e., foot-off to foot-down). The values will be identified from the processed 3-D kinematics for each walking cycle and average across steps.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stepping: Foot Trajectory Toe-off % Cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure is the percentage of the gait cycle (%) for the occurrence of toe off. Foot trajectory toe-off was identified as indicated in the prior primary outcome (#2). The occurrence of toe-off was then identified relative to the percent of a complete gait cycle and thus the end point of the stance component of the gait cycle and the point of initiation for the swing component of the gait cycle. This outcome is reported in per cent of gait cycle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Foot Trajectory Initial Contact</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Foot trajectory initial contact is the foot angle in a global reference frame at the end of swing (start of stance phase) during treadmill walking at self-selected speed when the foot contacts the ground (i.e. heel strike, foot contact, initial contact). The kinematic outcomes were first standardized as deviations from control subjects who walk at similar speed (i.e. deviation from the control mean divided by the SD among control). Foot trajectory initial contact (heel strike) was quantified by the orientation of the foot angle (in a global reference frame) at foot down (initial contact or heel strike). The values will be identified from the process 3-D kinematics for each walking cycle and averaged across steps. The outcome measurement is in degrees.</description>

    <description>The total program is 45 sessions, 5x/week with total locomotor training (LT) duration of 30 stepping minutes/day. 1) BWS is initiated at 40% and gradually decreasing to 0%, 2) treadmill speed is set at normal walking speeds and increased as tolerated, and 3) manual assistance given when the subject is unable to independently step or control upright posture, and decreased as participant progresses. Trainers assist via verbal cues and manual assistance to achieve good stepping. The goal for endurance is 20 mins of continuous, independent, coordinated stepping on the treadmill at 0% BWS. Participants are encouraged to assist and/or independently maintain an upright posture, weight shift onto the loaded limb, flex or extend their legs, and to swing their arms in coordination with the legs.</description>

The kinematic outcomes were first standardized as deviations from control subjects who walk at similar speed (i.e., deviation from the control mean divided by SD among control). Stepping was quantified by the change in orientation of the foot angle (in a global reference frame) from the beginning to the end of the swing phase (i.e., foot-off to foot-down). The values will be identified from the processed 3-D kinematics for each walking cycle and average across steps.</description>

        <description>The outcome measure is the percentage of the gait cycle (%) for the occurrence of toe off. Foot trajectory toe-off was identified as indicated in the prior primary outcome (#2). The occurrence of toe-off was then identified relative to the percent of a complete gait cycle and thus the end point of the stance component of the gait cycle and the point of initiation for the swing component of the gait cycle. This outcome is reported in per cent of gait cycle.</description>

        <title>Foot Trajectory Initial Contact</title>
        <description>Foot trajectory initial contact is the foot angle in a global reference frame at the end of swing (start of stance phase) during treadmill walking at self-selected speed when the foot contacts the ground (i.e. heel strike, foot contact, initial contact). The kinematic outcomes were first standardized as deviations from control subjects who walk at similar speed (i.e. deviation from the control mean divided by the SD among control). Foot trajectory initial contact (heel strike) was quantified by the orientation of the foot angle (in a global reference frame) at foot down (initial contact or heel strike). The values will be identified from the process 3-D kinematics for each walking cycle and averaged across steps. The outcome measurement is in degrees.</description>

The goal for endurance is 20 mins of continuous, independent, coordinated stepping on the treadmill at 0% BWS. Participants are encouraged to assist and/or independently maintain an upright posture, weight shift onto the loaded limb, flex or extend their legs, and to swing their arms in coordination with the legs.</description>
