      This randomized phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride with or without
      carboplatin and paclitaxel works in treating patients with stage III-IV non-small cell lung
      cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving erlotinib
      hydrochloride together with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
      previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung who are never or light former
      smokers treated with either OSI-774 (erlotinib) (erlotinib hydrochloride) alone (arm A) or in
      combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (arm B).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the radiographic response rate in patients with previously untreated advanced
      adenocarcinoma of the lung who are never or light former smokers treated with either OSI-774
      (erlotinib) alone (arm A) or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (arm B).

      II. To determine the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and V-Ki-ras2
      Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase
      (ALK) translocations in patients with previously untreated advanced adenocarcinoma of the
      lung who are never or light former smokers.

      III. To determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with and without EGFR
      mutations treated with either OSI-774 (erlotinib) alone (arm A) or in combination with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel (arm B).

      IV. To determine the response rate and time to progression in patients with and without K-ras
      mutations treated with either OSI-774 (erlotinib) alone (arm A) or in combination with
      carboplatin/paclitaxel (arm B).

      V. To determine the median and overall survival of patients with previously untreated
      advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung who are never or light former smokers treated with either
      OSI-774 (erlotinib) alone (arm A) or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (arm B).

      VI. To estimate the response rate, progression-free, and overall survival of patients with
      echinoderm microtubule associated protein like (EML)4-ALK translocation who received OSI-774
      erlotinib alone (arm A) or in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel (arm B).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride as in Arm I. Patients also receive
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-3 hours and carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 6 courses of treatment, patients may continue to
      receive erlotinib hydrochloride alone as above.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 1 year
      and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.

    <measure>18 Weeks Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The product limit estimator developed by Kaplan Meier will be used to graphically describe progression free survival for patients randomized to each study arm.
The 18 week progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients that were alive progression-free 18 weeks after registration into the study. Disease progression was assessed per modified RECIST criteria, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, in either primary or nodal lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of new lesions. Kaplan-Meier estimate of 18-week progression-free survival was calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of Study (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients who respond (completely or partially) to each combination regimen will be estimated. An exact binomial confidence interval will be computed for these estimates.
Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria:
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to death (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from patient randomization (arm assignment) to death from any cause. The median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of treatment (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from registration until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. The median PFS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression is defined as in the primary outcome measure.
EGFR mutations were performed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute using a sensitive heteroduplex method coupled with enzymatic digestion as previously reported (Janne PA, et al: A rapid and sensitive enzymatic method for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation screening. Clin Cancer Res 12:751-758, 2006). All positive findings were independently verified and subjected to sequencing. The mutation analyses were blinded to the participants' clinical outcome.</description>

        <title>18 Weeks Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate</title>
        <description>The product limit estimator developed by Kaplan Meier will be used to graphically describe progression free survival for patients randomized to each study arm.
The 18 week progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients that were alive progression-free 18 weeks after registration into the study. Disease progression was assessed per modified RECIST criteria, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, in either primary or nodal lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of new lesions. Kaplan-Meier estimate of 18-week progression-free survival was calculated.</description>

EGFR mutations were performed at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute using a sensitive heteroduplex method coupled with enzymatic digestion as previously reported (Janne PA, et al: A rapid and sensitive enzymatic method for epidermal growth factor receptor mutation screening. Clin Cancer Res 12:751-758, 2006). All positive findings were independently verified and subjected to sequencing.
