      The study is designed to study the utility of 123I-mIBG as a diagnostic imaging agent to
      predict cardiac outcome in subjects with heart failure and in comparison to subjects without
      cardiovascular disease.

    <measure>Relationship Between the Occurrence of Adverse Cardiac Event and 123I-mIBG Uptake on Planar Scintigraphy Categorized as High or Low Heart to Mediastinum (H/M) Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 months from the date of administration of 123I-mIBG</time_frame>
    <description>H/M ratio for 123I-mIBG uptake at 3 hours 50 minutes post administration was calculated by dividing the counts/pixel in the total myocardium region of interest (ROI) by the counts/pixel in the 7x7 pixel mediastinal ROI. Assessments were done by 3 independent readers. H/M ratios were categorized as 'Low' and 'High' based on being &lt;1.6 or ≥1.6 respectively. The efficacy of 123I-mIBG was based on the prognostic value of the imaging data collected relative to time to adverse cardiac events. Data analysis to assess the relative hazard of an adverse cardiac event was performed only on HF participants categorized into 2 groups with H/M &lt;1.6 and H/M ≥1.6 using a Cox proportional hazards model.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study subjects must be adults with an established diagnosis of heart failure (New York
             Heart Association Class II or III) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction
             (LVEF) (≤ 35%) or be healthy volunteers without heart disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers were not eligible if they had a history of diabetes mellitus,
             signs/symptoms of neurological disease (e.g., Parkinson's Disease, multiple system
             atrophy, Parkinsonian syndromes), or other diseases known to affect the sympathetic
             nervous system.

          -  Subjects with New York Heart Association Class I or IV heart failure were not
             eligible.

          -  Subjects were excluded if they had previously received 123I-mIBG or 131I-mIBG or
             participated in a clinical study involving investigational medicinal product or
             devices within 30 days.

          -  Subjects that had a pacemaker or had received defibrillation, anti-tachycardia pacing
             or cardioversion to treat a previous arrhythmic event or had an ICD inserted within 30
             days before study entry are not eligible.

            <groups_desc>Analysis based on Reader A readings. Data analysis to assess the relative hazard of an adverse cardiac event was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Hazard (risk) of an event for a participant with low H/M at time “t” was expressed as Hl (t)/ Hh (t) = Ψ, where Hl (t) and Hh (t) denote the hazard of an event at time t for participants with low H/M and high H/M respectively.</groups_desc>
