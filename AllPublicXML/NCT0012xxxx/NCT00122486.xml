    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study involving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) will assess the extended
      safety of TDF 300 mg per day among young women who are not HIV-infected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol describes a randomized, fully-masked, parallel, placebo-controlled study of TDF
      for pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV in high-risk women. TDF was selected for investigation as
      prophylaxis against HIV in high-risk women because of its unique pharmacological profile. In
      addition to the convenience of being a once daily single tablet, TDF’s safety profile is
      comparable to placebo among HIV infected persons, it has striking anti-HIV potency, and it
      has low potential for selection of resistant viruses. TDF is cleared from the body by the
      kidneys and is not metabolized by the liver. Therefore, TDF has limited potential to have
      pharmacokinetic interactions with other hepatically metabolized drugs. Each of these
      properties is necessary given the realities of the intended target populations. Moreover,
      initial prevention studies in simian models have provided encouraging results. Finally, the
      drug’s sponsor is supportive of investigating the potential use of TDF as a preventive, as
      well as a therapeutic agent.

      Participants’ HIV status is monitored monthly. Participants are also monitored for safety
      using periodic physical examinations, serial laboratory tests and adverse event queries. Lab
      tests for kidney and liver function were to be conducted at screening, months 1, 3 and every
      3 months thereafter or at the final visit if early withdrawal. To minimize the risk of
      contracting HIV infection, participants are counseled monthly to use male condoms for each
      act of intercourse. Participants converting for antibodies to HIV are counseled and referred
      to medical services as appropriate for each country.
