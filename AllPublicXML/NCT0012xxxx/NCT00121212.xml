      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography using carbon-11
      acetate, may help find metastases from prostate cancer and may help predict whether prostate
      cancer will come back after treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well positron emission tomography using
      carbon-11 acetate works in finding metastases and predicting recurrence in patients with
      prostate cancer who are at risk for recurrence after treatment.

      The overall goal of this project is determination of the role of PET in patients with newly
      diagnosed medium- and high-risk prostate cancer in whom the standard clinical and imaging
      workup is negative. Thus, the incremental value of PET will be determined in this important
      group.
