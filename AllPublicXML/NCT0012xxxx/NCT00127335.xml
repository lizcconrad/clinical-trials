  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant proportion of patients complaining of muscle symptoms while on statin
      therapy who have a measurable difference in muscle strength or endurance and whose muscle
      biopsies are diagnostic for myopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Sixty patients who
      are identified by their physician as having muscle pain or weakness while on statin therapy
      and in whom creatine kinase (CK) enzyme determinations have been normal will be enrolled
      voluntarily. All patients will have a percutaneous muscle biopsy prior to enrollment into the
      trial. These patients will be randomized in a blinded crossover fashion to either
      standardized statin therapy or placebo in eight week intervals. After eight weeks of drug or
      placebo the patients will be assessed for signs and symptoms of muscle weakness by:

        -  Dynamometry of grip and hip strength

        -  An exercise test with exhaled gas analysis

        -  Blood tests for cholesterol, creatine kinase, lactate

        -  Urine tests for organic acids

      Following the first eight-week study and testing period, each patient will serve as their own
      control and they will enter a second eight-week study period. During the second phase they
      will take the opposite therapy, either drug or placebo, which they have not yet received.
      Sub-studies will include ten controls who have never previously received statins and ten
      subjects who have suffered statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Subjects in these sub-studies will
      not be exposed to statin therapy and will only undergo limited testing.
