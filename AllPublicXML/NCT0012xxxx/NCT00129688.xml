  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Once-daily dose administration of aminoglycoside in adults is effective and economical.
      However, its value in febrile neutropenic children, especially in Thailand, is less well
      researched. In the area where Pseudomonas aeruginosa prevalence in febrile neutropenic
      children is low, the combination of cloxacillin and amikacin is an appropriate approach. This
      study would like to compare the efficacy and safety including cost between these two amikacin
      administrations (once-daily or twice-daily) in combination with cloxacillin as an empirical
      therapy in febrile neutropenic children.

      Hypothesis: Once-daily amikacin plus cloxacillin can be used to treat febrile neutropenic
      children in Khon Kaen, Thailand.
