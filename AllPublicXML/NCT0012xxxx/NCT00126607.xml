  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well trastuzumab works in treating patients with
      metastatic or recurrent salivary gland cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab,
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial response) in patients
      with advanced high-grade salivary gland carcinoma treated with trastuzumab.

      II. To assess one-year progression-free survival and one-year overall survival for patients
      treated with this regimen.

      III. To assess the toxicities associated with this treatment regimen in this group of
      patients.

      IV. To measure the indicators of C-erb B2 oncoprotein expression and C-erb B2 oncogene
      amplification and epidermal growth factor receptor expression and explore the relationship
      between these markers and response, progression-free survival and overall survival in
      preliminary fashion.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months until 3 years from study
      entry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant high-grade
             (poorly differentiated or undifferentiated) salivary gland carcinoma of the head and
             neck (except adenoid cystic carcinoma) that is either metastatic or recurrent and is
             not amenable to salvage surgical resection or radiation therapy; eligible histologies
             are adenocarcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, salivary duct
             carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma

          -  Patients must have tumors that car HER-2 gene amplification as determined by (i)
             fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or (ii) overexpression of HER-2 protein, 2+
             to 3+ level assessed by immunohistochemistry

          -  Patients must have measurable disease; all measurable disease must be assessed within
             28 days prior to registration; all non-measurable disease must be assessed within 42
             days prior to registration

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are not eligible for this trial because of their
             poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that
             would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Patients must have and must be willing to submit tumor tissue for pathology review and
             translational medicine studies; patients must be offered the opportunity to
             participate in specimen banking for future research

          -  Patients previously treated with chemotherapy are eligible provided that at least (28
             days) has elapsed since the last course of chemotherapy was completed and patient has
             recovered from all toxicities

          -  Prior radiation must have been completed at least 28 days prior to registration and
             all toxicities must have resolved (in the opinion of the treating investigator); prior
             surgery must have been completed at least 28 days prior to registration and all
             surgical adverse events must have resolved (in the opinion of the treating
             investigator)

          -  Patients must not be planning on receiving any other investigational agents, other
             chemotherapeutic agents, radiation therapy, or hormonal therapy while receiving
             treatment on this study except for steroids administered for non-disease-related
             conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes)

          -  Patients must have a Zubrod Performance status of 0-2

          -  WBC count &gt;= 2,000 ul within 28 days prior to registration

          -  ANC count &gt;= 1,000/ul within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 75,000/ul within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal within 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal within 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  Patients with liver metastases must have bilirubin and SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 5 x the
             institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2.5 x the institutional limit of normal within 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  Patients with a known history of allergic reactions to compounds of similar chemical
             or biologic composition to trastuzumab are not eligible

          -  No prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated basal cell
             or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or
             II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other
             cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for five years

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing; women/men of reproductive potential must
             have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method

          -  If day 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next
             working day

          -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is done
             is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday four weeks
             later would be considered day 28; this allows for efficient patient scheduling without
             exceeding the guidelines

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must sign
             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the data operations center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
             has been entered into the data base
