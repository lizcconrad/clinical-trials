  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last years urinary tract infections (UTI) and pyelonephritis have been the most common
      reason for readmission to our hospital after birth. UTI is know to be one of the leading
      causes of postpartum fever affecting about 3%-8% of all postpartum women.

      The investigators hypothesize that collecting urine cultures pre- and postnatally may help
      identify women at risk for developing UTI, while treating women with positive cultures could
      decrease the rehospitalization rate due to postpartum fever. Collecting data during delivery
      may help identify women at risk for this complication.

      The study is planned as a randomized controlled study with 500 women in each arm. The study
      group will have pre and post labor urine cultures taken, and the risk factors during delivery
      will be documented, while the control group will have no cultures taken, as the common
      practice prior to the study.

      Women with positive cultures will be contacted by telephone, and antibiotic treatment
      recommended according to bacteria sensitivity. All women will be contacted by telephone 1
      month post partum and data regarding urinary tract symptoms and need for hospitalization,
      will be collected. The rehospitalization rate will be documented and compared between the two
      groups.

      The assumption is that routine urine culture to women in the peripartum period may reduce the
      UTI rate and hospitalization after delivery.
