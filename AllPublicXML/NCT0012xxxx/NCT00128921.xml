  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Velcade (bortezomib, PS-341) has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of multiple myeloma for patients who have received at least one prior
      therapy. Velcade is a unique compound developed by scientists at Millennium Pharmaceuticals,
      Inc. Velcade enters cells and affects the way they divide. Cancer cells are particularly
      sensitive. Velcade interferes with the enzyme &quot;proteasome&quot; which is responsible for allowing
      cells to divide. When cancer cells cannot divide, they die. Velcade falls into the class of
      drugs known as &quot;proteasome inhibitors.&quot;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies at the Myeloma Institute for Research &amp; Therapy have shown that Velcade is very
      effective in treating patients who are relapsing after having been treated with at least two
      lines of prior therapy.

      One key factor in multiple myeloma is bone destruction caused by the myeloma cells. Most
      patients with multiple myeloma (80%) will develop skeletal lesions, despite treatment. These
      lesions are rarely repaired, even when the myeloma is in remission.

      Experience at MIRT has suggested that Velcade may increase osteoblast (bone cells that cause
      bone growth) activity. One goal of this study is to identify if Velcade's effect on myeloma
      is due to its ability to increase osteoblasts.

      This study also has the following goals:

        -  To find out the lowest dose of Velcade that has an effect on myeloma and also increases
           bone activation;

        -  To identify ways to predict if Velcade will increase bone activation.

      Time periods are:

      According to cohort assignment, you will receive three cycles of Velcade®™ (1.3 mg/m2, 1.0
      mg/m2 or 0.7 mg/m2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, on a 21-day cycle.

      During the first two cycles of Velcade®™, bone markers (tests on your bones) will be measured
      Days 1, 4, 8, 11: Pre-dose, post-dose, and every 2 to 4 hours for 8 hours.

      Days 2-3, 5-7, 9-10, 12-21: every 24 hours, beginning with the immediate post-dose sample
      (+/- 2 hours)

      During the third cycle of Velcade®™, bone markers will be measured Days 1 and 11: Pre-dose
      and post-dose, and then again on Day 21.

Patients will complete the study after two cycles of VELCADE™. However, if a patient continues to receive VELCADE™ as part of his/her treatment for relapsing MM, routine bone markers may be monitored for the duration of VELCADE™ treatment as clinically indicated.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Enrollment plan was as follows: The first 10 were enrolled in Arm A, the next 10 were enrolled in Arm B and the last 10 were to be enrolled in Arm C. 10 participants were enrolled on Arm A, 8 participants on Arm B and 0 on Arm C. Of the 8 participants in Arm B, only 6 were analyzed because 2 withdrew before receiving bortezomib.</pre_assignment_details>
