  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to assess the efficacy of Migraid in terms of preventing
      headaches in patients with migraine with typical aura. The secondary objectives were to
      assess whether Migraid is able to achieve pain relief and/or relief of migraine associated
      symptoms and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study treatment.

      Migraid is to be used only once during the aura phase of a migraine attack for a duration of
      60 minutes.

      Reference therapy: No treatment. This means that at random the patient will be allocated to
      either of the two treatment orders; the first treatment order is to use the Migraid whenever
      a migraine attack with an aura occurs. During the next migraine attack the Migraid will not
      be used and vice versa for the other group of patients.

      Patients will be asked to complete diary cards to record details for each of the two migraine
      attacks and the severity of the migraine headache at certain points in time: at t = 30
      minutes, t = 60 minutes, t= 90 minutes, t =120 minutes, t =150 minutes, t =180 minutes and t
      = 24 hours.

      Also, associated symptoms will be asked for. Rescue medication data including name, time
      taken and amount will also be registered in the diary card.

      For all primary and secondary variables of efficacy, the following definitions will be used:

      Grade or score: Pain level: Description

      0: None - No pain;

        1. Mild - A headache with no remarkable pain that does not hinder you in performing your
           usual daily activities;

        2. Moderate - A headache with pain that hinders you in performing your usual daily
           activities, but that does necessitate you to go to bed;

        3. Severe - A headache with pain that necessitates you to go to or stay in bed.

      The associated symptoms will be graded as either present or absent. These symptoms are
      defined to conform to the following table:

      Symptom: Description

      Nausea: Sick to the stomach/feel like throwing up; Vomiting: Throwing up or puking;
      Photophobia: Light bothers or hurts the eyes; Phonophobia: Noise bothers or hurts the ears.

      A migraine attack is defined as:

      New onset of migraine pain, preceded by a pain-free period of at least 24-hours duration.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a current history of migraine with typical aura where the aura is
             usually followed by headache according to the International Headache Society (IHS)
             criteria.

          -  Patients are male or female. N.B. When female patients are treated for migraine
             attacks with triptans then the required precautions and safety measures should be
             taken in order to prevent pregnancy.

          -  Patients with an age between 18 and 65 years.

          -  Patients must have experienced 1-4 moderate (grade 2) or severe (grade 3) migraine
             attacks per month for at least two months prior to entry into the study.

          -  Patients must be willing to keep their prophylactic drug treatment for migraine
             unchanged.

          -  Patients must be able to distinguish migraine headaches from other headache types
             (e.g. tension-type headaches) at the onset of a migraine attack.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and complete the diary card

          -  Patients must be willing and able to give written informed consent prior to entry into

             with IHD.

          -  Patients suffering from coronary vasospasm or any atherosclerotic disease
             (cerebrovascular disease [CVD], peripheral vascular disease [PVD] or Raynaud’s

             planning to participate in another clinical research study at any time during this
             study.

          -  Patients with any concurrent medical or psychiatric condition that, in the
             investigator’s opinion, may affect the interpretation of efficacy or safety data or
