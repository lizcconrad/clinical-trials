  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how different forms of &quot;Anger Management&quot; compare in
      reducing anger and impulsive aggressive symptoms in people. &quot;Anger Management&quot; is a common
      form of &quot;talk therapy&quot; used to help people with anger problems. There are different types of
      &quot;talk therapy&quot; used to help people for anger problems and this study will compare two types
      of talk therapy in people with Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). IED is a disorder in
      which there are frequent and sudden outbursts of anger (yelling, throwing and breaking
      things, hitting people) that lead to problems with other people socially or at work.

      Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED) is increasingly acknowledged as a common, potentially
      disabling psychiatric condition. Despite this, there are currently no empirically supported
      behavioral treatments for patients with IED. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess
      the short-term and long-term efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT), previously
      found to be successful in treating dysfunctional anger, for treating IED. Secondary goals of
      the project are to:

        1. explore mechanisms involved in the successful treatment of IED, and

        2. examine individual differences associated with treatment response.

      Seventy-two subjects meeting for both research and DSM IED criteria will be randomly assigned
      to either 12 weeks of individual CBT, 12 weeks of group CBT or 12 weeks of a wait-list
      control condition. Subjects will be assessed before and after therapy/wait-list as well as at
      3 month and 6 month follow-up. Primary outcome measures will assess aggressive behavior,
      anger, and the presence of an IED diagnosis at post-treatment, 6-month follow-up and 12-month
      follow-up. Social and emotional information processing will be evaluated as potential
      mechanism of change. Trait aggression will be assessed as a potential moderating variable.
