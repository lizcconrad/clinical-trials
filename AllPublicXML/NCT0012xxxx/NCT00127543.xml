    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if education about medicines directed toward children will
      improve their knowledge. The investigators also want to know if this knowledge lasts over
      time. Right now there are few medication instructional cards that are appropriate for
      children. Most of the medication cards provide information for adults. Some studies have
      shown that by teaching children directly, the children may take medicine at the right time
      for the right reason, have fewer side effects and know more about their medicine.

      The purpose of this research study is to see if education about medication helps children
      learn more about their medicine and if this knowledge lasts.

      In 2004, then Surgeon General Carmona stated that a health literate individual is more apt to
      know the answer, when asked how to keep themselves well (AHRQ, 2004). There is a burgeoning
      movement among medical professionals to address health literacy. Teaching health information
      to children will empower them to actively participate in their current care and provide
      self-management skills that will assist them to keep themselves well throughout their lives.
      Currently, few medication administration instructional cards exist that are appropriate for
      children. Providing medication information that the child might understand may result in
      better administration compliance, fewer adverse effects and develop an individual that is
      knowledgeable regarding medications and appropriate administration. The purpose if this
      research is to develop medication administration cards, appropriate for children, which
      provide information on the most commonly used drugs among the Hematology/Oncology population.

      The overall objective of this research is to develop medication informational cards for
      medications frequently used within the Hematology/Oncology pediatric population, and evaluate
      the effectiveness of these cards, by means of a pre- and post–test.
