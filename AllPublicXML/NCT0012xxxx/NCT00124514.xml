      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of triptorelin when used for the protection
      of the ovaries (pair of female reproductive organs) during cyclophosphamide therapy for
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; lupus) and to see what effects (good or bad) it has on
      patients. The study will be done with female patients who have been diagnosed with systemic
      lupus erythematosus, are younger than 21 years of age, and require intravenous
      cyclophosphamide to control the disease. Each patient will be in the study for approximately
      23 months, until 4 months after the intravenous cyclophosphamide treatment has been
      completed.

      This study is currently being conducted at 3 sites across the United States and Brazil (Los
      Angeles, Cincinnati and San Paulo Brazil). A total of 50 patients will participate in this
      study.

      Each patient will be randomized (assigned) to one of 5 groups. Randomization means that
      patients are put into a group completely by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither the
      patient nor the study staff knows what group the patient is in. The patient has a 20% chance
      of being placed in any group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lupus is an autoimmune disease that may harm all organs in the body and especially affects
      the kidney, brain, skin and lungs. Cyclophosphamide is a very effective medication to treat
      lupus, but it can damage the ovaries (pair of reproductive organs).

      Only female lupus patients may participate in this study.
