  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenvatinib in
      patients with solid tumors or lymphomas.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study. Patients will be treated with
      lenvatinib once daily. Each four-week treatment period will be considered to be one treatment
      cycle. The selection of subsequent dose levels will be performed according to an accelerated
      design: Although initially 3 patients per dose level will be entered, the next dose level can
      be opened for patient accrual after only the first patient in the previous cohort completes
      Cycle 1 with no drug-related toxicity greater than grade 1 (except alopecia, lymphopenia and
      anemia).

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than one out of six participants experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was assessed during the first 4 weeks of therapy (Cycle 1) for dose escalation purposes. Participants enrolled into the MTD cohort were given the option to also participate in the food-effect pilot study. The food-effect pilot study was initiated once the MTD had been established.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>First date of study treatment to date of last dose of study treatment, up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the date the participant was withdrawn from the study. All AEs were graded on a 5-point scale according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) grading system, version 3.0. Safety was assessed using the occurrence of DLTs, AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, physical examination findings, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) readings. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered lenvatinib and did not necessarily have a causal relationship to lenvatinib. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which results in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or caused a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-related AEs and SAEs are AEs considered probably or possibly related to lenvatinib.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response (BOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to first date of documented CR, PR, SD, or PD, assessed up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>BOR was the best confirmed response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), or not evaluable (NE), recorded from the start of lenvatinib until disease progression/recurrence or death. CR; disappearance of all target lesions for at least 1 month. PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD; a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. SD; PR failed to be achieved in the overall response assessment and there was no PD observed at 7 weeks or later after starting lenvatinib.</description>

    <time_frame>Blood: Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 15, or Day 22, Cycle 2 Day 1 Tumor tissue: Screening and after at least one 28-day Cycle of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) immediately prior to the first dose and at 3 and 24 hours following the first dose of lenvatinib. The same collection schedule was repeated following the administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). For participants in the food-effect pilot study blood samples were collected pre-dose, plus 3 hour and 24 hours PD samples were collected on Day 15 or Day 22. These participants were not required to give PD samples on Cycle 2 Day 1. Tumor tissue samples were collected from participants with tumors accessible to biopsy (optional study). Tissue samples were formalin-fixed then paraffin embedded according to a standard protocol. Once preclinical studies have identified possible PD biomarkers for the biological effect of lenvatinib in vivo, the samples taken from participants in this study are planned to be analyzed. No data was provided at this time.</description>

          <title>0.2 mg Lenvatinib</title>
          <description>Two 0.1 mg lenvatinib tablets were taken orally, once daily. Lenvatinib was to be taken on an empty stomach shortly after waking. Participants were fasted for 2 hours following administration of lenvatinib and could drink only clear fluids during this time (grapefruit juice was to be avoided). If 1 of 3 participants experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1 (4 weeks) an additional 3 participants were to be treated at this dose level. If 5 of the 6 participants in the expanded dose level did not experience DLT during the first 4 weeks of therapy, no additional DLT was observed, the next dose level was opened for enrollment. If more than 1 participant experienced DLT during the first 4 weeks of therapy, dose escalation was stopped and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined. An additional 12 participants were treated at the MTD level.</description>

        <description>The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than one out of six participants experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT was assessed during the first 4 weeks of therapy (Cycle 1) for dose escalation purposes. Participants enrolled into the MTD cohort were given the option to also participate in the food-effect pilot study. The food-effect pilot study was initiated once the MTD had been established.</description>

Participants fasted for 2 hours following administration of lenvatinib and could drink only clear fluids during this period. Grapefruit juice was to be avoided during the study.
Participants in the food-effect pilot study: 25 mg lenvatinib was administered as described above except on Days 15 and 22 in Cycle 1. Participants in this pilot study were randomly assigned to receive lenvatinib under a fed state (following a high fat meal) or fasting state (overnight fast greater than or equal to 10 hours) on Day 15, then in the reverse/untried state on Day 22. For both cases, no food was allowed for 4 hour following administration of lenvatinib.</description>

        <title>Summary of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>AEs were collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the date the participant was withdrawn from the study. All AEs were graded on a 5-point scale according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) grading system, version 3.0. Safety was assessed using the occurrence of DLTs, AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, physical examination findings, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) readings. An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered lenvatinib and did not necessarily have a causal relationship to lenvatinib. An SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which results in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or caused a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-related AEs and SAEs are AEs considered probably or possibly related to lenvatinib.</description>

        <title>Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</title>
        <description>A DLT was defined as any grade 3 or higher hematological or non-hematological toxicity directly related to lenvatinib, any repeated National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) grade 2 hematological or non-hematological toxicity considered to be directly related to lenvatinib and required dose reduction, or failure to administer greater than or equal to 75% of the planned dosage of lenvatinib during Cycle 1 as a result of treatment-related failure.</description>
        <time_frame>Cycle 1 (4 weeks) of each dose level</time_frame>
        <population>Intention to Treat (ITT)/Safety population included all subjects who received at least one dose of lenvatinib.</population>

Participants were fasted for 2 hours following administration of lenvatinib and could drink only clear fluids during this time (grapefruit juice was to be avoided). If 1 of 3 participants experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1 (4 weeks) an additional 3 participants were to be treated at this dose level. If 5 of the 6 participants in the expanded dose level did not experience DLT during the first 4 weeks of therapy, no additional DLT was observed, the next dose level was opened for enrollment. If more than 1 participant experienced DLT during the first 4 weeks of therapy, dose escalation was stopped and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined. An additional 12 participants were treated at the MTD level.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response (BOR)</title>
        <description>BOR was the best confirmed response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), or not evaluable (NE), recorded from the start of lenvatinib until disease progression/recurrence or death. CR; disappearance of all target lesions for at least 1 month. PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD; a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. SD; PR failed to be achieved in the overall response assessment and there was no PD observed at 7 weeks or later after starting lenvatinib.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to first date of documented CR, PR, SD, or PD, assessed up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>

Participants were fasted for 2 hours following administration of lenvatinib and could drink only clear fluids during this time (grapefruit juice was to be avoided). If 1 of 3 participants experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1 (4 weeks) an additional 3 participants were to be treated at this dose level. If 5 of the 6 participants in the expanded dose level did not experience DLT during the first 4 weeks of therapy, no additional DLT was observed, the next dose level was opened for enrollment. If more than 1 participant experienced DLT during the first 4 weeks of therapy, dose escalation was stopped and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined. An additional 12 participants were treated at the MTD level.</description>

CR; disappearance of all target lesions for at least 1 month. PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD; a 20% or greater increase in the sum of the longest diameter of measured lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. SD; PR failed to be achieved in the overall response assessment and there was no PD observed at 7 weeks or later after starting lenvatinib.</description>

        <title>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Lenvatinib</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib. For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of Cmax, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed as nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

          <description>Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib. For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. Plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of Cmax, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed as nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

        <title>Apparent Plasma Half-life (t1/2) of Lenvatinib</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib. For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. The apparent plasma half-life was calculated as t1/2 = 0.693/λz where the apparent first order elimination rate constant (λz) was determined by the slope of the terminal log-linear phase of the plasma concentration-time curve. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of t1/2, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in hours.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC(0-inf))</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib. For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) was calculated as AUC(0-t) + Ct / λz where Ct is the last measurable concentration. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of AUC(0-inf), which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in nanograms*hours/milliliter (ng*hr/mL).</description>

          <description>Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib. For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours, was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of AUC(0-24), which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in ng*hr/mL.</description>

For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. CL/F is the clearance for parent lenvatinib only and was calculated as Dose/[AUC0-inf]. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of CL/F, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in liters/hour (L/hr).</description>

        <description>Urine aliquots were collected at 0 to 8, 8 to 16, and 16 to 24 hour intervals after administration of lenvatinib on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, and then analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib using approved standardized methods. The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the urine using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. Urine PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of fe, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in percentage of lenvatinib.</description>

        <title>Renal Clearance (CLr) of Lenvatinib</title>
        <description>Blood samples were drawn immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib. For participants who were not enrolled in the food-effect part of the study, the collection of blood samples was repeated following administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. Renal clearance was calculated as: Ae(0-24)/AUC(0-24) where Ae(0-24) is amount of unchanged lenvatinib recovered in 24 hours. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of CLr, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in liters/hour (L/hr).</description>

        <title>Effect of Food on the Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Lenvatinib</title>
        <description>Blood samples for PK analysis were collected at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib and 24 hours after the first dose of lenvatinib on Day 15 and Day 22 of Cycle 1. Blood samples were not collected on Day 29, except for the pre-dose sample. The samples were analyzed for the amount of lenvatinib in the plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method of analysis. Plasma PK data were analyzed using a noncompartmental analysis approach to obtain individual participant estimates of Cmax, which was then summarized as the mean and standard deviation for all participants and expressed in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

        <title>Pharmacodynamic (PD) Biomarkers of Lenvatinib in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and Tumor Samples</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for isolation of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) immediately prior to the first dose and at 3 and 24 hours following the first dose of lenvatinib. The same collection schedule was repeated following the administration of lenvatinib on Day 29 (Cycle 2 Day 1). For participants in the food-effect pilot study blood samples were collected pre-dose, plus 3 hour and 24 hours PD samples were collected on Day 15 or Day 22. These participants were not required to give PD samples on Cycle 2 Day 1. Tumor tissue samples were collected from participants with tumors accessible to biopsy (optional study). Tissue samples were formalin-fixed then paraffin embedded according to a standard protocol. Once preclinical studies have identified possible PD biomarkers for the biological effect of lenvatinib in vivo, the samples taken from participants in this study are planned to be analyzed. No data was provided at this time.</description>
