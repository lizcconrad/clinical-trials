      A multicentre study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of
      nanofiltered Cetor® (called C1-esteraseremmer-N during the development phase) for the
      treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) will be performed. This study (KB2003.01) consists
      of three parts: Part A - pharmacokinetics (phase II); Part B - treatment of attacks of
      angioedema (phase III); and Part C - prophylactic use of C1 inhibitor (phase III). Parts B +
      C will provide data on the efficacy of C1-esteraseremmer-N.

      The changes within the manufacturing process of C1-esteraseremmer-N, compared to Cetor®
      nanofiltration and omission of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, most likely will not affect
      tolerability. The nanofiltration will provide more safety regarding viruses.

      In Part B of the study, 15 attacks of hereditary angioedema will be treated with open-label
      C1-esteraseremmer-N. Attack severity and duration will be monitored by the subjective
      experience of the patient himself (which has been shown to be the most sensitive way of
      monitoring attack severity) and compared with historical (and literature) data. If possible,
      some attacks of acquired angioedema will also be included.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria for HAE type I and type II patients:

          -  Established diagnosis of hereditary angioedema (type I or II): markedly decreased C1
             inhibitor activity; decreased (type I), normal or elevated (type II) level of C1
             inhibitor antigen; decreased level of C4.

          -  Age ≥ 16 years

          -  Evidence of a peripheral, abdominal, facial, laryngeal or genitourinary attack of
             angioedema of moderate to severe intensity, starting less then 5 hours before
             infusion. An attack is defined as moderate if it affects the normal daily activities
             of the patient in any way. Severe attacks are defined by the inability to perform
             normal daily activities.

          -  Signed informed consent by patient and patient's legal representative if under 18
             years old

        Inclusion criteria for acquired angioedema patients:

          -  Established diagnosis of acquired angioedema: recurrent attacks of angioedema without
             urticaria; no family history; decreased functional C1 inhibitor; decreased level of
             C4.

          -  Autoantibodies to C1 inhibitor or decreased C1q or onset after the third decade of
             life.

          -  Age ≥ 16 years

          -  Evidence of a peripheral, abdominal, facial, laryngeal or genitourinary attack of
             angioedema of moderate to severe intensity, starting less then 5 hours before
