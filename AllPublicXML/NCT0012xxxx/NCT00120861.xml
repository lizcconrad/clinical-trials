  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the safety, effectiveness and tolerance of
      valopicitabine (NM283) when used alone and when valopicitabine is used together with
      pegylated interferon in hepatitis C treatment failure patients. These results will be
      compared against the results of treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, the
      current standard therapy for treatment of hepatitis C viral infection.
