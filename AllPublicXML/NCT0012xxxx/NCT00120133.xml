  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed randomized double blind cross-over placebo controlled study, the researchers
      intend to investigate if Atorvastatin (FDA approved statin for children) can be used to
      alleviate the symptom of bone pain (acute phase reaction) that is commonly associated with
      initial doses of pamidronate or zoledronic acid, and also the mechanism that underlies this
      proposed beneficial effect of Atorvastatin. The primary outcome studied will be alleviation
      of bone pain by Atorvastatin compared to placebo by visual analogue pain scale in children
      treated with pamidronate or zoledronic acid. The secondary outcome investigated will be
      changes in blood count and γδT cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokine levels of
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and gamma interferon (γ-IFN)
      following treatment with Atorvastatin compared to placebo.

      The proposed study is a double blind cross-over placebo controlled randomized clinical study
      that would be conducted in the Metabolic Bone Clinic of The Children's Mercy Hospital. This
      is a pilot study and a more comprehensive study will be designed only if the results from
      this pilot study are significant. In our proposed double blind cross-over placebo controlled
      pilot study we will have a total of 12 children who will receive either placebo or
      Atorvastatin in a randomized cross-over design. The pilot study with a sample of 12 in a
      cross-over trial will provide reasonably stable estimates even though it is unlikely to
      provide statistical significance on its own but will help plan further large scale studies.
