      The purpose of this study is to test whether perioperative estrogen replacement in
      postmenopausal women reduces the risk for neurologic injury after coronary artery bypass
      graft (CABG) surgery.

      BACKGROUND:

      Women undergoing CABG surgery have a higher operative mortality rate, longer
      hospitalizations, and higher hospital costs compared with men. A large proportion of this
      excess morbidity and mortality of surgery for women is due to perioperative neurologic
      injury. Estrogen has been consistently shown to reduce the extent of neurologic injury in a
      variety of in vitro and animal experimental stroke models. These data together strongly
      suggest that the higher risk for perioperative neurologic complications for elderly women may
      relate to their estrogen deficient state.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This randomized, placebo controlled study will test the hypothesis that perioperative
      estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women reduces the risk for neurologic injury after
      CABG surgery. Three hundred thirty-four women undergoing CABG surgery will be prospectively
      randomized to receive either 17 beta-estradiol or placebo in a double-blind fashion beginning
      the day before surgery and continuing for 5 days after surgery. Patients will be assessed for
      neurocognitive dysfunction, which is the most common manifestation of neurologic injury from
      cardiac surgery. Neurocognitive testing will be performed 1 to 2 days before surgery, 4 to 6
      weeks postoperatively, and 6 months after surgery. The primary endpoint will be
      neurocognitive function 4 to 6 weeks after surgery for women who received 17 beta- estradiol
      compared with placebo perioperatively. The trial will also evaluate the importance of
      postoperative cognitive decline on measures of cognitive function and quality of life 6
      months after surgery, and whether perioperative 17 beta-estradiol treatment improves these
      outcomes.
