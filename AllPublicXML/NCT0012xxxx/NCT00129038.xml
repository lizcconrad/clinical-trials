  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess whether adding modified-release dipyridamole
      to aspirin (Asasantin Retard) has measurable effects on markers of platelet function (for
      example, platelet aggregation) in patients with cardiovascular disease who are known to be
      resistant to aspirin alone
