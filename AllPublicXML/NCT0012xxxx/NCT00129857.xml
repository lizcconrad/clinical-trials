  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year a large number of patients are hospitalized at Shock Trauma Centers with severe
      head injuries. Bleeding into and swelling of these patients' brains may cause compression of
      vital structures, disability and death. Sometimes surgery is needed. Unfortunately, the
      investigators have no medication to treat the bad effects of head trauma. Part of the brain
      damage is due to toxic chemicals (including one called glutamate) that are released by the
      damaged nerves. Dexanabinol may prevent some of the bad effects of glutamate on the brain and
      may protect the brain against uncontrollable swelling and death.

    <textblock>
      Dexanabinol is a synthetic, non-psychotropic cannabinoid derivative that because of its
      dextro-configuration is compatible with activation of cannabinoid receptors in the brain. It
      combines the ability to block NMDA receptors and neuroinflammatory cascades in the same
      molecule. Dexanabinol scavenges free radicals, protects neurons from toxicity of free radical
      generators and inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced production of prostaglandin E2, NO and
      TNF-a by macrophages in culture.
