    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-blinded randomized phase III trial. Patients will be
      post-surgically stratified at inclusion first according to the participating institution,
      then according to menopausal status and will be randomly assigned to receive either:

        -  TAC: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks
           (q3w) in combination with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500
           mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.

        -  FAC: 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks in combination
           with doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 as an i.v. bolus and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 as an i.v.
           bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks.

      Primary objective:

        -  To compare disease-free survival (DFS) after treatment with docetaxel in combination
           with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) to 5-Fluorouracil in combination with
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (FAC) as adjuvant treatment of high risk operable
           breast cancer patients with negative axillary lymph nodes.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare overall survival (OS) between the 2 above mentioned arms.

        -  To compare toxicity and quality of life between the 2 above mentioned arms.

        -  To evaluate pathologic markers for predicting efficacy (hormonal receptors and c-erB-2).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Operable breast cancer patients (T1-T3) with negative axillary lymph nodes (10
             axillary nodes dissection) and high risk criteria according to St. Gallen consensus
             criteria.

          -  Histologically proven breast cancer. Interval between surgery and registration is less
             than 60 days.

          -  Definitive surgical treatment must be either mastectomy, or breast conservative
             surgery. Margins of resected specimen from surgery must be histologically free of
             invasive adenocarcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Lobular carcinoma in-situ
             is not considered as positive margin.

          -  Patients without proven metastatic disease.

          -  Estrogen and progesterone receptors performed on the primary tumour prior to
             randomization.

          -  Age between 18 years and 70 years.

          -  Karnofsky performance status index &gt; 80 %.

          -  Adequate hepatic, renal and heart functions.

          -  Adequate hematology levels.

          -  Negative pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:
