      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of cladribine, high-dose
      cytarabine and idarubicin in the treatment of patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considerable progress has been made in the induction therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML);
      however, current therapeutic results are still unsatisfactory in those with relapsed disease.
      The purine nucleoside analogue cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA) has been shown to
      be a safe and active agent in acute myeloid leukemia. Synergistic interaction between
      cladribine and cytarabine has been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies.

      The current multicenter phase II study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
      cladribine, high-dose cytarabine, and idarubicin in the treatment of patients with relapsed
      AML. Adult patients of all age groups can be enrolled in the trial, but elderly patients will
      be treated with a less dose-intensive regimen.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with relapsed AML with a remission duration of at least 6 months after first
             complete remission (CR) or of at least 3 months after second (or higher) CR

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

          -  Life expectancy of at least three months (without consideration of AML and
             complications)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-2 (without consideration of AML and
             complications)

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy of AML with cladribine

             AML)

          -  Other severe organ impairment grade III or IV World Health Organization (WHO) (if not
             due to AML or, in the opinion of the investigator, may not interfere with the
             procedures in the study)
