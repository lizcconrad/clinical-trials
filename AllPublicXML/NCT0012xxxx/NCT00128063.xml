  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of Suc-HSA
      after consecutive daily intravenous (i.v.) doses. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability and the antiretroviral and immunological effects of consecutive
      daily i.v. doses of Suc-HSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single arm study. Subjects will receive 5 consecutive daily doses of
      Suc-HSA at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the Special Investigation Unit
      (SIU), with a safety follow up on the SIU for 4 hours on day 1 and 2 hours on the next days.
      There will be follow-up visits on week 1, 2, 4 and 12. Standard safety parameters (physical
      examination, clinical symptoms, laboratory hematology and biochemistry) will be followed
      until week 12. Plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+/CD8+ cell counts will be assessed at every visit.
      Plasma drug levels (trough and peak) will be measured from baseline until week 2.

      6 patients will be included in this study as described in this protocol amendment.

      Eligible subjects are chronic HIV-1 infected patients who have never been treated with
      antiretroviral treatment and for whom there is no need to start antiretroviral treatment.

      Test Product: Suc-HSA, a candidate HIV-1 fusion inhibitor.

      Duration of treatment: 5 days

      Criteria for evaluation:

        -  Safety: symptoms, signs at physical examination, standard hematology and chemistry
           laboratory parameters- Efficacy: changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T cell count

        -  Pharmacokinetics: plasma levels of Suc-HSA: Cmin, Cmax and AUC
