  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigational study to determine the response rate of relapsed/refractory
      breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer to oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
      (SAHA), to evaluate PET as an earlier indicator of response to SAHA as assessed by response
      evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria and to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid.
