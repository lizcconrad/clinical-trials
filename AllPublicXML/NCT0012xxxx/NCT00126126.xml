      The purpose of this study is to determine if an evidence based exercise intervention improves
      the functional mobility of diabetic amputees (single lower leg amputation) who have already
      completed standard rehabilitation and prosthetic training.

      Subjects who pass all eligibility requirements will then undergo baseline testing by an
      examiner who will remain blinded to subject group assignment. Baseline testing will include
      the AAS, six-minute walk test, and both the AMPPro and AMPnoPro.

      After baseline testing has been completed, subjects will be randomly assigned to either the
      intervention or wait list control. Randomization will occur in blocks of 20 such that for
      each panel of 20 subjects, 50% will be randomized to the intervention and 50% will be
      randomized to wait list control. Randomization will be performed using a random-number table
      to assign treatment group to status to each subject's unique identification number.
      Randomization status will be concealed by recording status on a card that is folded in half
      so that the group assignment is inside the fold. The cards will be placed in envelopes
      bearing identification numbers. When a subject has completed all baseline measures, the
      envelope with that subject's ID number will be opened and the subject will be assigned to a
      group.

      Subjects assigned to the intervention group will undergo clinical strength testing. An
      individualized program will be developed for each subject based on his or her AMP test
      results and clinical strength testing. Subjects will then attend rehabilitation sessions 3
      times per week for 8 weeks. Each session will last approximately 45 minutes including any
      required rest periods. Subjects will perform endurance, balance and strengthening exercises
      at each session. Every 6th session, subjects in the intervention group will perform a
      six-minute walk test, AMPPro and complete the AAS questionnaire. The results of each AMPPro
      test will be reviewed and the therapeutic exercise program revised according.

      After follow-up testing, subjects assigned to the wait list condition will be eligible to
      attend the 8-week rehabilitation program. Wait list subjects in the exercise phase will also
      receive the same exercise intervention described above. They will also perform a six-minute
      walk test, AMPPro and complete the AAS questionnaire every 6th session.

    <description>The Amputee Mobility Predictor is a reliable and valid performance-based outcome measure of prosthetic mobility. The AMP is scored from 0-47, higher scores indicating greater prosthetic mobility. The AMP can help clinicians differentiate between different functional K-levels based on as defined by the Medicare Functional Classification Level (MFCL) system. Lower limb amputees functioning at the K2 level score between 27-36 on the AMP and are classified as limited community ambulators. Those at the K3 level score between 37-42 and are typical community ambulators who have the ability to traverse environmental barriers and performing activities that are beyond simple locomotion. Individuals at the K4 level score between 43-47 which is typical of prosthetic demands of an active adult or regular athlete. The minimal detectable change for the AMP is 3.4 points.</description>

    <measure>Six-minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks for intervention and wait list control group</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a measure of overall functional mobility, and cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal endurance. It assesses the distance ambulated in 6 minutes. The 6MWT has excellent reliability for lower limb amputees and can differentiate between amputee Medicare Functional Classification Levels (MFCL).Lower limb amputees functioning at the K2 level ambulate a mean distance of 200 meters. Those at the K3 level ambulate a mean distance of 300 meters. Those at the K4 level ambulate a mean distance of 400 meters. Service Members with traumatic lower limb loss ambulate a distance of 600 meters. The minimal detectable change for the 6MWT is 45 meters.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  People with unilateral transtibial amputations (TTA)

          -  At the lowest level of function candidates will have the ability or potential to use a
             prosthesis for transfers or ambulation on level surfaces at a fixed cadence. Typical
             of the limited and unlimited household ambulator, the majority of candidates' ability
             or potential for ambulation with the ability to transverse low-level environmental
             barriers such as curbs, stairs, or uneven surfaces (the ceiling for candidacy) will be
             those TTAs who have the ability to vary cadence and can ambulate within the community.

          -  People with a diagnosis of diabetic mellitus and/or peripheral vascular disease
             leading to amputation

          -  Persons comfortably fitted with a prosthesis for a period of at least 6 months

          -  Candidates who have completed the &quot;standard&quot; course of rehabilitation and prosthetic
             training

          -  Candidates who score in the range of 10 to 36 on the Amputee Mobility Predictor which
             would indicate that subjects achieved the minimum required score to be fitted with a
             prosthesis but they did not attain a score that is considered to be at the highest
             level of functioning where additional therapy would not be of significant benefit.

          -  Able to tolerate a moderate intensity exercise program

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons receiving renal dialysis

          -  Persons with severe cardiac or pulmonary disease limiting ability to exercise
             including angina or poorly controlled hypertension.

          -  Persons with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease or stroke that affect
             ability to ambulate

          -  Persons with severe lower extremity arthritis

          -  Persons with wound on non-amputated side

          -  Persons experiencing problems with prosthetic fit

          -  Persons with poor control of diabetes

        <title>Amputee Mobility Predictor</title>
        <description>The Amputee Mobility Predictor is a reliable and valid performance-based outcome measure of prosthetic mobility. The AMP is scored from 0-47, higher scores indicating greater prosthetic mobility. The AMP can help clinicians differentiate between different functional K-levels based on as defined by the Medicare Functional Classification Level (MFCL) system. Lower limb amputees functioning at the K2 level score between 27-36 on the AMP and are classified as limited community ambulators. Those at the K3 level score between 37-42 and are typical community ambulators who have the ability to traverse environmental barriers and performing activities that are beyond simple locomotion. Individuals at the K4 level score between 43-47 which is typical of prosthetic demands of an active adult or regular athlete. The minimal detectable change for the AMP is 3.4 points.</description>

        <title>Six-minute Walk Test</title>
        <description>The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a measure of overall functional mobility, and cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal endurance. It assesses the distance ambulated in 6 minutes. The 6MWT has excellent reliability for lower limb amputees and can differentiate between amputee Medicare Functional Classification Levels (MFCL).Lower limb amputees functioning at the K2 level ambulate a mean distance of 200 meters. Those at the K3 level ambulate a mean distance of 300 meters. Those at the K4 level ambulate a mean distance of 400 meters. Service Members with traumatic lower limb loss ambulate a distance of 600 meters. The minimal detectable change for the 6MWT is 45 meters.</description>
