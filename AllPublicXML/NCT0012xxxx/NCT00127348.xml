  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of CPAP over the incidence of
      cardiovascular events and diagnosis of arterial hypertension in patients with sleep apnea.

      The hypothesis of the study is the following: The existence of sleep disordered breathing in
      the general population is associated to an increased incidence of arterial hypertension and
      to an increased risk of suffering cardiovascular disease. CPAP corrects respiratory disorders
      during sleep. Treatment with CPAP in subjects with sleep disordered breathing without daytime
      sleepiness reduces the incidence of systemic arterial hypertension and cardiovascular
      complications.

      The end points of the study are new diagnosis of arterial hypertension and new cardiovascular
      events.

      All patients, after randomization, will be followed for three years.
