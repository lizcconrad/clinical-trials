      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with advanced cancers who receive
      AVR118 solution for injection into the skin can achieve improvement in quality of life. Based
      on a study in patients with AIDS, possible benefits may include improved appetite and
      strength; weight gain; improved mood; and decreased fatigue. For the first three weeks, some
      patients receive AVR118, and others receive placebo (an injection expected to have no
      benefits). After three weeks, all patients will be offered the opportunity to take injections
      of AVR118.

      Advanced cancers are usually debilitating. There are few treatments available for symptoms of
      advanced cancers like loss of appetite, decreased strength, fatigue, and change in mood. A
      Phase II, double blind study comparing treatment with AVR118 to placebo, followed by an open
      label phase treating all patients with AVR118, will enable the Sponsor to gather data on
      safety and efficacy of AVR118 in this patient population. Patients aged 18-80 with advanced
      cancers (excluding central nervous system [CNS] cancers) who are not receiving chemotherapy,
      or who are receiving single agent, third line (or beyond) chemotherapy, may be eligible to
      participate.
