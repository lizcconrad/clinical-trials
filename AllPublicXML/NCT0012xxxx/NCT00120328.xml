      The purpose of this study is to determine whether avosentan (SPP301) is effective in
      decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the
      western world, accounting for approximately 40% of new cases in the US, and up to 20 to 30%
      in Europe.

      Current treatments for diabetic nephropathy usually try to deal with the underlying diabetes
      or they aim to reduce cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperglycemia,
      smoking and dyslipidemia. A few recently approved drugs such as irbesartan and losartan (for
      type 2 diabetic nephropathy) have a renoprotective activity beyond their antihypertensive
      effect. However, morbidity and mortality rates remain high.

      Avosentan may have a positive effect on reducing the amount of protein lost in the urine and
      if this is the case it will help treat patients with diabetic nephropathy.

                  potential (defined as those who are not surgically sterile, have not had a
                  hysterectomy or are not 2 years' post-menopausal) must have a negative pregnancy
