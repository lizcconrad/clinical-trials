  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a comprehensive, individualized management
      approach with caregiver training and medication with memantine will alleviate symptoms in
      community dwelling patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently some 4.5 million people are afflicted with Alzheimer's disease in the United
      States. At present pharmacologic treatment, although beneficial, is not curative. Certain
      nonpharmacologic treatments have assisted caregivers of AD patients by reducing their stress
      and burden, and others have aided patients, by improving their mood and physical functioning.
      Comprehensive, individualized approaches to improving Alzheimer's patients' symptomatology
      and caregiver stress and burden have not been systematically investigated in Alzheimer's
      patient care. This study seeks to train and counsel caregivers as well as develop an
      individualized, comprehensive management program that will seek to enhance the functioning of
      each patient participant.

      Patients are randomly placed into one of two groups. Both groups receive memantine and
      comprehensive evaluations at baseline, 4, 12,28 and 52 weeks. Additionally, group 1 receives
      an individualized management program, which consists of home visits to get the patient
      exercising, doing enjoyable activities and cognitive stimulation, educational sessions for
      caregivers on coping with difficult situations and a caregiver support group to help with
      questions and emotional concerns.

    <measure>Change From Baseline of the Functional Assessment Staging Disability Score (FAST-DS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FAST-DS assesses the magnitude of progressive functional deterioration by identifying characteristic progressive disabilities in participants with AD. Scores range from 1.0 (normal) to 7f (severe loss of ability, not even able to hold up head independently). Scores are made up of stages (1 through 7) and substages (from a to e for stage 6; from a to f for stage 7). The following scoring for substages is applied: 6a=6.0, 6b=6.2, 6c=6.4, 6d=6.6, 6e=6.8, 7a=7.0, 7b=7.2, 7c=7.4, 7d=7.6, 7e=7.8, 7f=8.0. Additionally, non-consecutive deficits are noted and scored as follows: full stage non-consecutive deficit=1.0, non-consecutive substage deficit=0.2.
The overall FAST-DS score = (FAST Stage Score) + (Each Non-Consecutive FAST disability scored as described)</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BEHAVE-AD-FW measures the frequency and severity of 25 behavioral symptoms with a total score and global rating. Individual behavioral assessments are rated for severity (0=none to 3-most severe) and frequency (1=least frequent to 4=most frequent) which are then multiplied; scores for each of the 25 items are then summed. Possible total scores range from 0 to 297. The global rating is scored from 0 (not dangerous to patient, not troubling to caregiver) to 3 (dangerous to patient, highly troubling to caregiver). Global rating was not analyzed for this study. The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to 28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The RMBPC is a 24 item rating scale of the frequency of memory and behavioral problems in the AD subject and of how upset or &quot;bothered&quot; their caregivers react. Frequency is rated from 0 (least frequent) to 4 (most frequent) and caregiver reaction is rated from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely bothered or upset). Higher scores indicate more frequent memory and behavioral problems in the subject with AD as well as a more upset or bothered caregiver. Possible scores range from 0 to 96.</description>

        <description>The FAST-DS assesses the magnitude of progressive functional deterioration by identifying characteristic progressive disabilities in participants with AD. Scores range from 1.0 (normal) to 7f (severe loss of ability, not even able to hold up head independently). Scores are made up of stages (1 through 7) and substages (from a to e for stage 6; from a to f for stage 7). The following scoring for substages is applied: 6a=6.0, 6b=6.2, 6c=6.4, 6d=6.6, 6e=6.8, 7a=7.0, 7b=7.2, 7c=7.4, 7d=7.6, 7e=7.8, 7f=8.0. Additionally, non-consecutive deficits are noted and scored as follows: full stage non-consecutive deficit=1.0, non-consecutive substage deficit=0.2.
The overall FAST-DS score = (FAST Stage Score) + (Each Non-Consecutive FAST disability scored as described)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of The Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Frequency Weighted Severity Scale (BEHAVE-AD-FW)</title>
        <description>The BEHAVE-AD-FW measures the frequency and severity of 25 behavioral symptoms with a total score and global rating. Individual behavioral assessments are rated for severity (0=none to 3-most severe) and frequency (1=least frequent to 4=most frequent) which are then multiplied; scores for each of the 25 items are then summed. Possible total scores range from 0 to 297. The global rating is scored from 0 (not dangerous to patient, not troubling to caregiver) to 3 (dangerous to patient, highly troubling to caregiver). The higher the score the worse the outcome.</description>
