    <textblock>
      This study examines surgery versus radiosurgery (highly focussed radiation) for the treatment
      of cancer which has spread to one spot in the brain (solitary brain &quot;metastasis&quot;). For these
      two treatment options, it will compare patients' survival times, quality of life, control
      rate of the brain metastases and side effects. It uses the most rigorous scientific method
      available called &quot;randomisation&quot; which minimises biases that exist with other types of
      studies. It will involve 30 - 40 patients.

      Primary objectives - to evaluate for solitary brain metastases whether both overall survival
      and health related quality of life (HQoL) in patients treated with radiosurgery (RS) plus
      whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) are non-inferior to those of patients treated with surgery
      (S) plus WBRT.

      Secondary objectives - to compare between the two treatment arms time to local and distant
      brain recurrence, failure free survival, acute and late toxicity.

      Hypothesis - Patients treated with RS + WBRT have neither worse survival nor worse quality of
      life than those treated with S + WBRT.

      Research plan:

        -  Trial design - Single-centre prospective randomised Phase III controlled two arm
           non-inferiority study with the &quot;gold standard&quot; of surgery (plus WBRT) as the control
           arm. Blinding to trial arm will not be feasible. Stratification is by Radiation Therapy
           Oncology Group Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RPA) prognostic Class 1 vs 2 vs 3.

        -  Main eligibility criteria - single presumed metastasis on MRI brain; systemic cancer
           diagnosed within the last 5 years; considered suitable for both S and RS; written
           informed consent.

        -  Main exclusion criteria - surgery indicated for life-threatening raised intra-cranial
           pressure or tissue diagnosis; surgery contra-indicated by site or medical
           co-morbidities; leptomeningeal disease; primary is small cell lung cancer, germ cell
           tumour, lymphoma, leukaemia or myeloma.

        -  Radiation - WBRT dose is 30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. RS dose is based on lesion
           size up to 4 cm (15-20 Gy).

        -  Surgery - Aim is complete excision.

        -  Treatment sequence and patient assessments - Any sequencing of S/RS and WBRT is
           allowable, as long as the brain treatment is commenced within 2 weeks after, and
           completed within 6Â½ weeks after the diagnostic MRI brain. Assessments at baseline,
           during brain treatment, at 2 and 3 months after commencement, then 3 monthly, with MRI
           brain at 3 and 6 months, and/or as clinically indicated. Acute toxicity monitored by NCI
           Common Toxicity Criteria, late toxicity by RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scheme.
           HQoL assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BN20.

        -  Sample size - 30-40 patients over 5 years.

      Outcomes and Significance:

      The trial will enable Level I evidence to be applied to this common clinical problem.
      Patients will be able to make an informed choice based upon valid survival, quality of life
      and toxicity comparisons.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Single presumed brain metastasis on contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
             within two weeks before commencement of treatment.

          -  Systemic cancer diagnosed histologically or cytologically synchronous with, or within
             5 years of treatment of the presumed brain metastasis (other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer and cancer in-situ of the cervix, neither of which would be reasonably
             attributable as the primary site). Exception - melanoma diagnosed &gt; 5 years previously
             is allowable in view of the extremely variable natural history of melanoma.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 (no upper age limit).

          -  Considered suitable for both S and RS by the neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist
             (see exclusions).

          -  Patient must agree to adjuvant WBRT.

          -  RTOG RPA Class 1 or 2 (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] &gt;= 70 after adequate trial
             of corticosteroids).

          -  RPA Class 3 patients (KPS &lt; 70) eligible if it is considered that the poor performance
             status is due primarily to the solitary metastasis, aggressive local treatment of
             which may be expected to restore good performance status. This would ordinarily be
             associated with minimal systemic disease burden.

          -  Accessible for treatment and follow-up.

          -  Patient is infertile or is aware of the risk of becoming pregnant or fathering
             children and will use adequate contraception.

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous history of brain metastasis(es)

          -  Surgery indicated to relieve life-threatening raised intracranial pressure or excision
             required for tissue diagnosis (no extra-cranial site to biopsy ie unknown primary).
             However, prior diagnostic (non-excisional) biopsy is allowable - it is acknowledged
             that the 50% probability of a repeat surgical procedure on subsequent randomisation
             would not be acceptable to many patients and clinicians.

          -  Surgery contraindicated by site (e.g. thalamus, brain stem) or medical co-morbidities.

          -  Leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Primary is small cell lung cancer, germ cell tumour, lymphoma, leukaemia or myeloma.

          -  Prior cranial RT (including RS).

          -  Patient is pregnant.
