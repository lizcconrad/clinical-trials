      This study will classify types of hypertonia in patients with cerebral palsy and determine if
      the classifications are reasonable in relation to the functional task of walking. Hypertonia
      is an abnormal increase in muscle tension. It is a common symptom of cerebral palsy that can
      lead to loss of function and deformity. This study may help scientists improve evaluation
      criteria for hypertonia and, ultimately, treatment results.

      Patients with cerebral palsy who are older than 6 years of age may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and clinical evaluation.

      Participants are asked to walk in the lab while cameras record their movement. During this
      test, subjects wear a t-shirt and shorts with their arms and legs wrapped with a soft,
      rubber-like material. A piece of firm material is attached to the rubber sleeves and small
      plastic reflective balls are attached to the firm material. Balls may also be attached to the
      skin, using an adhesive. With the balls in place, the subject walks several times while
      cameras record the positions of the balls. In addition, small metal electrodes attached to
      the skin with an adhesive measure the electrical activity in the muscles.

      After the walking test is completed, subjects' leg muscle strength is measured with a special
      device while they perform three activities. First, they sit on a special chair with their leg
      and foot placed in an apparatus that measures their strength, then lie on their back, then on
      their stomach, and then stand on one foot holding a bar to balance during part of one
      activity. During the activities, their reflexes are tested, they are asked to move their
      legs, and their legs are moved for them.

      Cerebral palsy (CP) affects 0.25% of newborn babies in the U.S. alone each year. Hypertonia
      (increased joint resistance to externally imposed motion) is a common symptom that limits
      function in this patient population. It may originate in spasticity, dystonia or rigidity or
      may be a combination of all these factors. Surgical, rehabilitation and pharmacotherapeutic
      methods are used to improve functional outcome in patients with cerebral palsy. These
      treatments are not always effective, and the amount of improvement is difficult to predict.
      The choice of treatment is based on clinical tests that are not objective, especially in
      children, and they do not allow for differentiation between various causes of increased joint
      resistance. As a result, ineffective treatments are offered to patients with different types
      of movement disorders. The complex torque devices used in research facilities to quantify the
      resistance of a joint cannot be easily applied in clinical settings. In previous studies, a
      portable measurement method was developed based on a hand-held force transducer, which
      allowed for the quantification of biomechanical and bioelectrical characteristics of
      resistance of a knee joint at different velocities. Using this method, we found different
      types of hypertonia that had not been previously reported in patients with cerebral palsy. It
      is not clear to what degree hypertonia restricts an ability to execute selected functional
      tasks, due in part to the considerable variability in patients with CP. If this variability
      could be decreased, the relationship between restricted ability and the different types of
      hypertonia would be easier to determine. Strong arguments exist to consider different
      pathophysiologies in these different types of hypertonia.

      The aim of this non-invasive study is to sub-classify patients with CP based on the type of
      knee hypertonia, and to determine if the classification is valid during the functional tasks
      of walking. When validated, it can serve as a predictive model for the relationship between
      the clinical evaluation at bedside and functional outcome.

      To classify hypertonia, the resistance of a knee joint at different velocities in knee
      flexion and extension and the maximum activation of stretched and shortened muscles are
      measured with a hand-held force transducer, an electrogoniometer, and surface electrodes in
      100 patients with CP. The strength of velocity-dependent hypertonia during passive stretch
      and position, and/or velocity thresholds will be calculated. The knee extension and flexion
      muscles will be classified bilaterally as normal, or as one of the four types based on the
      pattern of activation of stretched muscles. To determine the impact of other impairments on
      the function, the maximum isometric knee flexion and extension strength and the monosynaptic
      reflexes of the rectus femoris muscle will be measured.

      At the functional level, we will evaluate knee motion during walking. To determine the impact
      of hypertonia on function, the Spearman R correlation will be used to analyze data in
      patients within the same class. To determine if the classification holds during walking, the
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be calculated. The significance of differences will be
      tested at the level of significance alpha less than or equal to 0.05.

      It is expected that as a result of this study, better criteria for classifying patients into
      predictable categories correlated to specific therapeutic responses will be established. In
      the future, the improvement of differential diagnoses with quantitative methods will increase
      the effectiveness of treatment by customizing the needs of each patient.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        This study will include children and adult patients with cerebral palsy, patients with
        dystonia, and able-bodied children older than 6 years of age. Each patient must meet the
        following criteria:

        The patient must have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy or dystonia

        The patient must be able to follow the instructions to successfully complete the testing

        The patient must be properly motivated and willing to do the tasks.

        The patient must be older than 6 years

        The patient must score a 2 or 3 on the walking subsection of the Gross Motor Function
        Classification System (GMFCS).

        The patient must cease taking medications known to affect spasticity at least 48 hours
        before the first investigation; however, if any antispasticity medication is longstanding
        and stable it should be maintained during the entire study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inability of the patient to follow the instructions to accomplish the task.

        Structural deformities at the level of a knee joint.

        If patients are unable to complete all the tasks or conditions they can still be enrolled
        to complete part of the study.
