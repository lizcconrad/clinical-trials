    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of L-glutamine as a therapy for
      sickle cell anemia and sickle ß0-thalassemia. as evaluated by the number of occurrences of
      sickle cell crises.

      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral L-glutamine in the
      therapy of sickle cell anemia and sickle ß0-thalassemia.

      The secondary purpose is to assess the effect of L-glutamine on pain; energy and appetite
      levels; narcotics usage; height and weight; and hospital and emergency room visits for sickle
      cell pain.

      Methodology:

      By site, patients will be randomized to L-glutamine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio after a 4-week
      screening period. Patients will undergo 48 weeks of treatment with dosing BID orally, with
      dose calculated according to patient weight. Patient visits will occur every 4 weeks. After
      48 weeks of treatment, dose will be tapered to zero within 3 weeks. A final evaluation visit
      will occur 2 weeks after last dose.
