      Although lifelong continuous therapy with HAART remains the standard of care of HIV
      infection, allowing to achieve undetectable plasma viral RNA, restore CD4 cell count and
      provide substantial decline in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, long-term toxicity
      associated with antiretroviral therapy is a real concern. The purpose of this study is to
      compare an intermittent therapy strategy to a continuous treatment in patients with chronic
      and well controlled HIV-1 infection.

      Although lifelong continuous therapy with HAART remains the standard of care of HIV
      infection, allowing to achieve undetectable plasma viral RNA, restore CD4 cell count and
      provide substantial decline in HIV-related morbidity and mortality, long-term toxicity
      associated with antiretroviral therapy is a real concern.

      The purpose of this study is to compare an intermittent therapy (IT) strategy (8 weeks off /
      8 weeks on) to a continuous treatment (CT) in patients with chronic and well controlled HIV-1
      infection (CD4 over 450/µl and plasma HIV1-RNA below 200 cp/ml) under HAART, over a 96-week
      study period.

      The study hypothesis is that intermittent therapy is not inferior to continuous therapy in
      maintaining a CD4 cell above 300/µl. It will compare the proportions of and time to
      immunological failure (CD4 count below 300/µl confirmed by a retest 14 days later) in the IT
      and CT groups.
