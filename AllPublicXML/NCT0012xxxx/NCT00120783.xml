      This study investigated whether a calibrated reduction in antiretroviral drug pressures could
      stabilize the evolution and the pathogenic potential of resistant HIV viruses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with HIV multidrug resistance, maintaining a failing full-dose HAART regimen
      usually results in significant drug toxicity and in continued accumulation of resistance
      mutations that can preclude future therapeutic options. In contrast, treatment interruption
      provokes the reemergence of wild-type virus with full replicative and pathogenic capacity.
      The researchers investigated whether a calibrated reduction in drug pressure could stabilize
      the evolution and the pathogenic potential of resistant virus.

      A prospective pilot study was conducted in patients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART
      with a resistance genotype predicting less than two active drugs according to the 2002 ANRS
      algorithm, CD4 counts over or equal to 100/mm3 and plasma HIV RNA below or equal to 5 log/ml.
      The treatment was low-dose IDV/RTV (200/100 BID) and 3TC 150mg BID. IDV doses were adjusted
      at week 4 to ensure a Cmin of 250+/-100ng/ml, which, based on a panel of multi-PI resistant
      viruses, was calculated to yield an inhibitory quotient (Cmin/IC50) of 0.50. Primary
      end-points were over 25% decrease in CD4 counts (immunological failure–IF), or over 0.7 log
      increase in plasma HIV RNA (virological failure–VF) at two consecutive monthly visits during
      the 24-week study. Inclusions were to stop when the total number of failures (VF+IF) reached
      7
