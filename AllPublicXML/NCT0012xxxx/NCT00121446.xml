  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the setting of acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks), the principle objective of the
      WEST Study is to compare the impact on clinical outcomes of 3 different treatment strategies.
      The first is using medical (drug) therapy alone with standard care. The second strategy is
      identical medical (drug) therapy as the first group combined with early heart catheterization
      (within 24 hours) for angiography and if required, intervention. The third treatment strategy
      is direct admission (within 3 hrs) to the heart catheterization lab for angioplasty.

      WEST patients will be enrolled at first medical contact (using emergency medical services,
      e.g. ambulance) if possible or through Emergency Departments in participating health care
      facilities.

  <detailed_description>

      The principal objective of WEST is to compare the impact on clinical outcomes of the
      following three treatment groups defined as Group A: optimal pharmacologic therapy (prompt
      administration of tenecteplase (TNKase) and enoxaparin) at the earliest point of medical
      contact with usual post MI care; Group B: an identical pharmacological reperfusion strategy
      followed by an early invasive strategy including timely mechanical intervention, Group C:
      timely primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), undertaken after enoxaparin and an
      oral loading dose of clopidogrel.

      The secondary objective of WEST is to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving optimal
      pharmacologic therapy and a strategy of usual post-MI care, Group A versus protocol-mandated
      early catheterisation and PCI, Group B.
