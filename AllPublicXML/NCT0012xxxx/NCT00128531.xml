      The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy and safety of leuprolide acetate in
      patients with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>

      Other assessments include evaluation of main leuprolide PK parameters in 12 subjects after
      administration of 3 doses.

      Study Design:

      This will be a multi-center, open-label, fixed investigation of six monthly dosages of
      leuprolide acetate 3.75 mg administered to patients with histologically proven carcinoma of
      prostate, who might benefit from medical androgen deprivation therapy.

      A total of 120 male patients will receive a single, i.m. injection of leuprolide acetate 3.75
      mg initially on study day 0 (after baseline assessment) and then monthly (i.e. every 28 days)
      for five months.

      12 of the patients will also have plasma leuprolide levels measured for PK analysis during
      the first 3 injection periods (PK group). These patients will belong to pre-defined study
      sites.
