      This study will evaluate the role of thalidomide, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha
      modulator, on severe inflammation and relief of pain following extraction of wisdom teeth.
      TNFs are substances that affect the pathways of pain. This study involves an experimental
      group in which patients will be given thalidomide or a placebo (an inactive substance); a
      negative control group receiving the medication diazepam or a placebo; and a positive control
      group receiving diazepam or ibuprofen.

      Patients who are males ages 16 to 35, who are not allergic to aspirin or other nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (known as NSAIDs), sulfites, or certain anesthetics, and who in good
      health may be eligible for this study. Females are not eligible, owing to the risks that
      thalidomide presents to unborn children. To minimize the risk of fetal malformations, male
      patients who participate must use a condom during sexual intercourse for 4 weeks following
      the study and must not donate blood for 4 weeks.

      The medications used in the study will be given 1 hour before surgery. Then after the wisdom
      teeth are removed, a small piece of tubing will be placed into both sides of the patient's
      mouth where the teeth were removed. Every 20 minutes, for the next 6 hours, the researchers
      will collect inflammatory fluid from the tubing, to measure for changes in anti-inflammatory
      action. If they request pain relievers, patients will receive the medication ketorolac
      (Toradol), used for short-term treatment of moderately severe acute pain. Side effects of
      thalidomide include fatigue, dizziness, and rash. The use of ibuprofen and ketorolac may
      include the risk of gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. Diazepam can cause involuntary
      muscle movements and drowsiness, as well as dizziness lasting for up to 24 hours after it has
      been used as sedation. Patients will be instructed not to try to walk alone or to try to
      drive a vehicle during that period. Other risks related to participation in this study
      include those usually experienced with removal of wisdom teeth-that is, pain and swelling,
      bruising from insertion of the sedative into a vein (if needed), possible infection at the
      extraction site, prolonged bleeding, and numbness.

      Benefits from participating are having wisdom teeth removed at no cost as well as close
      monitoring before and after surgery. Results from the study may help people in the future by
      improving the management of pain following surgery.

      The proposed investigation is a randomized, double-blind, placebo and positive-controlled
      clinical study to evaluate the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)
      modulator, thalidomide, in acute inflammation and analgesia. The analgesic effect of
      thalidomide, a putative TNF-alpha modulator, will be evaluated using a model of tissue
      injury, the oral surgery model. Briefly, healthy males referred for third molar extraction
      will undergo the surgical extraction of third molars using standard surgical methods. At the
      completion of the surgical procedure, a microdialysis probe will be placed under the
      mucogingival flap previously elevated for the surgical procedure and subjects will be
      observed for pain over the course of six hours following surgery. Thalidomide or control will
      be administered one hour prior to surgery. Tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
      inflammatory mediators will be measured at time intervals postoperatively concomitant with
      pain measurements. Pain will be assessed postoperatively over the course of six hours.
      Demonstration of amelioration of pain is the primary outcome measure; changes in levels of
      tissue mediators will be taken as evidence of an acute anti-inflammatory effect of
      thalidomide. Based on our previous work with the fusion protein etanercept (TNFR:fc) which
      specifically binds TNF-alpha and prevents its interaction with cellular receptors, similar
      changes in the inflammatory cascade and clinical endpoints of inflammation may provide
      insight into the activity of thalidomide on acute inflammation and its clinical sequela,
      pain.
