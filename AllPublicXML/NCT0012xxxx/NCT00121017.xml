  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a simplified lopinavir/ritonavir-based
      therapy will continue to keep the viral load at very low levels after initial treatment with
      a combination of Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir) plus tenofovir and emtricitabine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  Subject's plasma HIV-1 RNA is &gt;1000 copies/mL at screening and in the investigator's
             opinion, the subject requires antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Subject is naive to antiretroviral therapy or has received &lt;7 days total of any
             antiretroviral therapy &gt;30 days prior to study drug administration.

          -  Subject has chronic HCV based on detectable plasma HCV RNA level (&gt;600 IU/mL) at
             screening.

          -  Subject is not currently undergoing treatment of HCV infection and does not plan to
             initiate HCV treatment for the duration of this study.

          -  If female, the results of a urine pregnancy test performed at screening and on
             Day-1/Baseline are both negative.

          -  If female, subject is either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             for at least one year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of
             the following methods of birth control: condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or

             intercourse.

          -  Subject is not breastfeeding.

          -  Subject's vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit
             evidence of acute illness.

          -  Subject agrees not to take any drugs during the study, including over-the-counter
             medicines, vitamins, mineral supplements, herbal preparations, alcohol or recreational
             drugs without the knowledge and permission of the investigator.

          -  Subject has not been treated for an active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection
             within 30 days of initiating study drug.

          -  Subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent from, approved by an
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), after the nature
             of the study has been explained and the subject has had the opportunity to ask
             questions. The informed consent must be signed before any study-specific procedures
             are performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to lopinavir,
             ritonavir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and efavirenz or to any inert
             materials contained in the study drug formulations.

          -  Subject has a significant history of cardiac, renal, neurologic, psychiatric,
