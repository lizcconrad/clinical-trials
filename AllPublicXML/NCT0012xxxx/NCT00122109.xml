    <textblock>
      Telemedicine has the potential to profoundly influence the delivery of specialized care to
      the remote veteran population suffering with PTSD. Preliminary research supports telemedicine
      technology as a possible solution to improve access to mental health services for veterans
      with PTSD. The proposed research is a treatment-outcome study that will assess the clinical
      efficacy of conducting an Anger Management Therapy (AMT) group treatment intervention using a
      videoteleconferencing (VTC) modality as compared to the traditional in-person modality with
      veterans who have PTSD and reside in remote locations on the Hawaiian Islands. AMT is a
      manual-guided cognitive-behavioral, skill based group intervention that has been used
      nationwide in VA substance abuse programs and most recently has been adopted by many VA PTSD
      Clinical Teams to treat anger-related to the sequelae of PTSD.

      Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent problem among military
      troops. Recovery from combat-related PTSD is often complicated by problems with anger.
      Veterans with difficulties managing PTSD-related anger may be particularly likely to live in
      remote geographical regions where access to specialized mental health care is often limited.
      Telemental health (TMH) has been touted as a potential means of increasing access to care in
      rural or remote areas. Objectives: This study compared the effectiveness of group Anger
      Management Therapy (AMT) delivered via videoteleconferencing (VTC) and in-person delivery in
      a sample of rural combat veterans with PTSD. The long-range objective of this project was to
      develop an empirically sound TMH protocol that will facilitate the extension of manual guided
      clinical services to remote sites via VTC. We hypothesized that providing a manualized group
      therapy intervention via VTC would result in similar reductions in anger symptoms as obtained
      from traditional in-person care. Further, we hypothesized that key process indicators (i.e.,
      attrition, adherence, satisfaction, and therapeutic alliance) would not be significantly
      different between the VTC and in-person conditions. The specific objectives of this project
      were to: a) determine if group AMT delivered via VTC is as effective as the same intervention
      delivered in-person on clinical outcomes measuring reductions in anger symptoms and b)
      determine if group AMT delivered via VTC is as effective as the same intervention delivered
      in-person on group process outcomes. Methods: A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial
      of 125 male veterans with PTSD and anger difficulties was conducted at three Department of
      Veterans Affairs' outpatient clinics. Participants were randomly assigned to receive AMT
      delivered in a group setting with the therapist either in-person (N= 64) or via VTC (N= 61).
      Participants were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3 and 6-months
      post-treatment. The primary clinical outcome was reduction of anger difficulties, as measured
      by the Anger Expression and Trait Anger subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression
      Inventory (STAXI-2) and the Novaco Anger Total Scale (NAS). Process variables were measured
      to assess the feasibility of AMT delivered via VTC. SAS MEANS procedure was used to calculate
      means and standard deviations for change from baseline at subsequent assessment points for
      both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis.

    <description>Anger expression was measured using the STAXI-2's 32-item Anger Expression Index (range 0 - 96). The STAXI-2 subscale have robust psychometric properties including high internal consistency, external validity, and construct validity. The Anger Expression Index provides a general measure of anger expression; assessing one's experience, expression and efforts to control anger. Higher scores indicate more problematic levels of anger and its expression.</description>

The STAXI-2 subscale have robust psychometric properties including high internal consistency, external validity, and construct validity. The Anger Expression Index provides a general measure of anger expression; assessing one's experience, expression and efforts to control anger. Higher scores indicate more problematic levels of anger and its expression.</description>

        <description>Anger disposition was assessed using the total scale score from the Novaco Anger Scale. This 60-item measure (range = 60 - 180) is a well validated self-report instrument designed to measure cognitive, arousal, and behavioral aspects of anger in both clinical and non-patient populations. Higher scores indicate more anger-related symptoms.</description>
