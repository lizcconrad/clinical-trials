      The purpose of this study is to see whether injection of hydromorphone through a subcutaneous
      injection device is more effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain than oral morphine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breakthrough pain is an exacerbation of severe pain that occurs on a background of otherwise
      controlled pain. Breakthrough pain is common in patients with advanced cancer. Current
      medications to treat breakthrough pain include oral immediate release opioid formulations and
      more recently oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate.

      The pain pen study is a randomized controlled double blind cross-over study comparing the
      efficacy of oral immediate release morphine with that of subcutaneous hydromorphone, injected
      through a so called pain pen, on breakthrough pain in cancer patients. Preliminary experience
      with the pain pen suggests that it has a more rapid time of onset of pain relief than oral
      formulations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable cancer pain requiring the equivalent of 60-1000 mg oral morphine/day

          -  1-4 breakthrough pain episodes/day

          -  Patients must be able, in the opinion of the investigator, to fully comply with trial
             requirements

          -  Patients who have given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled pain

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating or intend to become pregnant

          -  Cardiopulmonary disease that would increase the risk of opioids

          -  Neurologic or psychiatric disease that would compromise data collection

          -  Recently started chemotherapy or radiotherapy in as far as it would be effective in
             lowering breakthrough pain
