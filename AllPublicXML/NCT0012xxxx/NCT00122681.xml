  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Papilloma virus (HPV) are viruses that cause a common infection of the skin and
      genitals in men and women. Several types of HPV infection are transmitted by sexual activity
      and, in women, can infect the cervix (part of the uterus or womb). This infection often goes
      away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is called persistent infection), it can lead
      in women over a long period of time to cancer of the cervix. If a woman is not infected by
      HPV, it is very unlikely that she will get cervical cancer. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy of GSK Biologicals HPV 16/18 VLP/AS04 vaccine to prevent infection associated
      cervical pre-cancer and vaccine with HPV 16 or 18 and the vaccine safety, over 48 months, in
      young adolescents and women of 15/25 years of age at study start. Approximately 18.000 study
      subjects will either receive the HPV vaccine or a control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine)
      administered intramuscularly according to a 0-1-6 month schedule.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Persistent Infection (6-month Definition) With HPV-16 or HPV-18</title>
        <description>Persistent cervical HPV infection (6-month definition) was defined as the detection of the same HPV type by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cervical samples at 2 consecutive evaluations over approximately a 6-month interval.
Detection was done in subjects:
DNA- and sero-: subjects HPV DNA- at Month 0 and Month 6 for the corresponding HPV-type and sero- for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) at baseline (Month 0)
Overall: subjects HPV DNA- at Month 0 and Month 6 for the corresponding HPV-type and regardless of initial serostatus at baseline</description>
        <time_frame>Up to the moment when 36 cases of CIN2+ lesions associated with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection had been detected, including at least 15 cases of CIN2+ associated with HPV-18 infection. Mean follow-up was 34.9 months post dose 3</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for efficacy, which included all evaluable subjects, who had received 3 doses of study vaccine and who had a normal or low-grade cytology (i.e. negative or ASC-US or LSIL) at Month 0. All subjects had at least 5 months of follow-up after Month 12</population>

          <title>Number of Subjects With Histopathologically Confirmed Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)2+ Associated With Oncogenic HPV Types Detected Within the Lesional Component of the Cervical Tissue Specimen</title>
          <description>CIN2+ was defined as histopathologically-confirmed lesions including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 (CIN2), grade 3 (CIN3), AIS and invasive cervical cancer.
Oncogenic types detected included HPV-16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68.
Detection was done in subjects who were HPV DNA negative at baseline, regardless of initial serostatus.</description>
          <population>Analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for efficacy, which included all evaluable subjects, who had received 3 doses of study vaccine and who had a normal or low-grade cytology (i.e. negative or ASC-US or LSIL) at Month 0.</population>
