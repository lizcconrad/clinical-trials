  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a recently recognized entity. It has been thought to be
      related to both allergies and acid reflux. There have been reports that both swallowed,
      aerosolized steroids and proton pump inhibitors have been effective treatments. The
      researchers propose to directly compare the efficacy of aerosolized fluticasone to
      esomeprazole in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis. The hypothesis is that aerosolized
      fluticasone (Flovent) will be more effective in relieving symptoms of EE than esomeprazole
      (Nexium) treatment. Patients will undergo endoscopy, pH monitoring and manometry for
      diagnosis. Following diagnosis of EE by pathology (biopsy of esophagus), patients will be
      randomized to esomeprazole or swallowed fluticasone for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks,
      subjects will be asked to repeat upper endoscopy with biopsies. Three questionnaires
      (dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], and allergy) will be completed by the
      patient at the first endoscopy and at the end endoscopy. The primary objective is to measure
      change in eosinophil infiltration of the esophagus in response to treatment of allergy
      (swallowed fluticasone) versus treatment for reflux (esomeprazole) in EE patients.

      This is a randomized, non-blinded, multicenter treatment trial to demonstrate and compare the
      efficacy of esomeprazole and fluticasone in the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis.

      Following the initial diagnostic EGD with four quadrant biopsy, serum eosinophil count and
      serum IgE levels will be measured. Patients will undergo 24 hour pH study to determine the
      incidence of reflux in this population. Clinical assessment will be performed with validated
      questionnaires quantifying dysphagia, GERD, and allergy/atopy. Patients will be randomized to
      8 weeks of either esomeprazole versus swallowed aerosolized fluticasone. After 8 weeks of
      therapy, upper endoscopy will again be performed. Eosinophils per high power field will be
      quantified, and biopsies will be stained for major basic protein. Dysphagia, GERD, and
      allergy/atopy questionnaires will be repeated, as will serum eosinophil counts and IgE
      measurements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18-80 with EE, defined as: a) dysphagia, food impaction or other upper
             gastrointestinal symptoms (chest pain, heartburn, regurgitation); b) multiple
             esophageal rings or furrows; c) the presence of &gt;20 eosinophils/high power field in
