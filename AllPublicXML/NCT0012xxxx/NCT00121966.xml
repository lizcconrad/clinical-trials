      The primary objective of this study is:

        -  To investigate whether insulin aspart with meals is better than a standard treatment
           with insulin NPH at bedtime, evaluated by HbA1c.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To study if a combination treatment with metformin and/or rosiglitazone and insulin
           aspart with meals is better than a standard treatment with insulin NPH combined with one
           or more of the above oral antidiabetic drugs. According to the hypothesis, special focus
           will be given to the treatment group with insulin aspart combined with metformin and
           rosiglitazone. The treatment effect will be evaluated by HbA1c.

        -  To examine the effects of the treatments on glucose metabolism and beta cell function,
           evaluated by diurnal blood glucose, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and
           lactate.

        -  To examine the effects of the treatments on cardiovascular risk factors evaluated by
           serum lipid profiles, serum free fatty acids, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and
           electrocardiogram (ECG).

        -  To quantify and describe the patients' subjective experiences of the two different
           insulin treatments (quality of life assessment)

        -  To examine patients with type 2 diabetes for the presence of variability in a series of
           genes, which are known to or are assumed to:

             -  affect the long term outcome;

             -  determine the responsiveness to treatment with diet, exercise and drugs targeting
                the known risk markers for late diabetic complications; and

             -  after intervention, to analyse the complex interrelationships between genotypes and
                clinical endpoints and the responsiveness to actual treatment modalities.
