  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a home-based exercise and weight control
      program applied to elderly overweight individuals with painful osteoarthritis of the knee,
      would result in pain reduction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic disease in the United States (U.S.). Arthritis
      is a leading chronic illness among older adults in the U.S. Approximately 40% of individuals
      above 60 yr of age have OA of the knee. The primary objective of the proposed study is to
      determine whether individuals who are overweight with OA of the knee and who complete a
      24-week home-based exercise program combined with a weight control intervention program will
      report significantly less pain (as measured by the WOMAC) than volunteers who participate in
      home-based exercise (Ex) only, weight control intervention (WC) only, or standard clinical
      care (C). The secondary objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether
      overweight individuals with OA of the knee who complete the Ex+WC program, when compared to
      subjects who are randomly assigned to a E, WC or C groups, demonstrate significant
      improvement in the following health risk profile variables: (a) improved physical function
      (measured by the Functional Performance Inventory), (b) improved capacity to perform stair
      climbing and descending, (c) improved strength, (d) increased lean body mass, (e) increase in
      physical activity at home (measured by pedometer step count). The proposed clinical trial
      will utilize a prospective, randomized two by two factorial design. Descriptive and ancova
      statistical method will be applied for data analyses.

    <measure>WOMAC Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Base-line and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) is used to measure pain, function, and stiffness in patients with OA of the knee. At 24 weeks post-baseline, the average change in score was measured. We used the Function Scale only for this study. The Function Scale has 17 items, the responses are in Likert scale; namely 0=No difficulty, 1=Slight, 2=Moderate, 3= Very, 4=Extremely. The total score ranges from 0 to 68, a higher score means worse functioning. A score of 68 indicates extremely difficult in functioning.</description>

    <measure>Physical Scale SF-36v</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Base-line and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Rand Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to measure health related quality of life (i.e. physical health). The average change in score 24 weeks post-baseline was measured. Physical Health consists of 4 scales, Physical Function (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items). The Physical Health component is a summary measure of scales, and the scores ranges from 0 to 100, a score of 50 is the normative average of general health. Lower scores correspond to worse physical health, higher scores correspond to better physical health.</description>

    <time_frame>Between Base-line and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Rand Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to measure health related quality of life (i.e. mental health). The average change in score 24 weeks post-baseline was measured. Mental Health component consisted of 4 scales; these are the scales: Vitality ( 4 items), Social functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), and Mental Health (5 items). The mental health summary measures is called the Mental health component of SF36v. It was used to measure health related quality of life (i.e. mental health). The total score ranged from 0 to 100, a score of 50 is the normative average for general mental health. Lower scores correspond to worse mental health status, higher scores correspond to better mental health status.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Between Base-line and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Average distance walked in six minutes. The average change in distance walked (meters) 24 weeks post-baseline was measured.</description>

    <time_frame>Between Base-line and 24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Total amount of stairs climbed and descended for three minutes. Subjects climbed four steps up and descended four steps down. The average change in total number of steps 24 weeks post-baseline was measured.</description>

We used the Function Scale only for this study. The Function Scale has 17 items, the responses are in Likert scale; namely 0=No difficulty, 1=Slight, 2=Moderate, 3= Very, 4=Extremely. The total score ranges from 0 to 68, a higher score means worse functioning. A score of 68 indicates extremely difficult in functioning.</description>

Mental Health component consisted of 4 scales; they are: Vitality ( 4 items), Social functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), and Mental Health (5 items). The mental health summary measures is called the Mental health component of SF36v. It was used to measure health related quality of life. The total score ranged from 0 -100, a score of 50 is the normative average for general mental health. Lower scores correspond to worse mental health status, higher scores correspond to better mental health status.</description>

        <title>Physical Scale SF-36v</title>
        <description>The Rand Short Form-36 (SF-36) was used to measure health related quality of life (i.e. physical health). The average change in score 24 weeks post-baseline was measured. Physical Health consists of 4 scales, Physical Function (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items). The Physical Health component is a summary measure of scales, and the scores ranges from 0 to 100, a score of 50 is the normative average of general health. Lower scores correspond to worse physical health, higher scores correspond to better physical health.</description>
