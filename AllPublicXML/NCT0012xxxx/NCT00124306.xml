  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial study to test the efficacy and safety of amitriptyline in
      the treatment of patients newly diagnosed with painful bladder syndrome (PBS). PBS is defined
      by symptoms--frequent urination day and night and increasing pain as the bladder
      fills--according to the International Continence Society. The syndrome includes interstitial
      cystitis (IC), which has been estimated to affect as many as 700,000 people, mostly women.
      Estimates for PBS vary widely, but as many as 10 million people may suffer from this
      condition. Although amitriptyline is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication
      used for depression, the way it works makes it useful for treating the pain of fibromyalgia,
      multiple sclerosis, and other chronic pain syndromes. Prior small studies in interstitial
      cystitis (IC) suggested the drug may be a wise choice for this syndrome as well, because it
      blocks nerve signals that trigger pain and may also decrease muscle spasms in the bladder,
      helping to relieve the symptoms of pain and frequent urination.

      The current trial is recruiting newly diagnosed adults who have not yet received treatment.
      Approximately 270 participants will be randomly assigned to take up to 75 milligrams of
      amitriptyline or a placebo each day for 14 to 26 weeks. All participants will be given
      techniques to practice suppressing the urge to urinate for increasingly longer stretches
      until they can wait 3 or 4 hours before going to the bathroom. Participants will also
      regulate when and how much they drink and avoid bladder irritants such as alcohol, acidic
      foods and carbonated or caffeinated drinks. Staff and patients will find out who received the
      amitriptyline when the study is finished. Medications and tests are free to participants.

      Ten medical centers in the United States and Canada are recruiting adults newly diagnosed
      with either painful bladder syndrome (PBS) or interstitial cystitis (IC).The centers make up
      the Interstitial Cystitis Clinical Research Network, sponsored by the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) at NIH.
