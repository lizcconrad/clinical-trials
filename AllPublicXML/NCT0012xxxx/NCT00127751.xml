  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactor
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction program using team case management in high risk
      patients who have low family incomes and limited access to medical care. Patients were
      randomized to case management (99) or usual care (49) with baseline, 6-month and 12-month
      evaluations of CVD risk factors, clinical status and quality of life.

      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactor
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction program using team case management in high risk
      patients who have low family incomes and limited access to medical care. Patients were
      randomized to case management (99) or usual care (49) with baseline, 6-month and 12-month
      evaluations of CVD risk factors, clinical status and quality of life. Subjects were primarily
      recruited from patients being seen in free medical clinics in Santa Clara County California.
      Primary eligibility was ≥ 35 years of age, one or more CVD risk factors (with or without
      clinical CVD), low family income, and residing in Santa Clara County. Patients in the case
      management group were provided counseling services by specially trained registered nurses
      (RNs) and registered dieticians (RDs) and assisted in obtaining medications and medical
      services from programs provided in the county or indigent drug programs provided by selected
      pharmaceutical companies. Protocol driven treatment algorithms based on national practice
      guidelines were used and use of existing programs and resources were maximized. On average
      patients in case management were seen by staff 6-9 in the 12 months.
