      The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the following between the two arms of
      the study:

      A. The degree of postpartum maternal anxiety at day 1, day 7 and at hospital discharge.
      Anxiety will be compared point by point but also via kinetics.

      B. The incidence maternal post traumatic stress disorder at 6 and 12 months.

      C. The incidence of mother-child relationship disorders at 6 and 12 months.

      D. Infant vital signs during the hospital stay.
