      Introduction Cardiovascular diseases are the first cause of death in rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA). In 2010, EULAR Standing Committee for Clinical Affairs provides 10 recommendations for
      cardiovascular risk management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, including a
      cardiovascular risk assessment annually.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the application of EULAR recommendations in real life
      in patients with RA in the french population. Inclusion criteria: all patients over 18 years
      old with rheumatoid arthritis treated with at least one DMARDS and/or biologic therapy,
      affiliated to the RSI (regime social des independents which correspond to other branches of
      the universal healthcare insurance agency). Non inclusion criteria: patients declared as
      rheumatoid arthritis without DMARDS or biologic therapy or treated with steroids alone. The
      following analysis will be performed on the whole database of the RSI, without name
      identification. Evaluation criteria: at least once a years the prescription of at least one
      of the following items use in the evaluation of the cardiovascular risk factors: lipides
      dosage, glycemia, HbA1C, stress test, Carotid ultra-sonography, coronary or lower limbs
      arteriography, heart ultra-sonography, cardiology clinic, endocrinology clinic. This
      evaluation will be done on the whole national population of RSI for the year 2011 (01/01/2011
      - 31/12/2011). On a subgroup of patients from the region &quot;Provence Alpes Côte d'Azur&quot;, the
      investigators will analyze the year 2009, and compare to year 2011, to evaluate the impact of
      theses recommendations.
