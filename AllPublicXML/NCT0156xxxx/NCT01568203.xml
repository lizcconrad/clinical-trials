    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AMG 579 following a
      single oral dose administration in healthy subjects (Part A) and in patients with
      schizophrenia or stable schizoaffective disorder (Part B). The study in healthy subjects
      (Part A) concluded, and following a protocol amendment, enrolled only patients with
      schizophrenia or stable schizoaffective disorder (Part B).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of schizophrenia (chronic, all types) or schizoaffective disorder according
             to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition Text Revision
             (DSM-IV-TR) criteria and by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.)
             6.0 for Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders Studies

          -  Body weight greater or equal to 50 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 38.0
             kg/m2, inclusive, at screening

          -  Patient is judged by the Investigator to be likely to tolerate being off of
             antipsychotic medications for the duration of the trial (for patients withdrawing from
             or currently not taking antipsychotic medications)

          -  Clinically stable, as judged by the investigator, and in a non-acute phase for at
             least 12 weeks within enrollment. If patient is on antipsychotic medications, they
             must be on second generation oral antipsychotic therapy (eg, ziprasidone, quetiapine,
             olanzapine, etc) for at least 8 weeks within enrollment and at least one month within
             enrollment on a stable dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalized for psychiatric symptoms in the 3 months within enrollment

          -  Patients with evidence of mental retardation by history or clinical examination or
             known premorbid IQ â‰¤ 70

          -  Current risk of self-harm or violence as determined by the investigator, or current
             risk of suicide or history of suicidal behavior within 12 months of enrollment, and/or
             ongoing suicidal ideation as assessed using Columbia-Suicidal Severity Rating Scale
             (C-SSRS) at screening (eg, any response of &quot;yes&quot; to the Suicidal Ideation questions on
             the C-SSRS in the past 12 months).

        Additional critera apply. Eligibility criteria for healthy subjects (Part A) not outlined
        above.
