  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bexarotene is a RXR-selective retinoid, licensed for the treatment of cutaneous T cell
      lymphoma. The most frequent adverse effect is hypertriglyceridemia but its mechanism is not
      well known. The purpose of this study is to research a carbohydrate metabolism disorder
      associated in bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceridemia.

    <textblock>
      Primary cutaneous lymphomas are the second group of extra nodal lymphomas after
      gastrointestinal lymphomas. Bexarotene is licensed for the treatment of epidermotropic
      cutaneous T cell lymphoma .The most common side effect of bexarotene is hypertriglyceridemia
      (82%) associated with hypercholesterolemia (30 to 40%). Central hypothyroidism is also
      present in 40-80% of cases. These adverse effects are dose-dependent. The management of
      hyperlipidemia induced by bexarotene is difficult. The mechanism of lipid disorder induced by
      bexarotene is not well known. Associated carbohydrate metabolism disorder could be present
      and play a role in the bexarotene-induced hyperlipidemia.

      The main objective is to estimate the frequency of a carbohydrate disorder in patients with
      hypertriglyceridemia (TG&gt; 1.5 g / L) induced by bexarotene treatment of cutaneous T cell
      lymphoma, previously free of diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and dyslipidemia.

    <description>The presence of a carbohydrate disorder is defined by glucose intolerance or diabetes. The diagnosis of glucose intolerance is made for a fasting glucose less than 1.26 g / l glucose and 2 hours (T120mn) after taking 75 g of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 1.4 and 2 g / l and / or a value greater than or equal to 2 g / l between T30 and T90 min. Diabetes is established for a fasting glucose greater than or equal to 1.26 g / l and / or blood glucose greater than or equal to 2 g / l to 2 hours.</description>
