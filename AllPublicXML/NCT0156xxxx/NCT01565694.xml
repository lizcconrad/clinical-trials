  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate a medicine for the treatment of symptoms and
      complications of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in children and adolescents.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NDO often occurs in patients with spina bifida or other spinal cord damage where the
      bladder muscle contracts more than normal during filling. These patients often have an
      inability to void, so that catheterization is required to empty the bladder.

      The medicine being tested in this study is called solifenacin succinate. Solifenacin tablets
      are given to adults for the treatment of overactive bladder. A new liquid suspension has been
      developed to treat children and adolescents in this and other studies.

      The efficacy and safety of the solifenacin suspension was investigated. The take-up and
      length of time that the solifenacin suspension stays in the body was also investigated during
      this study. Effectiveness was measured by urodynamics (the filling and emptying of the
      bladder) and the urine volumes during catheterization together with the diary responses
      relating to the number of incontinence episodes or incontinence free days.

      Safety assessments included analysis of the blood and urine, review of the electrocardiogram
      (ECG), ultrasound of the kidney, simple memory and understanding tests (cognitive function)
      and the ability to see near and far objects (visual accommodation).

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 24 in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage begins, or until it was stopped because either the participant experiences pain or discomfort or 135% of expected bladder capacity for age has been reached. MCC is the maximum bladder capacity reached during filling cystometry before either leakage or pain/discomfort was observed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Last Possible Titration Step in Maximum Cystometric Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 9 or Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>During urodynamic assessments, the bladder was filled until voiding/leakage begins, or until it was stopped because either the participant experiences pain or discomfort or 135% of expected bladder capacity for age has been reached. MCC is the maximum bladder capacity reached during filling cystometry before either leakage or pain/discomfort was observed. Based on study requirements, the last possible titration step was Week 9 for participants enrolled under versions 1.0 and 1.1 and Week 12 under later versions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bladder Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Bladder compliance gives an indication of the elasticity of the bladder wall and was calculated by dividing the change in volume by the change in detrusor pressure during the filling of the bladder.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bladder Volume (mL) Until First Detrusor Contraction &gt; 15 cmH2O as a Percentage of Expected Bladder Capacity (EBC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the bladder volume was calculated using urodyanamic assessments. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder is filled until voiding/leakage begins, or until it is stopped because either the subject experiences pain or discomfort or 135% of expected bladder capacity for age has been reached. If no detrusor contraction of at least 15 cmH2O occurs, the bladder volume was imputed with MCC.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bladder Volume at 30 cmH2O Detrusor Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Bladder volumes at 30 cm H2O detrusor pressure was calculated using the urodynamic assessments. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder is filled until voiding/leakage begins, or until it is stopped because either the participants experiences pain or discomfort or 135% of expected bladder capacity for age has been reached.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Bladder Volume at 40 cmH2O Detrusor Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Bladder volumes at 40 cm H2O detrusor pressure were calculated using urodynamic assessments. During urodynamic assessments, the bladder is filled until voiding/leakage begins, or until it is stopped because either the subject experiences pain or discomfort or 135% of expected bladder capacity for age has been reached.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Number of Overactive Detrusor Contractions (&gt; 15 cmH2O) Until End of Bladder Filling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in number of overactive detrusor contractions until end of bladder filling was measured by urodynamic testing. If leakage occurred, the &quot;Detrusor pressure at leakage&quot; was recorded otherwise the volume of fluid instilled into the bladder was recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Detrusor Pressure at the End of Bladder Filling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The bladder was filled until voiding/leakage began or until it was stopped because either the participant experiences pain or discomfort or 135% of expected bladder capacity for age has been reached. Pressure was recorded for an extra 5 minutes after leakage began or the end of bladder-filling, whichever is sooner.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Average Catheterized Volume per Catheterization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Maximum Catheterized Volume</measure>

    <description>The maximum catheterized volume per day was calculated using all available (non-zero) catheterized volumes recorded for the 2 measuring days in the diary, whether or not these 2 days were concurrent. The maximum value was calculated separately for each measuring day and the mean of these two values was used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Average First Morning Catheterized Volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The average first morning catheterized volume was calculated as the average of the available first morning catheterized volumes recorded for the 2 measuring days in the diary, whether or not these 2 days are concurrent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Mean Number of Incontinence Episodes per 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
