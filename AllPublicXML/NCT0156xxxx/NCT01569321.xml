    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the first cancer in women, the second etiology of death by cancer and the
      first cause for women between 35 and 55 years.

      Diagnostic tools and large screening have been realized with positive impact in a recent
      review with 31% less likely to die of breast cancer over nearly 30 years compared to women
      who didn't get regular screening mammograms. Diagnostic tools and treatment also are
      improving continuously.

      However, for some women, breast cancer diagnosis is difficult, in case of high density
      breast, breast modifications after surgery… In these cases, breast MRI is currently the best
      imaging tool, with high sensitivity about 90% but with a lower specificity about 60%, that
      lead to futile biopsies.

      Recently, molecular imaging with PET-CT scan with 18FDG has permitted to widely modify cancer
      treatment.

      However, PET-CT scan is not a good imaging tool for initial diagnostic of breast tumor
      because of a lack in spatial resolution about 8mm. So, researchers developed dedicated PET
      scan for breast, called Positron Emission Mammography. Our project is in this field of view
      and is named CLEARPEMSONIC.

      First clinical studies with PEM showed very good performance of this imaging modality for
      initial evaluation of breast tumors. PEM performance is not affected by breast density,
      hormonal status. Spatial resolution is less than 3mm. PEM seems complementary with MRI,
      adding a better specificity value.

      In the field of CERIMED, ClearPemSonic Project aims to evaluate an new imaging tool which
      combined PEM scan and ultrasonography.

      Technologic evaluation was made. Now a feasibility study is the first step for clinical
      applications.

      The main objective of this project is to confirm the feasibility of PEM scan with the
      ClearPEmSonic.

      Secondary objectives are to compare results with other conventional imaging modalities and
      MRI.

      The gold standard will be histology of the breast tumor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Mammary Néoplasia ready(in position) (diagnosed on histological taking of type(chap)
             biopsy)

          -  Waits whose realization of an imaging TEP-TDM in the 18FDG is required for the
             coverage(care) of a mammary néoplasia. The decision of realization of this TEP-TDM can
             be validated during a RCP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other cancerous affection;

          -  Pregnant Woman. Nursing mother

          -  Patient presenting difficulties of follow-up (insufficient motivation, imminent
             transfer(transformation) in a city where the study cannot be led)

          -  Patient incapable to give their written consent.

          -  Patient claustrophobic or presenting a contraindication to the realization of the MRI
