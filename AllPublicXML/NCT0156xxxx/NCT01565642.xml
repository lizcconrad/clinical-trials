    <description>Composite outcome:
The Quality of Communication (QOC) score + Concordance on goals of care defined as the percent of surrogates that report a primary goal identical to providers + the Advance Care Planning problem score from the Toolkit Family Interview. It consists of 3 items assigned one desired answer; a &quot;problem score&quot; is calculated as percent of respondents giving a non-desired answer to one item.</description>

    <measure>Number of palliative care domains in care plan</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Index score ranging from 0-10 with one point given for care plan addressing each domain: prognosis, goals of care, physical symptoms, emotional needs, spiritual needs, resuscitation, artificial feeding, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, hospitalization.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction with care</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Care at the End of Life in Dementia (SWC-EOLD) scale; 10 items rated 1-4 and summed with total potential range 10-40.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comfort in dying</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure applies only to residents who die during follow-up. Comfort Assessment in Dying for Dementia (CAD-EOLD) includes 14 items rated on a 3 point scale, summed for a total potential score of 14-42.</description>
