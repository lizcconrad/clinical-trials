  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are controversial data about fluoride intake by children when tooth brushing with
      children's or regular toothpastes. However, a study have showed that children were exposed to
      a dose of 0.051 mg F/Kg/day and 0.046 mg F/kg/day by tooth brushing with children's and and
      regular toothpaste, respectively. Fluorides doses were too close and is questioned if there
      is a real clinical relevance in terms of risk of dental fluorosis. It is important to
      evaluate if children's toothpastes does really represent a risk of fluoride intake when
      compared to the regular toothpastes in terms of risk of dental fluorosis. The hypothesis is
      that both children's and regular toothpastes can represente risks of development of dental
      fluorosis and can represent similar fluoride exposure by children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects: Children at age of development of dental fluorosis (up to 4 years) enrolled at day
      care centres from the city of Montes Claros (0.7 ppm F), Brazil.

      The study design has two phases:

        1. In the first phase, children are required to bring at the day care centres the tooth
           brush and the toothpaste used at home. There is no randomization, since the inclusion in
           either children's or regular toothpaste groups will be done based on each child's
           preference. The children are requested to tooth brush as the usual manner that the
           parent and the child do at home. Saliva expectorates are collected as the protocol
           described by Guha-Chowdhury et al. (1996). No instructions are provided in this phase or
           interventions by the researcher. Saliva expectorates are collected for further
           laboratory analysis. Toothpastes are collected for laboratory analysis.

        2. In the second phase, children are required to toothbrush with other type of toothbrush
           following the same tooth brushing protocol. For example, children that previously used
           children's toothpaste will be provided a regular toothpaste, and vice-versa.

      Parents are requested to answer a questionnaire regarding their children's tooth brushing
      habits and socioeconomic factors.

      Laboratory analysis provides estimation of fluoride intake from tooth brushing with both
      toothpastes.

      Analysis will base on dose of fluoride intake (mg F/Kg body weight/day) considering
      children's and regular toothpastes.
