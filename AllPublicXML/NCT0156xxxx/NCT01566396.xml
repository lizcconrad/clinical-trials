      The 3F Applicator (A3F) is indicated for use in dermatological procedures requiring ablation
      and resurfacing of the skin, and for the treatment of facial wrinkles. This study was
      designed in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the A3F for treatment of facial
      wrinkles.

    <textblock>
      The need for cosmetic facial enhancement procedures with minimal down time and low risk has
      led to the development of methods for non-surgical skin rejuvenation. Various ablative lasers
      were developed, which remove the full skin surface in a controlled manner1,2. However, the
      prolonged recovery and the significant risks prompted the development of fractional lasers
      which ablate the skin in a fractional manner, leaving untreated areas to improve healing
      process3. In the past few years, fractional RF systems have been introduced that enable
      controlled skin resurfacing accompanied with dermal collagen remodeling4,5,6. The new 3F
      Applicator (A3F, trade name TriFractional) from Pollogenâ„¢ is designed to enable skin
      resurfacing and treatment of wrinkles using radiofrequency energy.

    <description>Efficacy of using the 3F Applicator (A3F) for treatment of facial wrinkles will be established by level of wrinkle reduction. The treated area will be photographed, using high-resolution macro photography prior to the treatments and at the follow up visits. The pre - and post-treatment photographs will be compared and scored by two independent uninvolved physicians.</description>
