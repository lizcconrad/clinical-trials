    <textblock>
      This research plan is focused on neurochemical positron emission tomography (PET) studies of
      Parkinson disease (PD). PD is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, and
      considerable progress has been made in understanding and treating the &quot;typical&quot; movement
      abnormalities of resting tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. These cardinal PD features are
      all initially responsive to dopamine replacement therapy, and have been investigated
      intensively with respect to their relationships to degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine
      projection. More recently, increased attention has focused on the &quot;non-motor&quot; clinical
      aspects of PD, including cognitive, mood, chronobiological and peripheral autonomic defects.
      These clinical features are less reliably affected by dopaminergic therapy, and are likely to
      be associated with other, non-dopaminergic neural degenerations. Indeed, detailed postmortem
      assessments of PD brain reveal substantial neuronal losses in a variety of chemically-defined
      neurons, including brainstem serotonin and norepinephrine neurons and basal forebrain
      cholinergic neurons. Projects in the proposal will focus on dementia, depression, sleep-apnea
      and dysautonomia in PD patients, employing PET measures of presynaptic dopaminergic,
      serotoninergic and cholinergic CNS neurons and of peripheral sympathetic neurons. Results of
      the investigations may identify associations of non-motor PD signs and symptoms with the
      non-dopaminergic neuronal losses. These findings will establish additional therapeutic
      targets for symptomatic, but also for potential neuroprotective PD therapies. In addition, a
      majority of patients will be characterized with all 3 CNS PET measures. The availability of
      multiple markers of distinct neuronal populations involved in PD neurodegeneration will
      permit exploratory analyses to assess whether the degenerations are correlated (possibly
      manifestations of a common pathophysiology) or apparently independent (possibly a
      manifestation of multiple PD subtypes or pathophysiologies). Ultimately, better understanding
      of these non-motor features will be essential to developing future treatments that address
      the entire PD patient.
