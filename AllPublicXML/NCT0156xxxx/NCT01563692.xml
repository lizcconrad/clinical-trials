    <textblock>
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a human restricted pathogen and is the single most
      important cause of severe respiratory illness in infants and young children, a major cause of
      infantile bronchiolitis and is the most frequent cause of hospitalization of infants and
      young children in industrialized countries. Severe RSV infection early in life is associated
      with an increased risk of subsequent recurrent wheezing and asthma. There are few
      population-based estimates of the incidence of RSV disease from developing countries, but the
      existing data clearly indicates that the virus accounts for a high proportion of Acute
      Respiratory Infections (ARI) in children. Studies in Brazil, Colombia and Thailand suggest
      that RSV causes 20-30% of ARI cases in children from 1-4 years of age, a proportion similar
      to that in industrialized countries, and WHO has estimated the global RSV disease burden at
      64 million cases and 160 000 deaths every year. RSV also causes severe disease in elderly and
      immune-compromised adults, and the burden of RSV disease in the elderly is comparable to that
      of seasonal influenza. The economic impact of RSV-related disease in adults estimated to be
      greater than that of influenza in relation to numbers of days lost from work.

      The development of a safe and effective vaccine against RSV would benefit greatly from data
      on the immune responses in healthy adults naturally exposed to the virus. RSV infection has
      been shown to increase and induce short-lived circulating antibody secreting cells and
      produce an increase in the RSV specific antibody titres but very limited data is available on
      the cellular immune responses induced by RSV during natural infection in healthy adults. The
      existence of cell mediated immune response against RSV in humans has been described but
      characterization of this response remains poor and simultaneous analysis of several
      immunological parameters have not been attempted in an RSV exposed population before.
