  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neuropathic pain is a global health concern, affecting millions of patients
      worldwide. It is often extremely debilitating and poses a diagnostic and therapeutic
      challenge. The current mainstay of treatment is pharmacotherapy consisting of powerful
      analgesics combined with different classes of drugs that change nerve cell membrane
      properties. However, response to pharmacotherapy is often poor and mandates interventional
      strategies. Among the latest and most promising interventional strategies is the use of
      neurostimulation to targeted brain areas, specifically the primary motor cortex . Motor
      cortex stimulation , both invasive and noninvasive (using megnetic or electical stimulation),
      has emerged as a highly beneficial treatment, and is currently included in different
      professional guidelines for the treatment of medically refractory neuropathic pain.

      A possible alternative way to achieve stimulation of the motor cortex is by using EEG based
      neurofeedback. This design, which is actually a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) enables the
      patient to voluntarily modulate the activity of a circumscribed brain area after a few
      training sessions. While EEG based neurofeedfback is decades old, it has never been tested in
      neuropathic pain patients.

      This experiment is intended to compare both the clinical effects and the brain correlates of
      a BCI based self modulation of M1 activity and of exogenous magnetic brain stimulation in a
      population of patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain of an upper limb. 15 such
      patients will receive a course of 10 daily magnetic stimulation sessions with stimulation of
      M1 as described in the literature. A further 30 patients will be divided into two groups: 15
      will perform a course of 10 real BCI neurofeedback sessions modulating motor cortex activity
      and 15 will perform a course of 10 sham neurofeedback sessions. The participants' baseline
      chronic pain levels and their response to acute painful stimuli will be clinically evaluated
      before and after the course, and for an additional 1 month. Furthermore, before and after the
      course patients will be scanned using functional MRI during rest (baseline pain levels) and
      during acute pain. These scans are performed both to describe the neural correlates of the
      analgesia induced by motor cortex magnetic stimulation , and to compare the observed networks
      to the network effect of a BCI neurofeedback modulation of motor cortex activity.
