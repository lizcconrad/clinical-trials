    <textblock>
      The sensitivity of a person's cough reflex can be measured by getting them to breathe in
      (inhale) irritant chemicals. There are different methods by which subjects are asked to
      inhale these chemicals, either by taking one deep breath in, or by asking them to just
      continue to take a number of breaths. The purpose of this clinical research study is to see
      if the coughing responses are different in healthy people and people with respiratory
      problems that make them cough when they are given these chemicals in these two methods.

          -  Current smokers with at least 10 pack year history of smoking.

          -  Spirometry within normal limits i.e. FEV1 &gt; 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio of &gt; 75%
             predicted.

        Asthma:

          -  Physician diagnosis of asthma

          -  Stable asthma.

          -  Airway hyperresponsiveness to methacoline; PC20&lt; 16mg/ml.
