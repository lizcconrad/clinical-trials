      This study will document the cognitive (mental) and functional abilities of newly diagnosed
      cancer patients. The study will also examine the changes in cognitive and functional
      abilities during and after chemotherapy (your cancer treatment).

      A comprehensive set of questionnaires and tasks, or assessments, have been put together in
      order for doctors and nurses to learn more about the day to day functioning of newly
      diagnosed adult cancer patients. The investigators would also like to follow up with the same
      adult patients, during and following completion of their cancer treatment, to learn about the
      kinds of treatments they received and how their cognitive status and level of participation
      in activities of daily living has changed. With follow-up assessments, doctors and nurses can
      learn more about the complications or health problems that adult patients may experience as a
      result of undergoing cancer therapy. This is a study involving two visits. The first visit
      occurs within two weeks before starting your cancer therapy, specifically chemotherapy. The
      second visit occurs within two weeks of completing your chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is increasingly used in the management of various cancers. There are reports in
      the literature of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments ranging from deficits in memory
      and attention to slowed information-processing and deficiencies in executive function,
      including planning and problem-solving. These deficits have been shown to affect work-place
      productivity and social role-functioning which present significant public health risks in an
      era of increased chemotherapy usage. However, previous studies investigating cognitive
      deficits after chemotherapy have mainly used neurocognitive assessments, which are limited in
      their utility for clinical diagnosis due to their likelihood for practice effects and low
      sensitivity for detecting subtle cognitive changes that may be functionally relevant to the
      patient.

      Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) is a sensitive test
      that measures resting-state neural network connectivity, reflecting the integrity between
      functionally-related brain regions. fcMRI has been used to delineate cortical neural networks
      involved in a variety of cognitive domains, including memory, and attention. The
      investigators believe that fcMRI will be more sensitive than neurocognitive tests alone for
      investigating chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes. The goal of this novel study is to use
      fcMRI to investigate cognitive changes after chemotherapy in an attempt to understand the
      currently unknown neurobiological mechanisms associated with this phenomenon.

      This prospective study will investigate the presence of cognitive deficits after chemotherapy
      in cancer patients by assessing changes in three fcMRI-defined neural networks involved in
      cognition. The three networks include (1) Dorsal Frontal Attention network (2) &quot;Default&quot;
      network and (3) Cognition &quot;Core&quot; control network. Sixteen cancer patients scheduled for
      chemotherapy will undergo fcMRI of the brain and neurocognitive testing within two weeks
      before and after chemotherapy. Comparisons between time-points will establish the effect of
      chemotherapy on cognition.

      Results obtained from this study in cancer patients will provide insight into the mechanisms
      underlying the development of chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficits. Knowledge of the
      development of chemotherapy-induced cognitive deficits will enhance positive outcomes by
      allowing practitioners and patients to be better informed of the potential cognitive
      consequences to anticipate. With patients equipped with such information before starting
      cancer treatment, they will be better able to manage their affairs and daily activities in
      such a way that allows them to maintain productive living through their course of cancer and
      its treatment.

        The final study population will include sixteen adults over the age of 40 years with
        newly-diagnosed locally-advanced breast, head and neck, ovarian, primary peritoneal,
        bladder , and urethral cancer although up to 25 patients will be approached for enrollment
        to account for losses to attrition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be 40 years of age or older

          -  Subjects must be able to read, write and speak English fluently

          -  Treatment with a chemotherapy regimen that contains 5-fluorouracil or a platinum-based
             drug.

          -  Breast cancer subjects must be newly diagnosed with invasive lobular or ductal cancer
             (stages II and III)

          -  Head and Neck cancer subjects must be newly diagnosed with locally-advanced squamous
             cell carcinoma of the head and neck in oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal
             sites (stages III and IV)

          -  Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer subjects must be newly diagnosed
             with epithelial ovarian cancer (stages II - IV), fallopian tube cancer with pelvic
             extension (stages II-IV), or primary peritoneal cancer (stages III-IV)

          -  Bladder, renal pelvis, or ureteral cancer subjects must be newly-diagnosed with
             muscle-invasive cancer (stages II - IV).

          -  Urethral cancer subjects must be newly diagnosed with cancer invading the corpus
             spongiosum, prostate, or periurethral muscle (stages II-IV)

          -  Subjects must be anticipated to receive chemotherapy without the concomitant treatment
             use of hormonal therapy or immunomodulators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with other prior cancer diagnoses who have evidence of active disease
