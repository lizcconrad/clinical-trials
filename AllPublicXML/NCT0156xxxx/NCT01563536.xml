    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      antiviral activity of multiple, ascending doses of ABT-267 (also known as ombitasvir)
      administered as two-day monotherapy followed by ABT-267 in combination therapy with other
      direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) ABT-450 with ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-333 (also
      known as dasabuvir) plus ribavirin (RBV) in patients with chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection without cirrhosis.

      An open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      antiviral activity of ABT-267 as monotherapy for 2 days, followed by ABT-267, ABT-450 with
      ritonavir (ABT-450/r) and ABT-333 plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy for 12 weeks in
      treatment-naïve, non-cirrhotic patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The

    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose (time 0) and at 2, 4, and 6 hours post-dose on Day 1 and pre-dose on Day 2 (ABT-267 monotherapy). The samples were analyzed for ABT-267 using validated analytical methods.

    <time_frame>Day 2 (pre-dose) and Day 3 (pre-dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected pre-dose on Day 2 (prior to second dose of ABT-267 monotherapy) and pre-dose on Day 3 (prior to first dose of combination therapy).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>All AEs were collected from the time of study drug administration to 30 days after last dose of study drug (16 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
The investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to the use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), and rated the severity of each event as either: Mild: The AE was transient and easily tolerated by the participant; Moderate: The AE caused the participant discomfort and interrupted usual activities; Severe: The AE caused considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and could have been incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in a congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability or was any other important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention.</description>

    <measure>Mean Maximal Decrease From Baseline in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) During ABT-267 Monotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose on Days 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline value was the last measurement before the first dose of ABT-267 monotherapy (Day 1). The maximal decrease during monotherapy was the change from baseline to the lowest log10 IU/mL HCV RNA level any time from the first dose of ABT-267 on Day 1 to the last log10 HCV RNA level before the first dose of ABT-267 combination therapy (Study Day 3).</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with sustained virologic response (plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] level less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ]) 12 and 24 weeks after the last dose of combination study drug. The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.</description>

    <time_frame>Predose on Days 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between ABT-267 dose, ABT-267 concentration, and response was analyzed as the change in viral load (measured as log10 IU/mL) from baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) to pre-dose on Days 2 and 3. Plasma concentrations of ABT-267 pre-dose on Days 2 and 3 are presented above in 4. Primary Outcome: Plasma Concentration of ABT-267 Pre-dose (Ctrough) on Day 2 and Day 3.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Resistance-Associated Variants and Phenotypic Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 Pre-dose (Baseline) and Day 3 Pre-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid (AA) variants using population sequencing. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-267 at Baseline was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with the EC50 for the appropriate reference replicon (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Day 3 samples were analyzed using population sequencing and were compared with the baseline and appropriate prototypic reference sequences to assess AA changes. Phenotypic resistance at Day 3 was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding Baseline sample. The number of participants with variants at resistance-associated AA positions and phenotypic resistance at Baseline and Day 3 are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
The investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to the use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), and rated the severity of each event as either: Mild: The AE was transient and easily tolerated by the participant; Moderate: The AE caused the participant discomfort and interrupted usual activities; Severe: The AE caused considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and could have been incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in a congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability or was any other important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention.</description>
        <time_frame>All AEs were collected from the time of study drug administration to 30 days after last dose of study drug (16 weeks).</time_frame>

        <description>Baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) samples were analyzed for resistance-associated amino acid (AA) variants using population sequencing. Phenotypic resistance to ABT-267 at Baseline was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared with the EC50 for the appropriate reference replicon (1a-H77 or 1b-Con1). Day 3 samples were analyzed using population sequencing and were compared with the baseline and appropriate prototypic reference sequences to assess AA changes. Phenotypic resistance at Day 3 was assessed by calculating the fold difference in the EC50 compared with the EC50 for the corresponding Baseline sample. The number of participants with variants at resistance-associated AA positions and phenotypic resistance at Baseline and Day 3 are presented.</description>
