  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With approval of the IRB at the Cleveland Clinic and written informed consent, the
      investigators propose to study up to 20 healthy volunteers in the protocol below as this will
      allow for drop-outs. As the investigators believe that 10 volunteers will provide sufficient
      power to detect clinically-meaningful differences between laminar air flow treatments.

      The study has been designed to find out whether heat loss increases significantly in laminar
      air flow operating rooms. Furthermore the investigators will find out whether active warming
      minimizes this heat loss. Increased heat loss increases the amount of perioperative
      hypothermia. It has been shown that perioperative hypothermia is associated with severe
      complications such as an increased incidence of surgical wound infections. On the other hand
      laminar air flow is explicitly used to decrease air-borne infections. Our study results will
      help to optimize thermal management of orthopedic patients.

    <description>Defining the within-volunteer difference in heat flux between laminar air flow 'on' and laminar air flow 'off' as the primary outcome of interest, we will use two linear regression models to perform analyses, respectively, for active warming and no active warming settings. Ambient temperature and relative humidity will be adjusted for within this linear model if they are not adequately balanced between the four experimental scenarios, on average (as determined by standard univariable summary statistics).</description>
