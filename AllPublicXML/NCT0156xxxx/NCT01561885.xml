  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if by providing a collaborative, integrated
      pathway-based healthcare compared to the usual healthcare, whether or not this would be
      superior in reducing the length of hospital stay across five high frequency /high risk
      medical diagnoses: Acute Venous Thromboembolism, Acute Kidney Injury, Community Acquired
      Pneumonia, Adult Left Ventricular Heart Failure, and Asthma.

    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. To date, there is a scarcity of
      randomized controlled trials looking at pathway-based, patient-centered healthcare versus
      usual care in several high-risk or high volume diagnoses that account for the vast majority
      of hospitalizations in medical settings.

      In this study, the pathway care intervention is a collaborative effort that involves
      healthcare professionals from multiple departments, including pharmacists, health educators,
      nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and quality management.

      For patients allocated to the usual care, these healthcare professionals will deliver
      standardized care when consulted. For pathway care patients, this collaborative healthcare
      will be default.

    <description>Patients who are randomly allocated to Pathway Care will be treated by the Pathway Clinical Teaching Unit as well as other collaborative healthcare professionals (pharmacists, nurses, health educators, nutritionists, and social workers). The Pathway Care physicians will have access to the Clinical Care Plan on the QuadraMed, which is a detailed, organized, day-to-day treatment plan that includes pre-set orders and medications. Physicians for the patients on Usual Care will not have access to this information, and the collaborative healthcare will only be provided upon consultation.</description>
