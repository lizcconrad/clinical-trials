  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with inadequate drainage of the aqueous
      humor via the trabecular meshwork towards the systemic circulation. This may lead to an
      increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose of glaucoma management is to
      lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic neuropathy and subsequent visual loss.
      Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering drug therapy. However, if IOP remains
      uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses despite controlled IOP, surgery may be
      indicated. Deep sclerectomy with a collagen implant (DSCI) is a non-penetrating surgical
      procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the enhancement of the aqueous
      outflow. This forms the rationale to conduct this prospective, open label study to assess the
      24-hour IOP fluctuation profile recorded with Triggerfish® in patients with POAG before and
      after DSCI.
