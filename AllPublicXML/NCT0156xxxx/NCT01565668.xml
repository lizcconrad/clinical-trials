    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate two doses of Quizartinib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia who are also FMS-like tyrosine kinase - internal tandem duplication (
      FLT3-ITD) positive. Patient will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment
      arms. Both treatment arms will receive Quizartinib but at different doses. The study
      treatment is taken orally in 28 day cycles until either disease progression occurs or an
      unacceptable toxicity occurs. In addition to the study assessments to evaluate the disease,
      blood will be drawn to measure drug levels and biomarkers. Patients will be followed for
      survival at three month intervals after the end of treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has morphologically documented primary AML or AML secondary to myelodysplastic
             syndrome (MDS) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, as
             determined by pathology review at the treating institution and has relapsed or is
             refractory after 1 second line (salvage) regimen or after HSCT

          -  Subject is positive for FLT3-ITD activating mutation in bone marrow or peripheral
             blood (&gt;10% allelic ratio)

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 2

          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease clearly documented by the investigator,
             the interval from prior treatment to time of AC220 administration will be at least 2
             weeks (14 days) for prior cytotoxic agents or at least 5 half-lives for prior
             noncytotoxic agents, including immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT

          -  Subject has uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including

          -  Subject has a pre-existing disorder predisposing the subject to a serious or
             life-threatening infection (e.g. cystic fibrosis, congenital or acquired
             immunodeficiency, bleeding disorder, or cytopenias not related to AML)

          -  Subject has an active uncontrolled acute or chronic systemic fungal, bacterial, viral,
             or other infection

          -  Subject has any of the following laboratory values:
