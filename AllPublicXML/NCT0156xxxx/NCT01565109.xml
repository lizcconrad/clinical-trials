  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated to 7300 the number of new cases of gastric cancer each year in France.

      According to a randomized trial comparing 3 cycles of ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin, 5FU)
      administered before surgery and 3 cycles after surgery with surgery alone in adenocarcinoma
      of the stomach and lower esophagus, clinical and experimental data are the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy is a new standard treatment for operable gastric cancer. This treatment with a
      median survival of more than 3 years to obtain a hazard ratio of 0.75 in favor of
      chemotherapy arm (p = 0.009). The 5-year survival being 36% for patients treated with
      chemotherapy versus 23% for surgery alone. Progression-free survival was also significantly
      prolonged with a hazard ratio of 0.66.

      The proposed clinical study by Ajani et al shows that the combination of Docetaxel with the
      schema Cisplatin - 5FU provides greater clinical benefit and induces to consider the triple
      combination as a reference treatment in metastatic gastric cancer in patients under 65 years.

      Preoperative radiochemotherapy is expected to increase the rate of curative resections,
      reduce gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity.

      Two studies evaluating the feasibility of preoperative RTCT in operable gastric
      adenocarcinoma with continuous 5GU (+ or - paclitaxel) and 45 Gy are available and the
      combination 5FU oxaliplatin has been assessed in the esophagus and rectum tumors.

      The NESC study, Phase II, proposes the following schema: 2 cycles of chemotherapy with
      Docetaxel - Cisplatin - 5FU then preoperative chemoradiation with oxaliplatin - continuous
      5FU and radiotherapy in locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma stage III and IV
      non-metastatic administered before surgery.
