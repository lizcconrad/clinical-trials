      Rationale: For the past 3 years the investigators have routinely used an axial subpleural
      tunneling technique that del

      Study Design: All patients over the age of 18 having an isolated thoracoscopic procedure
      performed at Inova Fairfax Hospital for therapeutic or diagnostics purposes will be screened.
      Patients will be excluded if they have: previous ipsilateral thoracic surgery, need for
      operative pleurectomy or pleurodesis, chronic use of pain medication, sedatives or hypnotics,
      drug allergies, liver dysfunction, renal dysfunction, history of peptic ulcerative disease,
      sleep apnea in need of Bipap, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), inability
      to consent, or are pregnant. All patients included will be screened, consented, and operated
      on by the one year anniversary of institutional review board (IRB) approval.

      Study Methodology: Eighty-six consented patients will be randomized into the study arm (use
      of a pain catheter with 0.125% bupivacaine) or the standard of care group (no pain catheter).
      The primary outcome is the use of narcotic pain medication post-operatively, compared between
      study groups. Secondary outcomes will include postoperative pain scores, hospital and length
      of stay.

      The On-Q pump delivers local anesthetic to the intercostal space, without leakage elsewhere,
      creating a functional multi level rib block. Despite positive subjective results, objective
      data is lacking. The investigators have also noted that some patients develop an annoying
      short term paresthesia that has been minimized by using lower anesthetic concentrations than
      described in other publications.

      Objectives: To evaluate visual analog pain scores post-operatively up to 30 days
      post-operative, and to determine any association between pain management and length of stay.

      Study Type: A prospective randomized 2-arm study will be performed. Statistical Methodology:
      Total amount of narcotic pain medication administered through postoperative day 7, will be
      compared between the study groups using student's t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
      Secondary outcomes, overall sum of pain scores through postoperative day 7, then at day 30
      post-operatively, hospital length of stay, and overall hospital cost, will also be compared
      among study groups using student's t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) has been shown to hasten patient recovery by
      attenuating the physiologic stress of surgery and decreasing post-operative pain. Despite
      this approach, incisions in the chest are proportionally more painful than in other parts of
      the body, and most patients require some form of narcotic pain medication.

      Multiple strategies for post-operative pain control have been attempted in thoracic surgery
      with no obvious superiority of one versus another. Pain catheters have been increasingly used
      over the past decade in different surgical procedures in order to minimize incisional pain
      for the first 3 to 7 days after an operation. The published literature is equivocal as to the
      efficacy of such approach following thoracic surgery with most recent series reporting no
      benefit in the use of these catheters. Of utmost importance is the placement techniques
      described thus far, which in our opinion, have been suboptimal.

      In order for a pain catheter to work, the infused local anesthetic has to constantly bathe
      the nerve in question thus preventing painful stimuli from being transmitted. It is hard to
      dispute the ability of local anesthetic to block pain conduction. Consequently, the success
      of the intervention is directly dependent on the placement technique to achieve such goal,
      hence the rationale for our study.

The catheter will contain an infusion of 0.125% bupivacaine. The single lumen pain catheter is infused by a self deflating pump filled to 335ml, which delivers the infusate at a rate of 4ml/h.

            <description>Patients in this arm will not receive a pain catheter in addition to the standard of care for pain management. Standard of care will consist of a standard balanced anesthetic consisting of midazolam 0.01-0.03mg/kg, induced with propofol (1-2mg/kg) or etomidate, fentanyl (1-2 mcg/kg) and rocuronium (0.1mg/kg) and maintained on a potent inhalation agent (sevoflurane 1.5%-2.5%) during procedures. Prior to emergence from anesthesia, patients will receive ketorolac 30mg IV once, neuromuscular reversal agents, and an antiemetic (ondansetron 4mg). Patients will be given additional narcotics (fentanyl) upon emergence, as needed, to facilitate patient comfort and extubation.
The ASA guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative period will also be provided. Patients shall receive 1,000 mg of acetaminophen orally every 6 hours, scheduled for 5 days. Other drugs will be given on as needed basis (PRN) to maintain an analog pain scale of ≤ 3.
