  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the potential ability of intranasal insulin to prevent
      post-operative cognitive decline and post-operative delirium in an elderly cardiac surgery
      population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions consist of adults &gt; 65 years old, an
      age group that is at high risk for developing cognitive decline and delirium in the ICU. Over
      50% and 70% of critically ill cardiac surgery patients develop post-operative delirium (POD)
      and post-operative cognitive decline (POCD), respectively. These two forms of acute cognitive
      dysfunction are associated with increased mortality and poor functional recovery. While
      distinct conditions, POD has been associated with the subsequent development of POCD,
      suggesting a mechanistic link.

      No proven pharmacologic treatments targeting the prevention of both POD and POCD in elderly
      patients exist to date. Recent data suggest that insulin administered into the central
      nervous system via intranasal delivery improves cognitive function in elderly patients with
      Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. However, its utility in preventing POD and
      POCD in elderly critically ill patients has not been investigated.

      The hypothesis of this study is that intranasal insulin can prevent POD and POCD in elderly
      critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit after undergoing cardiac surgery.
      To test this hypothesis, this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded Phase II study
      will enroll 60 patients &gt;= 65 years old undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft
      and/or valve surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, and will treat them with either 40 IU
      of aspart insulin or placebo intranasally before surgery and then four times a day for 7 days
      or until hospital discharge (whichever occurs first).
