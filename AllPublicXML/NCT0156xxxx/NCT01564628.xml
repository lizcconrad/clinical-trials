  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to optimize an already existing algorithm for diagnosing
      atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (CAD, Coronary Artery Disease).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acoustic information from the heart is obtained from patients referred to examination for
      Coronary Artery Disease. The acoustic signals are evaluated as indicators for CAD.
