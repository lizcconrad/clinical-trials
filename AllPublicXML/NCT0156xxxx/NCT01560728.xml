  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth with mental illnesses are disproportionately represented in juvenile correctional
      facilities and limited evidence exists about effective treatments in this setting. This study
      will adapt Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), a treatment found to be
      efficacious in community settings, to the correctional setting and study the feasibility of
      its implementation. Conducted within Texas youth correctional facilities, the findings will
      be rapidly disseminated in the state. The goal is to enhance the TF-CBT approach to meet the
      unique needs of incarcerated youth and the correctional system, one of the priorities
      outlined in the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan.
