      Study design

        -  Multicenter, double-dummy, double-blinded, randomized, Phase 4 study

        -  Patients will be randomized to either a study group or a control group in a 1:1 ratio,
           and will be orally administered the assigned drugs

      Study Objective

      -The study is designed to demonstrate that efficacy and safety of morning dosing of Simvast
      Controlled Release (CR) Tab is not inferior to evening dosing of Zocor Tab in patients with
      stage 3,4,5 chronic kidney disease with hyperlipidemia

      Primary objective

      -to assess the percent change of LDL-C at Week 8 from baseline in Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)
      stage 3,4,5 with hyperlipidemia subjects.

      The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:

        -  to assess the change and percent change of TC, HDL-C, TG from baseline.

        -  to assess the accomplishment rate of therapeutic goals based on the therapeutic guidance
           for hyperlipidemia of the Korean Society of Lipidology and Atherosclerosis.
