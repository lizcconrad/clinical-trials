  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open label, single arm study evaluating treatment with pazopanib post
      sunitinib treatment in 43 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients will
      receive 800mg pazopanib per day given continuously until disease progression. Patients must
      have received treatment with sunitinib and relapsed. Patient must have received prior
      treatment with sunitinib for at least 12 weeks. Prior treatment with either temsirolimus or
      everolimus in addition to sunitinib is allowed. The trial design uses a Simons two stage
      design with an interim analysis planned after the first 15 evaluable patients. If 8 or more
      of the first 15 evaluable patients remains disease free at 4 months, then a further 28
      patients will be enrolled for a total of 43 metastatic renal cell cancer patients. It is
      estimated that there could be up to 10% of patients dropping out and so to achieve the
      required number of 43 evaluable patients the study will recruit up to 48 patients to ensure
      that 43 complete if stage 2 is required.

      Patients will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of patient consent. Response assessments will be carried out every 8 weeks until
      disease progression. Safety assessments will be carried out every 4 weeks (plus a visit for
      liver function tests after 2 weeks) for the first six months and then every eight weeks until
      disease progression. A further safety assessment will be carried out 4 weeks after treatment
      discontinuation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific
             procedures or assessments, and must be willing to comply with treatment and follow up.

             Procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood
             count, imaging study) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be
             utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided these procedures are conducted as
             specified in the protocol.

             Note: It is not necessary that informed consent be obtained within the
             protocol-specified screening window.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years

          3. Diagnosis of metastatic/unresectable renal cell carcinoma of the clear cell type or
             with a component of clear cell histology

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1

          5. Measurable disease by RECIST criteria (Version 1.1)

          6. Eligible patients must have been treated with sunitinib for a minimum of 12 weeks (2
             cycles). Patients must have evidence of progressive disease following treatment with
             sunitinib as assessed by the site investigator on the basis of CT scans and other
             appropriate clinical documentation. Patients who received sunitinib for 12 weeks
             (2cycles) but stopped the drug due to toxicity rather than disease progression are
             also eligible for this study.

             The Investigator should be aware of the patient's intolerance/toxicity with prior
             sunitinib treatment and take this in to account when assessing eligibility for the
             pazopanib study.

             Patients who have had prior treatment with either temsirolimus or everolimus are also
             eligible for the trial.

             No other prior treatment with bevacizumab, sorafenib, immunotherapies, chemotherapy,
             biologic therapy or investigational therapy is allowed.

             Previous radiotherapy (RT) is permissible provided the measurable disease is outside
             the RT port. RT must be completed &gt; 2 weeks prior to registration.
