    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of The Maintenance Period in International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Maintenance Period (approximately 7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) was intended to evaluate, in a standardized way, the subjective intensity of major symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and, in 2 items (9 and 10), the impact of the disease on subjects functioning in daytime activities by use of a 5-point scale for each of a total of 10 items.
In all items, the scores ranged from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). A sum score across all 10 items was calculated for analysis, which varied between 0 (no RLS symptoms present at all) to 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline To The End Of Maintenance Period In Daytime Somnolence Domain Score Of The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale - Revised (MOS Sleep-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Maintenance Period (approximately 7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale-Revised (MOS Sleep-R) is a self-administered questionnaire measuring several important aspects of sleep that have been validated in both general and patient populations.
The MOS Sleep-R consists of 12-items. Responses for 10 of the 12 items are on a 5-point frequency scale with options ranging from &quot;all of the time&quot; to &quot;none of the time&quot;. The other two items ask about the length of time to fall asleep and the average number of hours slept per night. The sleep problems index I allows for the summary of sleep problems using an abbreviated six-item index, whereas the sleep problems index II uses nine of the 12 items of the scale to compute an overall sleep problem summary. A higher score on each scale in summary index represents a lack of sleep problems (better sleep quality). All scores are transformed linearly to range from 0 to 100, with the exception of the sleep quantity subscale, which is scored in hours.</description>

    <measure>Change In Total Score From Baseline To The End of Maintenance Period On Profile Of Mood States Questionnaire (POMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of Maintenance Period (approximately 7 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Profile of Mood States questionnaire (POMS) total score will be calculated as the sum of the scores for the following 5 scale scores (Tension-Anxiety, Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, Fatigue-Inertia, and Confusion-Bewilderment) and then subtracting the Vigor-Activity score. All factors have to be available for the total score to be calculated; otherwise the total score will be set to missing. The range for the POMS is 0 - 200 with a high score being negative and a low score being positive.
For the POMS questionnaire total score, descriptive statistics will be presented on both the observed and the change from Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period values for the Full Analysis Set (FAS).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End Of The Maintenance Period in International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) Sum Score</title>
        <description>The International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) was intended to evaluate, in a standardized way, the subjective intensity of major symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and, in 2 items (9 and 10), the impact of the disease on subjects functioning in daytime activities by use of a 5-point scale for each of a total of 10 items.
In all items, the scores ranged from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). A sum score across all 10 items was calculated for analysis, which varied between 0 (no RLS symptoms present at all) to 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End Of Maintenance Period In Daytime Somnolence Domain Score Of The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale - Revised (MOS Sleep–R)</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale–Revised (MOS Sleep–R) is a self-administered questionnaire measuring several important aspects of sleep that have been validated in both general and patient populations.
The MOS Sleep–R consists of 12-items. Responses for 10 of the 12 items are on a 5-point frequency scale with options ranging from “all of the time” to “none of the time”. The other two items ask about the length of time to fall asleep and the average number of hours slept per night. The sleep problems index I allows for the summary of sleep problems using an abbreviated six-item index, whereas the sleep problems index II uses nine of the 12 items of the scale to compute an overall sleep problem summary. A higher score on each scale in summary index represents a lack of sleep problems (better sleep quality). All scores are transformed linearly to range from 0 to 100, with the exception of the sleep quantity subscale, which is scored in hours.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline To The End of Maintenance Period In Sleep Disturbance Domain Score Of The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale - Revised (MOS Sleep-R)</title>
        <description>The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale–Revised (MOS Sleep–R) is a self-administered questionnaire measuring several important aspects of sleep that have been validated in both general and patient populations.
The MOS Sleep–R consists of 12-items. Responses for 10 of the 12 items are on a 5-point frequency scale with options ranging from “all of the time” to “none of the time”. The other two items ask about the length of time to fall asleep and the average number of hours slept per night. The sleep problems index I allows for the summary of sleep problems using an abbreviated six-item index, whereas the sleep problems index II uses nine of the 12 items of the scale to compute an overall sleep problem summary. A higher score on each scale in summary index represents a lack of sleep problems (better sleep quality). All scores are transformed linearly to range from 0 to 100, with the exception of the sleep quantity subscale, which is scored in hours.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a 36 item generic human research quality of life instrument that uses a recall period of 4 weeks. Items are grouped into 8 domains as follows: Physical Functioning (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items), Vitality (4 items), Social Functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), Mental Health (5 items), and a further unscaled single item (question 2) for perceived stability or change in health (Health Transition) during the last year. The norm-based scores (based on the US general population) were used for analysis. For the MCS, the lowest and highest possible scores are -9 and 82 (rounded).
The SF–36 domains (subscores) are scored so that a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Physical Component Summary Score</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a 36 item generic human research quality of life instrument that uses a recall period of 4 weeks. Items are grouped into 8 domains as follows: Physical Functioning (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items), Vitality (4 items), Social Functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), Mental Health (5 items), and a further unscaled single item (question 2) for perceived stability or change in health (Health Transition) during the last year. The norm-based scores (based on the US general population) were used for analysis. For the PCS, the lowest and highest possible scores are 1 and 81 (rounded).
The SF–36 domains (subscores) are scored so that a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
