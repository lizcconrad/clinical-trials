  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of JNS007ER 3-12 mg once daily in patients
      with schizophrenia over a long term period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week, multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention), non-controlled, arbitrary-dose study. The patients included in this study are
      those who participated in the preceding double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the
      treatment that the patient receives) comparative trial (study JNS007ER-JPN-S31) of JNS007ER
      and completed the study, or those who remained in the study up to the evaluation at 2 weeks
      and discontinued the study after that for insufficient treatment efficacy. The study will
      assess the safety of JNS007ER in the clinical recommended dose range in a long term
      treatment. The dosage will be started at 6 mg/day, and it can be increased or decreased 3 mg
      at a time depending on the patient's symptom within the range of 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day. For
      dose adjustments, the investigator will evaluate the psychiatric symptoms before defining the
      dose change.

      Detailed Description: Extended description of the protocol, including more technical
      information (as compared to the Brief Summary) if desired. Do not include the entire
      protocol; do not duplicate information recorded in other data elements, such as eligibility
      criteria or outcome measures.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS is a medical scale that assesses various symptoms of schizophrenia. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a patient. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
