  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study based on the hypothesis that kidney transplant patients treated
      with an immunosuppressive therapy based on an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin
      (m-TOR) may increase resistance to physical exercise, which would result in an improvement in
      the quality of life of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the present study is that, with respect to calcineurin inhibitors, the mTOR
      inhibitor-based immunosuppression may alter the physical exercise capacity in renal
      transplant patients.

      This is based on recent data obtained. Regarding metabolism there is evidence that inhibition
      of mTOR, reduces muscle glucose utilization, as well as, increase fatty acid oxidation. On
      the other hand, has shown that drugs based on mTOR inhibitors in the context of excess of
      nutrients improves intracellular glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. Through these
      mechanisms could increase resistance to physical exercise, which would result in an
      improvement in the quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, there isn't any paper that has
      explored this hypothesis accurately.
