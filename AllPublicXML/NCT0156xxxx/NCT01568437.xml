  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic gastric-bypass surgery (LGBS) is one of the surgical treatments for morbid
      obesity, which is performed under general anesthesia. TAP block is an analgesic strategy
      covering the dermatomes from T6 to L1 and consists of injecting local anesthetic in the TAP
      between the costal margin and the iliac crest, where the thoracolumbar nerves (T6-L1) are
      located. As far as the investigators know, this analgesic technique has never been studied in
      LGBS. The investigators objective is to determine whether an ultrasound (US)-guided TAP block
      provides improved analgesia during the first 24 hours after laparoscopic gastric-bypass
      surgery, compared to conventional therapy only.

    <description>On the ward, patients will be prescribed acetaminophen 1 g every 6 hours. If additional analgesia is required, patients will take oxycodone 5-10 mg up to every 2 hours or iv morphine. Patients with contraindications to oxycodone will be prescribed oral hydromorphone 1-2 mg instead. This is the current standard of care at Toronto Western Hospital.</description>

    <description>The TAP block will be performed after the induction, before the surgery, by an anesthesiologist with experience of at least 10 successful TAP blocks.Also patients will be prescribed acetaminophen 1 g every 6 hours. If additional analgesia is required, patients will take oxycodone 5-10 mg(oral hydromorphone 1-2 mg) up to every 2 hours or iv morphine.</description>

    <description>Block needle will be inserted out-of-plane to the ultrasound beam, perpendicular to the skin surface, until the tip lies deep between the fascia of the transversus abdominis muscle and the internal oblique muscle. 30 ml of the study solution in each side will be injected at this location and should be observed to spread in an anterior-posterior direction between two muscles. Each patient will receive a total dose of 60 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine (150 mg) + 1:200,000 epinephrine.</description>
