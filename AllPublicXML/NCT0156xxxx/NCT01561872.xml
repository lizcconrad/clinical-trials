  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2 URCC in the Limousin region will be equipped with the automated telesurveillance system.
      Patient will be selected by ward's geriatrician and randomized into two groups after informed
      consent. One group will have cameras installed and the other will not and will act as a
      comparison group. Patient will be assessed twice during the study, at admission in (inclusion
      visit) and at outcome from the URCC (end of study visit). Each assessment implies a standard
      geriatric assessment, a fall questionnaire, a Neuropsychiatric inventory for behavioral
      disturbances and a quality of life questionnaire (EQ5D). Every fall will be considered as
      adverse events and will therefore be listed along the study and characterized in types and
      number.
