  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness and atrophy are important consequences of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Although resistance exercises increase strength and muscle mass in patients
      with COPD, the response to training appears to be suboptimal in these individuals. A
      dysregulation in the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of muscle mass could play
      an important role in this phenomenon.

      Hypothesis: Proteins involved in muscle mass regulation will be less activated in the
      quadriceps of patients with COPD following the acute bout of resistance training exercise
      compared to healthy age-matched controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to investigate the impact of an acute bout of resistance training on key
      signaling pathways involved in the regulation of muscle mass in moderate to severe COPD (FEV1
      under 60% of predicted). Key proteins of signaling intramuscular pathways involved in protein
      synthesis and degradation will be measured before after 72 contractions of the quadriceps.
      The exercise protocol was designed to match the actual exercise prescription model use in the
      context of pulmonary rehabilitation. A squat, leg press and leg extension will be done at 80%
      of max with one minute rest between sets. A biopsy of the quadriceps will be done before and
      after exercise in order to measure phosphorylated kinases, total protein content and mRNA
      expressions. All our patients will undergo a thorough baseline assessment in pulmonary
      capacity, muscle force and body composition.

The phosphorylated as well as the total protein levels will be measured by western blot. The data will be presented as arbitrary units and compared with values obtained in healthy age-matched healthy controls.</description>
