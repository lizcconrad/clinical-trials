      Purpose: To assess the effectiveness of global postural reeducation relative to segmental
      exercises in the treatment of scapular dyskinesis with cervicalgia.

      Methods: Participants with scapular dyskinesis and cervicalgia (n = 30) aged 18 to 65 years
      were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Global Postural Reeducation and Segmental
      Exercises(stretching and strengthening). Upper extremity was assessed using the Disabilities
      of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Function of the neck was estimated using
      the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Pain severity was measured using a Visual Analogical Scale.
      Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the Short Form (SF)-12. Assessments
      were conducted at baseline and after 10 weekly sessions (60 minutes each). Significance level
      was established at 5%.
