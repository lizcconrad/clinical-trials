  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some nerve and muscle disorders that start early in life (before age 25), like some forms
      of muscular dystrophy, can run in families. However, the genetic causes of these disorders
      are not known. Also, doctors do not fully understand how symptoms of these disorders change
      over time. Researchers want to learn more about genetic nerve and muscle disorders that start
      in childhood by studying affected people and their family members, as well as healthy
      volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To better understand nerve and muscle disorders that start early in life and run in
      families.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 4 weeks old with childhood-onset muscular and nerve disorders,
           including those who have a later onset of a disorder that typically has childhood onset.

        -  Affected and unaffected family members of the individuals with muscular and nerve
           disorders.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 4 weeks old with no nerve or muscle disorders.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Genetic
           information will be collected from blood, saliva, cheek swab, or skin samples. Urine
           samples may also be collected.

        -  Healthy volunteers and unaffected family members will have imaging studies of the
           muscles. These studies will include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound
           scans. Results will be compared with those from the affected participants.

        -  All participants with nerve and muscle disorders will have multiple tests, including the
           following:

        -  Imaging studies of the muscles, including ultrasound and MRI scans.

        -  Imaging studies of the bones, such as x-rays and DEXA scans.

        -  Heart and lung function tests.

        -  Eye exams.

        -  Nerve and muscle electrical activity tests and biopsies.

        -  Video and photo image collection of affected muscles.

        -  Speech, language, and swallowing evaluation.

        -  Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid for study.

        -  Tests of movement, attention, thinking, and coordination.

        -  Participants with nerve and muscle disorders will return to the Clinical Center every
           year. They will repeat the tests and studies at these visits.

      Objective:

      To diagnose patients with neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders with congenital or
      pediatric onset (phase 1 of the protocol) and to study the natural history and mechanism of
      disease in neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders of childhood (phase 2 of the protocol).

      Study Population:

      Patients with childhood onset neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders, their affected and
      unaffected family members, and healthy volunteers. Patients with later onset of a disorder
      that is known to typically have childhood onset will be included as well.

      Design:

      Diagnostic and prospective longitudinal natural history study.

      Outcome Measures:

      Diagnose and characterize patients with neuromuscular and neurogenetic disorders with
      congenital or pediatric onset and study the natural history and underlying disease mechanism.
      In the characterized patient population identify and develop effective outcome measures for
      use in future clinical trials, including applicable motor scales, quality of life scales,
      biomarkers from blood and urine, imaging studies, and pulmonary function tests.
