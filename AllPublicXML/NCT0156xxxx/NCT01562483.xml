  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent postsurgical abdominal pain (PPAP) is a very difficult to treat pain. This pain
      can persist for months or even years and significantly diminishes quality of life. The exact
      underlying cause for this pain persistence is still unclear, which makes its treatment still
      a challenge. The promising analgesic effects of Δ9-THC in previous research, plus the
      improved bioavailability of Namisol® in comparison with previous Δ9-THC substances form the
      basis of the present research proposal.

      The current study aims to investigate the analgesic efficacy of Namisol® as add-on analgesic
      during a long-term treatment (52 days) of persistent postsurgical abdominal pain.
