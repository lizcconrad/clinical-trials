    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of MultiPoint Pacing (MPP) on cardiac
      hemodynamics assessed by pressure-volume loop during MPP at implant. NYHA functional class
      assessment and echocardiographic measurements are performed at 3 months and 12 months
      post-implant to characterize long-term effect of MPP.
