    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical study will be conducted to evaluate effects of different doses of
      hepatitis B vaccines in low or non-response population in China. 650 low or non-response
      subjects after hepatitis B vaccination will be enrolled under the premise of informed
      consent. 200 subjects aged 1-17 years will be divided into 3 groups and 450 subjects aged
      18-65years will be divided into 4 groups. Group 1/2/3 will receive 3 doses of vaccine on day
      0,30 and 180, with 5ug/10ug/20ug HBs-Ag respectively. Group 4 will receive 1 dose of vaccine
      with 60ug HBs-Ag, low or nonresponse subjects of which will receive the second dose by an
      interval of at least 28 days. All vaccinations will be done by specific study personnel, who
      do not take part in the assessment of safety or immunogenicity. Adverse events will be
      recorded after vaccination and blood samples were collected at day 30 after each vaccination
      for antibody detection.

      The clinical program approved by the ethics committee will be performed by the researchers
      independently. Inspectors designated by the sponsor will take meticulous on-site audits to
      ensure the safety specifications during the whole process of research.
