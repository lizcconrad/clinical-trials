      This is a phase I/II protocol aiming at the assessment of the safety and efficacy of ARSA
      gene transfer into hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells for the treatment of Metachromatic
      Leukodystrophy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive Lysosomal Storage Disorder (LSD)
      characterized by severe and progressive dysmyelination affecting the central and peripheral
      nervous system.

      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is ineffective in ameliorating patients' phenotype
      or delaying disease evolution. No evidences of efficacy of enzyme replacement strategies are
      available at the moment. Transplantation of genetically corrected autologous hematopoietic
      stem cells (HSC) could represent a novel and potentially efficacious treatment for MLD
      patients.

      We are conducting a gene therapy clinical trial based on autologous HSC and advanced
      generation lentiviral vectors (LV) for patients affected by the most severe, early onset
      forms of the disease, based on our preclinical efficacy and safety data and on the experience
      we acquired from the treatment of Adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID) patients by a
      similar approach. Our general goal is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of this gene therapy
      approach in MLD patients. We have developed and tested a clinically applicable LV containing
      the ARSA cDNA controlled by a constitutive eukaryotic promoter sequence. Preclinical studies
      aimed at assessing efficacy and safety of ARSA gene transfer using the selected vector have
      been conducted in the murine model of the disease and in progenitors and mature hematopoietic
      cells from MLD patients. The following results were obtained:

        1. efficient ARSA gene transfer;

        2. long term in vitro and in vivo multilineage ARSA expression;

        3. ability to prevent and correct neurological disease manifestations;

        4. good tolerance and long-term safety of the treatment in the animal model.

      We expect to treat 20 patients, selected according to disease severity and clinical features.
      A myeloablative conditioning regimen based on iv Busulfan will be administered to the
      patients to enable engraftment of the transduced stem/progenitor cells in the bone marrow and
      enhance CNS microglia/macrophage repopulation by the transduced cell progeny. An efficient
      transduction protocol based on LVs has been optimized to guarantee abundant ARSA expression
      in the transduced patients' HSC and their progeny. In the treated patients, we will study the
      short-term and long-term safety of the administration of the autologous transduced HSC, their
      long-term engraftment, the expression of vector-derived ARSA, and the ability of the
      transduced cells to provide a clinical benefit to the patients. The treated patients will be
      followed for 3 years and thereafter monitored for the safety of gene therapy for additional 5
      years. If successful, this study will provide key results on the safety and efficacy of gene
      therapy for MLD patients.
