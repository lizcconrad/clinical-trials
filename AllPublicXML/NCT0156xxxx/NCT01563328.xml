    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3
      clinical development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
      Co-infection with Hepatitis C (HCV) is common in HIV-infected subjects therefore it is
      expected that DTG will be coadministered with treatments for HCV. Boceprevir (BCV) and
      Telaprevir (TVR) are protease inhibitors for the treatment of HCV that were recently approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency (FDA/EMA) and have rapidly been
      adopted to &quot;standard of care&quot; in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavarin. This is
      a single-center, open-label, two-cohort, two-period, one-way, study in healthy adult
      subjects. A total of approximately 32 subjects will be enrolled, in order to obtain 24
      evaluable subjects (12 per cohort). In the first treatment period, all subjects will receive
      DTG 50 mg once daily for 5 days (treatment A). In period 2, subjects will receive DTG 50 mg
      once daily plus either BCV 800 mg q8h (treatment B) for 10 days or TVR 750 mg q8h (treatment
      C) for 10 days. There will be no washout between treatments. Safety evaluations and serial PK
      samples will be collected during each treatment period.

      Subjects will have a screening visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug,
      two treatment periods, and a follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug.

      This study will be conducted at one center in the US, with healthy adult male and female
      subjects.

             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%). A single repeat is
             allowed for eligibility determination.

          -  Single QTcB &lt;or= 450 msec. A single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination.

             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator agrees
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures. Subjects with haemoglobin, WBC or neutrophil
             count values outside the normal range should always be excluded from enrollment. A
             single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination.

             an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator)
             prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the follow-up visit.

        ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
