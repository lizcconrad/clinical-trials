    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental study design was chosen to compare the model of hypertension management
      at commune-level with conventional management for people with high blood pressure in two
      communes (one for intervention versus one for reference).

      A intervention model included the commune-based programme on hypertension management combined
      with comprehensive health promotion campaigns

    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental study design was chosen: two communes were purposively selected from
      Ba-Vi setting: Phu-Phuong for reference and Phu-Cuong for intervention communes A
      hypertension management programme and the nested comprehensive health promotion campaigns
      were implemented simultaneously in Phu-Cuong while nothing performed in Phu-Phuong except for
      local conventional healthcare services.

      The health promotion campaigns aimed at smoking cessation, reduction of alcohol consumption,
      encourage of unsalted diet and physical activity, all of which targeted to every local
      inhabitants.

      The hypertension management programme focused on monthly check-ups, drug delivery and
      individual lifestyle consultation, all of which targeted to hypertensives only.

      Baseline cross-sectional survey was used to assess cardiovascular pattern in local community
      before intervention and recruit people with high blood pressure for the management programme
      in intervention commune Repeated cross-sectional surveys were used to evaluate the impacts of
      health promotion.

      Cohort study on hypertensives was used to evaluate the impacts of the management programme.
