  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Significance: Adverse drug events (ADE) are the most common of all healthcare
      associated adverse events. Transitions between inpatient and ambulatory care can lead to ADE
      and avoidable healthcare utilization affecting up to 20% of patients. Insufficient monitoring
      has been identified as a particularly common cause of preventable and ameliorable ADE. The
      Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has called for a
      process to &quot;accurately and completely reconcile medications across the continuum of care.&quot;
      Inpatient computerized medication reconciliation tools have shown great potential, but little
      is known about successful medication reconciliation strategies immediately post-discharge.
      One promising solution to outpatient medication reconciliation is the use of secure
      electronic communication (SEC) between patients, accessing their personal health record via a
      web portal, and providers within an electronic health record. Surveys have consistently found
      that patients want to communicate with their primary care providers via SEC, and SEC is
      rapidly becoming a standard feature in electronic health records. A SEC-based approach to
      outpatient medication reconciliation following hospital discharge has the potential to
      improve patient safety, but important questions must be addressed, including: What
      information needs to be included in the SEC? What elements of the SEC are essential to its
      design? How can SEC be best incorporated into the workflow of the primary care office
      practice? Will patients and physicians find this approach acceptable? To address these
      questions, we propose a one-year pilot study at VA Boston with the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To evaluate the primary care environment's receptivity to secure electronic
      communication (SEC) for medication reconciliation and design a prototype SEC. We will use
      qualitative methods to characterize the primary care clinic environment - the physical space
      and facilities, the workflow, the resources, as well as the knowledge, attitudes and skills
      of staff and, most importantly, the patients. Specific approaches will include in-depth
      interviews, direct ethnographic observations, and visualization methods Aim 2. To develop a
      prototype SEC for medication reconciliation through a participatory design process, involving
      primary care clinicians, staff and patients working collaboratively with the research team,
      and to test the usability and acceptability of the prototype SEC among a sample of patients
      and primary care clinicians.

      Research and Development Plan: With extensive experience in designing and evaluating health
      care informatics innovations, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with expertise from
      primary care internal medicine, clinical informatics, health services research, qualitative
      research, clinical pharmacy, nursing and industrial engineering. This team will carry out a
      formative evaluation and develop a prototype of a secure electronic message to facilitate
      medication reconciliation following hospital discharge. The proposed CIMIT project will
      leverage the resources and expertise of the e-Health QUERI (a national VA program for
      innovation and evaluation of the VA's e-Health programs) at VA Boston and other participating
      VA facilities nationwide. The figure below shows a very rough conceptualization of the SEC
      that will guide the qualitative research and participatory design of the prototype. This
      project will lay the foundation for a future rigorous evaluation of this approach to
      medication reconciliation and improving patient safety.

      Adverse drug events (ADE) are the most common of all healthcare-associated adverse events1
      and commonly occur after hospitalization when multiple changes to medication regimens take
      place in the context of poor patient education, inadequate information transfer and delayed
      continuity of care. Medication reconciliation - i.e., any intentional process to resolve
      discrepancies between what medications the patient is taking and what medications the health
      care team thinks the patient is taking - has been designated a &quot;National Patient Safety Goal&quot;
      since 2005.2-6 Recent studies examining inpatient computerized medication reconciliation
      tools and pharmacist-facilitated medication reconciliation programs at hospital discharge
      have shown promising results. However, little is known about successful medication
      reconciliation strategies following discharge, representing an untapped point of leverage to
      improve medication safety.

      With recently awarded seed funding, and in collaboration with the Department of Veterans'
      Affairs (VA) nationwide Medication Reconciliation Initiative, we are developing an
      informatics-based tool for medication reconciliation following hospital discharge by secure,
      e-mail-like communication: the Secure Messaging for Medication Reconciliation Tool (SMMRT).
      In this proposed study, we plan to pilot the SMMRT prototype through My HealtheVet (MHV), the
      VA's secure personal health record and web portal, among 50 Veterans at VA Boston, with the
      following two Specific Aims:

      Specific Aim 1: Refine the existing SMMRT prototype and integrate it into MHV's secure
      messaging web-interface, with authentication of secure two-way communication between patient
      and primary healthcare team. We will use a participatory and patient-centered process
      involving the primary care clinicians, pharmacists, nurses, other staff members and Veterans
      working collaboratively with the research team to establish the usability and acceptability
      of the prototype SMMRT.

      Specific Aim 2: Pilot the SMMRT prototype, refined through Specific Aim 1, among 50 Veterans
      with primary care relationships and hospitalized at our facility. Veterans will be recruited
      prior to hospital discharge, enrolled in MHV if necessary, and trained in the use of secure
      messaging and specifically the SMMRT tool.

      This study will benefit from a recently funded preliminary study (Veterans' Engineering
      Resource Center seed funding, $25,000), in enabling us to analyze the primary care
      environment's receptivity to SMMRT-based post-discharge medication reconciliation, focusing
      on staff activation and education, workflow optimization to incorporate staff and clinicians
      managing SMMRT's incoming and outgoing messages, and coordination with MHV staff to ensure
      continued successful software integration.

      This proposed CIMIT-funded study will lead to a refined and strengthened intervention to
      enhance the preliminary use of SMMRT, as well as qualitative results that will constitute the
      foundation of an investigator-initiated research proposal alongside a full-scale
      implementation of SMMRT into MHV for Veterans nationwide.
