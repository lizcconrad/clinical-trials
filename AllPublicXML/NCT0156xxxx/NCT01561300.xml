    <textblock>
      Flow mediated dilation (FMD) is a non-invasive measurement technique performed using
      ultrasound equipment to measure hyperaemia induced dilation of blood vessels. Evidence from
      prospective studies suggests that FMD is independently inversely associated with
      cardiovascular events.

FMD measurement included the following steps:

5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg, just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of the occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage) FMD was calculated as maximal percentage change in diameter of the artery above the baseline value after the release of the occlusion</description>

    <description>Tea extract: 1800 mg/day standardized Brooke Bond black tea extract equivalent to 400 mg flavonoids dissolved in 240 ml hot water.
Products will be consumed for 8 days. On measurement days tea will be given to the subjects as a single acute dose and 2 grams of sugar will be added.
On day 2-7 subjects will consume 3 cups or tea, each prepared with 800 mg product in 80 ml of boiling water and sugar added to subject's taste. First cup of tea will be taken as morning tea, 2nd at breakfast and 3rd in the evening. No milk will be added.</description>

        <description>Change in flow mediated dilation (FMD) due to tea consumption when compared to control.
FMD measurement included the following steps:
1 minute base scan to measure the baseline diameter of artery (baseline)
5 minutes of forearm occlusion at 300±30 mmHg, just below the elbow 2-5 cm from antecubital crease
4 minutes FMD scan, which started immediately after release of the occlusion (reactive hyperaemia stage) FMD was calculated as maximal percentage change in diameter of the artery above the baseline value after the release of the occlusion</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline day 1 to 2 hours post consumption on day 8.</time_frame>
        <population>Per protocol based on the full data set excluding one subject who did produce relevant data (AE) and three subjects who were removed during blind review (operator comments, hypertension and increase in body weight). Single data points were removed for 6 subjects (all single data points) based on operator comments.</population>
