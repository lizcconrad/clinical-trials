      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of Semuloparin
      [AVE5026] (assessed from the anti-Xa activity of Semuloparin) in children in order to
      determine the dose to be assessed in a clinical efficacy/safety study in this population.

      Secondary Objective:

      - To assess the tolerability of Semuloparin when administered at a weight-adjusted, once
      daily dose for up to 30 days in patients less than 18 years of age with central venous line.

      The maximum study duration for a participant was 68 days broken down as follows:

        -  Screening period: up to 6 days,

        -  Treatment period: minimum 6 days and maximum 30 days,

        -  Follow-up period with an end of study visit performed 4 weeks (30 +/-2 days) post
           treatment.

      Enrollment staggered by age group starting with the older children (≥12 years). In each
      younger age group, enrolment was planned to initiate only following a review by the Data
      Monitoring Committee (DMC) of the clinical safety data and available PK and PD data from the
      first 3 out of 7 children from the previous older age group. Enrollment of infants &lt;3 months
      was planned to initiate after recruitment of all patients ≥3 months had been completed and
      all data analyzed by the DMC.
