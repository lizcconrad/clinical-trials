  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactobacilli are commensal bacteria common to the gut of all mammals studied and
      traditionally associated with foods are considered safe.The established safe use on a
      diversity of foods and supplement products worldwide supports this conclusion. Lactobacillus
      reuteri is one species of Lactobacillus that naturally inhabits the gastrointestinal tract of
      humans and is one of the few autochthonous (indigenous) Lactobacillus species in infants as
      well as adults.

      Although the tolerability of DSM 17938 in a tablet formulation has earlier been established,
      it is desirable to repeat the assessment in this novel formulation.
