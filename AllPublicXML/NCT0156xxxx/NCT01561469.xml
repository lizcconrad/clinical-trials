      The objective of this study is to review the local management of patients with
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus hospital-acquired pneumonia treated with
      vancomycin or linezolid with the goal to define if any difference exists among these
      antimicrobials in regard to clinical and economic outcomes.

        This non-interventional study will retrospectively evaluate patients with documented MRSA
        hospital-acquired including ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with linezolid or
        vancomycin with incorporation of 100 patients in the vancomycin arm and 100 patients in the
        linezolid arm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be enrolled in the study if they fulfill the following three inclusion
        criteria:

          1. Protocol criteria for HAP/VAP: Criteria for making a correct diagnosis of HAP will be
             met if the patient develops a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate associated with
             at least two of the following: new or increased respiratory symptomatology (cough,
             sputum or tracheal secretions, shortness of breath), fever or hypothermia,
             leukocytosis, left shift, or leukopenia, or deterioration of pulmonary function.

          2. Isolation of MRSA from a respiratory sample or blood culture within 48 hours of the
             diagnosis of HAP/VAP

          3. Treatment of MRSA HAP/VAP with either vancomycin or linezolid with incorporation of
             100 patients in the vancomycin arm and 100 patients in the linezolid arm

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients not meeting enrollment criteria.
