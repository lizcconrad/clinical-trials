    <description>A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred after the first administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP), and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia or minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes: requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes: able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at one site in the United States of America (USA).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were on basal-bolus insulin regimens at screening using insulin glargine (IGlar) and either insulin aspart (IAsp) or insulin lispro (ILis). During the run-in period, IGlar 100 U/mL was administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily (OD) in the morning (before breakfast) along with IAsp 100 U/mL as meal-time insulin.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>IDeg/IGlar</title>
          <description>The trial included 2 treatment periods of 6 weeks each in a cross-over design, and a follow-up visit no less than 7 days after the last treatment visit. Total trial duration for the individual subject was 18 weeks.
All randomised subjects were scheduled for 12 weeks of treatment with the trial products. After 6 weeks of treatment in period A, the subjects were crossed over to 6 weeks of the other treatment in period B.
Upon completing the 4-week run-in period, subjects randomised to the IDeg/IGlar treatment sequence received an morning dose of IDeg OD (100 U/mL, 3 mL prefilled pen) along with mealtime dosing of IAsp (100 U/mL, prefilled pen) subcutaneously (under the skin) for 6 weeks in treatment period A. Upon completion of treatment Period A, subjects crossed over to Period B and received a morning dose of IGlar OD (100 U/mL, SoloStar® prefilled pen) in combination with mealtime dosing of IAsp (100 U/mL, prefilled pen) subcutaneously (under the skin) for 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Treatment Emergent Confirmed Hypoglycaemic Episodes</title>
        <description>A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred after the first administration of investigational medicinal product (IMP), and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia or minor hypoglycaemic episodes. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes: requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes: able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>
        <time_frame>Hypoglycemic episodes reported within each 6 week treatment period.</time_frame>
        <population>The SAS included all subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational product or its comparator.</population>

Total trial duration for the individual subject was 18 weeks.
Treatment period A: Subjects from run-in period were randomised to insulin degludec (IDeg) OD (100 U/mL, 3 mL prefilled pen, morning dose) administered subcutaneously (under the skin) in combination with mealtime IAsp (100 U/mL, pre-filled pen) for 6 weeks.
Treatment period B: Subjects (from treatment period A) were crossed over to IGlar OD (100 U/mL, SoloStar® prefilled pen, morning dose) in combination with mealtime IAsp (100 U/mL, s.c., prefilled pen) for 6 weeks.</description>
