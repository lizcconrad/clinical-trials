      Design:

      Clinical randomised non blinded controlled trial.

      Setting:

      The study was performed in an outpatient primary health care centre serving 36 000
      inhabitants.

      Participants:

      Patients (n=278), aged 18-65 years, with common mental problems or disorders were referred to
      the study by the GPs and 245 were included in the study.

      Interventions:

      Participants were randomised to CAU or one of two group interventions in addition to CAU.
      These were: a) group cognitive behavioural based therapy (CBT) administered by psychologists
      once a week for 12 weeks, and b) group multimodal intervention (MMI) based on a protocol
      comprising a mix of existing group interventions and exercises borrowed from multiple
      techniques and therapeutic schools and administered by assistant nurses with brief training,
      including two sessions per week for 6 weeks.

      Main outcome measures:

      Primary outcome measure was the Mental Component Summary score of SF-36. Secondary outcome
      measures were perceived stress scale (PSS) and Self-Rating Scale for Affective Syndromes
      (CPRS-S-A)
