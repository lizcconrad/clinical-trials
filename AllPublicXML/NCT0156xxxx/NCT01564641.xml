        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical condition included in the approved Indications For Use for the iDuo® G2

          2. Bicompartmental osteoarthritis defined as Medial and patellofemoral osteoarthritis, or
             Lateral and patellofemoral arthritis as confirmed by the investigator's assessment of
             disease status at screening visit. Disease status is assessed by Clinical and
             Radiographic assessment. In addition, CT arthrogram assessment may be utilized for
             diagnosis.

          3. Willingness to participate in the clinical study, to give informed consent and to
             attend all follow-up visits

          4. &gt; 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. BMI &gt; 40

          2. Active malignancy (defined as a history of any invasive malignancy - except
             non-melanoma skin cancer), unless patient has been treated with curative intent and
             there have been no clinical signs or symptoms of the malignancy for at least 5 years

          3. Poorly controlled diabetes

          4. Neuromuscular conditions which prevent patient from participating in study activities

          5. Active local or systemic infection

          6. Immunocompromised

          7. Fibromyalgia or other general body pain related condition

          8. Rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease

          9. Loss of bone or musculature, osteonecrosis, neuromuscular or vascular compromise in
             the area of the joint to be operated to an extent that the procedure is unjustified

         10. Diagnosed or receiving treatment for Osteoporosis

         11. Other physical disability affecting the hips, spine, or contralateral knee

         12. Severe instability due to advanced loss of osteochondral structure

         13. Prior arthroplasty of the affected knee

         14. Compromised ACL, PCL or collateral ligament

         15. Severe fixed valgus or varus deformity of &gt;15º

         16. Extensor lag &gt; 15 º

         17. Fixed flexion contracture ≥ 10 º

         18. Prior history of failed implant surgery of the joint to be treated, including high
             tibial osteotomy (HTO)

         19. Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements

         20. Participation in another clinical study which would confound results

         21. If during intra-op, it is noted that the patient has tri-compartmental disease, then
             the patient is considered a screen fail
