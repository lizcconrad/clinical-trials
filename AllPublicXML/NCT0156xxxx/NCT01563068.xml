  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcipotriene is a vitamin D3 analog that has been used as topical therapy in adult subjects
      with plaque-type psoriasis since 1993. Calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, was approved in 2010 for
      the treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults aged 18 years and older. The current study is a
      multicenter study in which adolescent subjects (ages 12 to 16 years, inclusive) or their
      primary caregivers will apply calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, as a thin layer to treatment areas
      of the body and scalp, excluding the face, under maximal use conditions, twice a day for 14
      days and once on Day 15. The safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of
      calcipotriene will be evaluated

      This Phase 1 multicenter, open-label, repeat-dose study is designed to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of calcipotriene foam, 0.005%, applied
      topically to adolescent subjects with moderate plaque psoriasis (defined as a score of 3 on
      the Investigator's Static Global Assessment [ISGA]) involving a minimum of 10% body surface
      area (BSA) excluding the face and scalp, and a minimum of 20% scalp involvement. Subjects
      will be enrolled no more than 2 weeks after Screening. Approximately 30 eligible subjects,
      ages 12 to 16 years, inclusive, will be enrolled to ensure 20 completing subjects.
      Calcipotriene foam will be applied as a thin layer twice a day for 14 days and once on Day 15
      on all treatment areas. Blood samples for the evaluation of albumin adjusted calcium, intact
      parathyroid hormone (iPTH), alkaline phosphatase, magnesium, and phosphorus will be taken at
      Screening and on Day 1 (before the first dose), Day 15 (3 to 9 hours after dosing), and on
      Day 22 if the results from Day 15 show any abnormalities. Serum 25-OH vitamin D
      concentrations will be evaluated on Day 1 (before the first dose). Safety and tolerability
      will be evaluated throughout the treatment period and a 7 day follow-up period. Blood samples
      for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be collected on Days 1 and 15. Urine samples for
      evaluation of calcium/creatinine ratio will be collected before dosing on Days 1 and 15.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, ages 12 to 16 years, inclusive, at the time of consent.

          2. Plaque psoriasis involving 10% body surface area (excluding the scalp and face).

          3. 20% scalp involvement (excluding the body and face).

          4. Clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, as defined by an ISGA score
             at Screening of 3 on a scale of 0 to 4.

          5. The ability and willingness of the subject and the subject's primary caregiver to
             follow all study procedures, attend all scheduled visits, and successfully complete
             the study.

        5. The subject's parent(s) or legal guardian must have the ability to understand and sign a
        written informed consent form and a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
        (HIPAA) authorization form, which must be obtained prior to participation in this study.

             Acceptable methods of contraception include one of the following highly effective
             methods of contraception (ie, Pearl Index &lt;1.0%): complete abstinence from intercourse
             or 2 forms of barrier contraception (diaphragm plus spermicide for females, condom
             plus spermicide for males), or systemic contraceptives (combined or progesterone only)
             used in combination with a condom. The subject must agree to use an acceptable method
             of contraception from 2 weeks prior to administration of study product, throughout the
             study, and for 28 days after completion or premature discontinuation from the study.
