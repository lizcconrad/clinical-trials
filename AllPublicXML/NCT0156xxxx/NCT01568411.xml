        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to give written, signed informed consent

          2. Male and female subjects 18 to 50 years of age (inclusive)

          3. Body mass index 19 to 30 kg/m2 (inclusive), and weigh at least 55 kg

          4. No clinically important abnormal physical findings at the screening or Period 1, Day
             -1 examinations

          5. Normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). These will be measured after resting
             seated or supine for approximately 5 minutes. Normal BP is defined as 90 to 140 mm Hg
             systolic and 50 to 85 mm Hg diastolic. Normal HR is defined as 45 to 90 beats per
             minute

          6. Negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody within the last 3 months (documentation must be
             provided for confirmation)

          7. No clinically relevant abnormalities in the results of Screening or Period 1, Day -1
             laboratory evaluations

          8. Ability to communicate effectively with the Investigator and to comply with all study
             requirements, restrictions, and direction of the clinic staff

          9. For women of childbearing potential, documentation of a negative serum pregnancy test
             at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Period 1, Day -1. Female subjects
             should not be breast feeding. All female subjects of childbearing potential must be
             using a highly effective method of birth control during the study and for at least 1
             month after completion of study drug dosing. A highly effective method of birth
             control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., &lt;1% per year) when
             used consistently and correctly, such as condom + diaphragm, condom + spermicide,
             diaphragm + spermicide, or IUD with documented failure rate of &lt;1% per year, or
             oral/injectable/implanted hormonal contraceptives used in combination with an
             additional double barrier method, or sexual abstinence. Women are considered to be not
             of childbearing potential if they have had a total hysterectomy or bilateral tubal
             ligation or are at least 2 years postmenopausal

         10. All male subjects must agree to use a highly effective method of birth control with
             partners of childbearing potential during the study and for 1 month after study dosing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have evidence or history of clinically significant allergic (except for untreated,
             asymptomatic, seasonal allergies at time of dosing), hematological, endocrine,
             pulmonary, GI, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or neurological disease

          2. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., previous surgery on the GI
             tract [including removal of parts of the stomach, bowel, liver, gall bladder, or
             pancreas])

          3. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would confound or
             interfere with study participation; evaluation of safety, tolerability, or PK of the
             investigational drug; or prevent compliance with the study protocol

          4. Have participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or medical
             device) within 30 days (or 5 half lives of the investigational drug if longer than 30
             days) prior to Screening, or are currently participating in another trial of an
             investigational drug (or medical device), or intending to participate in another trial
             of an investigational drug (or medical device) before completion of all scheduled
             safety evaluations in this trial

          5. Unwilling to abstain from ingestion of caffeine or xanthine containing products (e.g.,
             tea, coffee, chocolate, cola, etc.) beginning 48 hours before the dosing of study
             medication (Day 1) until the final PK sample in each period

          6. History of hypersensitivity to drugs with a clinically significant reaction

          7. Any history of alcoholism or drug abuse (in the past year) or positive screen for
             drugs of abuse or alcohol at Screening or Day -1 of each period.

          8. Unwilling to abstain from alcohol beginning 48 hours prior to study dose
             administration (Day 1) until the collection of the final PK sample in each period.

          9. Use or have used tobacco containing products (e.g., cigarettes, cigars, chewing
             tobacco, snuff, etc.) within 6 months prior to Screening

             P gp [e.g., St John's Wort, rifampin, cyclosporine, or ritonavir]) or five half lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to Period 1, Day −1 or required continuing use during
