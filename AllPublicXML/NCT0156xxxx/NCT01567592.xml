  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal studies to induce local growth of new
      blood vessels from existing ones.

      The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve the symptoms of patients
      with refractory angina not amenable to revascularization with angioplasty or bypass surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves (1/10 the ones used in Lithotripsy) are delivered to myocardial
      ischemic tissue. Shockwaves are created by a special generator and are focused using a
      shockwave applicator device. The treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment.
      The shockwaves are delivered in synchronization with Patient R-wave to avoid arrhythmias. The
      treatment is painless.

      At first, the patient undergoes stress- SPECT testing to identify the ischemic areas.
      Following that, the same area is localized by the ultra-sound device and the shockwaves are
      focused to the ischemic area. Several treatments are required for optimal results.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. The patient will have an acoustic window to the myocardium by echocardiography. 4
             chamber view (4CH), 2 chamber view (2CH), long axis (LAX) and short axis view (SAX)
             should be verified.

          2. Patient is diagnosed with chronic angina pectoris. Diagnosis is based on medical
             history, complete physical evaluation, and Exercise SPECT.

          3. Patient has documented myocardial reversible ischemia and or hibernation in at least
             one segment.

          4. Patient is classified as AP CCS of III or IV.

          5. Patient should be on a stable dosage of medication used to treat angina for at least 6
             weeks prior to enrollment.

          6. Patients demonstrates exercise tolerance time (ETT) duration &lt; 10 minutes on a
             modified Bruce protocol on 2 consecutive tests (tests no less than 24 hours and no
             more than 2 weeks apart), with the second test within the difference of 25% of the
             first (Patients should not be informed of exercise restrictions required for entry

             procedural reasons or frequent reocclusion/restenosis following traditional
             revascularization.

          8. Patient has refused to undergo another angioplasty or CABG.

          9. Patient has signed an informed consent form.
