      Background: The treatment of traumatised refugees is one of the areas within the field of
      psychiatry with the weakest evidence for the different types of treatment. This is a problem
      for both patients and doctors as well as for society.

      The treatment of choice today for Post Traumatic Stress disorder (PTSD) is antidepressants
      from the subgroup of Selektive Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI), among these the drug
      Sertraline. The evidence for the use of these drugs as treatment for chronically complex PTSD
      in traumatised refugees is however very limited and a large part of the group is estimated to
      be insufficiently treated with this type of medicine. Venlafaxine is an antidepressant from
      the subgroup of dual action product which means that is works on several pathways in the
      brain. Among others it influences the area in the brain that is responsible for the enhanced
      anxiety and hyperarousal experienced by traumatised refugees and which is found to be
      enlarged among patients suffering from PTSD.

      All together there is not sufficient evidence to conclude which type of medical and
      psychological treatment that is most efficient when it comes to the treatment of traumatised
      refugees. Also there is a lack of studies which examines social functioning and the relation
      between psychosocial resources and outcome from treatment. Furthermore there is a lack of
      knowledge of predictors of treatment outcome for the individual patients. This study seeks to
      produce some of this evidence.

      Method: This study is expected to include approximately 150 patients randomised into two
      different groups. The patients are treated with Setraline or Venlafaxine depending on the
      group the randomised to. Patients in both groups are getting the same version of manual based
      Cognitive Behavioural Therapy that is specially adapted to this group of patients. The
      treatment period is 6-7 month. The trial endpoints are PTSD-and depression symptoms and
      social functioning all measured on internationally validated ratings scales.

      Furthermore the study will examine the relation between expected outcome of treatment from a
      range of predictors and the actual treatment results for the individual patient.

      Results: Altogether this study will bring forward new standards for clinical evaluation and
      treatment of traumatised refugees and the results are expected to be used in reference
      programmes/clinical guidelines.
