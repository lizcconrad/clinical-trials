    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to survey patients to learn about their beliefs and
      behaviors related to the management of heart disease and to discuss options for making
      healthy lifestyle changes. From the information the investigators get from patients, the
      investigators hope to develop better methods for taking care of patients who have heart
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a significant health threat among veterans. Compared to their
      civilian counterparts, veterans experience greater disability, reinfarction, and mortality
      following myocardial infarction (MI) and other acute coronary syndromes (ACS). High rates of
      hypertension, diabetes, and cardiac risk behaviors (e.g., smoking) and low socioeconomic
      status (SES) further increase veterans' CHD-related morbidity and mortality. The proposed
      pilot project will establish the feasibility of a telehealth nursing intervention for
      veterans with CHD who are recovering from MI/ACS. The Veterans Heart Attack Representations
      Telehealth (Vet-HART) intervention is designed to promote adaptive conceptual change in
      veterans' beliefs (common sense models or representations) about CHD etiology and
      self-management and facilitate health behavior changes (e.g., smoking cessation, medication
      adherence, diet management, and increased physical activity). The long-term goal of this
      research program is to improve veterans' quality of life (QoL) and reduce their CHD-related
      morbidity/mortality. The proposed project is the requisite next step in attaining that goal.

    <description>For those subjects randomly assigned to the treatment group, information from their MIHART assessment interview and medical record review will be used to select intervention scripts optimally tailored to each subjects' unique configuration of beliefs and risk factors and they will be re-contacted by telephone at 2-weeks post-hospital discharge to deliver the Vet-HART intervention. The intervention will be administered by a trained research assistant via telephone, working from a semi-structured script tailored to each subject's representations and risk factors, the call will last about 15-30 minutes.</description>
