             disease

          -  All subjects must have had at least 2 prior lines of anti-myeloma therapy. Induction
             therapy followed by stem cell transplant and consolidation/maintenance will be
             considered as one line

          -  All subjects must have either refractory or relapsed and refractory disease defined as
             documented disease progression during or within 60 days of completing their last
             anti-myeloma therapy.

               -  Primary refractory: Subjects who have never achieved any response better than
                  progressive disease (PD) to any previous line of anti-myeloma therapy.

               -  Relapsed and refractory: Subjects who have relapsed after having achieved at
                  least stable disease (SD) to at least one prior regimen and then developed
                  progressive disease (PD) on or within 60 days of completing their last
                  anti-myeloma therapy.

          -  Subjects must have also undergone prior treatment with at least 2 cycles of
             lenalidomide and at least 2 cycles of bortezomib (either in separate regimens or

                  50% of bone marrow nucleated cells are plasma cells
