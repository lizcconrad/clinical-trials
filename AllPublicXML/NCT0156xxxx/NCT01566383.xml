  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The normal values of a Multichannel Intraluminal Impedance (MII)-pH study can vary between
      ages, gender, race and different values of body mass index (BMI). This fact can cause new
      modifications in the normal values such as making new scales for different age groups or BMI
      groups.

      Our aim is to find the normal esophageal MII-pH parameter ranges in volunteers who never
      experienced reflux related symptoms and are in between the same ranges of age and BMI of our
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patient population.

    <intervention_name>24-hr pH monitoring</intervention_name>
    <description>Visit 1
The following will be done:
A medical history including review of your current drugs;
Collection of demographic information;
A manometry, before the 24-hour pH testing, to find the junction between the esophagus and stomach;
24-hour pH testing will be done
Visit 2
You will return to the clinic 24 hours after the visit 1 and the following will occur:
The catheter will be removed from your nose; and
You will return the recording device</description>
