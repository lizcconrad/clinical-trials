  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients experience significant postoperative pain following shoulder surgery, Single shot
      interscalene block is used in ambulatory shoulder surgery for its advantages that include
      significant reduction in acute pain and analgesic requirements, prolonged time to first
      analgesic request, decreased incidence of nausea, as well as earlier hospital discharge.The
      process of nerve block requires several needle passes, with each of them being at risk of
      causing nerve injury either by direct trauma or intraneural injection even with the use of
      the ultrasound. These facts raised concerns and several authors stated that maybe the
      anesthesiologists should be more careful, keep a safe distance from the nerve, and inject the
      local anesthetics into fascial planes containing the nerve and not attempt to place the
      needle in close proximity to the nerve. This study is designed to determine the maximal
      effective distance away from the nerve for the injection to be effective.
