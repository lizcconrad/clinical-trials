    <time_frame>Day 1 of double-blind treatment phase to the first documented efficacy failure (up to 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their pain twice daily using a 0 to 10 scale with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain you can imagine. The participant's average evening pain intensity scores over the last 3 days of screening period and of run-in period were defined as the run-in baseline score and treatment baseline score, respectively. A primary responder was defined as a participant who had a ≥30% decrease in treatment baseline score relative to run-in baseline score. Efficacy failure was defined as an occurrence of 3 consecutive days, or 4 days in a row with only one day missing and the other 3 days with a daily evening pain intensity score ≥4 and an increase of ≥30% in daily evening pain intensity score relative to treatment baseline score. The time to efficacy failure for primary responders was summarized.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the drug. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study drug is also an AE.</description>

The participant's average evening pain intensity scores over the last 3 days of screening period and of run-in period were defined as the run-in baseline score and treatment baseline score, respectively. A responder was defined as a participant who had a ≥20% decrease in treatment baseline score relative to run-in baseline score. Efficacy failure was defined as an occurrence of 3 consecutive days, or 4 days in a row with only one day missing and the other 3 days with a daily evening pain intensity score ≥4 and an increase of ≥20% in daily evening pain intensity score relative to treatment baseline score.

        <description>Participants rated their pain twice daily using a 0 to 10 scale with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain you can imagine. The participant’s average evening pain intensity scores over the last 3 days of screening period and of run-in period were defined as the run-in baseline score and treatment baseline score, respectively. A primary responder was defined as a participant who had a ≥30% decrease in treatment baseline score relative to run-in baseline score. Efficacy failure was defined as an occurrence of 3 consecutive days, or 4 days in a row with only one day missing and the other 3 days with a daily evening pain intensity score ≥4 and an increase of ≥30% in daily evening pain intensity score relative to treatment baseline score. The time to efficacy failure for primary responders was summarized.</description>
