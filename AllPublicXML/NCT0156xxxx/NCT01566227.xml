  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out the ideal number of implants/attachments required to
      provide adequate stability of dentures during function.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is threefold: i) to evaluate within-subject response to complete lower
      dentures retained by 1 or 2 or 3 implants fitted with independent overdenture attachments;
      ii) laboratory evaluation of the retention force generated with 1-2 or 3-implants and study
      its correlation to patients' response; iii) study the wear pattern of the plastic inserts on
      the overdenture abutments during each retention mode (i.e. the number of implants used to
      retain the dentures) and correlate its effects to denture stability.
