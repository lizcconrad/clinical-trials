  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at an alternative way of delivering radiation therapy with
      protons. Protons are tiny particles with a positive charge that can be controlled to travel a
      certain distance and stop inside the body. In theory, this allows better control of where the
      radiation dose is delivered as compared to photons. Information from other research studies
      suggests that proton radiation may help to reduce unwanted side effects from radiation and
      allow an increase in radiation dose that increase the odds of tumor killing.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of proton radiation therapy to give
      in combination with standard chemotherapy in participants with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Proton radiation will be delivered daily Monday through Friday for 5 weeks. Study therapy
      will be give as an outpatient at the Francis H. Burr Proton Center at Massachusetts General
      Hospital.

      During the weeks that subjects receive radiation, they will also receive 2 cycles of
      chemotherapy. Each cycle will last 28 days.

      Cisplatin will be give as an IV infusion over 30-60 minutes or 1-2 hours on Days 1 and 8 of
      Cycles 1 and 2.

      Etoposide will be given as an IV infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of Cycles 1
      and 2.

      After radiation and 2 cycles of chemotherapy are completed, subjects may have surgery to
      remove their tumor.

      Following surgery, subjects may receive another 2 cycles of chemotherapy (Cycles 3 and 4).
      Each cycles lasts 21 days. Cisplatin is given on Day 1. Etoposide is given on Days 1, 2, and
      3.
