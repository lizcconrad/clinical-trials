  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic BP pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Five year follow up</time_frame>
    <description>After randomization to either obtain cardiac CT or usual care, patients will be followed for 5 years (with assessment of outcomes at every 6 months) to see any difference in control of systolic blood pressure. The outcome with be assessed as both a continuous measure, as well as a categorical variable (&lt;135 mm Hg, and &gt;=135 mmHg)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Control of LDL cholesterol</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the control of LDL cholesterol at 6 month intervals for a total of 5 years. We will assess this measure as a continuous variable and as a a dichotomous outcome (LDL &lt; or = 100 or LDL &gt;100)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemoglobin A1c</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>After the cardiac CT, we will assess if patients have better control of their hemoglobin A1c (we will assess every 6 months for a total of 5 years). This will be a continuous measure.</description>
