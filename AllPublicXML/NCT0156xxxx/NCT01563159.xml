    <textblock>
      This study aims to confirm the statistically significant decline in rotavirus related and in
      acute gastro-enteritis (AGE) related hospital admissions that was observed in 11
      participating hospitals, after the introduction of RV vaccines in Belgium in 2006.

      This retrospective study will use anonymised data, extracted from hospital databases during
      the period of the 1st of June 2010 until the 31st of May 2011. IMS Health sales data will be
      used to provide rotavirus vaccine coverage estimates (Rotarix and Rotateq) for the Belgian
      population during the study period. Any additional source of vaccine coverage status
      describing rotavirus vaccine uptake in the study population will also be reported.
