  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a debilitating genetic disorder affecting 70,000-100,000
      Americans. It is frequently associated with very serious medical complications. For children
      with SCD, successfully transitioning to adult care is a vital step in ensuring continuity of
      care, managing their disease, and improving their health outcomes. Transition programs have
      been created to facilitate the transition process. However, few studies have assessed
      transition readiness and whether transition program components meet the transition needs of
      patients and families.

      The purpose of this study is to explore transitioning from pediatric care to adult care and
      to assess components of the SJCRH SCD Transition Program from three perspectives: adolescents
      with SCD, their caregivers, and young adults with SCD who have transitioned to adult care.
      Data collection methods will include focus groups, questionnaires, and checklists.
      Qualitative data analysis procedures will be used to examine the data.

      In this study, through the use of focus groups and questionnaires, we will identify
      perceptions of transition from pediatric to adult care, transition readiness, disease
      knowledge, and self-management skills, and assess components of the St. Jude Children's
      Research Hospital (SJCRH) Sickle Cell Disease Transition Program. Participants will
      participate in focus groups to discuss transition and transition-related concepts and
      evaluate components of the transition program. Additionally, participants will complete
      questionnaires about specific aspects of the transition program and about current disease
      knowledge and management skills.

    <description>First, data will be prepared for qualitative analysis. Digital audio files from the focus groups will be transcribed verbatim and questionnaire data will be entered into an Excel data file. Second, focus group data will be qualitatively analyzed using the constant comparative process. A qualitative data analysis program, NVivo9 (Victoria, Australia) will be used to assist with this coding process.</description>
