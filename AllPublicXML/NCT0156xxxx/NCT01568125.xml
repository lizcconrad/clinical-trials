  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that incretin, particular GLP-ï¼‘enhances satiety and reduces energy intake in
      controlling appetite and dietary in humans (Flint A, et al. Gutzwiller JP et al.). Recently,
      incretin-based therapy has been attracted a lot of interest (Hare KJ, Knop FK). However, it
      is not clear how the incretin-based therapy affects energy and content of dietary intake in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previously, the investigators reported the
      amount of energy and content of dietary intake in type 2 diabetic Japanese patients with more
      than 10 years of long time duration after discovery using questionnaire (Inoue K et al.) and
      the patients were impaired a secretion of active GLP-1 (Kamoi et al).

      The investigators examine whether the incretin-based therapy effects on the energy and
      content of dietary intake in the same patients before and one year after administration of
      incretin-related drugs using the same method previously (Inoue K et al.).
