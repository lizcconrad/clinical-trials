      The rehabilitation of patients affected by defects of the jaws after tumor resection is still
      very challenging. Resection can lead to significant facial deformity, impaired oral functions
      such as speech, swallowing, saliva retention, and concomitant psychological problems.
      Moreover, the loss of teeth and the alveolar and basal jawbone can lead to significant
      impairment of mastication. The reconstruction of such defects with autogenous bone grafts or
      revascularized free flaps has become a valuable means for the rehabilitation of these
      patients. Major benefits of such procedure include an usually low morbidity of the donor site
      and an extensive length of the bone graft. Moreover, vascularized grafts provide a good bulk
      of bone in which to place implants and a satisfactory contour. In fact, after reconstruction,
      local hard and soft tissue conditions often exclude the integration of conventional dentures
      because of the impairment of dental prosthetic retention by thin cutaneous tissue, the
      thickness of subcutaneous tissues, the absence of a perilingual and vestibular groove, and
      the fragility of soft tissues. In Literature it has been well established the high biologic
      value of vascularized fibula grafts regarding the potential of implant osseointegration,
      which seemed to be equal to regional mandibular or maxillary bone and eventually capable to
      provide sufficient stabilization of prosthesis.

      It must be kept in mind that the final prosthetic success may be affected by some
      difficulties in this clinical scenario. These include the limited opening of the
      scar-contracted oral cavity, the huge amount of soft tissue covering the fibula, with little
      information about the profile of the underlying harvested bone, the need for limited bony
      exposure in a field that may well have been irradiated and they all may cause poor
      prosthetically-guided implant positioning and eventually disappointing results in dental
      rehabilitation, either functionally or esthetically. It can be postulated that these
      complications can be overcome, or at least reduced, by adopting the new methods of computed
      tomography (CT)-assisted implant surgery.
