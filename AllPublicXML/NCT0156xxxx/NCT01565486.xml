      The aim of the study is to evaluate differences between use of Ultrasonic Coagulation Device
      (New Harmonic ACE™, Ethicon endo-surgery) and Bipolar Energy Sealing System (LigaSure
      Precise™, Covidien) in surgery for thyroid cancer.

      Background: Thyroid is an organ that has abundant vessels. In thyroid surgery, it should be
      cautious to avoid injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and parathyroid, thus careful
      hemostasis during surgery is crucial for surgeons who perform thyroid surgery. Recently,
      there have been significant advances in vessel sealing systems for the occlusion of vessels
      during surgery as endoscopic surgery has been developed. UC and BES are now commonly used in
      thyroid surgery. However, only a few studies have compared the two surgical devices to
      determine which technique is superior in terms of operative time and complication rate. Thus,
      this single-blind prospective randomized trial is conducted to determine if there was a
      difference in operative time, complication rate, postoperative drainage volume, admission
      time, cost, and, furthermore, oncologic outcomes (RFS and OS) between the two surgical
      devices in surgery for thyroid cancer.
