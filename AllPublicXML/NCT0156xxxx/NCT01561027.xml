      The study is a randomized, double blind, cross-over study to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of CNV1014802 in subjects with neuropathic pain from lumbosacral radiculopathy.

    <textblock>
      The study consists of two treatment periods of 22 days with randomized CNV1014802 350mg or
      placebo administered twice daily. In addition, single blind placebo will be administered
      during a two week run-in, a two week wash-out period between the two treatment periods, and a
      one week run-out phase.

      This study was previously posted by Convergence Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., which has been
      acquired by Biogen.
