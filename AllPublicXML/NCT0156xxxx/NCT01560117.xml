  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab has become standard of care
      for patients with follicular lymphoma. However, there are still open questions regarding
      dosing and scheduling of rituximab, optimal type of chemotherapeutic combination partners
      during induction as well as the best interval and length of rituximab maintenance treatment.
      Fludarabine-mitoxantrone combinations have shown strong debulking activity as initial therapy
      followed by rituximab maintenance. While rituximab maintenance with a standard dose of 375
      mg/m2 prolongs clinical remissions, administration schedules still vary: Three-monthly
      infusions for 2 years and two-monthly infusions for one or 2 years are most frequently used.
      A few pharmacokinetic data for rituximab have been reported for induction treatment. These
      studies have proposed a presumptive &quot;active&quot; level of 25.000 ng/ml in anti-lymphoma
      treatment. However, there is only limited information regarding maintenance treatment in
      patients who are in remission and have no remaining tumor load.

      The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of treatment with oral Fludarabine,
      Mitoxantrone und Rituximab and Rituximab maintenance on the depth of remission measured by
      BCL2/IgH PCR.
