      The overall aim of the study is:

      To provide accurate and reliable information regarding NSCLC clinical management across MENA
      region in order to detect unmet medical needs of this disease in terms of:

        -  Patient and hospital characteristics.

        -  Diagnostic and treatment approaches: initial and subsequent.

        -  Follow-up patterns in clinical management.

        -  Outcomes: symptoms, death, functionality, quality of life.

        -  Use of resources and burden on patients and health care systems.
