  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the major causes not only of mortality, but of disease burden worldwide,
      because of residual disability and cognitive decline. Although blood pressure lowering has
      been clearly shown to be the most effective means for primary and secondary prevention of
      stroke, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels to achieve by treatment in order to optimize
      prevention results are unknown, and whether SBP levels lower than those usually recommended
      are accompanied by further or reduced benefits is undecided yet. Likewise, while low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering by statins has been shown to be associated with
      primary and secondary stroke prevention, whether more intense lowering is or is not of
      further benefit is unknown. The Stroke in Hypertension Optimal Treatment Trial (ESH-CHL-SHOT)
      is a factorial 3 x 2 arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to test the
      hypothesis that in elderly patients at high risk of recurrent stroke (previous recent stroke
      or TIA) antihypertensive treatment programs aimed at reducing SBP to the usually recommended
      values (&lt; 145 to 135 mmHg), to a lower goal (&lt; 135 to 125 mmHg) or to even lower values (&lt;
      125 mmHg) will result in progressively greater reductions in recurrent stroke, incidence of
      cardiovascular outcomes and cognitive decline. Parallely, the preventive efficacy of more and
      less intense LDL-C reductions will be tested on the same outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ESH-CHL-SHOT will randomize about 7500 participants aged &gt; or = 65 years with SBP &gt; or = 140
      mmHg or antihypertensive therapy, who have presented a stroke or TIA, within 1 to 6 months
      before randomization.

      The trial will investigate

        1. the effects of randomization to antihypertensive treatment of different intensities,
           aiming at three different SBP targets. SBP targets are &lt; 145 to 135, &lt; 135 to 125, &lt; 125
           mmHg, with approximate mean inter-target differences of 8 mmHg;

        2. the effects of randomization to lipid lowering treatment of different intensity, aiming
           at two different LDL-C targets. Targets are 2.8 to 1.8 mmol/l (110 to 70 mg/dl) and &lt;
           1.8 mmol/l;

        3. possible interactions between antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments. The
           primary hypothesis is that recurrent stroke rates will be 25% lower in the lowest vs
           intermediate SBP target group, 25% lower in the intermediate vs higher SBP target group,
           and 20% lower in the lower vs higher LDL-C target group. Sample size has been calculated
           to provide a 80% power with a significance of 5% after corrections for repetitive
           measurements on the assumption that stroke incidence will be 4% per year in the highest
           SBP target group. Participants will be recruited at approximately 250 clinics in Europe
           (2500 patients) and China (5000 patients) over a 2-year period, and will be followed up
           for an average of 4 years or until 925 recurrent strokes occur.

      Arms and assigned intervention

      1. Antihypertensive treatment design and assigned treatment

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three different sitting SBP targets:

        1. &lt; 145 to 135 mmHg

        2. &lt; 135 to 125 mmHg

        3. &lt; 125 mmHg to be possibly achieved within 3 months and subsequently maintained within
           the target window.

      Investigators are free to choose the drugs (among those approved in each country) to be
      administered to individual patients. It is expected that patients already on antihypertensive
      therapy and with SBP at randomization not too far from target will be maintained on current
      therapy with suitable adjustments. Other patients (untreated or with SBP far from target) may
      follow a suggested treatment algorithm of progressive increase in number of compounds or
      doses. During follow-up visits drugs and/or doses will be modified if necessary to maintain
      patients within randomized target window.

      2. Lipid-lowering treatment design and assigned treatment

      Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two different LDL-C targets:

      A) 2.8 to 1.8 mmol/l (110 to 70 mg/dl) B) &lt; 1.8 mmol/l (&lt; 70 mg/dl) to be possibly achieved
      within 3 months and subsequently maintained within the target window.

      Investigators are free to choose the statin (among those approved in each country) to be
      administered to individual patients. The initial statin dose should be chosen by the
      investigator according to LDL-C at randomization and the LDL-C target. The initial dose can
      be increased (to the maximum dose allowed in each country) or decreased until the LDL-C
      target is achieved possibly within 3 months, and further adjusted up or down at 6-month
      intervals in order to maintain LDL-C within the randomized target window.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Qualifying event: stroke or TIA 1 to 6 months previous to randomization.

          -  All patients should have a CT scan or MRI (preferably MRI) at screening. The CT scan
             or MRI carried out at the time of the qualifying event, if available, is acceptable.
             Stroke will be defined as imaging evidence of a recent brain infarction (or
             haemorrhage) independently of duration of clinical symptoms, or as duration of
             clinical symptoms &gt; 24 h even in absence of imaging evidence of lesion

          -  TIA as clinical symptoms (involving limbs or speech) lasting &lt; 24 h without imaging
             evidence of infarction. Enrolling units should avoid enrolling patients with TIA in a
             proportion greater than 25% of enrolled patients. The general coordinators in Milan
             and Beijing may decide stopping enrolment of TIA patients if their proportion is
             becoming greater than expected.

          -  A haemorrhagic stroke (1 to 6 months previously) is also a qualifying event, but only
             for the BP-lowering component of the trial (see Exclusion criteria).

          -  Age: 65 years and above. No fixed upper age limit is introduced, but frail patients
             aged above 80 years should not be enrolled.

          -  Gender: either gender.

          -  BP: Only hypertensive patients: untreated patients with SBP ≥140 mmHg; patients on
             antihypertensive treatment with any BP (but see exclusion criteria)

          -  LDL-C: Patients without statin treatment with LDL-C &gt; 2.8 mmol/l; patients on statin
             treatment with any LDL-C value (but see exclusion criteria)

          -  Antiplatelet therapy: All patients should be under antiplatelet therapy (agents and
             doses chosen by the investigator according to accepted guidelines), unless
             contraindicated. Anticoagulant (instead of antiplatelet) therapy whenever indicated
             (e.g. atrial fibrillation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Qualifying event:

               1. Patients in unstable clinical conditions

               2. Clinical disturbances caused by non-stroke pathology

               3. patients with haemodynamically significant carotid stenosis or requiring carotid
                  revascularization

               4. haemorrhagic stroke is an exclusion criterion for the lipid lowering component of
                  the trial; however, these patients should be randomized to the BP component, but
                  considered in addition to the number of patients requested to each enrolling
                  unit, in order not to decrease the power of the lipid-lowering component.

          -  BP: - known secondary hypertension;

          -  SBP &gt;140 mmHg under three antihypertensive drugs at full doses (these patients are
             unlikely to achieve SBP &lt; 125 mmHg, if so randomized);

          -  orthostatic hypotension (SBP fall &gt; 25 mmHg on standing);

          -  LDL-C: - LDL-C &gt;2.8 mmol/l under full dose of a statin (these patients are unlikely to
             achieve LDL-C targets).

          -  LDL-C &gt; 4.5 mmol/l under low dose of a statin or untreated (these patients are
             unlikely to achieve the lower LDL-C target).

          -  Others: - Patients with a myocardial infarction (preceding or subsequent to the
             qualifying stroke or TIA) if their baseline LDL-C is &lt; 1.8 mmol/l

          -  Dementia

          -  Severe disability (modified Rankin scale &gt; 4)

          -  Severe chronic renal failure defined as serum creatinine &gt; 250 micromol/l

          -  Hepatic disease as determined by either AST or ALT values &gt; 2 times the upper limit of
             normal

          -  History of hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices or portocaval shunt

          -  History of gastrointestinal surgery or disorders which could interfere with drug
             absorption

          -  Known allergy or contraindications to one of the drugs to be administered in the study

          -  History of malignancy including leukaemia and lymphoma (but not basal cell skin
             cancer) within the last 5 years

          -  History of clinically significant autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus
             erythematosus

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the last 5 years

          -  History of non-compliance to medical regimens and/or patients who are considered
             potentially unreliable

          -  Inability or unwillingness to give free informed consent
