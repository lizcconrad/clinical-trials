  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate and compare the effect of the amount of toothpaste used and brushing
      time on enamel strengthening (percent of surface microhardness recovery, % SMHR) and enamel
      fluoride uptake (EFU).

    <measure>Percentage Surface Micro Hardness Recovery (% SMH), of Brushing for 2 Minutes Versus (vs.) Brushing for 45 Seconds With 1.5g of Experimental Dentifrice.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and at Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>SMH recovery test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH recovery was performed in-vitro and determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. % SMH recovery was calculated from indentation length (micrometer [μm]) of sound enamel specimen at baseline (B), indentation length (μm) after in vitro demineralization (D1), indentation length (μm) after intra-oral exposure (R): [D1-R/D1-B] ×100.</description>

          <description>This was a five arm cross-over study. Five arms were divided according to the different treatment regimens, the participants were received all the following treatment regimens during the study: 1. Experimental dentifrice 0.5 grams (g) for 45 seconds, 2. Experimental dentifrice 0.5g for 2 minutes, 3. Experimental dentifrice 1.5g for 45 seconds, 4. Experimental dentifrice 1.5g for 2 minutes, and 5. Control dentifrice 1.5g for 2 minutes only.</description>

        <title>Percentage Surface Micro Hardness Recovery (% SMH), of Brushing for 2 Minutes Versus (vs.) Brushing for 45 Seconds With 1.5g of Experimental Dentifrice.</title>
        <description>SMH recovery test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH recovery was performed in-vitro and determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. % SMH recovery was calculated from indentation length (micrometer [μm]) of sound enamel specimen at baseline (B), indentation length (μm) after in vitro demineralization (D1), indentation length (μm) after intra-oral exposure (R): [D1-R/D1-B] ×100.</description>

          <description>SMH recovery test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH recovery was performed in-vitro and determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents re-hardening of enamel surface. % SMH recovery was calculated from indentation length (μm) of sound enamel specimen at baseline (B), indentation length (μm) after in vitro demineralization (D1), indentation length (μm) after intra-oral exposure (R): [D1-R/D1-B] ×100.</description>

        <title>Enamel Fluoride Uptake (EFU) After Brushing for 45 Seconds With 0.5g of Experimental Dentifrice vs. Brushing for 45 Seconds With 1.5g of Experimental Dentifrice.</title>
        <description>EFU was measured by using micro-drill analysis of the enamel specimens carried out after 14 days of intra-oral exposure for each of the toothpaste treatments. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores.</description>
        <time_frame>At Day 14</time_frame>
        <population>PP population included all randomized participants who had no major protocol deviations that were felt by the investigator to have affected the assessment of efficacy for all treatments.</population>
