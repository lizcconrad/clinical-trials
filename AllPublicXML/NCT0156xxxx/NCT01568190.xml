        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients 18-65 years of age.

          -  A clinical history of HDM induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma
             at least one year prior to trial entry.

          -  Positive SPT to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der pte) or Dermatophagoides farinae
             (Der far) (wheal diameter ≥ 3 mm).

          -  A positive specific IgE against Der pte or Der far (≥Class 2; ≥0.70 KU/L) documenting
             in the last 5 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  FEV1 &lt; 70% of predicted value at screening after adequate pharmacologic treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe asthma.

          -  A clinically relevant history of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or
             conjunctivitis caused by an allergen, to which the subject is regularly exposed and
             sensitized.

          -  History of severe asthma exacerbation or emergency room visit or admission for asthma
             in the previous 12 months.

          -  At screening, current symptoms of, or treatment for, upper respiratory tract
             infection, acute sinusitis, acute otitis media or other relevant infection (serous
             otitis media is not an exclusion criterion).

          -  Treatment with parenteral corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids or anti-IgE in the
             previous 3 months or during the study (except for steroids if needed as rescue
             medication). Please, see Table 4.

          -  Currently treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, tricyclic
             antidepressants, β-blockers, mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and any other drug
             containing alum (e.g. antacids) taken on a daily basis.

          -  Previous treatment by other allergen concomitant IT or immunotherapy with HDM extracts
             within the previous 5 years (initiation of subcutaneous immunotherapy is acceptable if
             treatment has been discontinued before reaching maintenance dose; for SLIT 3 months in
             the last 5 years is accepted).

          -  History of anaphylactic shock due to e.g. food, insect venom, exercise or drug.

          -  History of severe and recurrent angioedema.

          -  Any contraindication according to the Investigator Brochure (IB).

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening.
