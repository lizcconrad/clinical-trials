  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed JEV05 study is a four-arm double-blind randomized controlled single center trial
      to evaluate, by examining post-vaccination seroprotection titers, the lot-to-lot consistency
      of three lots of JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine manufactured in a new GMP facility,
      and to establish non-inferiority of the new vaccine in comparison to a single lot of the same
      vaccine manufactured in the existing facility. The study will enroll a total of 1,000
      Bangladeshi infants aged 10 to 12 months. In addition to providing immunogenicity data, JEV05
      will provide local safety data of JE live attenuated SA 14-14-2 vaccine among Bangladeshi
      children. This will be the first step to secure licensure for this life-saving vaccine in
      Bangladesh as well as provide data to support WHO prequalification of JE live attenuated SA
      14-14-2 vaccine.

             chronic treatment.

          -  History of serious chronic disease (e.g., cardiac, renal, neurologic, metabolic,
             rheumatologic, hematologic, or bleeding disorder).

          -  Known or suspected impairment of immunologic function.

          -  History of documented or suspected encephalitis or meningitis.

          -  Received measles vaccine within 4 weeks prior to, or scheduled to receive a
             vaccination during, the conduct of this trial.

          -  Prior or anticipated receipt of immune globulin or other blood products, or injected
             or oral corticosteroids or other immune modulator therapy within 6 weeks of
             administration of the study vaccine.

          -  Serious adverse reactions (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, shock, breathlessness following
