  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myo-Inositol (MI) is a precursors for the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates
      (PIPs). In male reproduction, it was shown that MI concentration in the seminiferous tubules
      is higher than in serum and it was increasing during the movement through the epididymis and
      the deferent duct. In the present study, the role of myo-inositol has been investigated as a
      possible antioxidant agent for the systemic treatment of male infertility and the improvement
      of the sperm's quality.

      Samples of seminal fluid were obtained from two groups of patients undergoing to a IVF cycle:
      healthy subjects and subjects with oligoasthenospermia (OA, &lt; 15 mil/ml). The collected
      samples were submitted to optic microscopy in order to evaluate semen's volume, spermatozoa's
      number and motility, during the initial semen analysis and after density gradient separation
      method; these parameters were evaluated before and after the administration of 4000mg/die of
      myo-inositol associated to 400 µg of folic acid for three months.

      These values were compared with samples of seminal fluid of healthy patients undergoing to a
      IVF cycle for a female cause of infertility (control group).
