  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in
      response to the ingestion of a mixture of glucose and fructose is greater in South Asians
      compared to controls (Caucasians).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Asians, who originate from the Indian subcontinent and make up one-fifth of the world's
      population, are among the highest number who suffer from heart disease and diabetes. The
      results of many research studies suggest that genes play a role in developing heart disease
      and diabetes that is made worse by the diet in the United States. Fructose is a sugar widely
      used in the American diet, and when consumed, it is taken up by the liver and changed into
      fats through a process called de novo lipogenesis (DNL). The current study will compare this
      change into fats in the liver between South Asians and Caucasians. The participants will be
      screened on the initial visit, and on the second visit, the DNL response will be measured in
      the blood over four hours after drinking one sweetened beverage, containing half glucose,
      half fructose, similar to a soft drink. We expect that DNL in response to fructose intake is
      higher in South Asians when compared to Caucasians and may partially explain why South Asians
      have earlier heart disease and diabetes.
