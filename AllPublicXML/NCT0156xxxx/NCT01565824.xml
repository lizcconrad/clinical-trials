  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate whether the implementation of a web-based support to women with
      type 1 diabetes during pregnancy and early motherhood can improve well-being and self
      management of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is associated with increased medical risks and
      increased psychosocial pressure in relation to childbearing. There is need for extended
      support from both health care professionals and peers. Web-based interventions can improve
      personal capacity and self-management in people with long- term illnesses but are not
      evaluated in childbearing women with type 1 diabetes. A web site prototype for full-size
      browsers and mobile devices has been developed through a participatory design by
      multidisciplinary researchers, health care professionals, experienced mothers with type 1
      diabetes and web designers. In a randomised control study the developed web site offering
      information, communication with health care professionals, person-centred self-care diaries
      and online social community of included women, is provided to the intervention group in early
      pregnancy at admission to specialised antenatal clinics at six hospitals in Sweden. A control
      group will receive standard care (usual care). Total n = 160. Primary outcomes are Well-Being
      Questionnaire and Diabetes Empowerment Scale. The intervention offers proactive solutions for
      strengthening patients' decision making of diabetes in daily life during pregnancy and early
      motherhood, and is expected to increase their wellbeing, personal capacity and knowledge of
      diabetes.
