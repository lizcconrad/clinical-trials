      This study is designed to compare the infection rates in wounds irrigated with sterile normal
      saline to those irrigated with chlorinated tap water. The hypothesis is that the wound
      infection rate subsequent to irrigation with tap water is not significantly different than
      the infection rate for wounds irrigated with sterile normal saline.

      Inclusion criteria are patients older than 1-year of age who present to the emergency
      department with a soft-tissue laceration requiring repair. Exclusion criteria include
      patients with any underlying immunocompromising illness, current use of antibiotics, puncture
      or bite wounds, underlying tendon or bone involvement, or wounds more than nine hours old.

      Patients are randomized to have their wounds irrigated either with tap water or sterile
      normal saline prior to closure, controlling for the volume and irrigation method used.
      Structured follow-up is completed at 48 hours and 30 days to determine the presence of
      infection.

      The primary outcome measure is the difference in wound infection rates between the two
      randomized groups.
