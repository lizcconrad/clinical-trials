  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving patients with cancer who are referred by their treating physician
      for percutaneous locoregional therapies.

      Patient's clinical and radiology findings, pathology findings, survival, treatment responses,
      and complications after their locoregional therapy will be studied.

      The efficacy of the percutaneous and transarterial treatments for solid tumors will be
      studied. Prospective study on patients who receive percutaneous locoregional therapies,
      including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation, microwave ablation, IRE and chemical
      ablation for treatment of cancer will be performed.

      Preoperative clinic chart, procedure note, postoperative chart, pre- and post-operative CT,
      MRI or Ultrasound, angiographic findings, biopsy results and pathologic findings, will be
      reviewed. Patient survival, treatment responses, complications after the therapy will be
      collected from clinic visits and clinical encounters.

      Patient overall performance status before and after procedures will be assessed using the
      Quality of Life questionnaire (SF-36â„¢ Health Survey).
