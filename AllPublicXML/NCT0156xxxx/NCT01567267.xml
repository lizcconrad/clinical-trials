  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of a short term educational intervention
      for upcoming biology teachers to teach principles of Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) and Good
      Scientific Practice (GSP) to high-school biology students.

    <textblock>
      Shared decision making is increasingly demanded by patients in order to take part in health
      care decisions. However this demand for autonomy can only be used for shared decision making
      if the patient has basic skills in critical health literacy. To transfer health care literacy
      to young and healthy consumers educational intervention programs at high-school might be a
      feasible and effective way. This preliminary phase 2 study is designed to investigate the
      effect of an educational intervention to be integrated in a curriculum for upcoming teachers
      in biology.
