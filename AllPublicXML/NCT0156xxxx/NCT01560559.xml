    <textblock>
      Recommended therapies for esophageal achalasia are endoscopic pneumatic dilation and
      Heller-Dor surgical myotomy. Endoscopic myotomy has been recently proposed in human patient
      in expert centers in Japan, US and Germany. In theory, endoscopic myotomy is as effective as
      surgical myotomy but less invasive and more effective with less complications than endoscopic
      pneumatic dilation. Up to now, published studies have confirmed these expectations, with 100%
      efficacy and no clinically significant complications. The present clinical trial with study
      the security and efficacy of peroral endoscopic myotomy in primary achalasia patients.

    <description>An endoscopy is performed under anesthesia with orotracheal intubation. After submucosal saline injection, an entry point in the submucosal space is created at 10 cm above the cardia. The endoscope will create a 12cm long tunnel in the caudal direction by submucosal dissection, stopping at 2cm below cardia. Then the muscular circular internal layer is sectioned on a 9cm length, starting 3 cm below the submucosal entry point. At the end the submucosal entry point is closed with metallic clips. A scanner is performed after the procedure so as to check the esophageal wall integrity. Alimentation is progressively introduced at day 1.
This is a study of a procedure - peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). No new, unapproved device is used. All endoscopic tools are already approved for endoscopic submucosal dissection and associated complications (hemorrhage or perforation): dissection knifes, hot biopsy forceps, endoscopic metallic clips.</description>
