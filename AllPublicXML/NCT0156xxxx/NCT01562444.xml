  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity response in adults up to 10 years
      after one booster dose. Data collected from this study will allow for greater information to
      prescribers who administer TBE vaccine, so that they can appropriately time the
      administration of booster vaccinations to individuals who received different vaccination
      schedules and who live in tick borne encephalitis endemic regions.
