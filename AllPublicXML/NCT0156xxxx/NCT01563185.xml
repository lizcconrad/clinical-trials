  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase 4, multi-center, open-label study is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of DUEXIS in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) patients aged 10
      years to 16 years, 11 months, treated up to 24 weeks.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the PK characteristics of DUEXIS in JIA patients and
      to evaluate the signs and symptoms of JIA in patients aged 10 years to 16 years, 11 months
      receiving DUEXIS for up to 24 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 JIA patients who meet all eligibility criteria and who are expected to
      require daily administration of an NSAID for up to 24 weeks will be enrolled. A subset of
      approximately 6 patients will participate in a single dose PK study at Day 0 with an
      abbreviated PK profile performed at Week 4 if possible. Multiple dose PK sampling will occur
      in all enrolled patients.

    <measure>Childhood Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Endpoint (Endpoint is the last post-baseline value obtained, as two subjects did not complete the study up until week 24).</time_frame>
    <description>To assess patient quality of life while on study medication, the CHQ was administered to the patients' parent or guardian on Day 0 and at the Week 24/ET visit. The raw scale scores were transformed into scores on a 0 to 100 scale, 100 indicating best health and 0 indicating worst health. The algorithm is:
Transformed Score = ((Actual Raw Score - Lowest Possible Raw Score)/(Possible Raw Score Range)) x100. The actual raw score is the mean of the item responses in a scale (sum of item responses/number of completed items). The possible raw score range is the highest possible raw score minus the lowest possible raw score. The outcome measure data table shows the average change in the CHQ concepts from Baseline to the week 24 visit. The average change in the CHQ concepts is on a -100 to 100 scale, -100 representing a negative change in health and 100 indicating a positive change in health.</description>

    <description>The following 2 ACR pediatric Core Measures of JIA activity and the parent's assessment of discomfort were quantitatively assessed at baseline and each study visit: the physician's global assessment of disease activity and the parent's global assessment of overall well-being. These ACR values represent the average change in the physician's global assessment of disease activity and the parent's global assessment of overall well-being from the baseline visit to the week 24/ET visit.

        <title>Childhood Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50) Scores</title>
        <description>To assess patient quality of life while on study medication, the CHQ was administered to the patients' parent or guardian on Day 0 and at the Week 24/ET visit. The raw scale scores were transformed into scores on a 0 to 100 scale, 100 indicating best health and 0 indicating worst health. The algorithm is:
Transformed Score = ((Actual Raw Score - Lowest Possible Raw Score)/(Possible Raw Score Range)) x100. The actual raw score is the mean of the item responses in a scale (sum of item responses/number of completed items). The possible raw score range is the highest possible raw score minus the lowest possible raw score. The outcome measure data table shows the average change in the CHQ concepts from Baseline to the week 24 visit. The average change in the CHQ concepts is on a -100 to 100 scale, -100 representing a negative change in health and 100 indicating a positive change in health.</description>

These ACR values represent the average change in the physician's global assessment of disease activity and the parent's global assessment of overall well-being from the baseline visit to the week 24/ET visit. The ACR pediatric core measure: Physician's global assessment of disease activity and parent's assessment of overall well being was measured on a scale of 0-100 mm (0 = very good, 100=very poor).</description>
