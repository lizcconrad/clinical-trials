  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a three-part quality improvement intervention to 1) improve
      the clinic-based measurement of blood pressure, 2) introduce a care management system to
      promote self-management behaviors and rapidly titrate medications by algorithms developed in
      accord with guidelines and 3) introduce an interactive, needs-based, longitudinal-provider
      education system that promotes patient-centered care and provides practical examples of
      patient-provider communication strategies. The intervention will occur at six clinics within
      the metropolitan area of Baltimore, Maryland. The investigators will also describe clinic and
      health system characteristics and measure their association with implementation (uptake),
      success (improvements in blood pressure control and reductions in racial disparities), and
      sustainability of the three-part intervention over 12 -24 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is common in the US. From efficacy and observational studies, we know that
      achieving blood pressure control can reduce morbidity and mortality. However, less than
      one-third of persons with hypertension achieve control as defined by national guidelines.
      Furthermore, racial disparities in hypertension have been clearly documented with African
      American patients being less likely than Caucasians to achieve adequate control. The
      objective of this study is to study the implementation of a multi-method quality improvement
      intervention in a pragmatic clinical trial. Six clinic sites within the Johns Hopkins
      Community Physicians (JHCP) healthcare system have been selected for participation in this
      study. The sites are located within the metropolitan ara of Baltimore, Maryland, yet differ
      greatly. We will define the context and local characteristics of each study site and
      determine which characteristics are associated with blood pressure control and racial
      disparity at the clinic (micro-system) and health system (macro-system)level. We will deploy
      a three-part quality improvement intervention to 1) improve the clinic-based measurement of
      blood pressure, 2) introduce a care management system to promote patients' self-management
      behaviors and rapidly titrate medications by algorithms developed in accord with guidelines
      and 3) introduce an interactive, needs-based, longitudinal-provider education system that
      promotes patient-centered care and provides practical examples of patient-provider
      communication strategies. Using statistical process control charting, we will determine the
      stability of blood pressure control in the system prior to intervention and after the
      introduction of each intervention. We will vary the order of the interventions among the six
      clinical sites to determine if each intervention is independently effective in each local
      context and if the effect is repeatable in other contextual situations within the same
      macro-system. In addition, we will study the organizational characteristics and features of
      the local context that are associated with implementation, uptake of the interventions and
      success of each intervention in achieving blood pressure control and reducing racial
      disparities in blood pressure control at the clinic level .

    <measure>Percent of clinic patients with controlled blood pressure and the racial disparity in controlled BP at each clinic.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percent of clinic patients each week with SBP &lt; 140 and DBP &lt; 90, or if patient is diabetic or has CKD then SBP &lt;130 and DBP &lt; 80. If no BP measure, patient does not meet JNC-7 guidelines. Note: If multiple BP measures are recorded, the lowest will be used. The racial disparity is defined as the percent difference in blood pressure control between white patients and ethnic minority patients (separated into categories of African-American patients and other race patients). These outcomes will be assessed weekly for 24 weeks prior to and after roll out of each of the interventions.</description>

    <description>This intervention seeks to improve BP control and reduce disparities through an organizational change and new skills development. To improve the reliability of BP measurement in clinics, new automated BP machines (Omron HEM-907XL) will be provided for each PCP. Medical assistants will be trained and certified in the proper use of the Omron machine by a master trainer. The will be trained to measure the arm circumference, choose the appropriate cuff and place it properly on the arm. They will be recertified yearly. Once activated, the Omron HEM-907XL will lead measurement for 5 minutes then perform a series of 3 BP measurements spaced by 30 seconds and present the man of these 3 measurements. The mean will be record in the electronic medical records.</description>

    <description>The provider education intervention will address blood pressure control and disparities through audit and feedback. The intervention includes a hypertension dashboard and a linked provider-tailored education intervention. The latter aims to enhance provider communication skills during clinical encounters with hypertension patients, via teaching specific verbal behaviors with practice implications related to elicitation of hypertension treatment and adherence concerns. The dashboard is a web based tool linked to the electronic medical records that imports clinic measurements of BP and offers PCPs a quick assessment of the percentage of those achieving blood pressure control and receiving guideline-concordant care in their panel, clinic, and system overall and by patient race/ethnicity.</description>

    <description>The care management (CM) intervention will address blood pressure management and disparities through patient education, promotion of self-management, and the introduction of an organizational change through the addition of new team members. The CM team will contact patients with a BP of ≥140/≥90 (≥130/≥80 for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease) as identified through the electronic medical records for enrollment in care management services. Patients with a BP in these ranges will be referred to a CM program that emphasizes four key self-management behaviors: diet, physical activity, medication adherence, and self-monitoring. The self-management promotion program will consist of 3 one-on-one sessions either with a Pharm D. or R.D. over the course of 3 months.</description>
