      This is a pilot study to see if oral administration of freeze dried, powdered broccoli
      sprouts have any effect on whether moles end up becoming melanoma.

      This study is designed as a pilot evaluation of sulforaphane as a candidate natural
      nutritional chemopreventive agent able to modulate key steps in melanoma progression and the
      expression of STAT proteins in melanocytic and stromal elements of atypical nevi, which are
      precursor lesions and risk markers of melanoma. Eighteen individuals in total will receive
      oral broccoli sprout extract rich in sulforaphane (BSE-SFN) standardized for 3 different
      concentrations of actual sulforaphane content which will be utilized in our study. Three
      groups of six patients will be randomly assigned to receive oral BSE-SFN at SFN dosages of 50
      µmol, 100 µmol, or 200 µmol daily. Due to the established safety of SFN at all of the
      proposed dosage levels, there is no plan to complete a lower dosage level prior to escalating
      to the next higher dosage level; i.e., subjects will be randomized across all of the proposed
      SFN dosage levels. However, the safety of BSE-SFN administration will continue to be
      evaluated through laboratory studies (CBC, chemistry) performed before and following 28 days
      of administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have at least two atypical nevi of ≥ 4 mm diameter and prior diagnosis
             of melanoma.

          -  Subjects must be ≥ age 18.

          -  Subjects must not have received any form of systemic antineoplastic treatment for
             melanoma within the last year from day 1.

          -  Subjects should not have known allergies to cruciferous vegetables.

          -  Subjects must agree to abstain from dietary sources of glucosinolates and
             isothiocyanates beginning three days prior to study and throughout duration of the
             active study (28 days). Participants will be asked to keep a food diary. A list of
             food and supplements to abstain from is provided in Appendix A. Patients will be asked
             to record instances of accidental ingestion of these foods, with patients being
             removed from the study if this occurs 7 or more times.

             during course of study.

             ALT, ALK phos, total bilirubin) - within 2x ULN
