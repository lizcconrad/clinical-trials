    <textblock>
      The present study was to retrospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes of the cograft
      acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with autologous thin split-thickness skin for coverage of
      functional regional wounds in burned patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The potential of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) had been proved to improve cosmetic and
      functional outcomes, nevertheless, there had been few reports about the long term results of
      the morphological, histological and functional changes after placement. The present study was
      to retrospectively evaluate the long-term outcomes of the cograft acellular dermal matrix
      (ADM) with autologous thin split-thickness skin for coverage of functional regional wounds in
      burned patients.
