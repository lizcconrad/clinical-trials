      This is an open-label study to evaluate tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic
      profile of ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil in Japanese patients with previously
      untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Ofatumumab will be infused intravenously at Day
      1 (300 mg) and Day 8 (1000 mg) in the first 28-day cycle, followed by infusions of 1000 mg at
      the first day of each 28-day cycle. Chlorambucil will be given 10 mg/m2 at Day 1-7 in each
      28-day cycle.

      The primary objectives are to evaluate tolerability and overall response rate (ORR) of
      ofatumumab with chlorambucil for previously untreated (frontline) CLL.

      Secondary objectives include to evaluate complete remission (CR) rate, progression free
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to response, duration of response, time to next
      therapy, incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events, incidences of
      grade 3 and 4 infections and myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia), and
      pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab and chlorambucil.

After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by the IRC and the Investigator</title>
        <description>Progression free survival is defined as the time from start of treatment until disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined by the IRC or investigator according to the definitions of response in the IWCLL updated NCI-WG guidelines, 2008. According to the guidelines, PD is characterized by at least one of the following: lymphadenopathy (appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (&gt;1.5 centimeter [cm]), spleen or liver or other infiltrates or an increase by 50% or more in the greatest diameter of any previous site); an increase by 50% or more in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen; an increase by 50% or more in the numbers of blood lymphocytes with at least 5000 per microliter B-lymphocytes; transformation to a more aggressive histology; or occurrence of cytopenia attributable to chronic lymphocytic leukemia. PFS was censored at the last visit with adequate assessment for participants who were alive and had not progressed.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response, as Assessed by the IRC</title>
        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR, CRi, nPR or PR until the first documented sign of PD or death in participants with CR, CRi, nPR or PR. For participants who did not progress or die, duration of response was censored on the date of last assessment.</description>

After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Improvement in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS)</title>
        <description>ECOG PS is a scale to assess disease progression, extent to which disease affects the daily living abilities and determines appropriate treatment and prognosis. It is scored on a scale of 0 to 5 as, 0 (fully active), 1 (restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature), 2 (ambulatory and capable of all self cares but unable to carry out any work activities, up and about &gt; 50% of waking hours), 3 (capable of only limited self cares, confined to bed or chair &gt; 50% of waking hours), 4 (completely disabled, cannot carry on any self cares, totally confined to bed or chair), 5 (death). Improvement is defined as decrease from Baseline by at least one step on the ECOG performance status scale (yes/no). Baseline was the last pre-dose assessment performed on Cycle 1-Day 1(C1-D1). When C1-D1 was missing, the last assessment performed prior to pre-dose C1-D1 was used. It was performed on Day 1 of each cycle and follow-up (FU).</description>

        <population>All Subjects Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the All Subjects population.</population>

            <title>Ofatumumab + Chlorambucil</title>
            <description>Par. with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received intravenous (IV) infusions of ofatumumab on Day 1 (300 milligrams [mg]) and Day 8 (1000 mg) in the first cycle, followed by 1000 mg on the first day of each subsequent 28-day cycle in combination with oral chlorambucil 10 mg/meter squared (m^2) on Days 1-7 of each cycle for at least 3 cycles, until best overall response or up to 12 cycles. After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>

        <description>HAHA are indicators of immunogenicity induced by ofatumumab. Blood samples were taken from participants at Screening, Cycle 4-Day 85, FU 1-PDFU 1, and FU 169-PDFU 169. The presence of HAHA in human serum was determined using a validated electrochemiluminescent assay in a multi-tier assay format. The results are presented as participants with HAHA results as positive, negative or confirmation required.</description>

        <description>Immunoglobulins, or antibodies, are large proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses. Their normal blood levels indicate proper immune status. Low levels indicate immuno-suppression. IgA, IgG, and IgM were measured in the blood samples of the participants. Baseline IgA, IgG, and IgM values are the last pre-dose assessment values performed on Cycle 1-Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. Immunoglobulins were measured at Cycle 1-Day 1, FU 1-PDFU 1, and FU 169-PDFU 169 for participants in CR, PR, and stable disease (SD).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Positive or Negative for Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), as Assessed by IRC With CT</title>
        <description>MRD refers to small number of leukemic cells that remain in the participant's body during treatment or after treatment in participants who achieved a confirmed complete remission. MRD assessment in bone marrow aspiration sample was perfrmed by flow cytometry (cluster of differentiation [CD]5, CD19, CD20, CD23). The absence of MRD was defined as less than one CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes. The number of participants who were positive and negative for MRD are presented.</description>

            <description>Par. with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received intravenous (IV) infusions of ofatumumab on Day 1 (300 milligrams [mg]) and Day 8 (1000 mg) in the first cycle, followed by 1000 mg on the first day of each subsequent 28-day cycle in combination with oral chlorambucil 10 mg/meter squared (m^2) on Days 1-7 of each cycle for at least 3 cycles, until best overall response or up to 12 cycles. After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>

        <description>CD5+CD19+ cells were counted in peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Baseline CD5+CD19+ and CD5-CD19+ cell count value is the last pre-dose assessment values performed on Cycle 1-Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. B-cell monitoring (CD5+CD19+ and CD5-CD19+) was performed at Cycle 1 (Day 1, Day 15) and Cycle 2 (Day 29, Day 43), on Day 1 of Cycle 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 12 (Day 57, Day 85, Day 113, Day 141, Day 225, Day 309), 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (FU 1-PDFU 1) for all participants depending on the number of cycles administered, and 84 and 168 days after the day of FU 1-PDFU 1 for participants in CR, PR, and SD.</description>

        <description>t1/2 is the time required for the serum concentration of chlorambucil to decrease by half. Blood samples for serum concentration of chlorambucil was collected at Cycle 1-Day 1, Cycle 1-Day 4, and Cycle 3-Day 57. In each sampling, blood samples were collected at pre-dose, and 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 1.5 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, and 10 hr.</description>

After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>

After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>

            <description>Par. with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) received intravenous (IV) infusions of ofatumumab on Day 1 (300 milligrams [mg]) and Day 8 (1000 mg) in the first cycle, followed by 1000 mg on the first day of each subsequent 28-day cycle in combination with oral chlorambucil 10 mg/meter squared (m^2) on Days 1-7 of each cycle for at least 3 cycles, until best overall response or up to 12 cycles. After the Treatment Phase (for par. in CR, PR or SD), survival and disease status were assessed 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (Follow-up [FU] 1), 84 and 168 days after the day of FU1 (FU85 and FU169, respectively). For par. with disease progression (PD) during the Treatment Phase, post PD follow-up were done 28 days after the first day of the last treatment cycle (PDFU1) to assess safety. Survival status, date of next CLL therapy, and type of therapy were subsequently assessed 84 and 168 days after the day of PDFU1 (PDFU85 and PDFU169, respectively).</description>
