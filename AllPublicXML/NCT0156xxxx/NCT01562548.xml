      Explore the clinical efficacy of 7-day treatment regimens of guaifenesin in order to
      investigate the evidence that guaifenesin is an effective treatment for upper
      back/neck/shoulder muscle spasm/stiffness and pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Paticipant presents with a new episode of acute upper back/neck/shoulder pain and
             muscle spasm that:

               1. is at least 30 days from previous episode.

               2. has an onset occurred within 48 hours of Visit 1.

               3. has symptoms consistent with a clinical diagnosis as per the physical examination
                  at Visit 1.

               4. has a subject-rated muscle spasm score and a pain score of at least 40 out of 100
                  on a 100mm VAS.

          -  Paticipant has a normal neurological examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical history: a) Paticipant has a known or suspected intolerance or
             hypersensitivity to guaifenesin or methocarbamol (or closely related compounds) or any
             of their stated ingredients. b) Paticipant has history of upper back pain with active
             hypersensitive spots - trigger point in the muscles of upper
             back/neck/shoulder/maxillofacial regions. c) Paticipant has a current or recent
             history of liver and/or kidney disease, neck/back/shoulder injuries, spinal disc
             disease, myocardial infarction (&lt;12 months from Visit 1) and osteoporosis. d) Subjects
             have history of other chronic pain e.g. headache, osteoarthritis, arthritis, lower
             back pain etc.

          -  Medications: a) Paticipant has used a muscle relaxant or narcotic within 2 weeks of
             Visit 1. b) Paticipant has used monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selegiline within 2
             weeks of Visit 1 c) Currently using tricyclic antidepressants, lithium,
             anticoagulants, or tramadol.

          -  Paticipant is involved in a workers compensation case.

          -  Paticipant is unlikely to refrain from using analgesics, NSAIDs, and other muscle
             relaxants for the duration of the study, with the exception of cardioprotective doses
             of aspirin (i.e., ≤ 325 mg/day).

          -  Paticipant is unlikely to refrain from physical therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture,
             heat treatment, spas, etc for the duration of the study.
