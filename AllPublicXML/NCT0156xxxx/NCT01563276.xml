  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand why individuals with Progressive
      Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) fall. Understanding the mechanism of gait and balance dysfunction in
      individuals with PSP may provide us with important early diagnostic tools, allowing for
      earlier identification of mobility problems and to better evaluate medical therapies aimed at
      improving motor disability.

      The investigators will recruit 10 PSP, 10 PD and 10 healthy controls for the study. All
      subjects will be asked to come to the OHSU clinic at the Center for Health and Healing for an
      initial screening visit. They will meet with the primary investigator to conduct a brief
      interview and physical examination. In addition, they will be asked to answer questions
      regarding current and past medical illness, how often they fall and what kinds of medications
      they are on.

      Subjects who agree to participate will come to the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research
      Institute (OCTRI) at OHSU for balance testing. Subjects will be asked to stand or sit on a
      movable platform with eyes open or closed. Prior to standing on the platform, the
      investigators will place 6 small sensors on body which are held in place by velcro straps
      (one on each wrist, ankles, chest and lower back). The platform will then be moved (tilt or
      slide) while subjects try to keep their balance. During all of the balance tests described
      above, body movements will be recorded from the sensors on the subjects' body. This data is
      directly recorded by a computer and analyzed to help us gain better understanding of the
      subjects' posture and their ability to remain up right.

    <description>To gage the relative contributions of vestibular and visual information to postural control in PSP we will measure body sway using two different tests (LOS and SOT) while a patient stands on a movable force plate within a movable visual surround.</description>

    <time_frame>Single visit. 10 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to rise from a chair, walk and turn. Ambulatory balance will be measured by a time up and go test (TUG). Six accelerometers will be placed on the subject and will measure parameters including arm swing, number of steps and turn duration.</description>

    <measure>Perception of vertical and horizontal references</measure>
    <time_frame>Single visit. 2 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will perform two different tasks with their eyes closed while standing and sitting on a force plate that is tilting in the antero-posterior direction. They will perform the following two tasks: 1. Hold a rod parallel to the gravitional vertical 2. Hold a rod perpendicular to the tilting surface so it remains 90 degrees to the surface at all times. Six accelerometers will measure lower and upper body tilt.</description>
