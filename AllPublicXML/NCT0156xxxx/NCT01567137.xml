      Objective: To determine the accuracy of multi-functional magnetic resonance (MR) in
      detecting, localising and characterising satellite lesions in relation to an index breast
      tumour in order to improve definition of clinical target volume after local excision.

      Hypothesis: Pre-operative multi-functional MR has high sensitivity and specificity for
      localising unsuspected multifocal and multicentric lesions in women diagnosed with early
      breast cancer.

    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity of the MR technique in detecting histopathologically-identified multifocal/centric pre-invasive/invasive disease will be calculated (with 95% confidence intervals)from positive or negative correlates.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Closeness of agreement between MR techniques and histopathology in localising satellite lesions relative to the index tumour.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Distance &amp; distribution of lesions from reference tumour will be plotted and correlated with distances and signal characteristics seen on multifunctional MR.
Pre-op MRI volume will be plotted against histopathological dimensions and examined for agreement between the two methods.
Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests will be used to test for systematic differences between MRI and pathology measurements.</description>
