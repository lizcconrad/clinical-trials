    <textblock>
      The current international Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) replacement fluid doses
      of 35 ml/kg/h is better, but the result is according to white people, black people . It is
      Whether the best amount of replacement fluid for Chinese people, it is unclear.
      Especially,there is little evidence about the optimal dose from randomized trials in Cardiac
      surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI )required CRRT,According to the clinical
      situation, the design of replacement fluid to 25 ml/kg/h.The observation of two doses 14
      days, 28 days, 90 days survival and renal function.

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication in patients with cardiac surgery and is an
      independent predictor of mortality. However, the optimal intensity of renal replacement
      therapy for such patients is still controversial. we randomly assigned the patients with
      Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) to continuous renal replacement
      therapy with different treatment dose (35ml / kg / h or 25ml/kgÔºèh),The primary study outcome
      was death from any cause within 14, 28 and 90 days.
