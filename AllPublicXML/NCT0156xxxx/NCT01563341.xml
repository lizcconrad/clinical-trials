    <measure>Change in memory testing from presurgical baseline to 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Memory will be assessed with the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. The test consists of a set of six forms. Each test includes a list of 12 nouns; the examiner reads the list to the examinee, who repeats as many words as remembered, in any order. This process is repeated three times; 20-25 minutes later, examinees are asked again to recall as many words as possible; for the final task, the examiner reads a list of 24 words (including the 12 words from the list) and asks the examinee after each whether the word was on the list. For interpreting findings, in each metric listed (total recall, delayed recall, retention), higher scores reflect better learning efficiency (total recall) and memory (delayed recall, retention). Since this is a longitudinal study, follow-up scores will be compared to baseline. A positive direction of change would be interpreted as &quot;improved&quot; and a negative direction of change would be interpreted as &quot;declined&quot;.</description>
