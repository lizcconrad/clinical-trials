  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look for low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) in prostate cancer
      using a special x-ray test called a positron emission tomography (PET)scan. Hypoxia may have
      an effect on how prostate cancer grows and responds to treatments like radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy. The use of PET scans to measure hypoxia may be better and simpler than the
      methods used previously.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age =&gt; 18 years

          -  Histologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Bulky intermediate risk, high risk or metastatic prostate cancer

        Bulky intermediate risk: cT1-2 with &gt;50% of diagnostic biopsy cores containing cancer and
        Gleason 6 or 7 and prostate specific antigen (PSA) &gt;10 and ≤20 OR

        High risk:

        cT1-2 with Gleason score ≥8; or cT1-2 with PSA &gt;20; or cT3 OR N+ and/or M1 disease OR Newly
        diagnosed hormone-refractory prostate cancer - Intention to treat using radiotherapy +/-
        concurrent and adjuvant hormonal therapy

          -  Intention to treat with radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, other systemic treatment for
             prostate cancer, or a combination of these according to the Princess Margaret
             Genitourinary Site policies.

          -  Previous or concurrent anti-cancer therapy for the PET FAZA target lesion allowed

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to lie supine for more than 60 minutes

          -  Patients taking the drug disulfiram (Antabuse)

          -  Contraindications for MRI: only applicable in cases where the PET FAZA target lesion
             is identified as the prostate gland. Patients with target lesions at other anatomic
             sites will not undergo MR imaging.
