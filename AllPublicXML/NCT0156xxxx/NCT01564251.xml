  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, Phase I, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GDC-0575 administered alone or in combination with
      gemcitabine in participants with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. In Stage 1, cohorts of
      participants will receive multiple ascending oral doses of GDC-0575 alone or in combination
      with intravenous gemcitabine. In Stage 2, participants will receive GDC-0575 orally in
      combination with intravenous gemcitabine at or below the maximum tolerated dose determined in
      Stage 1. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity occurs, up to approximately 5 years.
