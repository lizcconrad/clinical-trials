  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HER2/neu expressing solid tumors progressing after standard therapy will be
      treated with a so called trifunctional antibody (Ertumaxomab). The main objective of this
      trial is to find the maximum tolerated dose. Tolerability and Safety will be assessed as well
      as efficacy.

      This is an open label phase I/II study dose escalating study to investigate safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the trifunctional anti-HER2/neu x anti-CD3 antibody
      ertumaxomab in patients with HER2/neu (1+/SISH positive, 2+ and 3+) expressing solid tumors
      progressing after standard therapy. The primary objectives of the study is to assess the
      safety and tolerability of ertumaxomab in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and to establish a recommended dose (RD) for further development.

      A maximum of ten infusions will be applicated.

      Patients will be seen at baseline/screening, and then weekly for infusion and safety
      assessment with a break of 3 weeks after the 5th dose. Radiological tumor assessment will be
      performed every 6 weeks. Post-study follow-up will be completed every 8 weeks for up to one
      year.
