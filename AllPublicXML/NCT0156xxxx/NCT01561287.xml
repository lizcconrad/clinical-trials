  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer affects about 1 out of 8 American women. Twenty percent of breast cancer
      patients undergo some form of breast reconstruction. Several types of reconstructive
      procedures are available for appropriate patients. A reconstructive sequence consisting of a
      tissue expander followed by permanent implant placement is a popular choice for many women.
      In the past several years, acellular dermal matrices (allografts) have been used at the time
      of tissue expander placement to extend submuscular coverage. Reported benefits include the
      ability to initially fill the expander to a greater extent, improved control of the
      inframammary crease, and possible decrease in capsular contracture rate. Potential
      disadvantages of dermal allografts include foreign body reaction, incomplete tissue
      integration, or increased infection rates. The latter is especially worrisome, as infection
      in the setting of a tissue expander often necessitates the removal of the implant and
      interruption of the reconstructive sequence. There have been a few scattered reports of the
      use of dermal autografts in implant-based breast reconstruction, but they have not been
      widely used. Dermal autografts carry the potential benefit of improved tissue integration and
      lowered complication rates. However, to date there have been no studies which compare
      acellular dermal allograft matrices to dermal autograft for use in breast reconstruction. The
      objectives of this study are to compare dermal allograft to dermal autograft with respect to
      cost, tissue integration, patient satisfaction with scar, and complication profile in
      patients undergoing mastectomy followed by tissue expander/implant reconstruction.

      This is a retrospective comparative study of two established therapies. It is designed to
      enroll patients who will be undergoing breast reconstruction with tissue expanders/implants.
      Two groups will be created. One with patients receiving acellular dermal allograft for
      submuscular coverage and a second group of patients undergoing dermal autograft for
      submuscular coverage. Patients with a lower abdominal scar and sufficient abdominal laxity
      for autograft harvest will be offered this technique. The subset of these patients who elect
      to undergo autografting will comprise the autograft group. The allograft group will consist
      of the patients without a suitable abdomen for autografting and those who decline the
      autograft procedure. Patients in the allograft group will have placement of dermal allograft
      over the lower pole of the tissue expander. Patients in the autograft group will undergo
      harvest of a dermal autograft from the lower abdomen at the time of mastectomy, which will be
      used to cover the lower pole of the tissue expander. The following data will be recorded in
      an unidentifiable fashion: age, medical history, type of breast cancer treatment, type of
      reconstruction to include implant type, brand, implant size and characteristics, time of
      surgery including autograft harvest, and cost of overall procedure. Patients will receive
      routine follow-up care only, and the presence of any complications will be recorded. Per the
      standard reconstructive sequence for implant-based breast reconstruction, all patients will
      undergo a second surgical procedure under general anesthesia approximately three months
      following the initial surgical procedure for replacement of the tissue expander with a
      permanent implant and capsulotomy. At the time of this procedure, three small samples of the
      internal capsule will be harvested from standard locations with a 4mm biopsy punch. Histology
      with H/E and factor VIII staining will be performed on these samples to measure inflammation,
      tissue architecture, and vascular ingrowth. Comorbidities between patients with and without
      acellular dermal matrices will be evaluated using the Fisher exact test. Group differences
      for continuous variables will be assessed with the t test.

      Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>To accurately measure the neovascularization of the implants, the number of blood vessels per 40x high-power field (hpf) will be counted on the slides stained with Factor VIII. Any brown-staining endothelial cell or endothelial-cell cluster, clearly separate from adjacent microvessel and other connective-tissue elements, will be considered a single, countable microvessel. Vessel lumens, although usually present, will not be necessary for a structure to be defined as a microvessel, and red cells will not be used to define a vessel lumen.</description>

    <description>The acellular dermal matrix used in our study is AlloDerm (LifeCell Corp., Branchburg, N.J.) The AlloDerm group will consist of patients without a suitable abdomen for autografting and those who declined the dermal autograft procedure. Patients in the dermal allograft group will have placement of AlloDerm over the lower pole of the tissue expander.
