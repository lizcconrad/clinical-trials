  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that reducing salt in the diet will improve the function of
      blood vessels in middle aged and older adults with moderately elevated systolic blood
      pressure, by increasing the amount of BH4 and nitric oxide in your blood vessels and reducing
      the amount of oxidative stress.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The improvement in blood vessel function will be determined over a 10 week period. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned to either a 'low salt' condition (placebo pills + 1200 mg dietary
      sodium) or a 'normal salt' condition (2300 mg sodium chloride pills + 1200 mg dietary sodium)
      and monitored for 5 weeks. After the initial set of 5 weeks, the subjects are switched into
      the opposite condition, completing the cross-over study design. During weeks 1-4 and 6-9,
      subjects are monitored weekly with 24 hour urine collections and diet logs. The assessment of
      the primary outcome (blood vessel function) is completed during weeks 5 and 10. BH4 and
      ascorbic acid are also administered during weeks 5 and 10 to measure the effects of sodium
      intake on endogenous BH4 levels and vascular oxidative stress.
