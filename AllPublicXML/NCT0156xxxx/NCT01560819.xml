  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, debilitating, relapsing inflammatory disorder
      affecting the gastrointestinal tract which does not have a medical cure. IBD consists of 2
      different forms: Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). In the last 2 decades, Gut
      Microbial Transplantation (GMT), also known as fecal transplantation, has been used as a
      treatment option for Clostridium difficile colitis and UC. The literature supports strong
      evidence for the plausibility of using GMT for patients with IBD associated colitis,
      especially for patients with UC.

      This research will be conducted in the Helen DeVos Children's Hospital (HDVCH) Pediatric
      gastrointestinal outpatient clinic. A pilot study of ten patients will be conducted to
      evaluate if GMT improves clinical symptoms in patients with IBD. Patients with IBD colitis
      (UC and CD with colonic involvement only) will be approached for GMT as a treatment option
      for their disease. Each subject will undergo 5 sessions (1 session/day, and not necessarily
      on consecutive days) of GMT within a period of 10 days. Post treatment evaluation will be
      done at their regularly scheduled clinic follow up.

      Healthy donors &gt;18 years of age will be chosen by the family, inclusive of immediate family
      members and friends. Donors will be required to complete a screening questionnaire, provide
      medical history, and undergo blood and stool tests.

    <description>Each participant received Gut Microbial Transplantation (GMT) as retention enema over a period of 1 hour (60mL enema every 15 minutes) daily for 5 days. Although 240mL of GMT solution was prepared for each participant, the final administered dose was dependent on the subject's comfort and willingness to proceed with the next enema, which was assessed after each enema infusion. Subjects were monitored for 30 minutes after GMT for any immediate adverse events and discharged.</description>
