  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that NIR fluorescence angiography using the
      PINPOINT Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System (&quot;PINPOINT System&quot; or &quot;PINPOINT&quot;) can assess
      viability of colon tissue during laparoscopic left colectomy. This information will provide
      the surgeon with clinically relevant information in assessing whether or not the tissue has
      adequate blood supply in the lower section of the colon prior to a colectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colectomy is a surgical procedure in which a part or all of the colon is removed. It is used
      to treat a variety of diseases including colon cancer, diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel
      disease (including ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) and infarcted bowel.

      This study is the second phase of a three phase process to demonstrate the clinical utility
      of perfusion assessment by NIR fluorescence angiography in colectomy. The initial phase
      (Phase I) consisted of a number of small investigative studies that have now been completed.
      Upon successful completion of this study, it is anticipated that a prospective, multi center,
      randomized trial will be conducted (Phase III). Information learned from this present study
      will help guide the design of the randomized trial e.g. specific patient populations that may
      best benefit from this imaging modality and how randomization should be conducted (e.g.
      imaged cohort vs. non imaged, or all subjects imaged but then randomized to no image
      assessment in one arm of the study).

    <description>The PINPOINT system will be used to provide real-time endoscopic visible and endoscopic NIR fluorescence imaging. PINPOINT enables surgeons to perform routine visible light endoscopic procedures as well as further visually assess vessels, blood flow and related tissue perfusion with near infra-red imaging during minimally invasive surgery</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is scheduled for laparoscopic left colectomy in the lower region (planned
             anastomosis located 5 - 15 cm from anal verge)

             iodine dyes

          -  Subject has any medical condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator and/or
