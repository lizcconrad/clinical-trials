      A Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicenter, Phase 2 Trial Comparing Veliparib Plus Carboplatin
      and Paclitaxel Versus Placebo Plus Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Previously Untreated
      Metastatic or Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

      Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups. The safety of
      each treatment group will be assessed by evaluating study drug exposure, adverse events,
      serious adverse events, all deaths, changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign
      parameters. Progression -Free Survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1) will be assessed as well as Overall Survival (OS) and the
      Objective Response Rate (ORR). Study visits will be conducted according to the protocol
      schedule. Study visits will include physical examination, laboratory blood sample collection,
      and assessment of vital signs, medical history and urinalysis. 12-lead Electrocardiogram
      (ECG) will be performed at protocol specified visits.

        assessment).

          -  Subject must have cytologically or histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer
             (NSCLC).
