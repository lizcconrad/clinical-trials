  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serotype distribution and estimation of antimicrobial resistance in S. pneumoniae isolates
      and anticipated PCV7 and PCV13 coverage is difficult in Greece, because invasive isolates
      collected each year are limited and depict a certain proportion of patients who have easy
      access to tertiary care or have underlying medical reasons which necessitate inpatient care.
      It is also probable that the real burden of pneumococcal disease is not well estimated
      especially among adults. New additions in the laboratory setting such as the pneumococcal
      urine antigen assay (Binax NOW®) and the Urinary Antigen Diagnostic Assay (Luminex) for the
      detection of 13 serotype specific polysaccharides in human urine developed by Pfizer might be
      helpful in identifying more pneumococcal infections compared to the previous years. This NIS
      is based on the unmet scientific need to describe the serotype distribution and the
      resistance profile of isolates from X-Ray confirmed CAP in the present circumstances.
