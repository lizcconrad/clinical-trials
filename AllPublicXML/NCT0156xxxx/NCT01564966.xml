      -  A reduce in renal mass may result in remnant single nephron hyperfiltration, with
           associated proteinuria and an accelerated loss of kidney function.

        -  Live-donor kidney transplantation is generally considered the best choice for patients
           who have renal failure and are awaiting transplantation, because these kidneys function
           better than kidneys from deceased donors, and waiting times for deceased-donor
           transplants are long

        -  Although several studies have shown that kidney donation has low short-term morbidity
           and mortality, the data on long-term outcomes are much less complete.

        -  This study is designed to prospectively evaluate the effects of unilateral nephrectomy
           on cardiovascular-renal functions of donors after living kidney donation: the
           development of hypertension, albuminuria, renal failure, inflammatory and endothelial
           changes.

  <detailed_description>

      Renal dysfunction is associated with accelerated cardiovascular disease even when kidney
      function is only mildly impaired. Besides, even levels of urinary albumin excretion below the
      accepted threshold for microalbuminuria are associated with increased cardiovascular risk,
      and the risk increases as the degree of proteinuria rises.

        -  Live-donor kidney transplantation is generally considered the best choice for patients
           who have renal failure and are awaiting transplantation, because these kidneys function
           better than kidneys from deceased donors, and waiting times for deceased-donor
           transplants are long. Although several studies have shown that kidney donation has low
           short-term morbidity and mortality, the data on long-term outcomes are much less
           complete. The short and long term renal functions of donors after kidney donation were
           much studied and still remain uncertain, the cardiovascular effects of reduction in
           renal mass in kidney donors is also not clearly known.

        -  Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is the first step for subsequent development of
           atherosclerosis, which can help us to assess the cardiovascular changes after kidney
           donation. Prospectively examining the endothelial consequences of uninephrectomy in
           donors may provide useful insight into the existence and pathophysiology of
           cardiovascular disease in donors and, therefore, into how the cardiovascular disease
           risk associated with renal impairment might eventually be reduced.
