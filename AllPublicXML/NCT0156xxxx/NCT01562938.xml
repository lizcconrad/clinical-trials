    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo controlled study enrolling 42 healthy adult subjects
      (18-45yrs) from 1 site. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:3:2 ratio to receive MEDI-557 or
      placebo. Subjects will receive 1 intravenous dose on Study Day 1. Subjects will be followed
      for safety from the time of Informed Consent through 360 days post dose.

      A Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of MEDI-557 administered IV to healthy adult subjects (18-45yrs). A maximum of
      42 subjects from 1 site will be enrolled in a 2:3:2 ratio (12 placebo, 18 MEDI-557 low-dose,
      12 MEDI-557 high-dose) to allow for greater data collection in the low-dose group. Subjects
      are evaluated for safety from time of Informed Consent through Study Day 360 post dose.
