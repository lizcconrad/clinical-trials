    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to use a DEK ELISA to quantitatively measure DEK protein in
      the urine of patients suspected of having bladder cancer. The measurement of urine DEK
      protein, relative to an established cut-off, is correlated with the presence or absence of
      bladder cancer.

      Sample Collection:

      Urine samples used in the study will be collected immediately prior to the urological
      evaluation procedure and stored at -80 oC. Urine samples will be sent to sponsor and remain
      at -80o C until analysis.

      Clinical Data Collection:

      All subject and clinical information will be recorded on the form in section 9.3. Enrollment
      Checklist and Case Report Form (CRF). Information regarding the history of hematuria and
      urine cytology will be recorded. In addition, non-identifying information including age, sex,
      race, smoking history, alcohol consumption, occupational exposure to chemicals or dyes,
      history of urologic disorder or disease, history of irritative voiding symptoms, history of
      urinary tract infection, history of pelvic irradiation, and analgesic abuse will be recorded.
      The Investigators will also be asked to provide information from the subjects' medical
      records for up to one (1) year after their enrollment and sample collection. In particular,
      diagnosis of TCC, other malignant diseases, or non-malignant urogenital conditions will be
      provided.
