  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the efficacy of minocycline augmentation in a sample of moderately
      ill outpatients with early-course schizophrenia on their chlorpromazine-equivalent doses of
      second-generation antipsychotic medications. The investigators hypothesize that as compared
      to placebo a 2-month treatment with minocycline in 120 volunteers with early-course
      schizophrenia will result in a more significant improvement in psychopathology (primary
      outcome) and cognitive symptoms (secondary outcome). In addition, cytokine plasma levels will
      be used as another secondary outcome measure to see if treatment-induced changes in total
      PANSS score are associated with changes in cytokine levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Minocycline, which is a second-generation tetracycline, has been found to inhibit Nitric
      Oxide Synthase (NOS) and inflammatory cytokines. These are some of the primary mechanisms
      that have been proposed to explain its neuroprotective and neuroplastic effects in several
      animal and human models of neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson's
      disease and schizophrenia. There are only three clinical trials with minocycline in
      schizophrenia subjects. A more definitive clinical trial in a larger sample with optimized
      and cost-effective design using a comprehensive cognitive battery and a global assessment of
      schizophrenia symptom domains is necessary to examine the efficacy of minocycline. If
      minocycline improves psychopathology and potentially other symptoms (including cognitive
      function) for schizophrenia, the treatment could be easily implemented in the existing
      treatment delivery system at relatively low cost and have the potential for making a
      significant public health impact. The investigators plan to recruit 120 individuals with
      early course schizophrenia who are currently on second-generation antipsychotic (SGA)
      medications and are experiencing persistent symptoms in at least the moderate range. In an
      effort to limit placebo response, which is notoriously high in psychiatric population, the
      investigators are using an adaptive design. Since, there is growing evidence to support the
      inflammatory hypothesis of schizophrenia, the investigators will also explore whether
      cytokine levels mediate the response from minocycline treatment.

    <description>PANSS total score will be used to examine treatment-induced change in psychaopthology. The PANSS is a 30-item rating scale used to assess symptoms of psychopathology. We will use the total PANSS score as the primary outcome measure which reflects total level of psychopathology including the positive and negative symptoms as well as general psychopathology.This measure will be administered at baseline, week 8 and week 16 of the study to assess if minocyline treatment results in a significant reduction in PANSS total score as opposed to placebo.</description>

    <description>Average total score on MCCB will be used to examine treatment-induced change in cognitive function. MCCB (Nuechterlein et al., 2008) will be admisnitered at the baseline an week 16 of the study. The MCCB assesses 7 domains of cognitive functioning known to be impaired for individuals with schizophrenia. A summary score averaging across domains is generated as a global measure of cognitive functioning.</description>
