  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent form of arthritis in the elderly. It is estimated
      that 7% of men and 11% of women over the age of 65 have KOA. The most significant symptoms of
      the disease are pain and functional disability.

      This study has two aims:

        1. To characterise the gait patterns and clinical parameters of patients with knee
           osteoarthritis (KOA) in Singapore at baseline, prior to treatment.

        2. To investigate the changes in gait patterns and the clinical benefits of treatment with
           a new biomechanical device, AposTherapy, for patients with KOA.
