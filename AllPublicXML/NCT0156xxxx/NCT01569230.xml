  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy and safety of acupuncture treatments
      (Individualized, Standardized acupuncture) for patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators targeted the patients with knee OA. After treatment in 4 groups -
      individualized acupuncture treatment, standardized acupuncture treatment, sham-needle
      treatment, and waiting groups - the investigators will compare the effects of pain relieving
      and daily performing improvement. So the investigators will confirm the efficacy of
      acupuncture, and further the best treatment method. In addition, the investigators are going
      to evaluate the safety of abnormal reaction during the treatment.
