    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Probable AD by DSM IV and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria

          -  Females must be surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, both ovaries removed or
             hysterectomy) or post-menopausal for at least 2 years.

          -  &gt; 50 years of age

          -  Residing in the community at baseline (includes assisted living facilities, long-term
             care nursing facilities)

          -  Mini Mental State Examination at screen of 12-26 (inclusive)

          -  No medical contraindications to study participation

          -  Fluent in English at least 8 years of education.

          -  Supervision available for study medication. Caregiver/study partner to accompany
             participant to all visits. Study partner must have direct contact with the participant
             &gt; 2 days/week

          -  Able to ingest oral medication.

          -  Neuroimaging (CT or MRI or PET) consistent with the diagnosis of AD at some time after
             the onset of the memory decline.

          -  Clinical laboratory values must be within normal limits or, if abnormal, must be
             judged to be clinically insignificant by the investigator

          -  Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine is permitted if doses are stable
             for 3 months prior to enrollment. Dose should be stable throughout the study unless it
             is clinically necessary to adjust the medication.

          -  Stable use of anti-depressants is permitted if doses are stable for 3 months prior to
             enrollment. Dose should be stable throughout the study unless it is clinically
             necessary to adjust the medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dementia not due to probable Alzheimer's disease

          -  Pregnancy, breastfeeding. The rationale is that retinoids are teratogenic and are
             excreted in breast milk.

          -  History of clinically significant stroke

          -  Modified Hachinski Ischemia score â‰¥ 4

          -  Current evidence or history in past two years of epilepsy, seizure, focal brain
             lesion, head injury with loss of consciousness or DSM IV criteria for any major
             psychiatric disorder including psychosis, major depression, bipolar disorder, severe
             alcohol or substance abuse.

          -  Sensory impairment which would prevent subject from participating in or cooperating
             with the protocol.

          -  Use of another investigational agent within two months.

          -  Evidence of any significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that renders the
             participant unsuitable for receiving an investigational new drug including clinically
             significant or unstable hematologic, hepatic, cardiovascular (including history of
             ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia), pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             endocrine, metabolic, renal, or other systemic disease or laboratory abnormality.
             Abnormal liver function test, including AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or prothrombin
             time. The rationale is that retinoids can be hepatotoxic.

          -  Participants receiving behavioral medications (including antidepressants,
             antipsychotics and anxiolytics) must be on stable doses for at least 4 weeks prior to
             randomization.

          -  Active neoplastic disease and any medical conditions requiring concurrent
             immunosuppression.

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia greater than 500 mg/dL despite statin/fibrate therapy. The
             rationale is that retinoids can increase lipids, particularly triglyceride and this
             can lead to pancreatitis.

          -  Any medical conditions requiring concurrent use of tetracycline, minocycline, or
             doxycycline. The rationale is due to enhanced risk of increased intracranial pressure.

          -  Hypersensitivity to retinoids.

          -  Presence of psychosis or hallucinations at baseline as determined by Neuropsychiatric
             inventory or Geriatric Depression Scale-short form greater than or equal to five

          -  Presence of any unstable cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes, chronic
             inflammatory or infectious conditions. Retinoids have been associated with chest pain
             of unclear etiology, increased serum glucose, myelosuppression and increased risk of
             infection.

          -  Use of Drugs and supplements such as: Vitamin A supplements beyond 100% RDA, other
             immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, etc.), Warfarin , Fish
             Oil (DHA)

          -  Any other disease or medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into
             this clinical trial.
