  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is one of the most common female malignancies in the United States, and
      has increased in incidence in Taiwan in recent decades.A recent population-based analysis
      noted that 4% of endometrial cancers occurred in women aged 40 years or younger, furthermore
      it is up to 15% in Taiwan according to the data of cancer registry. The standard treatment of
      endometrial cancer results in surgical menopause and places patients at risk for the
      long-term sequelae of estrogen deprivation. The goal of this study was to determine the
      frequency of a coexisting ovarian malignancy and to evaluate the outcome of ovarian
      preservation in women with treatment for endometrial cancer.

      we reviewed the cases with early stage of endometrial cancer who have primary staging surgery
      between January 1989 to December 2009. The enrolled patients will be divided into two group
      (oophorectomy vs. ovary preservation) for analysis:the outcome and recurrence type.To
      evaluate the outcome of ovarian preservation in women with endometrial cancer .
