  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Activity Score-28 (DAS 28) Response Classification at Month 3 and Moth 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (millimeter per hour [mm/hr]), and patient global assessment of disease activity (PGH) (measured on a 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28 is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale: a score greater than (&gt;) 5.1 indicates high disease activity; a score between 3.2 and 5.1 indicates moderate disease activity; a score of less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity; a score of less than (&lt;) 2.6 is considered remission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Response Classification at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>CDAI is the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGH and physician global assessment of disease activity (PhGH) assessed on 0-10 cm VAS; 0 = no disease activity and 10 = worst disease activity. CDAI total score = 0-76. CDAI &lt;= 2.8 indicates clinical remission, &gt;2.8 to 10 = low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 = high (or severe) disease activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Simplified Disease Activity (SDAI) Response Classification</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SDAI was a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA which reflected the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGH and PhGH, assessed on 0-100 mm VAS where 0 = no disease activity and 100 = worst disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP). SDAI total score = 0-86. A SDAI score &lt;/= 3.3 represented clinical remission, a score of between 3.4 and 11.0 represented low disease activity, a score between 11 and 26.0 represented moderate disease activity and a score &gt; 26.0 represented high (or severe) disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response assessed as per EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria was defined as clinically meaningful improvement at a particular time point. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in the DAS28 score and also on the actual DAS28 score at the time point so was more reflective of the current status of the participant. The DAS28 score was a measure of the participant's disease activity, based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PGH, and ESR. DAS28 total scores ranged from 0 to approximately 10. Scores &lt;2.6 = best disease control and scores &gt;5.1 = worse disease control. A negative CFB indicated clinically meaningful improvement. EULAR Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &lt;-1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a CFB &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2. EULAR No response: DAS28 ≤3.2 or CFB greater than or equal to (&gt;=) -0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or CFB&gt;=-0.6 and DAS28 &gt;5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Response at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>ACR response was calculated based on total joint count evaluation (28 or 66/68 joint count) and other clinical and laboratory assessments. A positive ACR20 response required at least a 20% improvement (reduction) compared to baseline in swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) and at least 3 of the following 5 assessments: patient's global assessment of pain, PGH, PhGH (all 3 assessed at 0 [good] to 100 mm [worst] VAS scale), participant assessment of disability measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (assessed on a 0 to 3 scale, where higher scores represented higher disease activity), Acute phase reactant (CRP or ESR). A reduction in the level of and acute phase reactants was considered an improvement. ACR50, ACR70, ACR90 require a 50%, 70%, 90% improvement from baseline respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician Global Assessment of Disease Activity at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The physician's global assessment of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 mm horizontal VAS by the physician. The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Assessment of disease activity provides an overall assessment of how RA affects the participant using a visual analogue score, where 0 indicates they are managing very well and 100 indicates they are managing very poorly. A decrease in the score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI was a participant self-reported questionnaire for assessing the extent of a participant's functional ability. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 to 3, where higher scores represented higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Simplified Disease Activity (SDAI) Response Classification</title>
        <description>The SDAI was a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA which reflected the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGH and PhGH, assessed on 0-100 mm VAS where 0 = no disease activity and 100 = worst disease activity, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

        <description>Clinical response assessed as per EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria was defined as clinically meaningful improvement at a particular time point. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in the DAS28 score and also on the actual DAS28 score at the time point so was more reflective of the current status of the participant. The DAS28 score was a measure of the participant’s disease activity, based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PGH, and ESR. DAS28 total scores ranged from 0 to approximately 10. Scores &lt;2.6 = best disease control and scores &gt;5.1 = worse disease control. A negative CFB indicated clinically meaningful improvement. EULAR Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &lt;-1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a CFB &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2. EULAR No response: DAS28 ≤3.2 or CFB greater than or equal to (&gt;=) -0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or CFB&gt;=-0.6 and DAS28 &gt;5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6.</description>

It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do.

          <description>The HAQ-DI was a participant self-reported questionnaire for assessing the extent of a participant’s functional ability. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 to 3, where higher scores represented higher disease activity.</description>
