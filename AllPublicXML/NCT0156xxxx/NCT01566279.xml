  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that certain mutations in the individual cancer genomes will
      predict response to Everolimus therapy. To identify possible genetic mutations that affect
      tumor response to Everolimus the investigators will obtain sequence analysis of tumors from
      all patients that will be treated with Everolimus in this study. Moreover, the investigators
      performed a systematic review of the currently available data to identify mutations that
      could be predictive for increased mTOR activity in cancer cells. These mutations have been
      described to lead to mTOR activation but their predictive value for response to Everolimus
      therapy remains unclear. The investigators will use the data generated in the investigators
      own prospective treatment study and the data from literature to select patients for entry
      into a second part of this trial. In this part the investigators want to test the hypothesis
      that selecting patients based on their specific genetic mutations increases the likelihood of
      response.
