  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seniors who receive supportive services face a variety of psychosocial vulnerabilities that
      put them at risk for depression. One group with very high risk is older adults receiving
      aging services through Medicaid waiver programs. This 3-year research uses a randomized
      controlled clinical trial to assess the effectiveness of brief behavioral therapies (problem
      solving therapy [PST] and Brief Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia [BBTI]) to prevent depression
      in seniors receiving aging services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will determine (i) if a course of problem solving therapy (PST) and Brief
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (BBTI), with boosters, reduces incidence of major depressive
      episodes over 12 months relative to usual care, and (ii) the extent to which behavioral
      therapies achieve these effects through enhancement of protective factors, such as greater
      self-efficacy, better targeting of services to address needs, and greater control over home
      environments.

      Periodic blood draws will be used to assess biosignatures of depression. Guiding our
      investigations of pharmacogenetics, inflammation, and proteomics are synergistic interactions
      among the serotonergic system, the HPA axis, systemic inflammation, growth factors such as
      brain derived neuro-trophic factor (BDNF), psychosocial stressors, and vascular co-morbidity.
      Genetic variation in vasopressin receptors, potentially involved in both cardiovascular risk
      and social attachment, is also associated with recurrence of depression. Similarly, genetic
      variation in inflammation may influence antidepressant response and medical co-morbidity.
