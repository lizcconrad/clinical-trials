  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The critical nature of respiratory diseases, the continuously increasing prevalence of these
      conditions, and the subjective perception of patients vis-à-vis their pulmonary function and
      health status underscore the importance of home telemonitoring. These conditions are critical
      and necessitate close and regular monitoring that may be achieved at distance using
      telemonitoring. This study will assess a number of measures both at baseline and
      post-intervention from a number of domains, including Arterial Blood Gases (ABG),
      BiPAP-related data, chronic respiratory failure symptoms, health-related quality of life,
      patients satisfaction and utilization of healthcare resources.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years home care is becoming increasingly used and considered by some the future of
      healthcare. Home mechanical ventilation has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in
      patients with chronic respiratory failure of different aetiologies. A French survey suggests
      an increase of 12% of cases per year. With the prospect of a substantial increase of
      ventilated patients at home, facilities and resources have not been proportionally growing,
      so new approaches should be investigated and addressed to absorb this constant flux of
      patients.

      Telemedicine is defined as the broad use of electronic and communications technologies to
      provide and support remote monitoring of health status. It has been shown to be an effective
      alternative model of care for managing chronic diseases. It as also been shown to reduce
      healthcare costs and is a major topic on the agendas of health and social care policies in
      Europe.

      Home telemonitoring of respiratory conditions results in early identification of
      deteriorations in patient condition and symptom control.

      However, evidence on the magnitude of clinical and structural effects remains preliminary,
      with variations in study approaches and an absence of robust study designs and formal
      evaluations.

      The objective is gathering data that can be help to establish guidelines for non invasive
      home mechanical ventilation initiation and quality control.

    <description>Patients will be initiated and adapted on non-invasive home mechanical ventilation in Pulmonology Department of S. João Hospital, in an outpatient setting, according to the prevailing standard of care for Chronic Respiratory Diseases patients in this unit. Patients will be provided with a ventilator outfitted with a wireless transmitter to allow the remote data collection of compliance and efficacy information. While patient sleeps, data is collected. If abnormalities criteria will be detected, remote titration of ventilator settings will be done to optimise therapy. Patient will be monitored again and data analyzed. This procedure will be repeated until we obtained the optimal ventilator parameters for each patient in this group. Nocturnal oximetry under home mechanical non-invasive ventilation will be carried out after one week and one month of treatment. Subjects also receive pre-arranged telephone calls to assist with progress.</description>

    <description>Patients will be initiated and adapted on non-invasive home mechanical ventilation in Pulmonology Department of S. João Hospital, in an outpatient setting, according to the prevailing standard of care for Chronic Respiratory Diseases patients in this unit. Patients will be assessed by a hospital visit scheduled at the end of third month after their initial adaptation. In this hospital visit data provided by the ventilator will be transferred to research team computer so they could evaluate patient compliance and efficacy of ventilation criteria under the parameters used at home present at the time of assessment. If abnormality criteria will be detected, re-titration of ventilator settings will be made. Patients will be encouraged to call their respiratory consultant any time they had a problem or concern.</description>
