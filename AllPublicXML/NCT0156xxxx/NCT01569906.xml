      To assess prospectively, the response of moderate to severe atopic eczema to a standard
      course of narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy by using validated objective and subjective
      scoring systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with moderate to severe atopic eczema prescribed a course of narrowband UVB
      phototherapy were scored (using validated scoring systems) objectively and subjectively
      before, during and after the course of treatment, as well as 3 and 6 months post treatment
      (to determine length of remission). Their scores were compared to a control group. The
      control group comprised children with moderate to severe atopic eczema who were offered UVB
      but were unable to undertake the treatment.
