  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Previous studies have suggested that psycho-educational interventions delivered by
      telephone improve adherence to initial colposcopy after an abnormal Pap smear. To further
      explore strategies for enhanced follow-up to medical care recommendations, we studied the
      impact of a theory-guided cognitive-affective barriers counseling intervention, delivered at
      2-4 weeks before the colposcopy appointment, for inner city women. The comprehensive
      telephone barriers intervention was compared to an enhanced comparison group and a group that
      received tailored print materials.

      Methods: Participants (N = 211) were recruited through a colposcopy clinic and randomly
      assigned to: 1) telephone assessment of barriers to follow up adherence recommendations
      combined with tailored telephone barriers counseling; 2) telephone assessment combined with
      tailored barriers print brochure; or 3) telephone assessment with no barriers counseling.
      Participants were assessed at baseline, 1-week, 9 and 15 months post-colposcopy.

      Objective: Previous studies have shown that theory-based, tailored telephone barriers
      counseling significantly improves adherence to a colposcopy appointment after an abnormal pap
      smear result among low-income, minority women. This study built on these research findings
      and explored the efficacy of a state-of-the-science telephone counseling intervention
      utilizing a more rigorous study design. This enhanced counseling intervention was tailored to
      individual's distinctive cognitive-affective barriers profile, as assessed by the
      Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) model-guided barriers assessment
      tool, and with counseling messages targeted to all five domains of individual's barriers to
      adherence. In addition, the current study design was improved in two ways. First, the
      comparison group in this current study was an enhanced one that received a notification
      letter, assessment of cognitive-affective barriers by telephone, and a telephone appointment
      reminder. Second, this study had a longer follow-up period to allow testing of the
      intervention effect beyond initial colposcopy adherence. The participants were followed for
      15 months post-colposcopy so that participants' adherence to medical follow-up
      recommendations (if any) within the 12 months after initial colposcopy can be collected and
      studied. Adherence to medical follow-up at 6 months and 12 months was measured at 9 months
      and 15 months, respectively, to allow 3 months for rescheduling, attending, and recording of
      the appointment. Overall, this study tested whether an enhanced tailored telephone barriers
      counseling intervention improve adherence to medical follow-up after abnormal pap smear among
      low-income, minority women.

      Methods:

      METHODS Participants (211) were randomized to the following baseline conditions: a) standard
      care (SC), i.e., a cognitive-affective barriers (CAB) assessment delivered via phone, receipt
      of a notification letter from physician regarding abnormal Pap test result and need to
      undergo colposcopy, and also including appointment date and clinic contact numbers, plus
      telephone confirmation and post-card appointment reminder; b) SC plus CAB counseling
      delivered by phone (CAB-C -T), i.e., culturally-relevant/sensitive barrier-specific messages
      drawn from a pre-developed library designed to counsel individuals regarding their specific
      barriers to adherence, e.g., by increasing risk-related knowledge, providing accurate outcome
      and self-efficacy expectancies, addressing health-related values and goals, moderating
      risk-related affect, or offering active plans and strategies to assist with self-regulation;
      c) SC plus CAB counseling delivered via Mail-Home Print Material (CAB-C-P), which included
      exactly the same applicable messages as were delivered by phone, but in print form. The
      tailoring of messages to a participant's cognitive-affective barriers profile was based on
      the two barriers in each of the five Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP)
      categories (a total of 10 messages) that she rated most important on a five-point scale.
      There were 23 cognitive-affective adherence barriers grouped into the following C-SHIP
      categories: 1) risk-related encodings/perceptions (i.e., purpose of colposcopy, presence and
      progression of HPV-related disease); 2) risk-related expectancies and beliefs (i.e.,
      confidence in ability to keep appointment, fatalistic beliefs about cancer); 3) risk-related
      values and goals (i.e., maintaining modesty, importance of having children); 4) risk-related
      affect (i.e., worries about necessary procedures and/or progression of disease, concerns
      regarding fertility); and 5) risk-related self-regulation (i.e., remembering appointment,
      overcoming child-care or work-related conflicts, transportation difficulties, ability to
      manage any negative risk-related affect). With regard to assessments, they were conducted at
      the following time points: baseline, and 1-week, 9-month, and 15-month post-colposcopy and
      included the following: the CAB assessment; background variables, including demographic
      (e.g., gender, age, ethnicity, education, marital and employment status, household income,
      number of children); medical and screening history (e.g., cancer diagnosis, previous Pap
      smears and frequency; breast exams (self and clinical); mammograms and abnormal results;
      results of the index colposcopy and physician recommendations from medical records; a
      potential moderating dispositional variable, attentional style (Monitoring-Blunting Style
      Scale); potential mediating variables, including affective variables (Spielberger State-Trait
      Anxiety Inventory, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and
      cognitive-affective process variables (knowledge, risk perceptions, expectancies and beliefs,
      affect, values and goals, regulatory skills); outcome variables, including adherence to
      initial diagnostic colposcopy and to 6- and 12-months colposcopically-based follow-up
      diagnostic and medical management recommendations, and an intervention evaluation. All
      assessments used scales developed in previous research, except the Powe Fatalism Inventory
      used to assess fatalism and the Revised Impact of Events Scale used to assess affect (i.e.,
      stress-related intrusive and avoidant thoughts). Assessed at baseline were background
      variables (except medical recommendations), the moderating variable, and all mediating
      variables. The cognitive-affective barriers were assessed only at baseline. Assessed at
      1-week post-colposcopy and at the 9-month and 15 month follow-ups were all mediating
      variables (except the cognitive-affect barriers) and outcome variables. The medical
      recommendations were assessed only at the 1-week post-colposcopy. Medical history was also
      re-assessed at the 15-month follow-up relating to the interim period from baseline.
