      Background:

      - Antidepressants help many people with depression, however, some do not seem to benefit as
      much. Currently, it is not possible to determine who will improve with certain
      antidepressants. Studies have shown that genes may influence whether an antidepressant works
      for an individual. Other studies have shown that depressed people tend to have lower levels
      of a chemical called glutamate in parts of their brain, and that glutamate levels increase
      after recovering from depression. Researchers want to study the antidepressant citalopram
      (Celexa) to see how it affects glutamate levels in the brain. They also want to study how a
      person s genes affect their response to this treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To see whether glutamate levels and certain genes affect how a person responds to a
      particular antidepressant medication.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 25 and 55 years of age who have been diagnosed with major depression
      (without psychotic features). Participants may not have tried more than three antidepressant
      treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will answer
           questions about mood and current feelings of depression, as well as family history of
           depression. Blood and urine samples will be collected.

        -  This study will have two phases. The first phase may last up to 7 weeks depending on
           current antidepressant use and involves one to seven outpatient visits. The second phase
           lasts 8 weeks and involves five outpatient visits, one every 2 weeks.

        -  In the first phase, participants will stop taking their current antidepressant
           medications for at least 2 weeks before the next phase of the study. Participants who
           are on fluoxetine (Prozac) will need to be off it for 6 weeks.

        -  At the end of this phase, participants will have brain imaging studies to look at brain
           function and chemistry.

        -  In the second phase, participants will take citalopram at the standard dose. They will
           answer questions about mood and response to the medication. They will also provide blood
           and saliva samples for tests.

        -  At the end of this phase, participants will have brain imaging studies to look at brain
           function and chemistry.

      Objective:

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious, debilitating, life-shortening illness that
      affects many persons of all ages and backgrounds. Although many patients suffering from MDD
      can expect improvement with antidepressant treatment, only a minority experience full
      remission, and little is known about the basis for individual differences in treatment
      outcome. The rationale for this study follows from the findings that treatment response in
      major depression is associated with: 1) variation in the genes encoding the serotonin 2A
      receptor (HTR2A) and the KA1 subunit of the glutamate-kainate receptor (GRIK4); and 2)
      increases in prefrontal glutamate/glutamine (glx) concentration measured by [+H] magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The central hypothesis is that genes associated with citalopram
      treatment outcome modulate glutamate concentrations in prefrontal brain (PFB) and thus
      facilitate response to citalopram treatment. Such information is important because it would
      ultimately allow the development of better treatments for MDD.

      Study population:

      A total of 104 moderate to severe MDD outpatients aged 25-55 with a baseline 17-item Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score of greater than or equal to18 who meet DSM-IV criteria
      for non-psychotic major depressive disorder (MDD) will be enrolled in the course of the
      study.

      Design:

      Subjects will be screened with an on-site research psychiatric evaluation using a structured
      interview (MINI plus). After screening, participants will provide a DNA sample, which will be
      analyzed to determine the patient s genotype at several relevant loci. All patients will then
      complete an eight-week period of citalopram treatment, during which time they will be
      evaluated bi-weekly with self-report questionnaires and clinician ratings to determine change
      of MDD symptoms. Participants will also undergo pre- and post-treatment MRS scans to
      determine glutamate concentration in the prefrontal brain.

      Treatment outcome measures:

      The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician-Rated (QIDS-C16) will be the
      primary clinical outcome measure and will be collected at baseline and at each treatment
      visit. Additionally, levels of glutamate in the prefrontal regions of the brain will be
      measured by MRS. Clinical response will be defined as a decrease of 50 percent or greater in
      QIDS-C16 score from baseline, and remission will be defined as a QIDS-C16 score of less than
      6.

      This proposal is part of a K99 training grant and has undergone extensive external review
      (K99MH085098-01A2).
