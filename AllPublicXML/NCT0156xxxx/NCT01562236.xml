      Background and objectives: Male sex is a risk factor for poor neurodevelopmental outcome
      following preterm birth. The investigators aimed to investigate gender-related differences in
      amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and to correlate these findings with
      neurodevelopmental outcome.

      Methods: Preterm infants born &lt;30 weeks' gestational age between 2000 and 2002 were
      prospectively included. aEEGs obtained within the first two weeks of life were evaluated and
      classified according to background activity, sleep-wake cycling (SWC) and seizure activity.
      Outcome was assessed at three years.
