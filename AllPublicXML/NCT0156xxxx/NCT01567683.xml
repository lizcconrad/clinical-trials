      This study is designed to assess the tolerability of test product and vehicle in terms of
      skin reactions during repeated topical applications on healthy skin under controlled
      conditions on the basis of the international guidelines for testing of skin irritations (FDA
      Guidance for Industry (1999)).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The written informed consent form (ICF) signed and dated by the subject prior to any
             study-related activity

          2. Generally healthy male or female subjects aged â‰¥ 18 years

          3. Healthy skin in the treatment areas (inner site of forearms) and test field for
             positive control on the upper arm

          4. Skin type I-III (Fitzpatrick)

          5. Willingness to actively participate in the study and to comply with the study
             procedures as defined in the study protocol

          6. High probability of a good compliance and orderly completion of the study

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use a highly effective method of
             contraception

          8. Negative urine pregnancy test (in female subjects with childbearing potential)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          2. Known or suspected skin diseases (e.g. acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis,
             etc.), which might interfere with the evaluation of the skin reaction at the treatment
             area or the SLS test field

          3. Clinical history suggestive of intolerance, allergies or idiosyncrasies to one of the
             IMPs or to the ingredients of the products (butyl lactate, isopropyl myristate,
             propylene glycol, butylated hydroxy anisole) and suspected cross allergies

          4. Known skin allergies

          5. Known infectious diseases (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) at the discretion of the investigator

          6. Insulin dependent diabetes

          7. Psychiatric conditions that might limit the participation in the trial and / or that
             lead to the assumption that the ability to completely understand the consequences of
             consent is missing

          8. Any suspicion of drug and / or alcohol abuse within the past 5 years

          9. Any illness or circumstance that could affect the trial purpose in the opinion of the

         10. Within 1 week prior to Day 1 and during the whole study any systemic use of
             antihistamines

         11. Within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the entire study no change in any medication
             with common medical influence on skin perfusion (e.g. beta-blockers)

         12. Within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the entire trial any use of systemic
             medication likely to interfere with the trial purposes (e.g. immune-modulating
             therapy, corticosteroids, cytotoxics or immunosuppressants)

         13. Within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the entire trial: any dermatological
             medication (drug or medical device) on treatment areas or SLS test field (exceptions:
             symptomatic treatment of discontinued areas with topical treatments as decided by the
             investigator)

         14. Use of cosmetic product (e.g. creams, moisturizers) in the treatment areas (i.e. inner
             forearms) or the SLS test field within 5 days prior to Day 1 and throughout the
             treatment phase (Day 1 to Day 22)

         15. Intensive UV-light exposure (e.g. solarium visits) within 4 weeks before Day 1 as well
             as during the study

             influence the visual scoring

         17. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days directly preceding the study,
             during the entire study, and earlier participation in this study
