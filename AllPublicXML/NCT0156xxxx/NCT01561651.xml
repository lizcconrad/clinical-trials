  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder that leads to one-sixth of all
      strokes. Prevention of strokes in AF is achieved through the use of blood thinners such as
      coumadin. Although these blood thinners are effective, they are limited by the risk of
      serious bleeding, by physician and patient reluctance to use, and by noncompliance and
      discontinuation. The left atrial appendage is a structure on the upper chamber of the heart
      that is the most common source of stroke in patients with AF. This structure is easily
      accessible during open heart surgery for removal, and has been an area of interest for stroke
      prevention. However, there is currently no strong evidence that removing it works.

      The LAAOS III trial will randomly (like the flip of a coin) assign patients with AF
      undergoing heart surgery for other reasons to have the left atrial appendage removed or not.
      These patients, other than this small procedure which has been shown to be quite safe, will
      be treated in the usual manner. The full study of 4700 patients, followed for an average of 4
      years, will determine if removing the left atrial appendage can reduce stroke and other
      complications on top of usual therapy. A positive study will change the way heart surgery is
      performed on AF patients and results in a large reduction in the number of strokes in a large
      population. Further, it will promote further research into this approach that could be
      applied beyond AF patients undergoing heart surgery.
