      This study will examine the efficacy of a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT)
      program for children with anxiety and autism spectrum disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children who have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience substantial anxiety that
      can cause impairment above that of an ASD alone. Few studies have examined effective
      treatment options for anxiety in this population.Preliminary studies have established the
      efficacy of computer-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy in otherwise typically developing
      youth with anxiety. Accordingly, this study seeks to examine the efficacy of computer
      assisted CBT in children with autism and ASD. A randomized-control trial will examine the
      ability of computer-assisted CBT to treat anxiety in comparison to a waitlist condition. This
      study will recruit approximately 40 youth ages 7-12 years. Significant reductions in anxiety
      severity and overall improvement of functioning will establish this treatment's ability to
      treat anxiety. This study aims to evaluate the acute efficacy of CCBT relative to WAITLIST in
      children with ASD and comorbid anxiety disorders;examine the short-term durability of
      treatment gains for youth receiving CCBT; examine whether, relative to WAITLIST, CCBT results
      in improved social; adaptive; and global functioning, as well as reduced child- and
      parent-rated anxiety symptoms; and examine whether, relative to WAITLIST, CCBT is associated
      with greater satisfaction and consumer acceptability.

The first 6 levels of this program are skill building levels to be completed by the user.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatient children with an autism spectrum disorder (see #2 below) between the ages
             7-12 years.

          2. Meets criteria for a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder using scores from the
             Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Childhood Autism Rating Scale-II High
             Functioning Version.

          3. Meets DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of one of the following anxiety disorders:
             separation anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia,
             panic disorder or specific phobia as determined by the ADIS-IV-C/P (with CSR 4) and
