  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol dependence is a major health problem worldwide and recently in Israel and it has
      major health care costs. Cannabis dependence is also a major health issue and many cannabis
      users find it difficult to quit. Similar to dependence on heavy drugs, alcohol and
      cannabis-dependent patients find it difficult to quit drinking and smoking cannabis and they
      relapse to drinking alcohol and using cannabis during treatment. Craving for alcohol and
      cannabis and withdrawal during detoxification are major factors for relapse to drinking and
      using cannabis. The cue-exposure and priming paradigms have been used in order to induce
      craving for alcohol and cannabis in the laboratory. Several studies have delineated the brain
      mechanisms responsible for cue-induced craving for alcohol using functional Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (fMRI), a method that can be useful in monitoring progress of treatment. A
      proven useful medication for treatment of alcohol dependence is the opiate antagonist
      naltrexone commonly used for treatment of opiate dependence. We have found that
      cannabis-dependent patients in treatment for cannabis dependence who also were heavy users of
      alcohol have dropped early from treatment.

      We propose to use naltexone to reduce craving for alcohol and cannabis in alcohol and
      cannabis-dependent patients. We also propose to use established techniques of priming and
      cue-exposure for alcoholic drinks and cannabis together with measures of [18F]
      Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging in 24 alcohol and
      cannabis-dependent patients before and after 35 day treatment with naltrexone. We predict
      that in those who will be successful in quitting alcohol drinking and using cannabis there
      would be a reduction in alcohol and cannabis cue-induced brain activity in the meso-limbic
      reward circuit that is responsible for craving for alcohol and cannabis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Alcohol dependent patients both males and females age 22-64

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  subjects who are diagnosed as suffering from psychotic illness according to DSM-IV
             (Axis 1) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) or with a history of CNS disease, a
             history of infection that might affect CNS (HIV, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, herpes), a
             history of head injury with loss of consciousness, history of other substance abuse
             taking psychoactive medications (shown by urine test). Abnormal liver test results
             (150% above average) will be excluded. Pregnancy is also an exclusion criterion, as
             radiation exposure is risky for the fetus.
