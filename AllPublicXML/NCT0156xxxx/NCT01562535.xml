    <textblock>
      Nursemaid elbow or pulled elbow is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department. It
      is the sudden pull of the radial head (a bone in the elbow) in toddlers. Usually occur when a
      parent tries to pull the child by the arm and a &quot;clic&quot; or &quot;clunk&quot; is felt with immediate pain
      and unwilling to move the arm. It is not a dangerous condition although it is distressing for
      kids and their parents/caretakers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usual therapy consists of one of two maneuvers: supination maneuver or pronation
      maneuver. They both are safe to perform but none of them have been statistically superior
      over the other. More studies are needed to confirm or discard the tendency of the studies to
      favor the pronation maneuver.

      The investigators intend to perform a randomized trial evaluating which of these techniques
      is better than the other in terms of returning the mobility of the affected arm and
      decreasing pain.

    <description>In this technique the arm is flexed 90 degrees and a gentle pronation is applied to the arm; then the arm is further flexed to 45 degrees until the clinician feels a &quot;click&quot; in the elbow meaning the re-accommodation of the radial head has been accomplished.</description>

    <description>The affected arm is in a 90 degrees flexion. The clinician will hold the arm by the elbow and then makes a gentle supination of the affected arm and flexion of the elbow until feeling the &quot;click&quot; and the child is able to move the arm without pain.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pulled elbow suspected in any child presenting one of the following:

               1. History of an adult or bigger person that had pulled the child's elbow
                  non-intentionally

               2. Presence of intense pain at the arrival at the emergency department and unwilling
                  to move the arm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any suspect of injury that could be intentional (child abuse)

          -  Any suspicion child of suffering a possible fracture (the mechanism of the injury was
             not from pulling the child's arm, the arm presents obvious deformity, ecchymoses,
             edema, etc.)

          -  The mechanism was from multiple trauma

          -  Any chronic disease affecting the adequate bone mineralization (vitamin D deficiency,
             osteogenesis, etc.)
