    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the classical procedure with intrahepatic
      Glisson's approach for laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy. The validity, feasibility and
      limitations were assessed objectively through our clinical prospective study. The
      investigators expect laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy with intrahepatic Glisson's approach
      is safe, effective and feasible.

      Background: China is the high incidence area of liver disease, some of which need to be
      treated by surgical liver resection. The development of minimal invasive techniques opened up
      a new situation for hepatectomy. Intrahepatic Glisson's approach and the classical procedure
      are the two major operation procedures used in laparoscopic hepatectomy. The intrahepatic
      Glisson's approach has the advantages of less intraoperative bleeding and shorter operation
      time in our experience and as previous studies. The investigators expect further comparison
      of the safety and efficacy through this prospective controlled study by using two kinds of
      operation procedures.

      Intervention: Classical procedure versus intrahepatic Glisson's approach: a prospective
      randomized study. Eighty patients with liver disease need undergo hepatectomy were selected
      and divided into intrahepatic Glisson's group and classical procedure group randomly, each
      group contains 40 cases. Total laparoscopic hepatectomy were performed, with the intrahepatic
      Glisson's approach or classical procedure respectively.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood
           transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function,long-term
           curative effect were collected and analysed.

        2. Statistical method: groups t-test univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression
           analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis were used.

    <description>Forty patients with liver disease were selected and divided into intrahepatic Glission's group as described in the detailed description.Total laparoscopic hepatectomy with intrahepatic Glisson's approach were performed. Operation began with division of liver ligaments, liver mobilization, followed by intrahepatic access to the Glissonian pedicle (containing arterial, portal, and bile duct branches ). A endoscopic stapler devices was used for Glissonian pedicle cutting and suture. Liver parenchyma was divided by harmonic scalpel combined with vascular stapler. The specimen was extracted through suprapubic incision.</description>

    <description>Forty patients with liver disease were selected and divided into classical laparoscopic hepatectomy group as described in the detailed description.Total laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy with classical procedure were performed.The initial step is to dissect hepatic portal and expose the liver artery, portal Vein branch and the bile duct. Then endoscopic stapler devices were used to cut the canal mentioned above. Final step is to divide the liver parenchyma along the following ischemic delineation.</description>
