      Study ING116529 is a multicenter, randomized, study with an initial 7 day placebo-
      controlled, functional monotherapy phase to quantify the antiviral activity attributable to
      dolutegravir (DTG) in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced adults who are experiencing virological
      failure on an Integrase inhibitor containing regimen (current RAL or ELV failures), with
      evidence of genotypic resistance to RAL or ELV at study entry. Thirty subjects will be
      randomized (1:1) to receive either DTG 50mg BID (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B) with the current
      failing regimen for 7 days (RAL or ELV should be discontinued prior to dosing with DTG). At
      Day 8, subjects from both arms will enter an open label phase and receive open label DTG 50mg
      BID with an optimized background regimen containing at least one fully active drug.

      Study ING116529 is a multicenter, randomized, study with an initial 7 day placebo-controlled,
      functional monotherapy phase to assess the antiviral activity and safety of a dolutegravir
      (DTG, GSK1349572) containing regimen in HIV-1 infected, ART-experienced adults with
      virological failure on an integrase inhibitor (INI) containing regimen.

      Subjects must have evidence of genotypic resistance to raltegravir [RAL] or elvitegravir
      [ELV] at Screening and documented current or historical genotypic or phenotypic resistance to
      at least two other antiretroviral therapy drug classes.

      The study is designed to provide an accurate measure of the intrinsic antiviral activity of
      DTG 50mg twice daily versus placebo both administered with the current failing regimen in a
      randomised double-blind phase to Day 8. This will be followed by an open label phase with all
      subjects receiving DTG 50mg twice daily with an optimized background regimen (containing at
      least one fully active drug) until subjects no longer derive clinical benefit or until DTG is
      locally available. Thirty subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either DTG 50mg BID
      (Arm A) or Placebo (Arm B) with the current failing regimen for 7 days (RAL or ELV should be
      discontinued prior to dosing at Day 1). At Day 8, subjects from both arms will enter an open
      label phase and receive open label DTG 50mg BID with an optimized background regimen
      containing at least one fully active drug The primary analysis will be conducted after the
      last subject enrolled has completed the randomised, double-blind phase at Day 8. Additional
      analyses may be performed prior to study closure when all ongoing subjects transition to
      locally available commercial DTG.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) at Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 8. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Day 8 minus the value at Baseline (Day 1). The analysis was performed using statistical modeling correcting for Baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, Baseline Dolutegravir (DTG) fold change (FC), the overall susceptibility score (OSS) of the failing regimen, and the interaction between DTG FC and treatment. Means and differences were calculated using the average Baseline DTG FC of the entire Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) Population. The last observation carried forward with discontinuation equals Baseline (LOCFDB) dataset was used for the analysis. For the LOCFDB dataset, missing values were carried forward from the previous, non-missing, available on-treatment assessment, except formissing values due to premature withdrawal or Day 8 missing values, which had the Baseline value imputed.</description>

    <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Baseline (Day 1), Day 8, Day 28, and Week 8, using the Food and Drug Administration's Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (VOI [due to missing data/discontinuation of investigational product prior to the visit window]) as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant antiretroviral (ART) prior to the VOI as follows: background ART substitutions not permitted per protocol; background ART substitutions permitted per protocol, however the decision to switch was not documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit after switching to optimized background regimen (i.e., Week 4) where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success/failure was to be determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on treatment within the VOI analysis window.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in other situations. Adverse events were graded for severity according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity scales as: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), or Grade 4 (potentially life threatening).</description>

    <time_frame>From the first dose of study medication until early withdrawal or through the Day 8 analysis data cut-off date (average of 96 study days)</time_frame>
    <description>For participants meeting one of the criteria for PDVF, plasma samples collected at the time point of virologic failure were tested to evaluate any potential genotypic and/or phenotypic evolution of resistance. The FC in IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) for DTG relative to wild-type virus was determined for virus isolated at Baseline and at the time of PDVF. The number of participants with the indicated change (ratio) in the two values at the time of PDVF is presented. PDVF was defined as (A) Virologic Non-response: a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of &lt;1 log10 copies/mL by Day 28, with subsequent confirmation, unless plasma HIV-1 RNA is &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;=400 copies/mL on or after Week 24 or (B) Virologic Rebound: confirmed rebound in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to &gt;=400 copies/mL after prior confirmed suppression to &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;1 log10 copies/mL above the nadir value, where nadir is &gt;=400 copies/mL.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) at Day 8</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 8. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Day 8 minus the value at Baseline (Day 1). The analysis was performed using statistical modeling correcting for Baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, Baseline Dolutegravir (DTG) fold change (FC), the overall susceptibility score (OSS) of the failing regimen, and the interaction between DTG FC and treatment. Means and differences were calculated using the average Baseline DTG FC of the entire Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT-E) Population. The last observation carried forward with discontinuation equals Baseline (LOCFDB) dataset was used for the analysis. For the LOCFDB dataset, missing values were carried forward from the previous, non-missing, available on-treatment assessment, except formissing values due to premature withdrawal or Day 8 missing values, which had the Baseline value imputed.</description>

This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (VOI [due to missing data/discontinuation of investigational product prior to the visit window]) as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant antiretroviral (ART) prior to the VOI as follows: background ART substitutions not permitted per protocol; background ART substitutions permitted per protocol, however the decision to switch was not documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit after switching to optimized background regimen (i.e., Week 4) where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success/failure was to be determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on treatment within the VOI analysis window.</description>

A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in other situations.

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Treatment-emergent Integrase (IN) Mutations Detected at the Time of Defined Virologic Failure (PDVF), as a Measure of Genotypic Resistance</title>
        <description>For participants meeting one of the criteria for PDVF, plasma samples collected at the time point of virologic failure were tested to evaluate any potential genotypic and/or phenotypic evolution of resistance.

        <description>For participants meeting one of the criteria for PDVF, plasma samples collected at the time point of virologic failure were tested to evaluate any potential genotypic and/or phenotypic evolution of resistance.
