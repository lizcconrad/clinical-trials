  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a focused questionnaire and laboratory tests can
      better define risk factors associated with possible genetic porphyria. The investigators
      hypothesize that the genetic carrier state of acute porphyria is distinctive enough that the
      Genetic Carrier Profile the investigators devise through this study will be useful in
      identifying carriers of genetic porphyria among the large population with undiagnosed
      abdominal pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The porphyrias are a group of genetic diseases caused by disturbances in the formation of
      heme, an essential component of hemoglobin and other proteins, leading to either acute
      (neurologic) and/or chronic (cutaneous) symptoms. Acute porphyria is often difficult to
      diagnose because symptoms may not be specific and, unless the patient is in an active attack,
      laboratory values typically may not be useful for diagnosing porphyria. The purpose of this
      study is to test whether a focused questionnaire and laboratory evaluation tool can better
      define risk factors associated with possible genetic porphyria. The goals of this study are:

        -  To determine the presence and number of abnormal lab tests and porphyria-like symptoms
           in adult family members of the first person in a family who has been diagnosed with a
           disease of acute porphyria, 50% of whom are expected to carry the same genetic defect of
           the index case.

        -  To devise a Genetic Carrie Profile that could be used to screen people in whom the
           diagnosis of porphyria is being considered.

        -  To test the Profile in patients with symptoms suggestive of HCP and/or urine tests
           showing some elevation of porphyrins.

        -  To explain other possible causes of minor increases in porphyrin levels in patients with
           recurrent abdominal pain who have not been diagnosed with porphyria

    <description>Subjects in Group 3 will participate in the &quot;Follow Up Sub-Study.&quot; This group will include individuals who have been seen by one of the Porphyria Consortium physicians/investigators for suspicion of porphyria 10 or more years prior to study initiation, but were not given a diagnosis of porphyria at the time of their initial visit.</description>

        Group 1:

        Individuals who are first-degree relatives of a patient with one of the acute porphyrias
        (AIP, HCP, VP). They will complete questionnaires and laboratory tests, including genetic
        testing for porphyria. The data will be used to develop a clinical profile for the risk
        factors associated with the genetic carrier state.

        Group 2:

        Subjects who possibly have acute porphyria, but do not have a confirmed diagnosis based on
        genetic testing. They will serve to test the validity of the clinical index derived from
        Group 1.

        Group 3:

        Patients who have been seen by one of the Porphyria Consortium physicians/investigators 10
        or more years ago, but were not given a diagnosis of porphyria. They will complete a
        questionnaire to determine whether they received a porphyria diagnosis, or another
        diagnosis that might explain the initial presentation.
