    <textblock>
      Subjects undergoing surgery on the small or large bowel will be randomized to one of 2
      groups, a normal fluid amount group and a reduced fluid amount group to evaluate the impact
      of this change on recovery after surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of reduction in the amount of
      perioperative fluids on postoperative morbidity, postoperative recovery and the duration of
      hospitalization. The study will accrue patients undergoing elective open intestinal resection
      for benign and malignant conditions of the small and large bowel. Patients, who consent to
      the study, will be randomized at the time of consent, preoperatively. The primary study
      endpoint will a composite of mortality and major morbidity within the first 30 postoperative
      days. Secondary endpoints will be return to bowel function (flatus or bowel movement),
      postoperative hospital stay including the day of surgery and a composite of minor
      complications. Approximately 186 patients will participate in the study, 93 in each group.
      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups: the Restricted Fluid Regimen group and
      the Normal Fluid Administration Regimen group. A very specific flow chart for each group will
      be followed to distinguish the group. A research nurse will collect the data needed for the
      study on a daily basis. The patient will be managed by the primary surgeon and his team and
      the study group flow chart will be followed. If for medical reasons, the patient's care needs
      to be varied from the study, this is allowed, and will be documented for the study purposes.
