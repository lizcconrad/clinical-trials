  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative urinary retention is a frequent complication of spinal surgeries and impacts a
      large portion of this population which results in increased morbidity as a result of
      increased number of catheterizations, urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prolonged hospital
      stays. With the addition of Tamsulosin, the investigators would anticipate a reduction in the
      incidence and duration of postoperative urinary retention and therefore a reduction in
      morbidity related to treatment of urinary retention as well as shortened hospital stays.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompressive laminectomy and spinal fusion procedures are among the most common
      neurosurgical procedures performed. Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a frequent
      complication of such surgeries and impacts a large proportion of this population resulting in
      multiple intermittent bladder catheterizations for bladder decompression, increased incidence
      of bacteremia, increased incidence of UTIs, and prolonged hospital stays. Use of a
      uroselective alpha-1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, such as tamsulosin, in the perioperative
      period (medication started five days prior to surgery and taken until hospital discharge)
      could reduce both the incidence and duration of postoperative urinary retention, resulting in
      shorter hospital stays and decreased healthcare costs.

    <description>Post operative urinary retention (POUR) will be defined as any of the following:
1) Estimated post-void residual (PVR) volume of urine greater than or equal to 300 mL; 2) Estimated retention urine volume of greater than or equal to 500 mL in patients unable to void; 3) Patients experiencing discomfort or distension and unable to void with lesser residual urine volume than 500 ml.</description>

    <measure>Duration of postoperative urinary retention</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of the hospital stay, an expected average of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The neurosurgical team will decide if an indwelling urinary catheter will be used. Time of indwelling catheter removal after surgery will serve as time zero for beginning calculation of postoperative urinary retention duration if the patient later requires in and out straight catheterization. For patients without an indwelling catheter, the time patients leave the operating room will serve as time zero. Urinary retention will be considered resolved after two consecutive post-void residual urine scans have demonstrated less than 300 ml residual urine volume in a patient spontaneously voiding.</description>
