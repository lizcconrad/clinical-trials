    <textblock>
      Rationale Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) complicates 5-7% of pregnancies. Major hazards
      include macrosomia, polyhydramnios, labor trauma and neonatal hypoglycemia. The ADA and ACOG
      recommend glucose control in order to reduce the incidence of hyperglycemia induced
      complications. Glucose control can be achieved using diet and life style changes. Insulin is
      initiated in women who fail to obtain glucose control with diet alone. During the past 11
      years oral hypoglycemic drugs have been tested and proven to be efficacious and safe.

      Objectives

        1. To compare the efficacy and safety of glybenclamide vs. metformin in the treatment of
           women diagnosed with GDM

        2. To evaluate the improvement in glycemic control after the addition of a second oral
           hypoglycemic drug after failure of the first

      Hypothesis GDM is one of the major conditions contributing to obstetrical complications and
      prenatal morbidity. Improving glycemic control, by means of improving compliance and patient
      satisfaction, will decrease obstetrical complications, maternal and neonatal morbidity and
      have positive long term health implications.

      Study design Prospective, randomized, open label

      Study population Women between the ages 18-45, diagnosed with GDM will be recruited. GDM will
      be defined by a pathological OGTT (according to Carpenter and Coustan criteria) performed at
      or after 13 weeks of gestation.

      Study period From recruitment until discharge of the newborn baby after delivery

      Study protocol Women will be randomized at recruitment. Demographic and obstetrical data will
      be collected. Average glucose levels during the previous two weeks, estimated fetal weight
      and amniotic fluid index, and lab exams reflecting glycemic control will be noted. Women will
      provide daily glucose levels via fax or mail once a week. Glycemic control will be evaluated
      by a daily chart, including 7 measurements: 3 preprandial, 3 postprandial and a 7th
      measurement at 10 pm. Women will be invited to a monthly follow-up, which will include a
      sonographic evaluation of fetal weight and amniotic fluid, and lab exams. Follow-up protocol
      after 38 w of gestation will be according to our ward's protocol. The study was approved by
      the local Helsinki committee.
