  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness of a systematic rehabilitative
      program for mastication in patients submitted to orthognathic surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery can produce complications during the postoperative period - i.e.
      situations of acute pain and inflammation - as a consequence of fractures and incisions in
      the mucosa. The inadequate management of soft tissue and prolonged surgical time could be the
      causes of acute facial oedema, hematoma and ecchymosis in the face and neck, as well as
      functional disorders involving swallowing and breathing, which can affect patients'
      integrity.

      Despite the fact that decreased muscular extensibility and strength, increased muscular
      fatigability, hipomobility, and alteration of the biomechanical efficiency and length of the
      masticatory muscles are documented clinical consequences, no systematic method of obviating
      such problems through muscular rehabilitation has yet been published

    <description>improvement is verified through a clinical orofacial myofunctional evaluation using a standardized protocol with scores (orofacial mobility, masticatory/deglutition clinical performance, jaw movements) and by variations in the activation of the masseter and temporal muscles (surface electromyography)</description>

    <description>Inclusion criteria were: Skeletal Class III orthognathic surgery patients; adults (age above 18 years), agreement to perform orthognathic surgery and to undergo all of the necessary procedures determined by the multidisciplinary team (i.e. orthodontic preparation, clinical orofacial myofunctional and electromyographic assessment, surgery, post surgery orthodontic treatment, post surgery clinical orofacial myofunctional and electromyographic assessment and orofacial myofunctional treatment when necessary). Exclusion criteria were: previous orthognathic surgery; previous head and neck surgery; neurologic and/or systemic diseases; facial trauma; syndromes; cognitive impairment; and communication and hearing deficits.</description>

    <description>Inclusion criteria for this group were: adults (age above 18 years); absence of stomatognathic system alterations; absence of alterations in the scapular region; complete permanent dentition (absence/extraction of the third molar was accepted); Skeletal and Angle's Class I facial pattern; and absence of malocclusion. Exclusion criteria were: previous orthodontic treatment; and history of previous oral motor intervention.</description>

    <description>Once a week for six weeks, the experimental group received a forty minutes session of orofacial myofunctional treatment. A home exercise program was prescribed during each session. The protocol implies in continuous and daily practices - participants were asked to perform exercises at least three times a day. After the first six weeks, the experimental group underwent four sessions for maintenance purposes (two sessions twice a month and two sessions once a month). The total treatment duration was of five months.</description>

    <description>The instruction group underwent two supervised forty minutes therapy sessions along the six weeks following surgery. These sessions involved the perception of the stomatognathic system, especially in terms of adequate performance during mastication. Specific exercises were not given and patients were instructed to try to reproduce the adequate pattern of mastication at all meals (i.e. alternated bilateral, with lip closure; with coordination activity of the tongue and mandible).</description>
