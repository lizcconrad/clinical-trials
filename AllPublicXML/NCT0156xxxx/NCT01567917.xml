  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has harmful effects on morbidity and mortality of cancer
      patients. In Western VTE guidelines, all solid cancer patients receiving abdominal major
      surgery are strongly recommended to receive pharmacologic prophylactic anticoagulation such
      as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the perioperative periods. These recommendations
      are based on the high incidence of postoperative VTE development in Western cancer patients.
      However, there have been many cumulative data about the effect of different ethnicity on the
      VTE development and more and more investigators and clinicians admit that Asian ethnicity has
      lower incidence of VTE than Western ethnicity. Therefore, it may not be advisable to apply
      Western guidelines as it is to the clinical situation of Asian cancer patients.

      Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the common cancers and the incidence is rapidly
      increasing in Asia, there have been few prospective data on the incidence of VTE development
      during the postoperative period in Asian CRC patients. To our knowledge, there have been a
      few small-sized prospective studies in Asia and thus clear conclusions could have not been
      drawn based on those studies. Most Korean colorectal surgeons think that the incidence of
      postoperative VTE development is very rare based on their own clinical experiences. They also
      have much concern about the complications such as bleeding that might be caused by routine
      use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis during the perioperative periods. Therefore, in most
      clinical situation, many Korean colorectal surgeons do not perform perioperative
      pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis using LMHW. Considering these clinical situations in Asia
      including Korea, the uncritical acceptance of Western guidelines may be inappropriate. The
      necessity of pharmacologic thrombo-prophylaxis can be answered only from our own prospective
      study on the incidence of postoperative VTE development after CRC surgery. Moreover, current
      surgical trend in cancer patients is minimally invasive approach such as laparoscopic
      surgery. However, the necessity of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving
      laparoscopic cancer surgery has not been evaluated even in Western countries. Western
      guidelines also cannot exactly answer whether pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis is really
      necessary in cancer patients receiving laparoscopic cancer surgery. On above backgrounds,
      this study was designed.
