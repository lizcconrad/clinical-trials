  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - About one-tenth of adults with sickle cell disease have pulmonary hypertension (high blood
      pressure in the lungs). This condition can cause shortness of breath, pain crisis, and
      congestive heart failure. It may even lead to death. Researchers want to test the drugs
      imatinib and carvedilol to see if they can treat high blood pressure in the lungs. Both drugs
      have been used to treat other types of heart problems, but they have not been tested as a
      treatment for high blood pressure related to sickle cell disease.

      Objectives:

      - To see if imatinib and carvedilol are safe and effective treatments for high blood pressure
      in the lungs in adults with sickle cell disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years of age who have sickle cell disease and have or may have high
      blood pressure in the lungs.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have different tests of heart and lung function, including a walking test and imaging
           studies. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.

        -  Participants who meet specific criteria will take one of two possible study drugs. Those
           who receive imatinib will take it daily. Those who receive carvedilol will take it twice
           a day.

        -  Participants will have weekly study visits for blood tests and other exams. The study
           drug dose will be adjusted at each weekly visit. It will be increased slowly to reach a
           target dose(based on the participant s weight) or to find a stable effective dose.

        -  Participants may continue to take their study drug for up to 24 weeks, with weekly study
           visits. Regular blood samples and heart and lung function tests will be performed.

        -  After 24 weeks, qualified participants may continue to take their study drug for up to 6
           more months. They will have regular study visits to monitor the treatment.

      Sickle Cell Disease related pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous condition that results
      in a high mortality and for which no therapy has been documented to be beneficial. We propose
      to perform a safety and tolerability study of treatments based on right heart catheterization
      derived hemodynamic profiles associated with higher mortality in our cohort. These same
      hemodynamic profiles have previously been described and confirmed in other large cohorts as
      well. We propose treatment of sickle cell subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension
      (PAH), defined hemodynamically by pulmonary arterial mean pressures (mPAP) of 25 mmHg or
      greater, with low estimated left ventricular filling pressures (low pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressures, or PCWP), and high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), with imatinib, a tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor that modifies the Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) pathway. PDGF is
      involved in Sickle Cell related PAH and there is now evidence that imatinib is effective in
      the treatment of idiopathic PAH. The hemodynamic profile of elevated mPAP with elevated left
      ventricular filling pressures is also associated with higher mortality rates, and we propose
      to treat this subgroup with carvedilol, a unique beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has
      been demonstrated to attenuate the adrenergic response and improve right and left heart
      function. The third subgroup with elevated mPAP is the hyperdynamic group, which by
      definition has low PVR and the absence of elevated left ventricular filling pressures. This
      group is also at higher risk but over a longer period of time and for less evident reasons.
      We will continue with aggressive sickle cell management in the hyperdynamic group according
      to the expertise offered by the Sickle Cell Group at the Clinical Center while systematically
      following them and intervening with optimal care. Those who do not quality for any of the
      three subgroups described above will go into a fourth subgroup and be followed for mortality
      and data sharing. Our primary endpoint is the safety and tolerability of these interventions
      and our secondary endpoints will be the clinical efficacy of these treatments.

             contraceptive rings and contraceptive patches, barrier contraceptives such as condoms,
             an intra uterine device (IUD) or abstinence). This is because the effects of imatinib
             mesylate on the developing human fetus are not fully known.
