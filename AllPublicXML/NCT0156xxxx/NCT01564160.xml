  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A marine lipid oil extract isolated from the New Zealand Greenshell® Mussel, Perna
      canaliculus (P. canaliculus), contains a unique synergistic blend of marine fatty acids.

      The objective of the this study is to evaluate the acute (5-hour) and chronic (21-day)
      bioavailability of a fixed dose of PCSO-524 compared to a fish oil product in a population of
      healthy adult participants.

             or would not be in the best interest of the subject. This would include any
             significant illness or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty
             complying with the protocol
