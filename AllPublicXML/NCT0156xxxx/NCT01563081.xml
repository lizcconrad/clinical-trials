      To evaluate the safety of treatment with levocetirizine oral solution in pediatric patients
      aged form 6 months to 2 years old with allergic rhinitis or pruritus associated with the skin
      diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-labelled study to confirm the safety as main objective, and
      consisting of minimum 1-week screening period and 2-week treatment period. The subjects who
      meet the inclusion criteria are to be placed on one of the following two regimens according
      to their ages at the start of treatment period: once daily administration of levocetirizine
      at a dose of 1.25 mg (in the morning) to infants aged between 6 months and 1 year old
      (younger age group), and twice daily administration of levocetirizine at a dose of 1.25 mg
      (in the morning, in the evening before sleep) to infants aged between 1 year and 2 years old
      (older age group).

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Week 2/Early Withdrawal (EW)</time_frame>
    <description>A non-serious AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant/clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse, or misuse. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a possible drug-induced liver injury. For a list of all SAEs/non-serious AEs occurring at a frequency of &gt;=5%, please see the SAE/non-serious AE module of this record.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Change From the First Day of Treatment in Allergic Rhinitis and Pruritis Associated With Skin Diseases at Weeks 1 and 2/EW, as Assessed by the Investigator/Sub-investigator Based on Legal Representative Impression</measure>
    <time_frame>First day of treatment; Weeks 1 and 2/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub-investigator made an overall assessment of nasal symptoms (allergic rhinitis [AR]) and pruritus associated with skin diseases (PAWSD) at Weeks 1 and 2 (or at the discontinuation day in the case of early withdrawal [EW] from the clinical trial) by asking the participants' legal representatives to provide feedback using the following scale: 1, significantly improved; 2, moderately improved; 3, mildly improved; 4, no change; 5, mildly worse; 6, moderately worse; 7, significantly worse. Only those participants with AR and PAWSD at Baseline were assessed for improvement in the conditions at Weeks 1 and 2. The &quot;n&quot;s in the category titles reflect the number of participants in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) who had AR and PAWSD at Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>First day of treatment; Weeks 1 and 2/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator or sub-investigator comprehensively assessed the participants' improvement in nasal symptoms (allergic rhinitis [AR]) and pruritus associated with skin diseases (PAWSD) at Weeks 1 and 2 (or at the discontinuation day in the case of early withdrawal [EW] from the clinical trial) compared to the first day of treatment by using the following scale: 1, markedly improved; 2, moderately improved; 3, slightly improved; 4, no change; 5, worsened.</description>

    <description>The investigator comprehensively assessed the pariticipant's severity of pruritus on the first day of treatment (FDOT), at Week 1, and at Week 2 (or at the discontinuation day in the case of early withdrawal [EW] from the clinical trial) by using the following scale: 4, severe; 3, moderate; 2, mild; 1, slight; 0, none.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cmax and Cmin of Levocetirizine in Plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 2/Early Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is defined as the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration. Cmin is defined as the lowest (trough) concentration that a drug reaches before the next dose is administered. For both age cohorts, blood samples were collected 1.5-2.5 hours after the last drug administration for assessment of Cmax at either Week 1 or 2/EW. For participants in the &gt;=6 months and &lt;12 months cohort, blood samples were collected 22.5-25.5 hours after the last drug administration for Cmin at a different visit from Cmax sampling. For participants in the &gt;=12 months and &lt;24 months cohort, blood samples were collected 10.5-13.5 hours after the final drug administration for Cmin at a different visit from Cmax sampling. For all participants, if Cmin sampling occurred at Week 1, then Cmax sampling occurred at Week 2/EW, and vice versa.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>A non-serious AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant/clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse, or misuse. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a possible drug-induced liver injury. For a list of all SAEs/non-serious AEs occurring at a frequency of &gt;=5%, please see the SAE/non-serious AE module of this record.</description>

        <description>The investigator or sub-investigator made an overall assessment of nasal symptoms (allergic rhinitis [AR]) and pruritus associated with skin diseases (PAWSD) at Weeks 1 and 2 (or at the discontinuation day in the case of early withdrawal [EW] from the clinical trial) by asking the participants' legal representatives to provide feedback using the following scale: 1, significantly improved; 2, moderately improved; 3, mildly improved; 4, no change; 5, mildly worse; 6, moderately worse; 7, significantly worse. Only those participants with AR and PAWSD at Baseline were assessed for improvement in the conditions at Weeks 1 and 2.

For both age cohorts, blood samples were collected 1.5-2.5 hours after the last drug administration for assessment of Cmax at either Week 1 or 2/EW. For participants in the &gt;=6 months and &lt;12 months cohort, blood samples were collected 22.5-25.5 hours after the last drug administration for Cmin at a different visit from Cmax sampling. For participants in the &gt;=12 months and &lt;24 months cohort, blood samples were collected 10.5-13.5 hours after the final drug administration for Cmin at a different visit from Cmax sampling. For all participants, if Cmin sampling occurred at Week 1, then Cmax sampling occurred at Week 2/EW, and vice versa.</description>
