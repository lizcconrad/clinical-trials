  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronically venous ulcer in lower extremities is a permanent and disabling disease. Venous
      insufficience is the main cause of chronic ulcer. There is a high prevalence and frequency of
      the disease, primarily among elderly people. Recently, electromagnetic field therapy has been
      tested on various diseases in musculoskeletal system with a beneficial effect. In recent
      years, there has been an increasing interest in using electromagnetic field therapy to treat
      chronically venous ulcer.

      The hypothesis of the investigators is that the electronic magnetic field therapy improves
      the healing process and reduces pain for patients suffering from chronically venous ulcer.
      The investigators assume that the bioactivity is affected by a cellular response which
      affects the DNA synthesis, transcription og protein synthesis.
