  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The giant cell tumor (GTC) is an aggressive benign bone tumor, growing at the
      metaphyseal-epiphyseal regions of long bones, especially around the knee and the distal
      radius.It is responsible for bony destruction in para-articular zone fracture and leading to
      the breakdown and destruction of the underlying joint.

      Histologically, the tumor cell contains a contingent of monocytic cells round, a contingent
      of giant type cell of type osteoclastic responsible for bone resorption that accompanies
      these tumors and a contingent of lengthened cells fibroblast-like considered to be contingent
      tumor.

      The treatment is exclusively surgical; or by resection of the lesion which takes away tumour
      and its environment, solution which, if it prevents local recurrence, imposes an important
      bony and articular reconstruction, always limited and deteriorating rapidly over time in
      these young patients; or by curettage of lesion, by &quot;hollowing-out&quot; of the bone, creating a
      hole which it will be necessary to fill up by a bony grafting or a substitute of the bone
      (cement). This last solution, if it preserves a better function, exposes at risk of local
      recurrence,putting into play the prognosis of articulation near, most often the knee.Despite
      different local adjuvants treatments used during surgical operation, after having curetted
      the cavity and before filling it up, the recidivism rates vary from 12 % to 41 % (average 25
      %) in literature.

      The beneficial effect of the adjuvants therapeutics suggests the concept broadly accepted by
      a tumoral microscopic residual at the origin of the local recidivism .Biphosphonates (BP) is
      molecules which settle in vivo on the hydroxyapatite of the bone; they inhibit the
      recruitment of the osteoclast forerunners and the activity of mature osteoclast. Besides,
      biphosphonates containing some nitrogen (N-BP), leads to the apoptose of mature osteoclast.
      These molecules also have a direct effect on tumor cells , causing apoptosis of neoplastic
      cells of myeloma, of breast cancer. Clinical controlled studies confirm the experimental data
      of N-BP. Two work also showed their effect on osteoclasts and stroma cells of tumours with
      giant cells but no clinical study assessed potential on the prevention of the local
      recurrence.

      The investigators offer a study phase 2 of the effectiveness of N-BP (acid zoledronique) on
      the prevention of the local recurrence of tumours with primary huge cells after surgical
      treatment by curettage - filing by a surgeon referent in oncologic orthopedic surgery.

      Outcome Measures:

      - Main: occurrence of recurrence detectable by Reasonable Magnetic Imaging (IRM) and / or
      standardized radiography.

      Local recurrence will be discussed in the presence or appearance on the radiographic and IRM
      monitoring of an osteolysis in the periphery of the cavity curetted, does not exist on the
      radio in post-operative with IRM signal abnormalities in the same location,taking the
      gadolinium. If in doubt, a new surgical biopsy will confirm or not the diagnosis of local
      recurrence

      secondary:

        -  clinical: patient interview, clinical examination

        -  biological Complete blood count, creatinine, serum calcium, phosphate, magnesium

    <description>Treatment with zoledronic acid will be initiated during hospitalization, the day after the removal of redundant. Intravenous injection of 4 mg. of zoledronate diluted in sodium chloride 9 / 1000 or a solution of 5% dextrose in intravenous over 15 minutes. In the absence of intolerance clinic, an infusion of zoledronic acid in the same doses and modalities will be performed in a hospital (on the occasion of a follow-up visit after surgery) at the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th weeks after the first, or 5 injections. )</description>
