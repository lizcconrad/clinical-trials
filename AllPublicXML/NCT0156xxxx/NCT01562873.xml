  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ruxolitinib is a drug which blocks the Janus tyrosine Kinase (JAK) signaling pathway. It is
      thought that this pathway might be important in certain types of breast cancer, and that
      blocking this pathway might lead to anti-cancer effects. This study is testing the effects of
      ruxolitinib in patients with breast cancer.

      Objectives:

      Primary

        -  The primary objective of this two-stage, phase II study is to estimate the objective
           response rate to ruxolitinib in patients with metastatic or unresectable locally
           advanced breast cancer which is pStat3+ and which has progressed on at least one line of
           chemotherapy for advanced disease, and/or has recurred within 12 months of completion of
           neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To describe the toxicity profile

        -  To evaluate clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD &gt;/= 24 weeks)

        -  To estimate progression-free and overall survival

      Exploratory

        -  To explore whether baseline hs-CRP level higher than the group median is associated with
           objective response

        -  To explore whether baseline IL-6 level higher than the group median is associated with
           objective response

        -  To describe hs-CRP level over time, and to describe the proportion of patients with a)
           hs-CRP &gt; 3mg/L at baseline, on treatment, and at time of progression, and b) hs-CRP &gt;
           1mg/L at baseline, on treatment, and at time of progression

        -  To describe IL-6 level over time, and to describe the proportion of patients with IL-6
           level above the upper limit of normal at baseline, on treatment, and at time of
           progression

        -  To describe pStat3 status by IHC in baseline metastatic biopsies

        -  To describe pStat3 status by IHC in on-study biopsies

        -  To describe pStat3 status by IHC in the time of progression biopsy samples

        -  To characterize archival and metastatic biopsy samples using triple immunofluorescence
           for CD44, CD24, and pStat3

        -  To characterize archival and metastatic biopsy samples using a previously characterized
           pStat3 gene signature

        -  To characterize circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for CD44, CD24, and pStat3 at baseline
           and time of progression

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 12 cycles. Treatment duration was a median of 2 cycles range (1-5).</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 12 cycles. Treatment duration was a median of 2 cycles range (1-5).</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 24 weeks or longer based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria. SD needed to be a minimum 24 weeks in duration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>In long-term follow-up, patients were followed for survival every 4 months for up to 2 years. Median follow-up in this study cohort was 4.5 months (range 0.6-21.9).</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive and estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically every 8 weeks on treatment through 12 cycles and in long-term follow-up every 4 months for up to 2 years. Median follow-up in this study cohort was 4.5 months (range 0.6-21.9).</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or equivocal progression of non-target lesions.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate</title>
        <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 12 cycles. Treatment duration was a median of 2 cycles range (1-5).</time_frame>

        <description>Clinical benefit rate (CBR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 24 weeks or longer based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions (smallest sum LD reference), new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria. SD needed to be a minimum 24 weeks in duration.</description>
