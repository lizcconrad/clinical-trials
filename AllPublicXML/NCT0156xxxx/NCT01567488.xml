  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying hypothesis of the synergistic activity of octreotide and everolimus is based
      on the combination of a) a direct action of everolimus over mTOR (mammalian target of
      rapamycin), and b) the inhibitory effect of octreotide on the IGF-I (insulin like growth
      factor 1) system preventing the activation of the mTOR system by this factor. Both types of
      inhibition would completely cancel this signal transduction pathway, which is so important in
      neuroendocrine tumours.

      Furthermore, the biological study proposed in this protocol will allow for better
      establishing the relationship between the activation of the IGFR-PI3K-mTOR signal
      transduction pathway (i.e., the mTOR pathway stimulated by IGFR) and treatment response; this
      information is relevant since the IGFR-PI3K-mTOR activation status could be a response
      prediction factor.

      This study will provide significant additional information about the efficacy of the
      combination treatment of everolimus with octreotide LAR® in non-functioning GI NET.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus has been developed following two administration regimens: weekly and daily. Phase
      I pharmacodynamic studies recommend doses of 50 mg weekly and 10 mg/daily, based on its
      toxicity and inhibitory effect of the mTOR pathway in tumours; although the inhibition of
      this pathway has been demonstrated, the knowledge of response prediction factors has not been
      developed, in part due to the very low responses found in the population in phase I studies.
      These factors can be better outlined in a phase II study, where patients who have received
      fewer previous treatments can respond better, and where the profile of responders and
      non-responders can be identified more easily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of non-operable or metastatic non-functioning, well differentiated advanced
             GI NET, confirmed by cytology or histology. In case of liver metastasis,
             neuroendocrine tumours of unknown origin are accepted.

          -  Confirmation of diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma of low to intermediate histology
             grade

          -  Radiologically documented disease progression within 12 months prior to inclusion in
             the study. If the patient received anticancer treatment within the past 12 months,
             disease progression must be documented by radiology during or after taking this
             medication

          -  Adequate bone marrow. liver and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:
