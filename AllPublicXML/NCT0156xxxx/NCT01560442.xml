  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the relation between pupillary diameter measured under scotopic
      conditions, and the pain thresholds measured at the time of peak and residual effect of
      methadone/buprenorphine in opiate-dependent patients following a substitution program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients substituted since at least 3 months shall be included during a regular control
      visit.

      Each session shall consist in

        -  check for toxics in urine sample;

        -  measurement of pupil diameter;

        -  measurement of mechanical punctuate pain threshold;

        -  measurement of mechanical bone pain threshold.

      A first session shall be done at time of residual effect of the opiate. A second session
      shall be done at time of peak effect of the opiate.
