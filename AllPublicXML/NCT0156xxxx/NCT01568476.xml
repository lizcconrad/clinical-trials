  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following foot and ankle surgery, ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block (SNB) at the
      popliteal fossa decreases post-operative pain and opioid consumption. At the popliteal fossa,
      the sciatic nerve bifurcates to form the Common Peroneal Nerve (CPN) and Tibial Nerve (TN).
      Studies have shown that when both branches are blocked separately distal to the bifurcation
      site, block onset time is reduced by 30%. Through clinical observation, the investigators
      found that onset time is further shortened when ultrasound-guided SNB is performed at the
      site of bifurcation. This is because the local anesthetic spreads interneurally. The purpose
      of this study is to compare the block onset time of an ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block
      at the site of nerve bifurcation with the blockade of each terminal nerve separately (TN and
      CPN) distal to sciatic nerve bifurcation.

    <description>We aim to compare the block onset time of an ultrasound-guided sciatic nerve block at the site of nerve bifurcation resulting in interneural spread of local anesthetic with that of blockade of each terminal nerve separately (TN and CPN), distal to sciatic nerve bifurcation. We hypothesize that sciatic nerve blockade at the site of bifurcation with interneural local anesthetic spread within a common epineural sheath results in shorter onset time compared to blockade of each terminal nerve distal to sciatic nerve bifurcation.</description>
