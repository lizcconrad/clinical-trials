      This study aims to collect data and assess the number of rotavirus related hospitalizations
      in 11 hospitals in Belgium - season 2006-2007 in order to develop proper age-cohort analysis
      over time.

      This retrospective study will use anonymised data, extracted from hospital databases during
      the period of the 1st of June 2006 until the 31st of May 2007. IMS Health sales data will be
      used to provide rotavirus vaccine coverage estimates (Rotarix and Rotateq) for the Belgian
      population during the study period. Any additional source of vaccine coverage status
      describing rotavirus vaccine uptake in the study population will also be reported.
