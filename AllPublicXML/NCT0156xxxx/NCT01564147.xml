    <textblock>
      Taking into account the recommendations of the Health Authority [1] and the application of
      patients' associations, we have structured a course of therapeutic education includes three
      stages for patients with rheumatoid arthritis and followed at Nantes University Hospital.
      Step 1: initial interview with a nurse patient education for diagnosis and education with the
      patient to choose three subjects from among 10 offered him problematic; Step 2: Orientation
      in an educational path that provides access to 6 months group workshops (3 maximum) and / or
      interviews tailored to the three selected topics; Step 3: final interview with a nurse said
      therapeutic education formative assessment to take stock. The main objective of our work is
      to ensure that the patient finds it easier solutions to the three problematic topics him
      after 6 months of education after six months without treatment.
