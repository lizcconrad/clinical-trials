  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system
      attacks and destroys the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. This condition is very
      prevalent, affecting up to 1:400/500 persons worldwide. Type 1 diabetes, previously known as
      juvenile diabetes, usually strikes in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, but lasts
      for a lifetime. To date, there have been no treatments that can arrest or reverse the ongoing
      beta cell destruction. The patients affected by this disease require multiple daily insulin
      injections to manage their blood sugars and usually have trouble regulating their blood
      sugars. Moreover, they are at risk for heart disease, kidney failure, eye problems, and other
      complications from this life-long condition.

      The investigators plan to utilize gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in children with newly
      diagnosed T1DM. This neurotransmitter is made in the brain from the amino acid glutamate with
      the aid of vitamin B6. There have been some recent studies in diabetic mice utilizing GABA to
      reverse inflammation on the pancreas and improve hyperglycemia. GABA studied in healthy human
      subjects demonstrated that large oral doses of GABA increased insulin secretion from the
      pancreas.

      The investigators propose that GABA given to children with new onset T1DM will be able to
      increase insulin production, suppress glucagon release, and decrease the inflammation
      surrounding the pancreas. The investigators hope this will at least prolong the beta cell
      life after diagnosis, if not lead to a cure for type 1 diabetes.
