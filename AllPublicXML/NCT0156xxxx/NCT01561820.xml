  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot trial of a 5 month aerobic exercise intervention in participants with
      MCI (n=20) to begin to compare the effects of randomization to use an exercise buddy or to
      exercise without an assigned buddy. The investigators hypothesize that participants with MCI
      who exercise with a buddy will have higher adherence to the protocol and greater improvement
      in 400 meter walk time.

      The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine feasibility and gather data that
      will inform the design of a larger, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Specifically,
      the investigators aim to:

      2.1 Determine the feasibility of recruiting persons with MCI and a buddy for an exercise
      intervention.

      - For MCI participants who do not identify a buddy, the investigators will determine the
      interest and feasibility of recruiting volunteers from the community to be an exercise buddy.

      2.2 Determine the effects of having an exercise buddy on:

        -  adherence to the protocol

        -  400 meter walk time, an objective measure of improved physical fitness

        -  retention and satisfaction for both participant with MCI and buddy

      2.3 Establish a scientific partnership with a community based exercise facility.

    <description>This is a pilot study with the principle outcome measures related to recruitment and retention of participants with MCI and buddies and adherence to the protocol. We are specifically interested in:
Time to recruit 20 participants
% of participants who identify their own buddy
Number of community volunteers to be buddies over the recruitment period
Retention at 3- and 5- months

    <description>Participant will be assigned a buddy that will meet with them at the gym for each of their exercise sessions. This person will serve as a source of support and motivation for them and will also help them remember and stick to the goals set for you. This person will also help them maintain their exercise logs and ensure they are correct. The buddy will not be exercising with them, but will just be there with them while you exercise.</description>

    <description>Participants will not be assigned a buddy (and are not allowed to bring someone with them as a buddy).

    <description>The 5-month aerobic exercise intervention is in accordance with the American Heart Association and American College of Sports Medicine physical activity recommendation for optimizing cardiovascular fitness in older adults.Exercise will consist primarily of walking on the treadmill.The goal of the program will be for participants to exercise at a moderate- to high-intensity, defined as 65-80% (ACSM guidelines) of heart rate reserve (HRR), for 30 minutes, 4 days per week.The duration of exercise will progress from 15-20 mins at 50% HRR the 1st week to 30 mins at 65-80% HRR by the end of the 6th week and thereafter.At the start of each session, exercise intensity will be gradually increased to 50% HRR(0.5[HRmax-HRrest]+HRrest)during a 10minute warmup period,and then to the individualized target heart rate training zone for the next 25-30 minutes.Participants will wear a digital heart rate monitoring device for the duration of the training session.</description>
