  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solifenacin succinate as a tablet formulation is already on the market for the treatment of
      symptoms of overactive bladder in adults. For the use in children and adolescent patients a
      new formulation of solifenacin has been developed.

      This study investigated the effect and safety of solifenacin succinate liquid suspension
      compared to a non-active drug (placebo) over a 12-week period. The 2 weeks prior to the
      double blind period was a single-blind placebo run-in period in combination with behavioral
      urotherapy (Non-interventional diary assisted urotherapy consisting of overactive bladder
      (OAB) information, awareness, instruction, life-style advice and documentation of voiding
      habits and symptoms for OAB), followed by a 12 week daily treatment period. The study also
      investigated how well solifenacin succinate suspension is taken-up by the body and how long
      it stays in the body during this time.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment (EoT) in Mean Volume Voided (MVV) Per Micturition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mean voided volume was calculated from the participant diary data recorded during two measuring days (i.e., those days when the participant recorded the volume of each micturition) in the 7 days prior to the baseline and end of treatment visits. The MVV is equal to the mean of the non-zero volumes recorded over the 2 measuring days. A micturition is any voluntary urination, excluding episodes of incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Daytime Maximum Volume Voided (DMaxVV) Per Micturition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The mean daytime maximum volume voided (DMaxVV) was determined using the participant diary data recorded during two measuring days (i.e., those days when the participant recorded the volume of each micturition) in the 7 days prior to the Baseline and end of treatment visits.

The initial dose started with the equivalent of 5 mg in adults, referred to as pediatric equivalent dose (PED) of 5 mg (PED5), based on body weight for three weeks and was titrated up or down in up to three titration steps of three weeks each to reach the optimal dose. Titration up or down could lead to weight-based doses equivalent to doses in adults of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg or 10 mg once daily and were referred to as PED2.5, PED5, PED7.5 and PED10. The minimum dose was PED2.5, and the maximum dose was PED10. The decision to titrate up or down was made by the investigator using information from the 7 day patient diary.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study population consisted of male and female children (5 to 11 years old) and adolescents (12 to 17 years old) with overactive bladder (OAB).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects received 4 weeks of urotherapy (standard first line therapy for pediatric OAB patients). Two weeks after start of urotherapy a single-blind 2-week placebo run-in period began. After run-in period eligible subjects were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment (solifenacin succinate suspension or placebo) and continued urotherapy.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Values for this baseline characteristic are based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The FAS consisted of all randomized patients that took at least 1 dose of double-blind study medication after randomization and provided a valid baseline and post baseline value for the primary efficacy endpoint. A micturition is any voluntary urination, excluding episodes of incontinence only. Micturitions voided volumes were recorded in a patient diary for any 2 days in the 7 day period prior to the baseline visit (referred to as &quot;measuring days&quot;). The number of participants was 70; 73; 19; 21 per arm.</description>

The mean DMaxVV was determined using the patient diary data recorded during two measuring days (i.e., days when the patient recorded the volume of each micturition) in the 7 days prior to the baseline visit. The DMaxVV is the largest (non-zero) volume recorded over both of the 2 measuring days in the diary (first morning void excluded). Daytime defined as time between waking up in the morning and going to bed later the same day. A micturition is any voluntary urination, excluding episodes of incontinence only.

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment (EoT) in Mean Volume Voided (MVV) Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The mean voided volume was calculated from the participant diary data recorded during two measuring days (i.e., those days when the participant recorded the volume of each micturition) in the 7 days prior to the baseline and end of treatment visits. The MVV is equal to the mean of the non-zero volumes recorded over the 2 measuring days. A micturition is any voluntary urination, excluding episodes of incontinence.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Daytime Maximum Volume Voided (DMaxVV) Per Micturition</title>
        <description>The mean daytime maximum volume voided (DMaxVV) was determined using the participant diary data recorded during two measuring days (i.e., those days when the participant recorded the volume of each micturition) in the 7 days prior to the Baseline and end of treatment visits. The daytime maximum volume voided (DMaxVV) is the largest (non-zero) volume recorded over both of the 2 measuring days in the diary. The first morning void is excluded from the calculation. Daytime is defined as the time between waking up in the morning and going to bed later the same day. A micturition is any voluntary urination, excluding episodes of incontinence.</description>

        <description>The mean number of incontinence episodes was determined using the patient diary data recorded by the participant in the 7 days prior to baseline visit and end of treatment visit. An incontinence episode is defined as an episode with any involuntary loss of urine. Daytime is defined as the time between waking up in the morning and going to bed later the same day.</description>
