      This is a Phase II study in a single center to determine the efficacy of autologous dendritic
      cells (DCs) loaded with autogeneic glioma stem-like cells (A2B5+) administered as a
      vaccination in adults with glioblastoma multiforme (primary or secondary).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in diagnosis and treatment (surgery +radiation +chemotherapy), median
      survival for patients with newly diagnosed brain glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is about one
      year, for recurrent GBM is about 4 months. Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a novel
      treatment strategy for glioma with improving patient survival. Usually, processed tumor
      antigens from the patient's own tumor or a peptide vaccine is capable of producing an
      anti-glioma response. Our previous experiment revealed that the CD133+ tumor stem-like cells
      associated antigens could elicit highly intensive immune response against human malignant
      glioma , and in phase I study, we have confirmed that DC vaccine loaded with glioma stem-like
      cells associated antigens against malignant glioma in recurrent patients was of safety .

      Autologous DCs will be obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each
      patient. Stem-like cells associated antigens (SAA) will be prepared with glioma stem-like
      cells that are harvested from patients with GBM and primary cultured and sorted
      flowcytometrically and then irradiated. Approximately 4 weeks will be required for vaccine
      production and the first vaccine administration. Each patient will receive an injection of
      DCs at his/her assigned dose once every week during the first 6 week. The dose of DCs is
      defined as 8~10×10^6.

      Clinical trials that utilize DCs for immunotherapy have demonstrated significant survival
      benefit for patients who exhibit robust immune responses against tumor cells. Unfortunately,
      at the present time the majority of clinical trials were in phase I that illustrated the
      safety. The efficacy of DCs against glioblastoma is still lack of sufficient randomized phase
      II study. According to our previous phase I study, here we designed this clinical trial in a
      triple-blind randomized manner to validate the efficacy of DCs vaccination.

      Recently , in order to re-estimate sample size and examine the efficacy of the DC vaccine .
      the interim analysis was performed by an independent data monitoring committee , this
      analysis contained: 11 cases in the placebo group and 11 cases in the control group.
      According to interim results : 86% of patients had achieved its primary endpoint events with
      minimal adverse events. However , our preliminary data is too unreliable to conclude anything
      further about the effency of DC vaccine: some variability need to be included in the analysis
      and balanced between two groups , such as the immune response, residual tumor volume, the
      molecular subtype of GBM . Accordingly , we made some modifications to the original plan, and
      are currently recruiting new participants.
