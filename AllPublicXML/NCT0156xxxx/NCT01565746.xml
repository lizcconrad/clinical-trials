        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male ≥ 20 years of age

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Presents with at least 2 bone metastases, confirmed by scintigraphic imaging within

          -  Progressive castration resistant metastatic disease

          -  Castrate level of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL), treatment to maintain castrate levels of
             testosterone must be continued

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received an investigational drug in the 4 weeks before or is scheduled to
             receiving one during or in the 8 weeks after study drug administration.

          -  Has received chemo-, immuno-, or radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks prior to entry
             in the study, or has not recovered from acute adverse events as a result of such
             therapy

          -  Has received prior hemibody external radiotherapy

          -  Has a need for immediate external radiotherapy

          -  Has received systemic radiotherapy with radium-223, strontium-89, samarium-153,
             rhenium-186 or rhenium-188 for the treatment of bony metastases within the last 24
             weeks prior to administration of study drug

          -  When receiving bisphosphonates, has changed the dose within 4 weeks before
             administration of study drug
