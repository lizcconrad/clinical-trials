        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that their parent(s)/legally acceptable
             representative(s) can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Korean male or female subjects who are eligible for the primary and/or booster doses
             of Infanrix-IPV according to the Korean Prescribing Information.

          -  Written or signed informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/ legally acceptable
             representative(s) of the child. Where parent(s)/ legally acceptable representatives
             are illiterate, the consent form will be countersigned by an impartial witness. Prior
             to enrollment of the subject into the post-marketing surveillance, the subject's
             parents/legally acceptable representatives will be requested to provide information
             regarding the enrollment of their child in a same/similar study previously. And prior
             to obtaining informed consent form, the investigator will check whether the subject is
             eligible for vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  At the time of post-marketing surveillance (PMS) entry, the contraindications and
             precautions of use indicated in the local Prescribing Information should be checked
             and the subject must not be included in the PMS if there is any contraindication. Any
             changes in the locally approved Prescribing Information must be implemented
             immediately.

          -  Subjects who receive any investigational or non-licensed DTPa-IPV vaccine within 30
             days prior to study start will not be enrolled.

          -  Child in care.
