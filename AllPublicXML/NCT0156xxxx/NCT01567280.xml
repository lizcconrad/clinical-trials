  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design consists of a cross-sectional survey on the clinical characteristics of
      patients with asthma and their level of asthma control and current quality of life, and on a
      prospective evaluation of the rate of switch from the uncontrolled/poorly controlled
      condition to the status of controlled asthma. Asthma control will be based on the Asthma
      Control Questionnaire scoring system, that has been fully validated for use in both clinical
      practice and clinical trials and has strong discriminative properties which means that it can
      detect small differences between patients with different levels of asthma control and it is
      very sensitive to within-patient change in asthma control over time.

      Quality of life as a reflection of the control of the disease, will also be evaluated by
      means of the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scoring system.
