  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary Study hypothesis is that the ProLung Test will demonstrate safety and efficacy in
      the risk stratification of patients with pulmonary lesions identified by CT that are
      suspicious for lung cancer. A statistically significant result will indicate that patients
      with a high ProLung Test result have a greater risk of developing lung cancer than patients
      with a low test result.

      There are three Specific Aims of this study:

        1. Optimize and confirm the stability of the ProLung Test risk-stratification algorithm in
           patients with a diagnosis.

        2. Externally validate the efficacy of the ProLung Test risk-stratification algorithm by
           comparing the test result to the conclusive patient diagnosis.

        3. Assess the safety and tolerability of the ProLung Test procedures.

      Study Design This Study consists of two distinct phases, Stabilization and Validation. The
      Study will collect data from multiple sites (3 to 12), and each site may enroll patients and
      collect data for the Stabilization and Validation Phases with a minimum of three sites for
      the Validation Phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet all of the following criteria may be enrolled in this Study:

          1. Subject is male or female, age 18 or older.

          2. Subject has undergone CT scan of the lung(s) that indicates one or more nodules or
             lesions suspicious for lung cancer.

          3. Subject's pulmonary nodule or lesion is greater than 4mm. Size is determined by the
             largest nodule or lesion dimension identified from CT imaging.

          4. Subject meets one or more of the following conditions:

               -  indicated for a tissue biopsy

               -  indicated for surgical resection of the lung

          5. Subject must be able to receive a ProLung Test

               -  within 60 days of abnormal CT (Inclusion Criterion 2 &amp; 3)

               -  within 60 days prior to the tissue biopsy or surgical resection (Inclusion
                  Criterion 4).

          6. Subject is capable of understanding and agreeing to fulfill the requirements of this
             Protocol.

          7. Subject has signed the IRB/IEC approved Informed Consent Form (&quot;ICF&quot;).

        Exclusion Criteria

        The following criteria will disqualify a subject from enrollment into this Study:

          1. Subject has an implanted electronic device in the chest.

          2. Subject receiving therapy for suspected chest infection such as fungal infection or
             tuberculosis.

          3. Subject with diagnosed malignancy other than lung cancer, non-melanoma skin cancer or
             any cancer in which the Principal Investigator does not suspect metastatic disease to
             the lung, who has 2 or more suspicious pulmonary nodules.

          4. Subject has received an invasive medical or surgical procedure within the thoracic
             cavity within 30 days prior to the ProLung Test or within the previous 14 days for a
             bronchoscopic procedure.

          5. Subject presents with an anomalous physical or anatomical condition that precludes
             ProLung Test measurement.

          6. Subject will have undergone unusually strenuous exercise within 24 hours.

          7. Subject who has significant systemic diseases such as uncontrolled diabetes, advanced
             heart failure, or a recent myocardial infarction, or other medical condition such as
             severe morbid obesity that in the judgment of the Principal Investigator would make
             him/her unsuitable for the Study.
