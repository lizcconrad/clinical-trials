  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased white blood cell count at the onset of an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction
      has been shown to be associated of increased incidence of heart failure and mortality. Now
      monocytes which are a subset of white blood cells may have a prognostic value for patients
      presenting with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. A monocyte count of greater
      than 800/mm3 following acute myocardial infarction has been shown to be associated with
      increased incidence of left ventricular dysfunction. The investigators study would
      retrospectively collect data on patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, looking for
      an association between high monocyte count and the culprit vessel causing the myocardial
      infarction. The investigators would also investigate whether monocytosis would be a marker of
      poor prognosis.
