    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will recruit patients diagnosed with glioblastoma at the time of
      recurrence or progression following prior treatment with surgery, radiation therapy and
      alkylating chemotherapy. Patients will be screened and if found eligible will be randomized
      to one of two treatment arms (1:1 randomization). Patients randomized to the Axitinib
      treatment-arm will be treated with Axitinib until progression (they can be treated after
      progression in the Axitinib plus lomustine arm), unacceptable treatment related toxicity, or
      patients refusal to continue study treatment. Patients randomized to the Axitinib plus
      Lomustine-arm will receive treatment until progression, unacceptable treatment related
      toxicity, or patients refusal to continue study treatment.
