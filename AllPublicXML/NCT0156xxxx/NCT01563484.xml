  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma (PHC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the
      world. In men is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide but the second most
      frequent cause of cancer death. In women, it is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer
      and the sixth leading cause of cancer death. An estimated 748,300 new liver cancer cases and
      695,900 cancer deaths occurred worldwide in 2008. Half of these cases and deaths were
      estimated to occur in China. Surgical resection and liver transplantation can be curative
      treatment options, but less than 20% of PHC patients are candidates for surgery. The
      prognosis of patients with unresectable PHC is poor; if left untreated, the median survival
      is less than 6 months. Since transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was introduced as a
      palliative treatment in patients with unresectable HCC, it has become one of the most common
      forms of interventional therapy. However, the possibility of treatment-related complication
      may offset the survival benefit, especially by the worsening of liver functions.TACE
      increases several parameters of hepatic cytolysis and decreases the metabolic activity of the
      liver. Such a deterioration of liver function due to ischemia following TACE may result in
      liver failure, or even death. TACE also may have an adverse effect on the kidney.
      Radiographic contrast medium is used to obtain the hepatogram before TACE. It has been shown
      that the use of contrast medium increases the risk of renal failure, especially the
      low-osmolar contrast media. The aim of this trials was to compare the change of liver and
      renal function after TACE for HCC of iso-osmolar contrast media with that of low-osmolar
      contrast media.

      This was a prospective, randomized, single centre, single-blind study. Patients were
      randomized (1:1) to use Low-osmolar contrast media or iso-osmolar contrast media for TACE.

      On the morning of 2th and 5th days after TACE, a hematologic check was performed, the
      hematologic check including serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, indirect
      bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase,
      lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase. Then, comparing them with the
      data before TACE.

        This test chooses the patients with unresectable PHC. Then divide them into two groups.In
        one group,patients underwent a transarterial infusion of ioversol injection(a kind of
        low-osmolar contrast media).In the other group,patients underwent a transarterial infusion
        of iodixanol injection(a kind of iso-osmolar contrast media).
