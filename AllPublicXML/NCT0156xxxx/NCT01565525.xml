  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to test anticipatory guidance, which is information
      given to families during a well child visit to prevent obesity during childhood. The
      objectives were to compare two styles of anticipatory guidance during the first year of life,
      maternal focused and infant focused, versus usual care and determine which style, if any,
      showed the most ideal infant feeding behaviors at age 1 year and to see if there were any
      differences in infant weight for height at one year of age. The investigators hypothesized
      that mothers who received the maternal focused anticipatory guidance (which gave information
      on eating family meals, not having tv on during meals, and maternal nutrition) would actually
      have the best infant feeding behaviors and weight for height of infants at one year.
