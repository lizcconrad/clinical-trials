    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to assess the tolerability and safety of 4 injections of two
      different doses of AFFITOPE® PD01A formulated with an adjuvant to patients with early
      Parkinson's disease in male and female patients aged 45 to 65 years (or age between 40 and 45
      years if there is no evidence for genetic forms of the disease and the diagnosis of
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease was confirmed, after approval by Sponsor). One study site in
      Vienna (Austria) will be involved. Each patient's participation will last 1 year.

      In addition, up to 8 patients will be offered participation within an untreated control
      group.
