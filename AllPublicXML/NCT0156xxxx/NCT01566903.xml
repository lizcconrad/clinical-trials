  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MR angiography (MRA) has become essential in the treatment of neurovascular diseases,
      including ischemic stroke - the first cause of disability in occidental countries, vascular
      malformations such as aneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas and malformations, whose treatments
      are improving year after year.

      MRA is an alternative to digital substracted angiography (DSA), circumventing th use of
      endovascular catheterism, irradiation and injection of iodinated contrast agent.
      Contrast-Enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) with gadolinium injection is currently the reference standard
      for vascular MR exploration but still presents many limitations inherent to the injection of
      contrast medium. Hence, the synchronization of the acquisition with bolus contrast injection
      limits the improvement of spatial and temporal resolutions and requires an accurate
      synchronization of the acquisition with the arrival of the bolus.

      Moreover, the acquisition can be repeated as required as it does not require any contrast
      injection.

      Besides, the increase in nephrogenic systematic fibrosis clinical cases, which would be
      secondary to gadolinium chelates injection, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency has
      restricted the use of CE-MRA. More than 500 cases were described to date in the world.

      Its occurrence is currently estimated around 4 % for patients in terminal chronic renal
      insufficiency and its mortality around 30 %.

      According to the recommendations of AFSSAPS from August, 2007, two gadolinium contrast agent
      (Gadodiamide-OMNISCAN *, General Electric HealthCare and Gadopentetate Dimeglumine-MAGNEVIST
      *, Bayer HealthCare) are contraindicated if the glomerular filtration rate is lower than 30
      ml/mn.

      Non-contrast enhanced MR angiography (NCE MRA) techniques have been proposed to provide
      complete and non-invasive investigation of the vasculature, thus offering patients with
      chronic renal insufficiency, as well as pregnant or nursing women a surrogate with no side
      effects.

      Moreover, the use of high field (3T) MR imaging offers improved signal to noise ratio.
      Combined with the use of phased array coils and parallel imaging, new NCE MRA sequences can
      achieve juxta-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution and temporal resolution of about 50 ms
      close to those of cerebral DSA.

      These sequences allow a joint hemodynamical and morphological assessment of lesions, both at
      the cervical and cerebral levels, whether at diagnosis or during patient follow-up

      The main objective is to evaluate the quality of the NCE images obtained in the exploration
      of neurovascular diseases, at the cervical and cerebral levels.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  to compare the NCE MRA sequences with the CE MRA sequences used in the clinical routine.

        -  to evaluate the anatomic and hemodynamic changes observable with sequences in the
           follow-up of patients, particularly those treated with partial embolization or
           radiosurgery.

      By circumventing the limitation to short bolus duration synchronization, the new dynamic
      sequences have the potential to achieve higher temporal resolution without compromising
      spatial resolution. Arteries and arteriovenous shunts may be more precisely identified and,
      due to a better visibility of small vessels allow a more accurate dynamic analysis.

      Finally, the sequence being derived from arterial spin labeling, and differing from time of
      flight or phase contrast sequences, should allow for an exploration less dependent on the
      vascular geometry with better anatomical analysis. For example, the tendency to overestimate
      arterial stenoses could be reduced.

      The robustness of sequences allow the non-invasive monitoring of patients including it
      possible to monitor the hemodynamic changes after radiosurgery or embolization.
