  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to analyze the advantages of the prophylactic use of hemoclips before
      polypectomy in our usual clinical practice, through a prospective randomized study that
      determines their effectiveness compared to conventional polypectomy, assessing the decrease
      in immediate and delayed post-polypectomy bleeding
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The methods for preventing post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB) are not standardised and there are
      groups that use hemoclips for this purpose.

      The aim of our study is to analyze whether the use of hemoclips reduces PPB complications. It
      is a prospective, randomised study of patients with pedunculated polyps larger than 10mm. The
      patients were included in two groups (hemoclip before polypectomy -HC- and standard
      polypectomy -SP-)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with one or more pedunculated polyps, the heads of which measured more than
             1cm (regardless of the stalk thickness and length), and they were compared against the

      <pre_assignment_details>Where more than one polyp was observed in a patient, all the polyps were included in the same randomization group, so that they all underwent the same technique (conventional or modified polypectomy). 3 patients were excluded for failing to meet the inclusion criteria since they involved semi-pedunculated polyps measuring less than 1cm.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>The Number of Polyps With Complications After Polypectomy (The Total Complication Rate)</title>
          <description>In order to test the ability of prophylactic hemoclipping to prevent post-polypectomy bleeding, the investigators were required to register all the adverse events that occurred. These adverse events were called &quot;complications&quot;, despite their severity and clinical significance</description>
          <population>Based on an anticipated decrease of at least 12% in the rate of adverse bleeding events between the group A and the group B, there was an alpha error of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80% with a patient inclusion rate of 1:1. The number of polyps required is 146 per group. Using the Fleiss correction, the final number is 164 per group.</population>
