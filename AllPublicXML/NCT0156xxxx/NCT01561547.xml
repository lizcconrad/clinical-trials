    <textblock>
      Mothers can provide pain relief to their newborns, even in the context of intensive neonatal
      care. There is a recent accumulation of data, being analyzed by ourselves in a Cochrane
      review, that mothers holding their infants in a bare-chested skin-to-skin position, known as
      Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), is effective in diminishing pain response during a single painful
      procedure. While evidence is compelling, leading to recommendations for its use, to date
      there is not a single study on the repeated efficacy to reduce pain. Current guidelines
      recommend sweet taste for minor painful procedures. Although there is some controversy about
      its continued use in this population based on one study with negative neurodevelopmental
      outcomes as well as its potential interaction with dopaminergic development, oral sucrose
      (sweet taste) remains efficacious in decreasing pain response over several weeks. The
      combination of KMC and sucrose is marginally more potent, but again, long term use remains
      unstudied.

      AIMS. To test the repeated efficacy in diminishing pain from heel lance of KMC compared to
      usual care (sucrose), and of KMC in combination with sucrose by examining each condition at
      least three times during NICU stay. A secondary aim is to compare these interventions on
      neurodevelopment at discharge from the NICU.

    <description>The PIPP is a composite measure of procedural pain and is based on changes from baseline in maximum heart rate and minimum oxygen saturation, and the duration of three facial actions. Data are analyzed in 30 second blocks from the moment the painful procedure begins. Time to return to baseline will also be noted. Scoring is done by assessors blind to the purpose of the study and group assignment.</description>

    <description>Two scales of the NAPI will be scored by person blinded to the intervention. These are 1) Motor Development and Vigour and 2) Alertness and Orientation</description>
