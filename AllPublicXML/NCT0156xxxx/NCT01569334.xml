  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is the best option for patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac
      allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of death following cardiac transplantation
      and is not managed by current therapies. Its pathogenesis traduces in an accelerated form of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) with similarities to atherosclerosis but also particular
      features of endothelial dysfunction associated to the alloimmune conflict and humoral
      responses toward the graft. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is the validated invasive method
      for late CAV diagnosis, but occurs lesions are established. Identification of reliable
      non-invasive early endothelial injury biomarkers that reflect mechanisms of cardiac damage
      thus remain a major challenge to optimize therapeutic management of post transplant
      morbidity. Endothelial dysfunction is a central feature of both CAV and CAD and results from
      a desquilibrium in the balance of endothelial lesion and repair that is partly controlled by
      recipient immune system. Through their expression of receptors sensing antibodies (FcR CD16)
      and endothelial stress-induced signals (CX3CR1 fractalkine receptor and NKG2D MICA
      receptors), Natural Killer (NK) cells represent effector cells with unique potential to
      generate both humoral and innate immune injury of graft endothelium.
