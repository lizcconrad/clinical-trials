  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several developing lines of evidence suggesting that brain receptors called GABA-B
      receptors play a significant role in addiction and its treatment. The investigators wish to
      examine the sensitivity of brain GABA-B receptors in alcohol and opiate addicts as part of
      the investigators MRC programme of research in neurotransmitters in alcohol and opiate
      addiction (NOAA). In this present study the investigators will give 2 different single doses
      of a drug called baclofen, and a placebo, to 8 healthy male volunteers. This drug affects
      GABA-B receptors in the central nervous system and is licensed for the treatment of
      spasticity in people with eg spinal injuries; the investigators are interested in its effects
      on brain GABA-B receptors. The investigators will measure EEG (brainwaves), eye movements,
      blood pressure and heart rate, motor co-ordination and subjective effects and also blood
      levels of the drug in the investigators volunteers before and at intervals after dosing. The
      investigators will use a double-blind randomised design to minimise expectation effects. The
      study will provide information on timing and magnitude of effects of baclofen on brain
      function in healthy subjects so that the investigators can optimise selection and timing of
      functional measures in future studies of addicts.

      After informed consent and screening participants will attend for 3 study days. On each of
      these there will be a set of baseline measurements including EEG, saccadic eye movements,
      vital signs, motor co-ordination task, subjective visual analogue ratings and questionnaires
      and blood sample. After dosing these measurements will be repeated at intervals during the
      day up to 6 hours after dosing. Participants will be allowed home after a health check.
