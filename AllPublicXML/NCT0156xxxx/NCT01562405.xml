  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is possible that the combination of lenalidomide, dexamethasone and ACE 011 may reduce or
      prevent the growth of cancer cells along with improving anemia and bone lesions that
      sometimes occur in people with multiple myeloma.

      This current study is the first study combining ACE 011 with lenalidomide. In this research
      study, the investigators are looking for the highest dose of ACE 011 that can be given with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The investigators will also begin to collect information
      about the effect of the combination of ACE 011, lenalidomide and dexamethasone on multiple
      myeloma.

      After the screening procedures confirm that you are eligible to participate in the research
      study:

      Assignment to dose level of study treatment Since we are looking for the highest dose of the
      ACE 011 combined with lenalidomide that can be administered safely without severe or
      unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple myeloma, not everyone who
      participates in this research study will receive the same dose of these drugs. The dose you
      get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study before you
      and how well they have tolerated their doses.

      Study treatment Study treatment will be given in 28 day cycles.

        -  ACE-011 will be given as an injection under the skin, Day 1 of each cycle (every 28
           days). You will receive each injection at the clinic.

        -  Lenalidomide will be taken by mouth: once daily days 1 21, followed by a 7 day rest
           period during which no lenalidomide will be taken.

        -  Dexamethasone will be taken by mouth once per week (days 1, 8, 15 and 22) of each cycle.

      You will be given drug diaries to record the doses of lenalidomide and dexamethasone taken.
      The study staff will tell you how to complete the diaries

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow &gt; 10% and/or presence of a biopsy-proven
             plasmacytoma

          -  Monoclonal protein present in the serum and/or urine

          -  Patient must have received at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy for the treatment
             of multiple myeloma. A line of treatment is sequential treatment without interruption
             for response and subsequent progression

          -  For participants treated with local radiotherapy with or without concomitant exposure
             to steroids, for pain control or management of cord/nerve root compression, two weeks
             must have lapsed since last date of radiotherapy, which is recommended to be a limited
             field. Participants who require concurrent radiotherapy should have entry to the
             protocol deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and two weeks have passed since
             the last date of therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status of zero to two unless decline is due to bony disease

          -  Not pregnant or breastfeeding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 2 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants may not have received treatment with another investigational drug or
             device within 28 days prior to Day 1, or if the half life of the previous product is
             known, within 5 times the half life prior to dosing, whichever may be longer

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ACE 011, Lenalidomide or Dexamethasone

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  History of major surgery within 30 days prior to trial initiation
