    <textblock>
      Objective of this study are:

      1) To determine if medication help extreme preterm infants to tolerate feeding better by
      reaching full feeding earlier.2) Out of two medication; which one is better for efficacy 1)
      Erythromycin 2) Metoclopramide. Infants who meet inclusion criteria would be entered to study
      after parental consent. Infant would be blinded to care givers. Infants will be randomized to
      receive one of three medication for 7-14 days. If infants fail on one medication they will be
      allowed to crossover to other medication. Infant would be allowed to treat like other
      infants. Blindness can be broken if deem necessary by attending neonatologist.

      Inclusion Critera:

        1. Weight below 1250 grams

        2. Age less than 14 days

        3. Feeding intolerance; If feeding residual more than 30% on q3 hr feeding; 5 times out of
           8 times, feeding residual more than 20% on q4 hr feeding 4 feeding out of 6 feeding or
           failure to advance feeding of more than 20ml/kg in 72 hrs.

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. GI malformation or perforation

        2. Genetic disorder

        3. Parents can't read English. After consent, if infants meet inclusion criteria, he would
           be allowed to receive one of the following three medication. 1) Erythromycin at
           1mg/kg/dose q8 hr 2) Metoclopramide 0.1mg/kg/dose q8 hrs and Placebo. If infant fails to
           get better, he would be crossover to one of the remaining two.
