  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TRC105 in patients with
      recurrent or progressive glioblastoma after prior antiangiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF
      therapy)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Angiogenesis plays a central role in the progression of solid cancer. TRC105 is an antibody
      to CD105, an important non-VEGF angiogenic target on proliferating endothelial cells. TRC105
      inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models. TRC105 has been
      well tolerated in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) as a single agent. The combination of
      TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab has demonstrated activity in bevacizumab refractory
      cancer patients. We hypothesize that TRC105 when administered with bevacizumab will have
      activity in GBM patients who progress on bevacizumab. By targeting a non-VEGF pathway, TRC105
      has the potential to complement VEGF inhibition by bevacizumab, which could represent a major
      advance in GBM therapy.
