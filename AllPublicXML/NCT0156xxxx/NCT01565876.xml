  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combat soldiers are required to perform under strenuous physical conditions; hence, their
      physical fitness is a crucial factor in their survivability.

      The Auxiliary Device- &quot;Minkal&quot;, is suggested (by its manufactures) to be able to reduce the
      soldiers' physiological strain by lowering the absolute load being carried by the soldier. As
      a result, it may improve the soldier's physiological abilities and performance through
      enduring missions with heavy loads, and may lead to better protection on the soldier from
      overuse injuries.

    <measure>Physiological Load with and without the auxiliary device</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days for each patient.</time_frame>
    <description>The physiological load will be measured using a heat tolerance test(HTT). Each paricipant will undergo a HTT 5 times (in different days). first day- without load. second day- with back load of 40% of the body weight. third day- with back load of 40% of the body weight and the Auxilairy Device. fourth day- with back load of 60% of the body weight. fifth day- with back load of 60% of the body weight and the Auxilairy Device. The rectal temperature, skin teperature and heart rate will be mesured in each HTT and compered afterwards to assess the physiological load.</description>
