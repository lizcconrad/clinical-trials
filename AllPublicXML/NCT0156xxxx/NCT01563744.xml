  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate bowel preparation is of critical importance for colonoscopy. Particularly among
      hospitalized patients, inadequate bowel preparation for colonoscopy may arise due to patient
      intolerance to prescribed laxative regimen, elderly population, and co-existing conditions
      that impair the ability to ingest a large-volume laxative regimen. Improvements in bowel
      preparation for colonoscopy in hospitalized patients would likely improve patient care and
      reduce hospital costs. The purpose of this study is to determine if administering a portion
      of the bowel purgative via EGD could improve colonoscopy preparation in hospitalized
      patients.

      In this randomized controlled trial in hospitalized patients, patients in whom colonoscopy
      was anticipated the day following EGD were consented and randomized to either standard prep
      by mouth (split-dose PEG) or intervention group (instillation of the first 2 liters of
      Nulytely solution through the channel of the endoscope into the duodenal bulb, then continue
      standard prep). Data is collected on quality of prep and patient satisfaction in both groups.
