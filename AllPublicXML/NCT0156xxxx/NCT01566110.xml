  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently no consensus exists on the optimal way to manage asymptomatic patients with celiac
      disease (CD) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The impact of dietary treatment as it pertains to
      clinically relevant outcomes such as metabolic control, bone mineralization and wellbeing
      will be evaluated in this study. A randomized controlled study longitudinally evaluating
      HbA1c and glycemic excursions using continuous glucose monitoring will rigorously determine
      the impact of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on blood glucose variability in patients with T1D.

    <description>As a standard measure of diabetes control, HbA1c is assessed on a frequent and regular basis as recommended by the CDA 2008 guidelines in both pediatric and adult patients. HbA1c is synthesized throughout the cycle of a red blood cell and reflects the degree of chronic hyperglycemia present in patients with diabetes.</description>

    <measure>Hypoglycemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Frequency over 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes will be recorded at each clinic visit. These will be classified as severe hypoglycemic episodes in subjects with normal hypoglycemic awareness.</description>

    <measure>Continuous Glucose Monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and 12 months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be evaluated for data quality, overall mean glucose, overall variability of blood glucose, patterns of blood glucose excursion, and measures of quality of glycemic control.</description>

          2. Diagnosis of T1D by American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria with duration of T1D
             greater than 1 year.

          3. CD screen positive (Positive TTG serology).

          4. Presence of a positive duodenal biopsy for CD (Marsh score of 2 or greater).

          5. Ability of the subject or a legally authorized representative to speak and read
             English or French.

          6. Ability of the subject to participate in all aspects of this clinical trial.

          7. Written informed consent must be obtained and documented, with assent of the child if
             &lt;14 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior diagnosis of CD.

          2. Symptoms or other evidence of overt CD defined by at least one of:

          3. Presence of recurrent apthous ulcers (painful mouth ulcers involving mucous membranes)
             or dermatitis herpetiformis (blistering skin rash). Mouth or skin lesions known to be
             related to diagnosed herpes are not included in this exclusion criteria.

          4. Conditions which in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          5. Prior enrolment in the current study.

          6. Concurrent enrolment in a longitudinal intervention study.

          7. Previously diagnosed or treated osteoporosis.
