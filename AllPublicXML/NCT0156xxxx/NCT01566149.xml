    <description>A serious AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at

    <time_frame>Up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline was defined as the highest FEV1 value of three assessments prior to first dose of study drug. If two (or all three) spirometry efforts had identical FEV1, the FEV1 from the effort with the highest Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) was to be recorded. Week 12 FEV1 was assessed as the morning FEV1 at the end of the dosing interval (trough FEV1). For participants who discontinued prior to Week 12, the FEV1 measurement from the discontinuation visit was to be be carried forward to Week 12 if (and only if) the participant's study medication compliance rate prior to discontinuation was at least 85%.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Baseline was defined as the highest FEV1 value of three assessments prior to first dose of study drug. If two (or all three) spirometry efforts had identical FEV1, the FEV1 from the effort with the highest Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) was to be recorded. Week 12 FEV1 was assessed as the morning FEV1 at the end of the dosing interval (trough FEV1). For participants who discontinued prior to Week 12, the FEV1 measurement from the discontinuation visit was to be be carried forward to Week 12 if (and only if) the participant's study medication compliance rate prior to discontinuation was at least 85%.</description>
