  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant use of fibrin glue in the fistula tract may promote healing in low-output
      enterocutaneous fistulas. However, there are only few studies that report autologous glue
      application in a larger patient group or clinical-controlled studies in this setting. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich fibrin
      glue (PRFG) in the treatment of low-output digestive fistulas and compare them with
      conservative management without the use of adjuvant application of FG into the fistulous
      tract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sudden appearance of intestinal contents draining from an abdominal incision is an
      emotionally devastating experience for both patients and surgeons. An enterocutaneous
      fistulas (ECF) is an abnormal communication between the bowel lumen and skin, often
      associated with fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, malnutrition, and sepsis. It is reported
      that spontaneous fistula closure rates vary from 15% to 71% after conservative treatment with
      wound care, control of infection, and nutritional support. Sufficient time should be allotted
      for the ECF to heal with conservative treatment, which also results in long-term discomfort.

      Adjuvant use of fibrin glue (FG) in the fistula tract may promote healing in low-output ECF.
      Containing high concentrations of human fibrinogen and thrombin, FG have been used
      extensively in many surgical fields as a biological adhesive system for tissue adhesion or
      hemostasis. Different types of FG are now employed: commercially produced and homemade
      autologous adhesives. Currently available FDA-approved commercial products such as Tisseel,
      Artiss (Baxter, Westlake Village, CA, USA), and Evicel (Johnson &amp; Johnson, Somerville, NJ,
      USA) are widely used in clinical applications. Risks of infection transmission, allergic
      reactions, and also the high cost, however, still make autologous FG attractive.
      Additionally, in comparison with other adhesives, autologous compounds have several
      advantages in terms of biocompatibility and biodegradation.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous platelet-rich
      fibrin glue (PRFG) in the treatment of low-output digestive fistulas and compare them with
      conservative management without the use of adjuvant application of FG into the fistulous
      tract.

    <time_frame>1-90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measures were defined as the time required for fistula closure and also fistula healing after the last treatment received if in study group, or since enrollment if in control group. Closure was predefined as the absence of drainage through the external openings whether occurring spontaneously or under externally applied pressure. Healing was predefined as complete reepithelialization of external openings.</description>

    <time_frame>1-90 days</time_frame>
    <description>For secondary analyses, the time required to resume enteral intake from parenteral nutrition was collected. The hospitalization after enrollment, and also the proportion of patients with recurrence of a healed fistula during 12 months follow-up were evaluated. The incidence of adverse events and severe adverse events (defined as an event that was fatal or life-threatening, led to hospitalization or disability, or required an intervention to prevent one of these outcomes) was determined at each study visit.</description>

    <description>The application of the glues through the external opening of the fistula was controlled by the drainage tube, which was based on fistulography to assure total occlusion of the internal hole. To allow the adhesion of the fibrin glues patch, all fistulous tracts were debrided to produce a smooth surface. At the time of procedures, the two components were mixed together to yield a gelatinous substance. After the FG was instilled, any redundant glue was removed from the external openings.</description>

    <description>Preparation of autologous platelet-rich fibrin glues (PRFG) The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was separated by centrifugation from 300-400 ml whole blood for 6 min at 1000g, 22°C twice, keeping most of the platelets (50%-60%) in the plasma fraction. For 50g PRP from each patient, with citric acid (2.84mM) lowering and NaHCO3 (75mM) adjusting the PH value, thrombin solution was produced. On the other hand, cryoprecipitate was produced from the rest of the plasma. Frozen at -80°C for at least 6h and then thawed at 4°C, PRP went through centrifugation at 4000rpm/min for 5min.
PRFG application The application of the glues through the external opening of the fistula was controlled by the drainage tube through a double-syringe system with distal mixing device. The distance was based on fistulography to assure total occlusion of the internal hole. After the FG was instilled, any redundant glue was removed from the external openings.</description>
