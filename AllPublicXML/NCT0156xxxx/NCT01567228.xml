      Physician counseling for physical activity, dental services, and academic support services
      such as tutoring could be improved through physician knowledge of local community resources
      and physician counseling directing patients to such services that are near the patient's
      residential address. This study will test the hypothesis that an electronic medical record
      enhanced with geographic information systems can improved physician counseling for physical
      activity, dental services, and academic support services by identifying services that are
      near the patient's residential address and informing MD's of such info at the point of care.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For the intervention clinics, data gathered by CHICA-GIS on the physician worksheet and just-in-time handouts will also allow us to determine the percentage of children who received behavioral counseling about dentistry, school performance, or physical activity by the physician, as well as the percentage of children who were referred to a community resource.</description>

    <measure>User experience and satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Surveys will be administered at baseline and end of the trial (18 months) to the entire staff of each practice, in order to document how each practice is organized and provide detailed information about community referral processes. Staff will also be asked about their satisfaction with the CHICA system, CHICA-GIS (Intervention Clinics only), and the community referral module (Intervention Clinics only).</description>

    <description>In randomly assigned experimental clinics, physicians will counsel patients to increase physical activity, seek dental care, or seek academic support services such as tutoring; this counseling will be assisted by an experimental intervention which consist of an electronic medical record that prompts specific counseling in conjunction with a geographic information system. The enhanced electronic medical record will map community resources to support physician counseling and lifestyle modification</description>
