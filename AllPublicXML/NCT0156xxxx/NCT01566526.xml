      The purpose of this study is to use retrospective data to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      re-injection interval of OZURDEX® in the treatment of macular oedema due to retinal vein
      occlusion (RVO) in patients who received OZURDEX® as part of the Belgium Medical Needs
      Program.

    <measure>Time to OZURDEX® Re-Injection in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The time interval is measured from the first OZURDEX® injection to the second OZURDEX® injection in the study eye.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) 7 to 12 Weeks Following Last Injection in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 to 12 weeks following the last injection</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA is measured in the study eye following each injection of OZURDEX® using a special eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The higher the number of letters read correctly, the better the vision (or visual acuity). A positive number improvement in the number of letters read means that the vision has improved. Data are reported for the 7-12 week period following the last injection.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With an Increase of 2 Lines or More in BCVA From Baseline in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA following the first injection of OZURDEX® is measured in the study eye using a special eye chart and is reported as the number of lines (5 letters per line) read correctly. An increase of 2 lines or more indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With an Increase of 3 Lines or More in BCVA From Baseline in the Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA following the first injection of OZURDEX® is measured in the study eye using a special eye chart and is reported as the number of lines (5 letters per line) read correctly. An increase of 3 lines or more indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness in the Study Eye by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) 7 to 12 Weeks Following Last Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 7 to 12 weeks following the last injection</time_frame>
    <description>OCT is measured in the study eye following each injection of OZURDEX®. OCT is a laser based non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina to assess retinal thickness. A negative change indicates an improvement. Data are reported for the 7-12 week period following the last injection.</description>
