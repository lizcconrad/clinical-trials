      This study will investigate whether clinical hypnotherapy can effectively treat chest pain
      symptoms, improve emotional wellbeing and quality of life in postmenopausal women with chest
      pain and coronary arteries without any narrowings. The diagnosis of chest pain with 'normal'
      coronary arteries is found in 25% of patients undergoing investigation of chest pain using
      coronary angiography (when dye is injected into the coronary arteries whilst xray pictures
      are taken), and the majority of these patients are postmenopausal women. Often there is no
      obvious physical cause. Despite symptoms being treated using conventional drugs, and life
      expectancy is not affected, many patients continue to suffer from debilitating chest pain
      symptoms, frequently resulting in visits to hospital, increased psychological illness and
      poor quality of life. The investigators are interested in finding ways of improving not only
      chest pain symptoms but also psychological wellbeing and quality of life in these patients.
      Previous studies of ours have found improvement in these patients after taking part in a
      support group, and using a relaxation technique called Autogenic training. Recently the
      investigators conducted a pilot study which showed a favourable effect of hypnotherapy on
      physical ability, well-being and quality of life. The investigators would now like to extend
      this study, performing a larger randomised, controlled trial. The investigators hypothesise
      that hypnotherapy will beneficially affect symptoms and quality of life in patients with
      cardiac Syndrome X.

    <description>Hypnotherapy will be conducted at the Royal Brompton Hospital by a qualified practician (DF). Ten pain control hypnotherapy session will run for 50-60 minutes each. In the first session a thorough history will be taken of the patient's chest pain history together with both the sensory and affective components of their pain. If there is time, relaxation technique and self-hypnosis will be taught at this visit. In subsequent sessions, various techniques, including techniques that focus on direct suggestions and imagery work, will be applied and taught to the patient. The pain control techniques are all analgesic in nature - focusing on the reduction, but not the total removal of the pain. A small amount of pain is left behind to serve as a reminder that either something is wrong or that the patient needs to take it easy.</description>

    <description>Subjects in the Supportive therapy group will attend the Royal Brompton Hospital weekly for 10 weeks to meet with person of equal status to the hypnotherapist (e.g. a research assistant, not a medical practitioner) trained to provide counseling and support. Visits will last 50-60 min. Patients will be encouraged to talk about their physical symptoms and any emotional issues, and to discuss how these might be coped with in a better way.</description>
