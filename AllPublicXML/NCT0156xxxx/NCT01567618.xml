    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent

          -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable gastric
             adenocarcinoma whose ECOG performance status are 0-2

          -  Presence of measurable disease by radiographic study (including CT or MRI scan, or
             chest x-ray) or physical examination

          -  At least 3 weeks since last major surgery

          -  At least 12 months since last adjuvant chemotherapy

          -  At least 6 weeks since prior radiotherapy providing that the extent and site of
             radiotherapy fields are such that marked bone marrow suppression is NOT expected

          -  Patients who have received palliative radiotherapy must have recovered from any
             reversible toxic effects e.g. nausea and vomiting caused by radiation of fields

          -  Patients with reproductive potential must use effective BC;

          -  Required Screening Laboratory Criteria:

        Hemoglobin 90g/L WBC 3.5 x 109/L Neutrophils 1.5 x 109/L Platelets 100 x 109/L Creatinine
        133 umol/L and creatinine clearance 60 mL/min

          -  A probable life expectancy of at least 6 months;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Brain metastases

          -  Female of childbearing potential, pregnancy test is positive

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies other than gastric cancer within the
             last five years, with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or low grade prostate cancer

          -  Active infection

          -  Concurrent severe medical problems unrelated to the malignancy, which would
             significantly limit full compliance with the study or expose the patient to extreme
             risk

          -  Sexually active patients refusing to practice adequate contraception; Patients with
             conditions which might affect absorption of an oral drug (for example intermittent
             obstruction) unless discussed and agreed with principal investigator

          -  History of grade 3 or 4 toxicity to fluoropyrimidines
