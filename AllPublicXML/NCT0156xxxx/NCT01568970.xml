  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The large number of people on long-term sick leave is a major public health concern in
      Norway. The main causes of disability are musculoskeletal and mental disorders. Long-term
      sick leave causes a decline in individual life-quality, is associated with increased risk for
      mental disorders and represents a very large cost for the Norwegian society.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the patients included return to work after
      rehabilitation at Hysnes Rehabilitation Centre. This includes an investigation of what is
      considered to be the effect of Return-to-work rehabilitation measured before, during and
      after the stay at the rehabilitation centre:

      The study specifically looks at the effect of structured and standardized return-to-work
      follow up of the patient, including contact with stakeholders (general practitioner, social
      security office and workplace).

      In addition there is a need to describe the patients participating in the program. The
      aetiology of complex symptom disorders is poorly understood and the role of genetics and
      stress is not translatable to a complex symptom population. This complicates the transition
      from current biological research to a clinical use regarding these patients. If the
      investigators can assist in understanding how these patients, who are multiusers of health
      care and have received sickness benefit for a long time, develop their disorders and
      symptoms, it will be of great importance to the Norwegian community. Therefore the study
      consists of multimodal measurements of the patients before, during and after a rehabilitation
      programme at Hysnes Rehabilitation Centre. These measures include genotype, saliva cortisol,
      medical-, psychological-, physiological diagnostics and work related factors.

      Related aims:

      Investigate if multidisciplinary treatment based on acceptance and commitment therapy,
      contributes to normalisation of cortisol release with regards to a standardized stress test.

      See wether individual differences regarding the stress profile can predict return to work in
      patients with complex symptom disorders.

      Investigate genetic risk factors in relation to Return to Work rehabilitation and identify
      treatment moderators in a multidisciplinary rehabilitation program.
