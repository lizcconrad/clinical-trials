      The purpose of the study is to clinically evaluate a new approach to treatment of patients
      with diabetes mellitus type II by using specially developed mobile-internet software
      solution.

      The effect of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve the integrated care
      of people with diabetes will be identified, developed, introduced and clinically evaluated.

      The investigators expect that usage of an e-Health application in health care of patients
      with diabetes mellitus type II could improve the following healthcare outcomes: results of
      the laboratory tests (with emphasis on HbA1C value), regular medication usage, blood pressure
      values, Body mass index (BMI) values, diet, regular exercise and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a &quot;group of common metabolic disorders that share the
      phenotype of hyperglycemia&quot;. It is generally agreed that in Caucasian populations the
      prevalence rate is between 2% and 6%. Prevalence rate of DM in SLovenia is about 5%. Type 2
      DM accounts for 90% to 95% of all diabetes cases.

      Results of many clinical studies demonstrated the great potential of information and
      communication technology (ICT) applications to improve health care of patients with chronic
      diseases including diabetes mellitus.

      In this study an ICT mobile environment to improve the process of an integrated care of
      people with Diabetes mellitus will be identified, developed, introduced and clinically
      evaluated. The study will include 140 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II who
      are managed in primary care. The study will use and evaluation questionnaire that will cover
      issues regarding the patient quality of life.

      Subjects with a blood pressure meter and a scale, will be able to enter the value of the
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the body weight.

      Subjects will be motivated to regularly enter data about their blood pressure, body weight,
      dietary misconducts and to complete available questioners. In addition to this, users can
      enter values about their physical activity (type, duration, intensity).

    <description>WONCA COOP questionnaire measure seven core aspects of functional status, therefore this instrument consists of 7 five-point ordinal sub-scales. Each scale ranging from 1 ('no limitation at all') to 5 ('severely limited'); for 'change in health' score 1 means 'much better' and score 5'much worse'. Sub-scales are averaged to compute a total score.</description>
