      Background

      An important part of individuals undergoing genetic counseling and/or testing for cancer
      experience psychosocial problems and worries during or after this process. Approximately 20%
      of these individuals experience serious problems, such as fear for cancer in themselves or
      their relatives, family communication problems, unresolved grief, problems in coping with the
      DNA-test-results, difficulties in choices with regard to DNA-testing, preventive surgeries,
      and concerns about insurance or work. Research shows that these problems are frequently
      undetected by the counselors. Within the limited available time of a counseling session, a
      lot of information should be given to the counselee. This information is mostly biomedical
      and provider driven. Therefore psychosocial issues can be underexposed. The use of a brief
      questionnaire, completed by the counselee prior to the counseling session, can serve as a
      tool for the counselor to screen and address the relevant psychosocial issues in a systematic
      manner. Therefore, in 2009-2010 the investigators have developed and validated the
      'Signal-checklist' to identify relevant psychosocial problems frequently encountered in the
      cancer-genetics setting, and need for extra psychosocial services. This 'Signal-checklist'
      can serve as a tool in screening systematically for psychosocial issues, addressing these
      issues and directing appropriate referrals to extra psychosocial services. The Signal-Trial
      will be performed to evaluate the use and effectiveness of the checklist.

      Aim

      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the implementation of a short, self-developed
      cancer-genetics checklist; the 'Signal-checklist', as an aid in 1) facilitating communication
      on psychosocial issues during the genetic counseling session, 2) increasing counselors
      awareness of psychosocial problems of the counselee, and 3) improving the management of these
      psychosocial problems during and after the process of genetic counselling.

      Method

      This study is a collaboration between the family cancer clinics of the NKI-AVL and the UMCU.
      Individuals requesting genetic counseling for the high incidence of cancer in their family
      are invited to participate in the trial. Participants will be asked to complete the 'Signal
      checklist' prior to their counseling visit. Participants (N=264) will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two study arms. The intervention group will receive feed-back on the
      'Signal-checklist', whereas the control group will not receive feed-back. Three weeks after
      the DNA-test disclosure session, participants will be asked to complete again the
      'Signal-checklist' followed by a telephone call by their counselor. Again, the results of the
      'Signal-checklist' will be available to the counselor for participants in the intervention
      group, but not for the control group. Both the genetic counseling session and telephone call
      will be audio taped. Furthermore, all participants will be asked to complete three
      questionnaires on the Internet (or by mail, if preferred); 1) before randomization (3 weeks
      prior to the counseling session), 2) three weeks after the counseling session, and 3) four
      months after the potential DNA-test result disclosure. These questionnaires include items on
      communication during genetic counseling, the need for professional psychosocial support,
      cancer worries, satisfaction with received care, and experiences with the use of the
      'Signal-checklist'. The audio-tapes and completed questionnaires will be used to measure
      psychosocial problems of the counselees, the awareness of the counselors of these problems,
      and the management of these problems. Secondary analysis will be conducted to assess the need
      for extra psychosocial services, satisfaction with genetic counseling, feasibility of
      implementing the 'Signal-checklist' and decreasing psychosocial problems over time.
