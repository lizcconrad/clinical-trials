  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) effecting large amounts of the
      population. The most common treatment for this condition is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA),
      however patients failing to respond to this and incurring a flare up are often escalated to
      steroidal treatments.

      This study is being conducted by GW Pharma Ltd as a pilot study in order to determine the
      efficacy and safety of GWP42003 (0mg - 250mg twice daily), compared with placebo, by the
      percentage of participants achieving remission quantified as a Mayo score of 2 or less (with
      no subscore &gt; 1) after 10 weeks treatment.

      This is the first study to determine whether the study medication has a positive benefit for
      subjects on their ulcerative colitis symptom control, as well as effects on inflammatory
      marker cytokines (plasma tumour necrosis factor [TNF]α, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6), C reactive
      protein [CRP], faecal inflammatory marker (calprotectin), stool frequency (NRS), rectal
      bleeding (NRS), pain (NRS). In addition, various IBD questionnaires are being implemented in
      the study to observe further benefits on the study medication, compared with placebo.

      This study will be a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group pilot study. There will be two parallel groups of participants (0mg-250mg
      GWP42003 and placebo, twice daily), with a treatment duration of 10 weeks as well as a 7 day
      baseline period and one week follow-up. The two treatment groups of 0mg-250mg GWP42003 and
      placebo will be randomised equally into a 1:1 ratio, with 31 participants in the active IMP
      group and 31 participants allocated placebo treatment.

      In order to be eligible for enrollment in this study, subjects will need to be aged 18 years
      and above (18-65 for Czech Republic) and be clinically diagnosed with with mild or moderate
      ulcerative colitis and on a fixed dose of 5-ASA treatment (0 mg dose of 5-ASA is acceptable)
      and have been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to screening.

      Eligible subjects will enter the study at a screening visit (Visit 1) and commence a baseline
      period. Each subject will have a Mayo (including endoscopy) assessment conducted to confirm
      eligibility. If eligible, the subject will be randomised into the 10-week treatment phase.
      There are a total of 6 visits in the study.

The IBDQ is a validated and reliable tool to measure health-related quality of life in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Each of the 32 questions falls into one of four domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional status and social functioning). All questions were scored out of seven, with higher scores attributed to increasingly favourable responses; accordingly, any increase in score signified an improvement in condition. Individual question scores were summed to give the IBDQ total score (range: 32-224 points).</description>

        <description>Change in IBDQ total score from Baseline to Final Visit.
The IBDQ is a validated and reliable tool to measure health-related quality of life in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Each of the 32 questions falls into one of four domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional status and social functioning). All questions were scored out of seven, with higher scores attributed to increasingly favourable responses; accordingly, any increase in score signified an improvement in condition. Individual question scores were summed to give the IBDQ total score (range: 32-224 points).</description>

          <description>Change in IBDQ total score from Baseline to Final Visit.
The IBDQ is a validated and reliable tool to measure health-related quality of life in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Each of the 32 questions falls into one of four domains (bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional status and social functioning). All questions were scored out of seven, with higher scores attributed to increasingly favourable responses; accordingly, any increase in score signified an improvement in condition. Individual question scores were summed to give the IBDQ total score (range: 32-224 points).</description>

        <description>Change in rectal bleeding from Baseline to end of treatment.
Rectal bleeding scores using a 0-4 numerical rate scale (0 = No blood seen; 1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time; 2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time or more; 3 = Blood alone passes) were recorded in daily diaries, by participants, during the baseline and treatment periods. For analysis the baseline value is defined as the mean rectal bleeding score of the last seven available days of the baseline period; the end of treatment value is defined as the mean rectal bleeding score of last seven days of the treatment period.</description>

        <description>Change in Total Mayo score from Baseline to Final Visit.
The Mayo score is an assessment of ulcerative colitis activity, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The Mayo total score (range 0-12 points) is made up of four sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings and the physicians assessment of illness severity); each carrying equal numerical weight (0-3 points).</description>

The Mayo score is an assessment of ulcerative colitis activity, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The Mayo total score (range 0-12 points) is made up of four sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings and the physicians assessment of illness severity); each carrying equal numerical weight (0-3 points).
The Mayo partial score does not include the endoscopy findings sub-score, and is calculated by summing the remaining three sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGAS) to give a value ranging from 0-9 points. As with the Mayo total score, higher Mayo partial scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

        <description>Proportion of participants responding between Baseline and Final Visit.
The Mayo score is an assessment of ulcerative colitis activity, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The Mayo total score (range 0-12 points) is made up of four sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings and the physicians assessment of illness severity); each carrying equal numerical weight (0-3 points).
A responder was defined as a participant with a decrease in their Mayo total score of ≥3 points, compared to baseline, with a reduction of at least 1 point in endoscopy findings sub-score.</description>

          <title>Mayo Score: Responder Analysis - PP Analysis</title>
          <description>Proportion of participants responding between Baseline and Final Visit.
The Mayo score is an assessment of ulcerative colitis activity, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The Mayo total score (range 0-12 points) is made up of four sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy findings and the physicians assessment of illness severity); each carrying equal numerical weight (0-3 points).
A responder was defined as a participant with a decrease in their Mayo total score of ≥3 points, compared to baseline, with a reduction of at least 1 point in endoscopy findings sub-score.</description>

The Mayo partial score does not include the endoscopy findings sub-score, and is calculated by summing the remaining three sub-scores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGAS) to give a value ranging from 0-9 points.
