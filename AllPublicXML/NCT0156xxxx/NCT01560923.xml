  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, multi-institutional phase II therapeutic study of
      Indoximod or placebo after the completion of standard of care sipuleucel-T (Provenge®) in men
      with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer that is castration
      resistant (hormone refractory). Patients are randomized to receive either twice daily oral
      Indoximod or placebo for 6 months beginning the day after the third and final sipuleucel-T
      infusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sipuleucel-T will be administered as standard of care. Oral Indoximod/placebo will be
      self-administered twice daily for 6 months starting after the last infusion of sipuleucel-T.
      Patients will be treated for a minimum of 12 weeks of Indoximod/placebo before disease
      progression can be declared and Indoximod/placebo will not be discontinued for increasing
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the absence of symptomatic clinical progression.
