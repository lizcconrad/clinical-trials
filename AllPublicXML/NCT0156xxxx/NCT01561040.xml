  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a common but often inadequately treated disease of the tears and
      surface of the eye. It can cause poor vision and chronic pain and is more frequent with
      increasing age. The 1995 Report of the National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop on Clinical
      Trials in Dry Eye defined dry eye as &quot;a disorder of the tear film due to tear deficiency or
      excessive evaporation, which causes damage to the interpalpebral ocular surface and is
      associated with symptoms of ocular discomfort&quot;. The International Dry Eye Work Shop (DEWS)
      committee subsequently defined dry eye as &quot;a multi-factorial disease of the tears and ocular
      surface that results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability
      with potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the
      tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface.&quot; Typically, symptoms associated with dry
      eye disease include ocular burning, foreign body sensation (sand or grit), photophobia (light
      sensitivity), and other symptoms that result in overall long term discomfort in patients. The
      proposed eight week feasibility study if dry eye subjects confirmed elevated osmolarity and
      symptoms respond to nutritional therapy.

      Hyperosmolarity is a major cause of cell damage over time and can result in apoptosis of
      corneal and conjunctival cells. Determining if a patient has hyperosmolarity is critical
      allowing us to offer therapies to correct the problem. Reducing and regulating osmolarity is
      important in preventing potential long-term tissue compromise. Treatment leading to
      decreasing tear osmolarity can improve the patient's quality of life by stabilizing vision
      and, in many cases, simply allowing patients to return to normal activities.

      Fatty Acids (EFA) have been shown to diminish inflammatory responses in many human
      inflammatory diseases, and interest in the use of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for disease
      treatment has resulted in several small studies as well as the use (and over-the-counter
      availability) of EFA-containing nutritional supplements, including several specifically for
      the treatment of DED. Unfortunately, the effects of Omega 3 on dry eye disease have not been
      established to date. The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of Omega 3
      plays in the regulating tear osmolarity in patients with established findings consistent with
      dry eye disease.

    <description>This multi-centre study will screen patients with dry eye disease defined by objective diagnostic procedures to include TearLab Osmolarity, Tear Break Up Time (TBUT), Corneal Staining, Conjunctival Staining, phenol red thread test, Ocular Surface Disease Index and Meniscus height. Patients will also be assessed using subjective questionnaires to document the change of comfort and vision with the addition to their diet omega 3 supplements.</description>

          -  Age 18 to 79 at the time of informed consent.

          -  Must understand; be willing and able, and likely to fully comply with study
             procedures, visit schedule, and restrictions.

          -  A diagnosis of dry eye disease based on a global clinical assessment by the attending
             clinician, patient complaint of dry eye symptoms and osmolarity. There will be two
             osmolarity tiers; the lower tier is an open label design based on an average
             osmolarity between 316-326 mOsmo/L, and the other a group &gt;=327 mOsmol/L. (Enrollment
             in the two tiers can either be simultaneous, or the second tier can be included after
             a responder analysis is done of tier 1).
