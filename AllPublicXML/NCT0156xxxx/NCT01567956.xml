      The aim of the trial is to test safety, tolerability and efficacy of Propionyl-L-carnitine
      modified release tablets 1g/die in reducing the symptoms of the disease with respect to the
      proportion of patients with disease remission at the end of the 8 weeks of treatment. It will
      also aim to investigate capability of the treatment in the maintenance of remission after
      four weeks of treatment interruption; histological changes will be also evaluated and
      finally, improvement in the overall quality of life as measured by the Short Inflammatory
      Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) will be investigated.

      Although it seems clear that an abnormal function of the colonic epithelium is the central
      problem causing inflammation and the unusual immunological response to the normal gut flora
      in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the actual causes of these dysfunctions are still
      unknown. Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are the main fuel of the colonic epithelium, and are
      normally produced by the bacterial flora by fermentation of the complex carbohydrates forming
      non soluble fibers usually introduced with everyday diet. Butyrate alone contributes 70% of
      the normal colonocyte energy. Studies done using animal models and colonic mucosa biopsies
      from patients suffering form ulcerative colitis (UC) have consistently shown that a metabolic
      change occurs in diseased colonic mucosa, with an impairment of butyrate oxidation (and of
      beta-oxidation) and an energy shortage that is only incompletely compensated by oxidation of
      glucose and other substrates such as glutamine. It is also well known that matrix
      metalloproteases production is highly increased in IBD and that serum transglutaminase
      activity is significantly reduced in patients with IBD. Transglutaminases are enzymes
      contributing to the crosslinking of matrix proteins and the reduction seen in patients
      affected by IBD correlates well with the endoscopic and histopathologic grading in UC,
      meaning that part of the circulating enzyme is sequestered in the injured colonic tissue in
      the effort to re-build the extracellular matrix during the healing process.
      Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride (PLC) is a molecule that has already been shown to reduce
      membrane lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells from bovine aorta and coronary vessels, to
      reduce the effects of hypoxia in coronary endothelial cells, and to play a role in the
      cardiac metabolic abnormalities that contribute to the mechanical dysfunctions leading to
      heart failure. Given these properties of Propionyl-L-carnitine Hydrochloride (ST 261) and
      given the peroxidative damage suffered by colonocytes in UC together with their metabolic
      impairment, the use of this molecule for the treatment of UC seemed to be appropriate and
      sound, in particular as a carrier of a propionate moiety that, once transformed into
      succinate, enters the Kreb cycle, acting as an extra burst fuel improving the balance of
      energy production inside tissues. Previous clinical experience has shown that PLC promoted
      complete or nearly complete regression of cutaneous trophic ulcers in a large number of
      vasculopathic patients refractory to all other therapies. As far as the UC pathology is
      concerned, the effects of ST 261, given orally or intrarectally, were investigated at
      different dosages, in preclinical experimentation, either after a single trinitrobenzene
      sulphonic acid (TNBS) administration (acute colitis) or after repeated TNBS administrations
      (reactivated colitis). The results showed a reduction in the damaged colon area both in acute
      model and reactivated colitis, even if the beneficial effect of restoration of TNBS-induced
      alterations of tissue morphology is more evident in the reactivated colitis model,
      particularly after oral administration. Based on the above-described results a development
      plan in humans started to investigate the activity of PLC in the treatment of ulcerative
      colitis.
