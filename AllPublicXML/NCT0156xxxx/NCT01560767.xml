    <textblock>
      Peri-articular knee infiltration with Levobupivicaine 150mg, Morphine 10mg and Ketorolac 30mg
      reduces postoperative pain following primary total knee replacement compared with the current
      standard treatment of femoral nerve blockade.

    <description>A validated, patient-reported 100 mm visual analogue pain score. It is a line 100mm long on which patient places a line through to mark the severity of the pain the patient is experiencing from 0mm= No pain to 100mm wost pain possible.</description>

    <measure>Concentration of Levobupivicaine in drain and patient serum samples</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours post operation and pre and post retransfusion</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of local anaesthetic agent (Levobupivicaine) in the drain fluid collected in the Bellovac ABT and patient serum concentrations. The drain concentration will be assessed at 6 hrs post operation with serum concentrations pre-retransfusion (tourniquet- down time + 40 mins) and post-retransfusion (post-op + 6hrs 40min).</description>

    <description>The patients 'straight-leg raise' and mobilisation will be assessed by an independent physiotherapist on the ward after the surgery and a more formal functional assessment of the knee will be made at 6 weeks using the Oxford Knee Score: a validated, patient-reported measure of knee function.</description>

    <description>The peri-articular infiltration of multimodal agents will consist of 150 mg of levobupivacaine, 10 mg morphine and 30mg ketorolac diluted in 0.9% saline to make a volume 100 ml. (0.5ml 1:1000 adrenaline will be added to the mixture to reduce blood loss after the operation) Fifty ml of the mixture will be injected into the posterior, medial and lateral soft-tissues just prior to implantation of the TKA components. Care will be taken to avoid excessive infiltration in the area of the common peroneal nerve. Then, while the cement is curing, the anterior soft-tissues including the quadriceps mechanism, the retinacular tissues and the subcuticular tissues will be infiltrated with the remaining 50 ml of peri-articular injection.</description>

    <description>Under aseptic conditions, the femoral artery will be palpated immediately below the inguinal ligament and nerve stimulation will be used to identify the femoral nerve just lateral to the artery. Once the femoral nerve has been identified the block may be performed in the routine manner, using 30 ml of levobupivacaine 0.25%. The precise technique used will be noted on trial documentation.</description>
