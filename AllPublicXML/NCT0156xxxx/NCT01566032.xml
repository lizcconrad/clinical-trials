  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The amount of air leaking from a chest tube can be measured in two main ways:

        1. electronic monitor connected to the chest tube

        2. numerical (non-electronic) monitor connected to the chest tube

      For people who have had lung surgery, it is important to understand the impact of measuring
      air leaks accurately in both the short term and the long term. An electronic medical device
      called Thopaz measures air leak electronically. Another medical device called Pleur-evac
      measures air leak numerically. The purpose of this study is to understand the accuracy of the
      method used by doctors and nurses to determine if a chest tube has an air leak. It is also
      important to determine the size or severity of an air leak.

      Patients with air leaks following lung surgery will be assessed by a target number of 6
      observers each (three nurses and three MDs) who will be randomly asked to participate.
      Patients will first be connected to the numerical air leak detector, followed by the
      electronic air leak detector. Observers will record their responses for each device. They
      will be blinded to responses from other observers.

    <description>Time frame will occur once patients have experienced an air leak. 70% of patients are expected to have a PAL on postoperative day 1. There will be a 4 hour window to complete observations from the numerical device. These observations will be followed by observations on digital device. Each observer should spend 5-10 min to complete both tasks.</description>
