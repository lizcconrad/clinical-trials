  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized study will study the 2 year survivorship and short term outcomes
      of a currently-used femoral stem: the Bone Preservation Tri-Lock femoral stem using two
      surgical approaches. The surgical approaches being studied are direct anterior and
      anterolateral. Implant survivorship, radiographic positioning, and functional outcomes will
      be compared. Subjects will be randomized to surgical approach and followed for a period of
      two years.
