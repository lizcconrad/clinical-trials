  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying a new treatment for one subtype of obesity. Obesity is not a
      disease. It is a symptom of several different diseases. These diseases have distinct
      etiologies, being caused by aberrations in different mechanisms. Forms of obesity caused by
      such non-critical mechanisms might be corrected fairly easily and safely. The investigators
      are interested in overeating and obesity that is caused by the opioidergic system. The
      opioidergic system appears to be responsible for a subtype of obesity associated with binge
      eating disorder (BED). People, especially with the right genetic predisposition, can become
      addicted to foods that release endorphins, in the way that people become addicted to
      exogenous opiates and other drugs that release endorphins. The particular application in our
      proposed clinical trial is for intranasal (IN) naloxone. The peak levels of naloxone were
      similar and the bioavailability of naloxone intranasally was 100% (the same) of that
      available IV.&quot; IN administration of naloxone has since been broadly tested in humans, as
      well, where it has been shown to be safe, with pharmacokinetics similar to those of naloxone
      given by injection .
