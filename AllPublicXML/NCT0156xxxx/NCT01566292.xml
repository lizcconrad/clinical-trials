  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The injection of botulinum neurotoxin A into the prostate represents an alternative, minimal
      invasive treatment in patient with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated to benign
      prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of BTA in treating patients with symptomatic BPH and
      unsatisfactory response to combined medical therapy.
