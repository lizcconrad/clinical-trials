      Background:

      - Gum disease is a condition in which the tissue around the tooth root becomes swollen and
      infected. This condition can cause tooth loss if it is not treated. Who gets gum disease and
      how bad it will be depends on (1) the different bacteria in the mouth and (2) how the immune
      system of an individual handles these bacteria. Researchers want to look at the oral bacteria
      and genetic immune problems of different people to learn how these affect gum disease and
      other conditions of the mouth.

      Objectives:

      - To study how immune system problems may lead to problems in the mouth, including gum
      disease.

      Eligibility:

        -  Children and adults at least 7 years of age who have genetic problems with their immune
           system.

        -  Healthy adults that have periodontal disease

        -  Health adults that do not have periodontal disease

      Design:

        -  This study will involve a screening visit and a study visit.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, blood work and a full oral and
           dental exam, including dental x-rays and photos.

        -  The study visit will involve collection of blood, urine, and other samples, including
           saliva, plaque, and gum swabs. Any abnormal tissue will sampled for a biopsy. Additional
           oral and dental exams will be performed. Participants will also answer questions about
           any current medical or dental problems.

      This protocol is a cross sectional study designed to investigate the clinical, microbiologic,
      and immunologic consequences of immune dysfunction (particularly dysfunction due to primary
      immune defects) in the oral cavity. The hypothesis is that systemic immune dysfunction,
      attributed to monogenic immune defects in most of our populations of interest, will lead to
      alterations in the local immune response and microbial colonization and ultimately predispose
      to susceptibility to oral infections and inflammatory conditions. Of particular interest to
      this protocol is the susceptibility of select patient populations with immune dysfunction to
      periodontal disease. Whereas patients with hyper-immunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) are an
      important focus of this research, enrollment will be open to a broader population, including
      monogenic immune defects such as leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1), chronic
      granulomatous disease (CGD), as well as patients with defects in cytokine signaling.

      For inclusion in this study, ID subjects must have a current diagnosis of a primary immune
      defect, and be enrolled in an NIH protocol that is following their medical issues and through
      which they are required to get a dental consult. Data from the dental consult, collected
      under the parent protocol, will be analyzed through this protocol to assess the type and
      extent of oral manifestation in patients with these immune defects. In addition to the
      information collected as part of the consult, subjects will undergo sampling for oral fluids,
      microbes, and blood sampling. Each patient subject 18 years of age or older will also undergo
      an oral biopsy. Systemically healthy volunteer subjects will be screened and classified as
      with/without periodontitis. Healthy volunteers will be clinically evaluated and enrolled for
      a single visit, at which they will undergo oral fluid/microbe/tissue/blood sampling/oral
      biopsy for research purposes.

      The primary aim of this protocol is to use modern methodologies to characterize the immune
      response and microbial colonization in the oral cavity in health and patients with primary
      immune defects. By particularly studying subjects with monogenic immune defects, we aim to
      increase the understanding of the role of specific immune molecules and pathways in the
      balance of host/microbial interactions on mucosal surfaces such as the oral cavity.
