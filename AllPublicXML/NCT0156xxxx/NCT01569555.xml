      By determining the correlation of a Crossed Leg Sign with signifcant pathology, a clinician
      would then be able to use this correlation to risk stratify his/her patients for significant
      pathology. Therefore, by determining the sensitivity and specificity of this physical exam
      finding, the clinician would have a better idea of the patients clinical management,
      including diagnostic testing and ultimate treatment of the patient. Crossed Leg Sign will be
      defined in this study as: any patient observed in the Emergency Department with sustained
      crossed legs. To my knowledge, crossed legs have never been evaluated in regards to it's
      correlation with significant pathology. This could potentially add another physical exam
      finding to be used by the clinician.
