      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of parecoxib in combination with
      epidural morphine in providing analgesia for patients undergoing gynecological surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Researches have showed that the use of epidural and spinal block resulted in significant
      reduction in morbidity and mortality after surgery. Moreover, appropriate pain management
      results in better outcomes. Opioids therapy is recommended as the first choice medication for
      the management of postoperative pain but is associated with a number of undesirable adverse
      effects. A multimodal therapy for providing postoperative analgesia has advantages over the
      use of opioids alone. The use of NSAIDs and opioids together often improves analgesia and
      reduces the need for opioids in the postoperative period. Often, the combination of COX-2
      inhibitors with epidural analgesia is preferred. With epidural analgesia, addition of COX-2
      inhibitors may improve the analgesia and decrease the undesirable side effects.

    <description>The secondary outcome included pain intensity, the patients' global evaluation, and side effects accompanied with PCEA and parecoxib, such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, motor block in the lower extremities, and the time to passage of flatus and first bowel movement.Blood loss, length of hospitalization, and postoperative cardiovascular (CV) events were also recorded.</description>

    <description>Before incision, patients in Group P (n = 120) receive 40mg of parecoxib IV. Thereafter, parecoxib patients receive 40mg of parecoxib IV every 12 h for 48 h. 30 min before the end of surgery, a mixture of 6 mL of ropivacaine 0.25% and 2mg morphine was given epidurally. Epidural patient-controlled analgesia was initiated by using ropivacaine 0.125% (1.25 mg/ml) and morphine 0.005% (0.05 mg/ml) with a basal infusion rate of 2 ml/h, a demand dose of 2 ml, and a 15-min lockout.</description>
