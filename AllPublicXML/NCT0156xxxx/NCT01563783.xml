      This Post Market study is being conducted to compare the direct and indirect cost of three
      approaches (GFA, myomectomy, and uterine artery embolization) for the treatment of
      symptomatic uterine fibroids.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are the most common pelvic neoplasms in women; they severely impact quality
      of life and are the leading indication for hysterectomy. Hysterectomy is the definitive
      treatment for myomas; however, many patients seek alternative uterine-sparing therapy and
      desire to conserve their fertility. Myomectomy is a much-reported surgical option for women
      with symptomatic fibroids and, until recently, the abdominal approach has been the approach
      of choice for most surgeons. Over time, patients have requested less invasive procedures and
      minimally invasive, laparoscopic options are becoming more popular among patients and their
      gynecologists. Standard surgical and interventional treatments for uterine fibroids are
      costly to society and to the health care system. New technologies such as GFA may offer a
      low-cost alternative to the standard treatments for symptomatic uterine fibroids in women who
      desire uterine conservation. This study seeks to evaluate those cost differences between
      three available uterine-sparing techniques and to explore the qualitative outcomes such as
      symptom severity, health related quality of life, and overall treatment effect.
