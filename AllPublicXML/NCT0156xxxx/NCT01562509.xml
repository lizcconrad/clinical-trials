  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed study is to assess the effectiveness, feasibility and
      costs of a tailored strategy (developed in accordance with the barriers found and current
      practice) to improve care for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), compared to a
      common strategy of 'audit &amp; feedback'.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study among 22 Dutch hospitals many gaps in the care for patients with
      non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) were found, compared to best evidence as described in
      guidelines. In a problem analysis study, barriers and facilitators for good quality of
      NHL-care were assessed and a tailored implementation strategy was developed, based on these
      findings. The proposed study aims at the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of this
      tailored strategy to improve quality of care for patients with an NHL in a clustered
      randomized controlled trial in 19 Dutch hospitals.

      Multilevel regression analyses will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of both
      strategies. Exposure to and experiences with the strategy elements will be analysed
      descriptively.

      Regarding the costs, the two strategies are compared with a health care perspective. The
      input of resources will be assessed by collecting volumes of consumed resources and
      multiplying these by the price of each resource unit; the implementation process and
      consequently costs will be estimated by an Activity Based Costing (ABC) approach. The output
      will be determined by the level of adherence to the NHL quality indicators.

    <description>The effect of our interventions will be measured by means of adherence to quality indicators for optimal NHL care. The effects of the audit and feedback strategy (9 hospitals) versus the tailored strategy (9 hospitals) will be evaluated using previously developed quality indicators. These indicators for optimal NHL care were developed on the basis of evidence based guidelines, literature and opinions of clinicians about NHL care in a previous study and were validated.</description>

    <description>To study the feasibility of both strategies, a process evaluation has to give insight into the mechanisms and processes responsible for the result (= extent of adherence to the indicator set for optimal NHL care). The actual 'exposure' of the patients and professionals to the implementation elements, together with their experience with these elements may have influenced the final result (success or failure of adherence). Data about 'exposure' to the different interventions will be collected using questionnaires.</description>

    <description>Non-adherence to the multidisciplinary NHL guideline may lead to unnecessary medical interventions and more complications, and subsequently to efficiency losses. This economic evaluation compares the two implementation strategies. The perspective of this economic evaluation will be a health care perspective. Both the costs of the implementation strategy and changes in health care consumption will be assessed. The outcome should facilitate local health care decision making on implementation.</description>
