  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T-DM1 , which is a highly innovative but also expensive antiHER2 agent consisting in the
      coupling of the humanised monoclonal antibody trastuzumab with a cytotoxic agent (maytansine
      derivate) has shown an encouraging antitumor activity evaluated by Recist criteria (35%
      objective response rate, 44% stable disease, 18% progressive disease) in patients with
      advanced HER2 positive Breast Cancer pretreated with several cytotoxic drugs, trastuzumab and
      lapatinib.

      Rationale I :For TDM1 to be active, the presence of an intact HER2 receptor is &quot;key&quot; since
      the internalization of the cytotoxic moiety depends on the binding of trastuzumab to the
      external domain of HER2.

      The zirconium 89 labelled trastuzumab PET/CT (or HER2 immunoPET/CT) is a non invasive test
      which shows promise in measuring HER2 expression (extracellular domain) for the entire
      disease burden and which could identify non responding patients prior to TDM1 administration.

      Rationale II: As for many such agents, it is desirable to identify early on (here with the
      use of FDG-PET/CT) which patients are unlikely to benefit from the therapy

      The main objective of the trial is to prospectively evaluate the ability of a zirconium 89
      labelled trastuzumab PET, to predict, before initiation of the treatment, treatment failure
      to a new targeted drug: T-DM1.

      At the same time, the early FDG-PET/CT, performed after 1 course of T-DM1, will also
      evaluated for its ability to predict non response to TDM1.
