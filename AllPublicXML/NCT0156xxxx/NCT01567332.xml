  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of neurological deficits after stroke results from a reorganization of cortical
      activities, possibly through brain plasticity. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (rTMS-MagproR30) produces changes in cortical excitability, generates phenomena of
      neuroplasticity. Its use to improve function after stroke, particularly of the upper limb,
      was validated. The investigators propose to evaluate in a prospective pilot against placebo,
      the benefit of rTMS at low frequency (1Hz) on the unaffected hemisphere in the short and
      medium term, especially on walking function and spasticity in patients with sequelae of
      cerebral infarction in the MCA territory with gait disturbance and motor weakness of the
      upper limb.

    <measure>Spontaneous walking speed of 10 meters. The evaluation of the primary endpoint is blind to the stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spontaneous walking speed (comfortable) to 10 meters. The gain on the walking speed of 10 meters will be appreciated by an independent evaluator, blinded to randomization.
The evaluation will be made on day 1 pre (T0) and post-stimulation (T1) (for 6 hours before and after 1 h), at D8 (T2) and J21 (T3) for 2 sessions (sham and active) .</description>

    <measure>- Study of the march by AQM (Gait Deviation Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement parameters spatiotemporal, kinematic and kinetic walking on day 1 pre-test, J8, J21 of the two phases.
This measurement is performed using 4 cameras and markers installed in the room where runs quantified analysis of the march.
Patients are fitted with reflective markers so that their movements are recorded and then digitized</description>

    <measure>- Consequence of lower limb spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale of the quadriceps and triceps surae)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Used to describe a subjective rate of increase in resistance or tone perceived by an examiner when a member engages in the mobility sector. Coast of the score 0-4 (0 no strength, no mobility possible, 4). The scale is used to measure the first tone. Its reproducibility is quite low but it is the scale used and accepted. It is brief and feasible (no equipment, but requires training).Will be measured pre and post test J1, J8 and J21 of the two phases.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analytical and functional recovery of the lower limb (Fugl-Meyer Scale, the FIM score)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale sensorimotor Fugl-Meyer: widely used in the literature, gold standard. The evolution motor is well defined. First part to obtain three subscores: MS (33 items, side 0 to 66), MI (17 items sides from 0 to 34), equilibrium (7 items sides from 0 to 14). The score can be used in total or subgroup. It requires 30 to 45 minutes with a trained evaluator. It can easily be used in clinical practice. A change in score &lt;10 may be due to simple measurement error and may not reflect a significant change in motor skills.
Will be measured pre and post test J1, J8 and J21 of the two phases.</description>

    <measure>Analytical and functional recovery of upper limb (Fugl-Meyer score and French arm test)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Frenchay Arm Test: This test, rapid (5 min) includes five tasks rated 0 or 1, requiring the use of one or both hands: draw a line, then install a lift cylinder, lift and then rest a glass of water, remove and replace a clothespin and combing. The score ranges from 0 to 5. The FAT is used to evaluate both the proximal motor skills, manual dexterity and bimanual coordination. It is validated in hemiplegic, reproduced over time and between observers, but its ceiling and floor effects are very important. Will be measured pre and post test J1, J8 and J21 of the two phases.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction and quality of life on a visual analog scale and the SF 36.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is a generic health scale created to measure health status in the general population. It includes 36 items organized into eight dimensions, physical functioning, physical limitations, pain, social functioning, mental health, emotion, vitality, general health perceptions. It includes two questions to estimate the change of health status on the past four weeks. The test is validated, it is a simple questionnaire and short of 10 minutes (acceptability).It requires no training to administer. It can be done by mail (Feasibility).She will be provided on D8 of the two phases.</description>
