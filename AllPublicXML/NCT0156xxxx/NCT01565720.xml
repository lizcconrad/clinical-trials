    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate repeat doses of isavuconazole on cardiac repolarization in
      healthy adult subjects. Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of four treatment groups
      and be confined for 17 days including pre-dosing days. Moxifloxacin will be given as an
      active control on the last dosing day to healthy subjects in one of the four groups. All
      treatments, except the moxifloxacin dose, are double-blinded (neither the subject nor the
      study doctor will know the treatment assignment). Subjects will undergo continuous ECGs on
      three study days. ECGs, vital signs, blood draws will be obtained throughout the study for
      safety and to assess the amount of study drug in body.
