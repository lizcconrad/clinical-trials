  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of temsirolimus in patients who have
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and have been treated with one previous chemotherapy
      or biologic therapy like sorafenib, but have experienced disease progression or intolerance
      to that therapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no standard therapy exists for patients who progress on sorafenib. mTOR signaling
      is often up-regulated in HCC promoting cell growth and survival. This process is inhibited by
      rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR. Temsirolimus, a rapamycin analog, may delay tumor
      progression by inhibiting mTOR in HCC.Intervention: Temsirolimus IV

      Eligible patients will receive temsirolimus IV on days 1,8,15 every 21 days. Treatment will
      continue till disease progression or untolerable side effects

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have advanced unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
             Prior diagnosis of HCC could have been established histologically or based on one of
             the following criteria:

               -  Liver mass &gt; 2cm: Characteristic enhancement on at least one imaging
                  technique(triphasic CT scan, MRI, or contrast enhanced ultrasound) or AFP &gt; 200
                  ng/ml.

               -  Liver mass between 1 and 2 cm: Characteristic enhancement on two imaging
                  techniques.Diagnosis of HCC must have been confirmed by biopsy if
                  non-characteristic enhancement on imaging.

          2. All patients must have received exactly one prior systemic therapy (cytotoxic
             chemotherapy or targeted therapies) and must not be eligible for further locoregional
             treatment modalities.

          3. All patients must have measurable disease per RECIST criteria.

          4. Patients with previous locoregional therapies, including but not limited to
             radio-frequency ablation, cryoablation, percutaneous ethanol injection,
             chemo-embolization, hepatic artery embolization, and hepatic artery infused FUDR,
             stereotactic radiotherapy are eligible provided they have documented progression of
             their disease or have measurable extrahepatic disease.

          5. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2 (see Appendix B).
