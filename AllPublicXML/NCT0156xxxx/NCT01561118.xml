  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is considered essential for optimal health, development, socialization and
      well-being of children. However patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are often
      restricted from participation in exercise activities. This is especially true for children on
      hemodialysis (HD). As a consequence their exercise capacity is reduced, both before, but most
      impressively after HD. In a nationwide randomized, multi-center design this study aims to
      proof the influence of an individualised endurance training program by bicycle ergometer
      performed during dialysis on the efficacy of HD, measured as single pool Kt/V. Secondary
      goals are to enhance physical performance, physical and mental well-being, and to improve
      measurable blood and treatment parameters (e.g. haemoglobin level, amount of medication). A
      positive impact of physical activity was observed in adults on HD, although most studies did
      not address this issue in a randomised protocol. Despite this beneficial evidence in adults,
      sport is still not integrated as part of standard care in patients on maintenance HD. The
      study protocol, developed in close collaboration with the German Sport University Cologne,
      differs substantially from previously published reports as it uses bicycle ergometer training
      in an upright position outside the dialysis couch and adapts the intensity of intervention to
      the patient's capabilities. Based on the expected results the investigators will develop an
      individualised training program to be integrated in the standard care of (pediatric) patients
      on maintenance HD.

    <measure>Change of single pool Kt/V (KDOQI Guidelines) - expressed as the change of single pool Kt/V from week 0 to 12 of intervention (period 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change of single pool Kt/V (spKt/V) measured at week 12 (V1) compared to baseline (V0). Single pool Kt/V is the standard measure to assess dialysis efficacy. As dialysis efficacy is the primary aim of dialysis treatment and the spKt/V is the best way to measure efficacy this figure has an important clinical relevance for the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the possible workload (maximum physical performance) achieved</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The maximal possible workload will be determined by an exercise evaluation program with increasing power on a leg bicycle ergometer before a hemodialysis session, measuring the peak oxygen uptake (VO2-peak), heart rate, blood pressure and lactate levels during exercise.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>

    <description>For quality of life assessment the validated and standardized PedsQL® questionnaires will be filled in by patients and parents.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of solute removal during hemodialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Solute removal during hemodialysis has a clear impact on the patient's health and well-being, as it reduces sequelae and offers the patient less restrictions on their diet, which would lead to a better compliance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of solute removal in the two compartment model (assessed in a subgroup of patients)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Solute removal in the two compartment model will only be analyzed in patients 12 years of age or older with explicit consent to a second blood drawing 30 minutes after end of hemodialysis session. It was previously used showing a significant enhancement during exercise, explained by an increase of skeletal muscles perfusion during exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammation, nutritional status and bone metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The nutritional status and bone metabolism will be determined as they are important for optimal health and growth of paediatric hemodialysis patients. Evidence is based on studies that showed trends towards a better nutritional status and less chronic inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body Composition Monitoring (BCM)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body Cpomposition Monitoring (BCM) will be performed to exermine further information on nutrional status, overhydration and muscle growth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of number and dose of medication needed</measure>
    <time_frame>12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number and dose of medication will be recorded, changes will be evaluated, and data will be correlated to e.g. the measured blood pressure (antihypertensive drugs) or haemoglobin levels (EPO or EPO stimulating agents).</description>
