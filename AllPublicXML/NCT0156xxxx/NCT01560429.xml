  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative thoracotomy pain is normally managed with an epidural catheter and continuous
      epidural analgesia (CEA). However, for some surgical procedures, patient controlled epidural
      anesthesia (PCEA) is more effective but little research has compared the two methods
      following thoracotomy. The current randomized, prospective clinical investigation did just
      this. Following institutional ethics approval 52 patients scheduled for thoracotomy were
      recruited for this prospective, randomized, unblinded study. A thoracic epidural catheter was
      sited preoperatively. Postoperatively all patients were titrated on continuous epidural
      infusions (hydromorphone 10 mcg/mL + bupivacaine 1 mg/mL) until pain scores were stable at ≤3
      on a numeric rating scale (NRS). Then they were allocated to their preoperatively determined
      randomization (either remained on continuous epidural infusion or they were switched to
      receive 2/3 of the stabilized background dose via continuous epidural infusion with the
      option to self-administer the remaining 1/3rd of the dose via PCEA. Participants remained on
      their allocated analgesic regimens for 48 hours postoperatively. The primary outcome was
      consumption of local anaesthetics/opioids. The secondary outcomes were worst pain and pain
      while coughing (0-10 NRS).

            <description>An epidural catheter sited preoperatively so analgesics can be administered postoperatively. Patients were titrated on a continuous analgesic epidural infusion until stable pain scores of ≤ 3 were reached while in PACU. Once stable, they were allocated to their preoperatively determined randomization which meant they still received 2/3rd of the anesthetic as a background infusion but also had the option to self-administer the remaining 1/3rd dose as patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Rescue analgesia was available upon request.</description>

CEA infusion rates were set to achieve pain scores of ≤ 3 on a numeric rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10 while in PACU. Those allocated to the CEA group remained on the same continuous epidural infusion rate to which they were optimized.</description>
