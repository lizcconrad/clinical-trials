  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators wish to compare Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) kinetics
      in type 2 diabetic males and healthy males postabsorptive and during hyperinsulinemia. The
      kinetics is obtained using an ex-vivo VLDL1- and VLDL2-triglyceride labeling technique. The
      investigators hypothesis is that the investigators will find an increased VLDL1 production in
      type 2 diabetic males, which is not lowered by hyperinsulinemia. Also the investigators wish
      to investigate the influence of diet on VLDL1 and VLDL2 production in healthy males, where
      the investigators expect less variance in VLDL production when the subject is given an
      isocaloric diet.

      Patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to suffer from dyslipidemia. Earlier research
      has shown that these patients have an increased VLDL production and this could be a key
      factor in dyslipidemia development. Especially the production of VLDL1 seems to be increased
      where an inhibitory response to insulin is lacking. Further investigation in VLDL1 and VLDL2
      kinetics is required.

      The investigators wish:

        1. To extend the method of ex vivo labeling of VLDL-triglyceride, to include separate
           labeling of VLDL1- and VLDL2-triglyceride for evaluation of the separate lipoprotein
           subtype kinetics.

        2. To investigate VLDL1- and VLDL2-triglyceride kinetics in the post absorptive state and
           under experimental hyperinsulinemia in twelve type 2 diabetic males compared to twelve
           healthy age, sex, and BMI matched males.

        3. To investigate the effect of a three day isocaloric diet compared to a non-restricted
           diet on the day-to-day variation in VLDL1 and VLDL2-triglyceride kinetics in healthy
           men. The investigators here examine six subjects on two different days who ingest a
           non-restricted diet and compare this group to six subjects examined on two different
           days, who have prior ingest a three day isocaloric diet.

        The type 2 diabetic men will be recruited from the endocrinology ambulatory of Aarhus
        University hospital. The healthy subjects will be recruited by local advertisement in the
        city of Aarhus and by national website advertisement.
