      The main objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the driving capacities in a population of elderly subjects with early stage
           Alzheimer Disease (AD) in a real-life situation.

        -  Define a typology of the main errors made in this population.

        -  Propose adaptive measures or technological aids that would make it possible for these
           patients to maintain their ability to drive a car while limiting risk.
