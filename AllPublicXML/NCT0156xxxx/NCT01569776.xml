    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether a new amino acid-based
      formula is hypoallergenic as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2000),
      demonstrating that the test formula does not provoke allergenic activity in 90% of infants or
      children with confirmed cow's milk allergy (CMA) with 95% confidence as compared to a
      commercially available hypoallergenic formula.
