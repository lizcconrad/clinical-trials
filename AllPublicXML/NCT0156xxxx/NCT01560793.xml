    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VAX161B [STF2.HA5 H5N1], a
      recombinant, inactivated, subunit influenza vaccine given as a two dose regimen at a range of
      doses.

      The purpose of this study is to test an investigational vaccine known as &quot;VAX161B&quot;. VAX161B
      is a vaccine for the influenza A virus subtype H5N1 avian influenza virus (bird flu). In this
      study, the subject will receive the VAX161B vaccine at one of five doses to see which does
      might be the best. VaxInnate want to find out how safe these vaccines are and how well they
      are tolerated by people who receive them. To measure how effective each type of vaccine is,
      VaxInnate will test the ability of the body to develop an immune response, which means how
      well the body recognizes and defends itself against the influenza virus.

    <description>Assess safety, reactogenicity and tolerability. Symptoms will be collected from the memory aid and from the information collected at the clinic visits. All symptoms will be graded according to severity. Response to vaccine will be categorized as local (arm pain, redness, bruising, etc.) or systemic (headache, muscle aches, fatigue, etc.) symptoms. Laboratory tests such as CRP, WBC, LFTs and cytokines collected before and after vaccination will also be analyzed. We will compare the types and severity of symptoms and laboratory results based on vaccine dose.</description>
