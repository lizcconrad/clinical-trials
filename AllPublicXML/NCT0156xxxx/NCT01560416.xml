    <textblock>
      Ganetespib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. This drug has been used in
      other research studies and laboratory experiments. It has also been studied in phase I
      trials, where the appropriate dosing has been determined. Ganetespib is considered an &quot;HSP90
      inhibitor&quot;. By blocking HSP90, ganetespib is thought to reduce the ability of cancer cells to
      become resistant to treatment.

      Fulvestrant is a hormonal therapy that works by attaching to estrogen receptors. In doing so,
      it can block the effect of estrogen on cancer cells. In addition, fulvestrant causes a
      decrease in the number of estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is a drug that is approved by the
      FDA for treatment of metastatic, hormone receptor positive breast cancer, based upon the
      results of phase III clinical trials.

      In the laboratory, adding ganetespib to fulvestrant appears to improve its effectiveness. It
      is not known whether this is true in humans. In this research study, we are evaluating the
      effect of the addition of ganetespib to fulvestrant in participants with hormone
      receptor-positive, metastatic breast cancer.

      Because no one knows which of the study options is best, you will be &quot;randomized&quot; into one of
      the study groups: Arm A: Fulvestrant or Arm B: Fulvestrant plus Ganetespib. You will have a
      one-third chance of being placed in Arm A and a two-thirds chance of being placed in Arm B.

      If you are initially placed in Arm A but your disease progresses, you will have the option of
      receiving the combination of fulvestrant plus ganetespib as part of Arm C.

      You will undergo the following procedures during the research study: study drug(s), blood
      tests, clinical exams and scans/imaging tests.
