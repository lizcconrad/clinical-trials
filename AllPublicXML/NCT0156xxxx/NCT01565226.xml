      -  This will be an observational study. Respiratory data will be recorded using
           Capnostream20p. There will be no use in the recorded data for the medical care of the
           patients. Other clinical data will be captured in the CRF. Similar study is currently
           conducted in Bnai Zion MC since 2008. Thirty four (34) patients have been recruited
           without any adverse events.

        -  During the study the medical team will capture in the CRF the following: Blood gas and
           distal capnography values at time of sampling, ventilator settings at time of sampling.

        -  Changes made in the ventilation parameters, blood gas time and results, concomitant
           treatment (e.g. suction) and concomitant medication (respiratory related e.g.
           surfactant), vital signs all these will be retrieved from the patient's medical charts.

             Chih, Mexico)

          -  Neonates that their respiratory condition requires HFV
