      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of the Progressive Goal Attainment
      Program (PGAP) in improving employment outcomes and community engagement among U.S. veterans
      with disabilities.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with disabilities often have low self-esteem and motivation, significant depression
      and a belief that their disability precludes them from gainful employment. The Progressive
      Goal Attainment Program (PGAP) is specifically designed to target these psycho-social risk
      factors of disability. PGAP is a structured, 10-week intervention that focuses on helping
      clients develop a planned activity schedule to assist them in resuming desirable life
      activities, including employment. The PGAP for Veterans Project will test the feasibility of
      delivering PGAP to U.S. military veterans. The research will focus on the best means of
      service delivery, staffing needs and how to coordinate PGAP in a larger veteran service
      system. MDRC will also gather information on the target population, recruitment methods, the
      feasibility of scaling and replication, and employment outcomes among the sample. Two hundred
      veterans will be enrolled and randomly assigned into the study across two sites: Errera
      Community Care Center within (part of the VA Connecticut Health Care System) and the Michael
      DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston, Texas.

    <description>The Progressive Goal Attainment Program (PGAP) is a behavioral intervention originally developed in Canada at McGill University in order to increase return to work and community integration for individuals who receive worker's compensation. PGAP is the first disability program that is specifically designed to target the psycho-social risk factors of disability. The premise behind PGAP is that inactivity and attitudinal barriers increase work disability, and these issues are a primary cause of unemployment for individuals with physical and mental disabilities. PGAP is a structured, 10-week intervention that focuses upon helping clients develop a planned activity schedule to assist them in resuming desirable life activities.</description>
