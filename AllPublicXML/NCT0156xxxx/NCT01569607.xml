  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States but identification of treatment
      strategies to improve outcome is limited by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of
      recovery. Motor cortex (M1) reorganization plays a major-role in the recovery of motor
      deficits post-stroke; hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative
      strategies that utilize this potential for recovery.

      In Specific Aim 1, investigators will determine if repeated exposure to training combined
      with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances functional M1 reorganization in lesioned M1 of
      stroke patients.

      In Specific Aim 2, investigators will determine if repeated exposure to training combined
      with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances structural cortical reorganization in lesioned M1
      of stroke patients and to explore whether these structural changes are related to the
      training induced functional cortical reorganization.

      The overall goal of this project is to determine the effect of Hebbian- type stimulation on
      both, functional and structural brain reorganization, thereby obtaining indirect evidence for
      the neuronal substrate underlying training related improvement and maintenance of motor
      function in stroke patients. This knowledge may have a substantial positive impact on
      treatment for stroke patients that may significantly improve recovery and could move the
      field of neuro-rehabilitation forward.

      Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States but identification of treatment
      strategies to improve outcome is limited by the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of
      recovery. Motor cortex (M1) reorganization plays a major-role in the recovery of motor
      deficits post-stroke; hence the importance for further development of rehabilitative
      strategies that utilize this potential for recovery. Non-invasive cortical stimulation can
      enhance the beneficial effects of motor training on performance and functional plasticity of
      motor cortex. Among the different approaches used in these studies, Hebbian-type M1
      stimulation is particularly intriguing, as it seems to be more effective when compared to
      random M1 stimulation. There is emerging evidence that motor training or cortical stimulation
      related improvement of function are associated with increases in the grey matter of targeted
      brain areas. While there is therefore some evidence supporting structural reorganization in
      human M1 in response to motor learning and cortical stimulation, the mechanisms underlying
      these changes and their relationship to functional plasticity are not known. A better
      understanding of the sequences of events is critical to development of optimal therapeutic
      interventions to improve recovery following stroke.

      In Specific Aim 1, investigators will determine if repeated exposure to training combined
      with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances functional M1 reorganization in lesioned M1 of
      stroke patients.

      In Specific Aim 2, investigators will determine if repeated exposure to training combined
      with Hebbian-type M1 stimulation enhances structural cortical reorganization in lesioned M1
      of stroke patients and to explore whether these structural changes are related to the
      training induced functional cortical reorganization.

      both, functional and structural brain reorganization, thereby obtaining indirect evidence for

      function in stroke patients. This knowledge may have a substantial positive impact on

    <measure>Primary Motor Cortex (M1) Excitability Derived From Stimulus Response Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training 1 (1 Week), Post-Training 2 (4 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were measured prior to treatment (baseline), one week after the treatment (post-training 1), and 4 weeks after treatment (post-training 2).The MEP is elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at increased intensity. Its amplitude is measured from peak to peak and expressed in millivolts (mV). Measured MEP amplitudes were plotted against the intensity to create a stimulus response curve (SRC). Long-lasting increases in MEP amplitude indicate increases in motor cortex excitability and are associated with motor learning.</description>

    <measure>Mean Time to Completion for Jebsen Hand Function Test (JTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training (1 Week), Post-Training (4 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The JTT provides a standardized and objective evaluation of fine and gross motor hand function using simulated activities of daily living assessing the speed of performance. Total score is the sum of time taken for each sub-test, which were normalized to standard scores (also expressed in seconds).Total scores range from +1 to -1 where -1 indicates best function.</description>

    <measure>Mean Peak Acceleration of Wrist Extension Movements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training (1 Week), Post-Training (4 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean peak acceleration was measured at baseline, one week after the treatment (post-training 1), and four weeks after the treatment (post-training 2). Increases in the mean peak acceleration of the trained wrist extension movements indicate motor learning. Acceleration was measured in g; a symbol for the average acceleration produced by gravity at the Earth's surface.</description>

    <measure>Mean Reaction Time of Wrist Extension Movements</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training (1 Week), Post-Training (4 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to perform 7 auditory-cued ballistic wrist extensions before and after motor training. Electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded during the ballistic wrist extensions will be used to measure reaction time. Reaction time is the length of time between the auditory cue and the onset of the movement-related EMG burst of the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle. A longer time indicated longer time to reaction.</description>

    <measure>Mean Motor Activity Log (MAL) Score: Amount Subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training (1 Week), Post-Training (4 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to rate amount of movement during 30 daily functional tasks. Items are scored on a 0 to 6-point ordinal scale as follows:
0 = The weaker arm was not used at all for that activity (never)
1 = Occasionally used weaker arm, but only very rarely (very rarely)
2= Sometimes used weaker arm, but did the activity most of the time with stronger arm (rarely)
3 = Used weaker arm about half as much as before the stroke (half pre-stroke)
4 = Used weaker arm almost as much as before the stroke (3/4 pre-stroke)
5 = The ability to use the weaker arm for that activity was as good as before the stroke (normal)
Total scores range from 0 to 140; 0 indicating the least movement 140 indicating the most movement. The scores were converted into percentage scores where higher percent score indicate more movement and lower percent score less movement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Motor Activity Log (MAL): How Well Subtest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Post-Training (1 Week), Post-Training (4 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals are asked to rate quality of movement during 30 daily functional tasks. Items are scored on a 6-point ordinal scale as follows:
0=The weaker arm was not used at all for that activity (never); 1=The weaker arm was moved during that activity, but was not helpful (very poor); 2=The weaker arm was of some use during the activity, but needed help from the stronger arm or moved very slowly or with difficulty (poor); 3=The weaker arm was used for the purpose indicated, but movements were slow or were made with only some effort (fair); 4=The movements made by the weaker arm were almost normal, but were not quite as fast or accurate as normal (almost normal); 5=The ability to use the weaker arm for that activity was as good as before the stroke (normal)
Total scores range from 0 to 140; 0 indicating the least movement and 140 indicating the most movement.</description>

        <title>Primary Motor Cortex (M1) Excitability Derived From Stimulus Response Curve</title>
        <description>Motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes were measured prior to treatment (baseline), one week after the treatment (post-training 1), and 4 weeks after treatment (post-training 2).The MEP is elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at increased intensity. Its amplitude is measured from peak to peak and expressed in millivolts (mV). Measured MEP amplitudes were plotted against the intensity to create a stimulus response curve (SRC). Long-lasting increases in MEP amplitude indicate increases in motor cortex excitability and are associated with motor learning.</description>

        <description>Individuals are asked to rate amount of movement during 30 daily functional tasks. Items are scored on a 0 to 6-point ordinal scale as follows:
0 = The weaker arm was not used at all for that activity (never)
1 = Occasionally used weaker arm, but only very rarely (very rarely)
2= Sometimes used weaker arm, but did the activity most of the time with stronger arm (rarely)
3 = Used weaker arm about half as much as before the stroke (half pre-stroke)
4 = Used weaker arm almost as much as before the stroke (3/4 pre-stroke)
5 = The ability to use the weaker arm for that activity was as good as before the stroke (normal)
Total scores range from 0 to 140; 0 indicating the least movement 140 indicating the most movement. The scores were converted into percentage scores where higher percent score indicate more movement and lower percent score less movement.</description>
