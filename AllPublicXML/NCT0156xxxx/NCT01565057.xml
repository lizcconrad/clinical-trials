  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This comparative study is designed to compare the gastric layering and rates of emptying and
      by inference rates of digestion of two food emulsions. Two types of dairy based foods will be
      used, one which will sediment in the stomach and one that will not. On each of two study
      days, a total of 9 post drink MRI scans will be taken to assess gastric layering and
      emptying. Cannulation will allow blood samples to be taken periodically for subsequent
      analysis for the presence of specific digestion related hormones. A total volume of 36 ml of
      blood will be removed and volunteers will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at
      predetermined times to assess feelings of satiation.

    <description>To assess whether rates of gastric emptying of a specifically formulated emulsion drink are significantly different from a control drink and that this in turn leads to differences in satiation (cessation in the desire to eat) and satiety (desire to limit further food intake) as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) satiety questionnaire and blood CCK.</description>

    <intervention_name>sedimenting meal</intervention_name>
    <description>The active system quickly forms a sedimenting layer of small particles that contain most of the caloric content of the system. This system is made by adding finely grated cheese (particle size 0.5-2 mm) to yoghurt and consumption is followed by drinking 327 ml water.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  If attended a study during the previous four months where combined blood sampling from
             previous study and present study would exceed 470mL.
