  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients retain upper-limb motor impairment following stroke. Most conventional
      rehabilitation techniques are aimed to improve motor intentional movement by repeated
      exercises. These techniques require attentional load and are responsible for significant
      fatigue that probably represents a limiting factor. Alternatively, the automatic control of
      action is now well documented. A rehabilitation method based on this principle could allow
      recovery of more natural movements.

      Hypothesis: Stimulating automatic motricity improves upper-limb motor skills compared with a
      rehabilitation technique based on intentional movements.
