  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with malignant mesothelioma of the lung lining (called pleura) who
      are planning to have pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy.

      We are investigating whether giving a vaccine called TroVax® with pemetrexed-cisplatin
      chemotherapy is both safe and potentially beneficial in patients with mesothelioma. This
      vaccine has been used in combination with chemotherapy in other types of cancer and has been
      shown to be safe. Cancer vaccines work by stimulating the person's immune system to fight the
      disease, in a similar way to the immune system fighting infection. In laboratory experiments,
      the vaccine has been shown to stimulate an immune response to a particular protein widely
      found on mesothelioma cells called 5T4. In patients with mesothelioma it is hoped that the
      vaccine will stimulate the immune system to attack mesothelioma cells carrying the 5T4
      protein.

      Pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy is currently seen as the best treatment for patients with
      mesothelioma, and this is why we plan to combine it with the vaccine. It is hoped that the
      combination of the TroVax® vaccine and chemotherapy is more beneficial than chemotherapy
      alone.

      Pemetrexed-cisplatin will be given into a vein in the arm (intravenously) every 3 weeks. The
      TroVax® vaccine will be given as an injection into the shoulder muscle (intramuscularly) 3
      weeks before chemotherapy starts, one week before chemotherapy starts, then every 3 weeks.
      Each participant will receive 4 chemotherapy and 9 vaccine treatments if they complete the
      planned trial schedule. We aim to recruit 26 patients into the trial over a two year period.
      If this study shows that pemetrexed-cisplatin chemotherapy plus the TroVax® vaccine is safe
      and beneficial in terms of stimulating the immune system, the combination will be tested
      further in larger clinical trials.
