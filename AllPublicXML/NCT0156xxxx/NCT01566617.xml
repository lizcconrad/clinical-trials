  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that pharmaceutical care may constitute an important tool for
      the clinical management of these patients by improving their compliance to their treatment
      with consequent improvement in their quality of life by minimizing symptoms, and decreasing
      the number of hospital admissions and adverse drug reactions. Therefore, the aim of this
      trial is to evaluate the contribution of pharmaceutical care to clinical treatment of
      patients with Chagas heart disease complicated by heart failure.

      Study Type: Interventional

      Study Design: A total of 88 patients will be randomly assigned into two parallel groups: (1)
      group who will receive standard care and pharmaceutical care; and (2) group who will receive
      only standard care. Both groups will be subjected to a follow-up period of 12 months. The
      primary outcome of this trial is the evaluation of quality of life, measured by the 36-item
      short-form and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes
      include drug-related problems and exercise tolerance measured by the standard six-minute walk
      test.
