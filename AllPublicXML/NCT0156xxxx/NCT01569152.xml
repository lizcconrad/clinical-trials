    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-8457 + Methotrexate
      (MTX) in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite MTX therapy. The primary
      hypothesis is that at least 1 dose of MK-8457 + MTX will be superior to placebo + MTX as
      measured by the percentage of participants who achieve American College of Rheumatology 20
      (ACR 20) response after 12 weeks of treatment.

    <textblock>
      In Base Study Phase IIa, participants were to receive blinded MK-8457 100 mg or matched
      placebo for up to 24 weeks. At Week 12 and 18 of Phase IIa, efficacy evaluation was conducted
      to assess eligibility for early escape, defined as &lt;20% reduction in both tender and swollen
      joint counts. The study plan included Base Study Phase IIb in which dose range finding or
      dose-response was to be evaluated, depending on the outcome of Phase IIa. Participants who
      completed Phase IIa or Phase IIb and those eligible for early escape could enroll in Period
      3, a 2-year Safety Extension.

      All participants must have been treated with MTX for at least 3 months prior to screening and
      have been receiving a stable dose of MTX for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health-related quality of life instrument that consists of 8 multi-item scales: limitations in physical functioning due to health problems, limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general mental health (psychological distress and well-being), limitations in usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems, limitations in social functioning due to physical or mental health problems, vitality (energy and fatigue), and general health perception. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the greater the disability i.e., a score of 0 corresponds to maximum disability and a score of 100 corresponds to no disability.

        <description>ACR responses are numerical measurements of improvement in multiple disease assessment criteria. An ACR20 response is defined as a ≥20% improvement in 1) swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) (0 = Absent; 1 = Present) and 2) ≥20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: a) a participant’s overall assessment of pain on a visual analog scale (VAS, no pain =0 to extreme pain =100); b) Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (doing very well =0 to doing very poor =100); c) Investigator’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (doing very well =0 to doing very poor =100 ; d) participant’s assessment of function across 8 functional areas as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), total scores ranging from no difficulty =0 to inability to perform tasks =24; and e) serum C-Reactive Protein (decrease indicates improvement). This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Hybrid ACR Response at Week 12</title>
        <description>Hybrid ACR Response evaluates the improvement in active RA by combining elements of the ACR20/50/70 with a categorical score of the mean change in the core set measures (tender joint count, swollen joint count, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, disability index of the HAQ, and CRP). The mean percentage improvement from Baseline in the core set measures was computed and used with the participant's ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 status to determine the hybrid ACR response in a lookup table. The range of values was -100 to 100, with a positive change indicating improvement. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

The mean percentage improvement from Baseline in the core set measures was computed and used with the participant's ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 status to determine the hybrid ACR response in a lookup table. The range of values was -100 to 100, with a positive change indicating improvement. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <description>The DAS28-ESR is a continuous parameter based upon a statistically-derived index combining tender joints (28 joints, TEN28), swollen joints (28 joints, SW28), ESR, and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (GH). It is defined as follows: DAS28-ESR = 0.56 × SQRT(TEN28) + 0.28 × SQRT(SW28) + 0.70 × ln (ESR) + 0.014 × GH. SQRT = square root. The DAS28-ESR is a scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating greater RA disease activity. Depending upon the DAS28-ESR value for a given visit, change in DAS28-ESR is categorized as follows: No Response (reduction from Baseline ≤0.6), No response or Moderate Response (reduction &gt;0.6 - 1.2), and Moderate or Good Response (reduction &gt;1.2). The percentage of participants with a Moderate or Good change in DAS28-ESR was reported. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <title>DAS28-ESR Area Under the Curve (AUC)</title>
        <description>DAS28-ESR AUC was to be calculated from the DAS28-ESR score versus time curve, which provided an assessment of changes in disease activity over time. The DAS28-ESR AUC was to be calculated using the trapezoidal rule as the DAS28-ESR multiplied by the duration of the assessment period (in weeks) and was to be expressed as %-weeks. A higher calculated AUC value indicates higher disease activity (worse). This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <description>Swollen joint count included 66 joints (same joints as for tender joint count except this excluded evaluation of hips) that were assessed for the presence of swelling. Soft tissue swelling was considered to be present if there was palpable or visible evidence of capsular distention considered to be due to either synovial thickening and/or a joint effusion. Bony swelling, nodule formation, and joint deformity were excluded from consideration. A swollen joint was scored as 0 = Absent; 1 = Present for each joint.

        <description>The SF-36 is a health-related quality of life instrument that consists of 8 multi-item scales: limitations in physical functioning due to health problems, limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general mental health (psychological distress and well-being), limitations in usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems, limitations in social functioning due to physical or mental health problems, vitality (energy and fatigue), and general health perception. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the greater the disability i.e., a score of 0 corresponds to maximum disability and a score of 100 corresponds to no disability. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <description>The FACIT-F is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). The higher the participant's response to the questions the greater the participant's fatigue. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>

        <description>The functional status of the participant was assessed using the Disability Index of the HAQ on a Likert scale. This 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The overall score for the Disability Index is the mean of the 8 functional area scores and also ranges from 0 to 3, with a lower score indicating less disability. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement. This outcome measure applied to Base Study participants only.</description>
