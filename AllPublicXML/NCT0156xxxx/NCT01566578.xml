  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in EGFR density in epidermis of psoriasis lesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 66</time_frame>
    <description>Punch biopsies of the treated psoriasis lesion will be performed before study treatment start (day 7) and at the end of the treatment, which is on day 66.
EGFR immunohistochemistry will be performed with a murine antibody directed against the extracellular domain of human EGFR. A pathologist blinded to the patient's characteristics and treatment modalities assesses the immunohistochemistry staining in three epidermal layers. A score ranging form 0 (no staining) to 3 (intense staining) is applied, resulting in a total score ranging form 0 (3x0) to 9 (3x3).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change to baseline in target lesion severity score (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 80</time_frame>
    <description>A blinded dermatologist assesses the treated psoriasis plaque clinically using the lesion assessment part of the PASI score, assessing 3 qualities (thicknes, redness and scaling) of the lesion. Score ranges from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe), resulting in a total score of 0 to 12 (3 x 4)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change to baseline in histological feature: thickness of the epidermis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 66</time_frame>
    <description>Punch biopsies of the treated psoriasis lesion will be performed before study treatment start (day 7) and at the end of the treatment on day 66.
A pathologist blinded to the patient's characteristics and treatment modalities assesses the following histological features: thicknes of the epidermis, acanthosis and epidermal/dermal lymphocytic infiltrates. Each characteristic is scored as follows: 0 = normal, + = mild, and ++ = marked.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 80</time_frame>
    <description>At every visit the patients are asked about the occurence of adverse events. The last visit is on day 80. All adverse events will be recorded in the crf.</description>
