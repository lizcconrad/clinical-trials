  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study, through a randomized controlled design, will evaluate the effectiveness of
      peer support, as compared to usual care and to an equivalent amount of support offered by
      peer case managers and non-peer recovery mentors, in reducing hospital days and readmissions
      and in promoting recovery and community inclusion among adults with mental illnesses with
      histories of multiple hospitalizations. The current study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of
      adding peer support to the array of services available to persons with serious mental
      illnesses who have histories of multiple hospitalizations and will test a theoretical model
      of the active ingredients of peer support, focusing specifically on the roles of 1)
      instillation of hope through positive self-disclosure; 2) role modeling of self-care and
      exploring new ways of using experiential knowledge; and 3) a trusting relationship
      characterized by acceptance, understanding, and empathy with conditional regard.
