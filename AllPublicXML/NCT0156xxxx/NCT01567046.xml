    <textblock>
      This research trial studies genes in tissue samples from younger and adolescent patients with
      soft tissue sarcomas. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer

      Study Subtype: Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective:
      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Existing NRSTS samples from the COG D9902/ARST0332 studies Sampling
      Method: Non-Probability Sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency with which actionable mutations are found in archived
      non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (NRSTS) tumor specimens using mass spectrometry (MS)
      analysis of tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Archived DNA tissue samples are analyzed for frequency of genetic mutations, including single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and small deletions
      and/or insertions, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and mass spectometry (Sequenom
      MassARRAY). Results are then analyzed to determine whether specific mutations correlate with
      patient or disease features such as tumor stage, histological grade, or outcome.
