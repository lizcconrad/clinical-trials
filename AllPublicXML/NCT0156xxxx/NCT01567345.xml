      The aim of this study is to compare intrathecal morphine administration: using a pump with
      continuous or programmable flow.

    <textblock>
      Cancer is frequently associated with pain. In spite of recent improvements in cancer related
      pain treatment, incidence of cancerous chronic pain did not decrease. Indeed, 15 to 20% of
      patients are still suffering from intractable pain despite an optimal symptom management.

      Treatment of cancer pain is generally based on the WHO analgesic ladder according to 3 steps.
      Patients with advanced cancer are often treated at WHO step 3 analgesics, i.e. morphine and
      its derivatives, at high dosages. But increasing the dosage of opioids also leads to
      accentuation of their adverse events and the corresponding risks.

      At this stage of the disease, in patients with failure of conventional analgesic therapy,
      intrathecal injection of analgesics can be decided in order to relieve pain. 2 types of pumps
      allow intrathecal morphine administration : continuous or programmable flow. In this study,
      we want to compare the quality of analgesia obtained through these 2 flows.

    <time_frame>At 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed every day by patient using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS. VAS scores will be compared between 2 groups(continuous or programmable flow). We want to demonstrate the superiority of intrathecal analgesia obtained through programmable flow compared to continuous flow.</description>

    <time_frame>at 3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Using Visual Analog Scale's score, we want to demonstrate the superiority of intrathecal analgesia compared to previous treatment (pain is assessed through VAS within 4 days before inclusion).</description>

    <measure>Adverse Events assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>every month</time_frame>
    <description>We want to demonstrate a reduction of adverse events related to intrathecal analgesia compared to the previous treatment and to compare the two delivery systems.
Adverse events due to morphine (6 types) will be scored according to 4 levels, then the sum of these scores will constitute an adverse event severity index ranging from 0 to 18. This index will be compared between the 2 arms and will also be compared to baseline values before introduction of intrathecal analgesia.</description>
