  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of integrated airway in nasal packing
      material foe patients receiving nasal septoplasty surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasal packing with integrated airway had been claimed to improve body oxygenation following
      septal surgery. This randomized control study examined the effect of airway integrated with
      nasal packing, in terms of its improvement on oxygen saturation. Sixty patients with septal
      deviation and hypertrophic turbinate were randomized into three groups. Group 1 patients were
      packed with only nasopore@ after surgery. Nasopore@ with integrated airway was used for group
      2 patients; and Vaseline gauze integrated with airway for group 3 patients. Hemodynamic
      parameters were sequentially checked. Nasal pain sensation was recorded using visual analog
      scale.
