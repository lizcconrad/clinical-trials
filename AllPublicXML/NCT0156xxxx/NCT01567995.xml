  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, two treatment arms, vehicle (cream base)
      -controlled, parallel-group study in subjects with moderate to severe eczema (defined by
      investigators global assessment (IGA) score greater than or equal to 3).

      Subjects were screened within 3 days prior to randomization. At the screen visit, subjects
      gave informed consent and were then assessed for health status and eligibility for inclusion
      in the study. At the baseline visit, subject eligibility was assessed for randomization (Day
      0). Eligible subjects were randomised to Clobetasone Butyrate 0.05% Cream group or vehicle
      (cream base) group at the rate of 1:1. During the treatment phase, subjects returned to the
      sites in day 7 post-baseline visit for assessment of their disease status and eligibility to
      continue on the study. During the final visit, 14 days after the baseline, subjects returned
      to the study sites for assessment of their disease status before completing the study. In
      addition, the safety and tolerability of Clobetasone Butyrate 0.05% cream were also assessed
      through the whole trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators assessed presence and severity of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification in four body areas using EASI: head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs. Investigators assigned a severity score from 0 - 3 for each area (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, and severe=3). Investigators also assigned an area score from 0 (no eruption) to 6 (&gt;90-100% eruption) for each area. The weighting factor was 0.1 for head/neck, 0.2 for upper limbs, 0.3 for trunk, and 0.4 for lower limbs. The total body score for each body region was obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores of the four key signs by the area score, then multiplying the result by the constant weighted value assigned to that body region. The sum of these scores gave the EASI total, ranging from 0 to 72. A higher score represented greater disease severity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators assessed presence and severity of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification in four body areas using EASI: head/neck, upper limbs, trunk, and lower limbs. Investigators assigned a severity score from 0 - 3 for each area (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, and severe=3). Investigators also assigned an area score from 0 (no eruption) to 6 (&gt;90-100% eruption) for each area. The weighting factor was 0.1 for head/neck, 0.2 for upper limbs, 0.3 for trunk, and 0.4 for lower limbs. The total body score for each body region was obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores of the four key signs by the area score, then multiplying the result by the constant weighted value assigned to that body region.

    <measure>Reduction Percentage of Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score after 7 day of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator assessed surface &amp; severity of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation &amp; lichenification in four body areas using EASI: head/neck, upper extremities, trunk &amp; lower extremities. Investigators assigned a severity score (0-3) for each area (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3). Investigators also assigned an area score from 0 (no eruption) to 6 (&gt;90-100% eruption) for each area. Weighting factor was 0.1 for head/neck, 0.2 for upper extremities, 0.3 for trunk &amp; 0.4 for lower extremities. Total body score for each body region was obtained by multiplying sum of severity scores by area score, then multiplying result by constant weighted value assigned to that body region. Sum of these scores gave EASI total, ranging from 0 to 72. Reduction percentage of score was calculated as: (sum of score after day 7 minus sum of score at baseline) *100/sum of score after day 7. Lesser negative reduction percentage lesser severity of disease, more effectiveness of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Investigators Global Assessment (IGA) graded score at Day 7 and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA was used to determine disease severity in a given time and describe severity of eczema using scale of 0 to 6 as follows: 0 Clear:=No inflammatory signs of eczema; 1 Almost clear=Just perceptible erythema and just perceptible papulation/infiltration; 2 Mild:=Mild erythema and mild papulation/infiltration; 3 Moderate:=Moderate erythema, and moderate papulation/infiltration; 4 Severe= Severe erythema, and severe papulation/infiltration; 5 Very Severe=Very severe erythema, and very severe papulation/infiltration with oozing/crusting. Lesser score indicate lesser disease severity.</description>

    <measure>Changes from baseline in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Day 7 and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed the degree of their pruritus using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS; 0mm=No itch, 100mm=maximum itch) at Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14. Higher pruritus/itch VAS score indicating more severe pruritus/itching.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with participants-based assessment score of disease control at Day 7 and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's assessment score is a semi-quantitative score intended to reflect the participants own evaluation of disease control. It consisted of a four-point scale ranging from complete disease control (0) to uncontrolled disease (3): 0 - Complete disease control; 1 - Good disease control; 2 - Limited disease control; 3 - Uncontrolled disease. Lesser score indicate better disease control.</description>
