    <textblock>
      Cabergoline prevents ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in high risk patients by disrupting
      follicular fluid hormone microenvironmentally altering the follicular fluid levels of insulin
      like growth hormone -I (IGF-I), antimullerian hormone (AMH), inhibin B and hepatocyte growth
      factor (HGF) levels in women with PCOS and high risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
      (OHSS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dopamine agonists have been proposed as a prophylactic treatment for OHSS in women with high
      risk of OHSS, however the possible mechanism of action has not been clearly known. In
      experimental studies, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor based pathway was
      proposed as a possible action of mechanism of dopamine agonists. However the role hepatocyte
      growth factor (HGF), insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I), inhibin B and antimullerian
      hormone (AMH) on cabergoline action in OHSS prevention has not been known.
