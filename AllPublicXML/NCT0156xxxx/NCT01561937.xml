  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this trial is to
      evaluate the efficacy of activated recombinant human factor VII to mitigate
      experimentally-induced bleeding in healthy volunteers treated with warfarin to reach a
      targeted INR (International Normalization Ratio).
