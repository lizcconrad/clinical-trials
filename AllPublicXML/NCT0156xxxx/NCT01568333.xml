  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decitabine has been reported to have a clinically significant, often long lasting effect on
      the platelet count in myelodysplastic syndromes(MDS). It is also reported that decitabine
      could increase platelet counts by enhancing megakaryocyte maturation and platelet release.
      Immune thrombocytopenia(ITP) is known as an immune-mediated acquired disease characterized by
      transient or persistent decrease of the platelet count. However, refractory ITP is lacking of
      effective treatments and the efficacy of decitabine in ITP remains poorly understood. Data
      from this study may provide some idea of decitabine in the treatment of ITP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a multicenter, single-arm study of 30 primary ITP adult
      patients from 5 medical centers in China. All the participants are selected to receive
      low-dose of decitabine treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 3.5mg/m2 for 3 days).
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  failure to achieve at least Response

          -  need of treatment(s) (including, but not limited to, low dose of corticosteroids) to
             minimize the risk of clinically significant bleeding. Need of on-demand or adjunctive
             therapy alone does not qualify the patient as refractory

          -  primary ITP confirmed by excluding other supervened causes of thrombocytopenia
