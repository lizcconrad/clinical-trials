      The aims of the study are to investigate

        1. the effects of an intervention vs. control on levels of glycosylated haemoglobin
           (haemoglobin A1c) in Hispanic participants, older than 18 years, who have elevated hA1c
           at baseline (&gt;6.0%). Glycosylated haemoglobin provides an indication of blood sugar
           levels over the past 3 months. Elevated hA1c levels are seen in diabetics and
           pre-diabetics.

        2. the effects of the intervention vs control on consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables

        3. the effects of the intervention vs control on levels of physical activity
