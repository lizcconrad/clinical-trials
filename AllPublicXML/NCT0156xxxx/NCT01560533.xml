    <textblock>
      The project aims to understand better how patients live the event of cancer and live its
      consequences on their bodily representations. In the study, the dynamic of the body image is
      not restricted to appearance but include sensations and visions of the inner body, what
      explains the choice of peritoneal cancer, and the treatment by cytoreductive surgery and
      HIPEC.

      The three objectives of the study are:

        -  identifying the impact of the representations of the treated body on the psychological
           strategies to cope with the disease, the bodily changes and the prospects of life;

        -  making explicit the positive or negative impacts of these representations on the
           relationship between patients and health professionals (easing factors,
           misunderstandings, negotiations, etc.);

        -  associating the health professionals with the study in its course and evaluation in
           order to elaborate a methodological collaborative approach between patients, health
           professionals and researchers in social sciences.
