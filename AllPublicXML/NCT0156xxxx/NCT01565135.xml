  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a multimodal immunization program carried out in
      obstetrics and gynecology (ob/gyn) practices would be more effective in improving ob/gyn
      patients' immunization rates, specifically for Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis), HPV
      (Human papilloma virus), and influenza vaccines, than the usual care provided to patients in
      ob/gyn practices.

    <description>The percent of patients who report one or more individuals who are/will be in frequent contact with their infant having received Tdap vaccine will be assessed during Feb/March 2013 and Feb/March 2014. These data will be collected in patients of both intervention and control settings via on-line survey and be administered to patients who volunteer to take the survey.</description>

    <description>Efforts will be made to collaborate with private ob/gyn offices to develop a multimodal intervention to improve patients'immunization rates. As part of the overall intervention, intervention practices will agree to 1) purchase, stock, and administer influenza, HPV, and Tdap vaccines, if not already doing so and 2) track patients' vaccination status. In addition, intervention strategies adopted by intervention settings to improve immunization rates may include:
Patient education regarding the importance of vaccination, including encouragement of vaccination for family members
Practice-based reminder/recall
Seek to decrease missed opportunities for immunization by using either or both of the following: provider prompts and/or provider education and feedback</description>
