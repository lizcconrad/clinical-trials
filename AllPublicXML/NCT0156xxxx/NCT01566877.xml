    <description>AVI-7288 is a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer with positive charges (PMOplusâ„¢) that targets Marburg virus nucleoprotein (NP). AVI-7288 is supplied in 5 mL vials containing 5 mL AVI-7288 at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. The dose levels of AVI-7288 will vary in four cohort's.</description>

The amount of AVI-7288 required to administer the required dose will be diluted to a volume of approximately 150 mL with normal saline solution (NSS) and given by IV infusion over 30 minutes once a day for 14 days. Infusions will be administered at approximately the same time each day.</description>
