    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the hypotheses that incentives can increase both participation
      in smoking cessation treatment and resulting cessation rates, when they are offered to
      Medicaid BadgerCare Plus pregnant smokers.

      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which contingent financial &quot;treatment incentives&quot; (i.e.,
      incentives for biochemical verification visits, treatment engagement, and abstinence) versus
      &quot;attendance incentives&quot; (i.e., incentives for only attending the biochemical verification
      visits), increase rates of prenatal and postnatal smoking abstinence. Participants will be
      BadgerCare Plus members who are recruited into the First Breath program while pregnant.

      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which treatment incentives, versus attendance incentives,
      increase rates of engagement in First Breath smoking cessation intervention when offered to
      pregnant and postpartum BadgerCare Plus members.

      Aim 3: To determine the cost‚Äêeffectiveness and reach of the First Breath intervention
      delivered to pregnant and postpartum smokers when it is paired with treatment incentives and
      when paired with only attendance incentives.

      Aim 4: To determine if the First Breath intervention with treatment incentives, in comparison
      to that intervention with only attendance incentives, produces significantly greater benefits
      in pregnant and postpartum women with regards to nonsmoking health outcomes: i.e., reduced
      depression, increased levels of breast feeding, and greater perceived support.

      Aim 5: To identify moderating and mediating effects of treatment incentives when offered in
      the context of the First Breath intervention delivered to pregnant and postpartum women.
