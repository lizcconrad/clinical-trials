      In Sickle cell disease children, sleep respiratory abnormalities are risk factors for
      vaso-occlusive complications, as well as cerebral vasculopathy.

      A 18 months follow-up children with sickle cell disease evaluating sleep respiratory problems
      frequency and etiology, as well as their influence on sickle cell disease complications.

      -  Inclusion visit with physical examination. A 2.9 ml blood sample will be necessary, if
           not done within the framework of care within 6 months for: CBC (Cell Blood Count),
           reticulocytes counts (1.2 ml of blood), liver enzymes, electrolytes, urea, creatininemia
           (1,2 ml of blood) and fetal hemoglobin (0.5 ml of blood). - A complete standardized
           examination including nasopharynx endoscopy, if not yet done in usual care, to
           identified upper airway obstruction

        -  A standardized pneumology evaluation to identified obstructive lung symptomatology

        -  An ambulatory polysomnography will be performed within days following inclusion, during
           sleep and will allow electroencephalogram recording, oculomotricity, muscles (mentalis
           muscles and tibialis anterior) movements, electrocardiogram and respiratory activity
           recording.

      The steering committee will classify the children in three populations based on their exam
      results:

        -  Group 1: no abnormality in polysomnography

        -  Group 2: obstructive sleep-related disorder

        -  Group 3: isolated sleep hypoxemia for group3, patients will have a new ambulatory
           polysomnography.

        The objective of this study is to provide an early curative treatment for homozygous sickle
        cell children in age group of 2 to 6 years based on the anomalies identified in
        polysomnography. The choice of the age of 2 to 6 is linked to the peak risk of onset of
        cerebrovascular occlusive complications in this age
