      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of alisertib when given
      together with vorinostat in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma, or peripheral T-cell lymphoma that has come back. Alisertib and vorinostat may stop
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in
      combination with vorinostat and to select a dose and schedule for further testing
      (recommended Phase 2 dose: RP2D) in patients with lymphoid malignancies.

      II. To describe the toxicities of MLN8237 when given in combination with vorinostat on a
      21-day schedule.

      III. To determine any clinical responses with MLN8237 in combination with vorinostat.

      IV. To compare the plasma pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 when given alone and in combination
      with vorinostat.

      V. To perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
      analysis to determine aurora kinase A (AURKA) expression in archival formalin-fixed
      paraffin-embedded sections from the most recent available tumor specimens of patients.

      VI. To perform correlative studies for apoptosis and proliferation on bone marrow and lymph
      node specimens, where available, obtained from patients in the expanded cohort at RP2D.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 or days 1-3 and 8-10,
      and vorinostat PO BID on days 1-14 or days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.
