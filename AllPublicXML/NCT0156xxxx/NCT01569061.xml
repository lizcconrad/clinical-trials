    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of
      transvaginally-delivered low level laser therapy (LLLT) versus Sham in the treatment of
      overactive bladder symptoms in women. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of
      transvaginally-delivered LLLT vs. sham on the quality of life.

    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, multicenter, clinical trial that
      will include enrollment of up to 200 subjects at up to 3 investigational sites.

      The study population will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two groups: Sham Laser Group
      (SLG) and Active Laser Group (ALG). The Sham Laser Group will receive a sham LLLT procedure
      (no laser energy) and the Active Laser Group will receive an active LLLT procedure (laser
      energy).

      Both groups will undergo 3 LLLT procedures per week for 3 weeks, for a total of 9 LLLT
      procedures. Whether the procedure will be a sham procedure (placebo) or an active LLLT
      application will be determined by randomization which will assign subjects to be treated with
      an LCT-1000TM labeled either Laser A or Laser B. The only difference between Laser A and
      Laser B is that one does not emit laser energy; therefore, both subjects and site research
      personnel will be blinded as to whether laser energy is actually applied to the subject.
