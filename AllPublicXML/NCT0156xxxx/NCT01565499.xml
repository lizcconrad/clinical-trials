    <textblock>
      Study GEICAM 2011-02 is a multicenter, open label, non-randomized phase 2 trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant treatment of ER positive HER2
      negative patients amenable to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The primary objetive of the trial is to determine the percentage of patients with poor
      response [residual cancer burden III (RCB-III) rate] in contrast to good response [residual
      cancer burden 0/I RCB-0/1] measured by the Symmans criteria [20] at surgery, in patients with
      stage II-III luminal breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the residual cancer burden grade III
      (RCB-III) after surgery.

      The total number of patients to be included in this study is 78 patients.

      The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be
      approximately 90 months (Including follow-ups)

    <time_frame>Death or up to 5 years whatever occurs first for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>Invasive Disease Free Survival will be evaluated. It is defined as the time (days)from the date of randomization until the date of objective recurrent disease (local, regional or distant), second primary invasive malignancy (breast or non-breast) or death from any cause. For patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have recurrent disease or second primary tumor, invasive disease-free survival will be censored at the last contact date. DCIS will not be considered an event for the purpose of this analysis, but will be collected in the e-CRF.</description>

    <description>Incidence of adverse events by maximum CTCAE grade (v4.03; NCI 2010) that occur during the study treatment period or within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment, regardless of causality and according to the relationship to study drug as assessed by the investigator, will be collected and evaluated. Additionally, the following safety-related outcomes will be summarized:
study treatment discontinuations due to adverse events.
