    <textblock>
      Using to method of Proteomics, for aims to conquer intractable disease, try to access variety
      experiment. Biomarker is necessary to develop new diagnosis method and target of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following Seoul National University Hospital Institutional Review Board approval, obtain
      serum and platelet with neurodegeneration patients and control group visited the part of
      neurology, there'll be analysis to differentiate each other diseases use to method
      Proteomics. Biomarker will be screening via 1D/2D analysis, Mass analysis, database
      searching- the MASCOT search tool, SWISS-PROT and etc.
