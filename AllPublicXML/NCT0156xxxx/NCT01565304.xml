      in group foster care homes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth in foster care are at especially high risk for teen pregnancy and associated sexual
      risk behaviors. The POWER Through Choices (PTC) program is a 10-session sexuality curriculum
      that aims to increase contraceptive use and delay sexual initiation by empowering youth to
      make healthy, positive choices about their sexual behaviors. This study uses a cluster
      randomized design to compare the effectiveness of PTC to usual programs and services provided
      to youth living in group foster care homes. Study participants will be youth living in group
      foster homes recruited in four locations: Kern County, CA; Cook County, IL; Baltimore County,
      MD; and Oklahoma (statewide). The study is being conducted as part of the national Evaluation
      of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Approaches funded by the Office of Adolescent Health in
      the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
