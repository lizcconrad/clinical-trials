  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to examine the effect of a high protein intake (from soy or whey protein)
      on weightmaintenance after weight loss in a group of predisposed (severe) obese persons.
      Furthermore, to examine short-term and long-term effect of a high protein intake on appetite
      regulation and diet induced thermogenese (DIT). Finally to examine the effect of calcium on
      weightmaintence, bloodlipid profilen, appetite regulation and DIT.

      The study is a parallel RCT with a weight loss (WL) period (8 weeks on very low calorie diet)
      and a weightmaintence (WM) period (24 weeks daily intake of supplement). 200 overweight/obese
      subjects will be enrolled into the study and randomized to placebo (maltodextrin), soy
      protein, whey protein or calcium enriched whey protein supplement. At baseline (week 0),
      after the WL period (week 8) and after WM period (week 24) body weight and composition will
      be measured and blood samples will be collected. Meal test will be performed at week 0 and 24
      (examining both appetite regulation and DIT). Urine and feces will be collected three times
      during the study. Subjects will receive dietary counseling (in groups) regularly during the
      study and body weight will be measured at each visit.
