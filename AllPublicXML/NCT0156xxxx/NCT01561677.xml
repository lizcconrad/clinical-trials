    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) is associated with stroke as a risk factor but little
      is known about the consequences of OSAS on the outcome and the survival after stroke. The aim
      of the investigators study is first to evaluate the outcome and the survival of patients with
      stroke depending of OSAS (presence and severity of OSAS) and second to compare the outcome
      and survival of patients with severe OSAS depending on the treatment of the syndrome with
      nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure. The investigators hypothesis is that OSAS is
      associated with worst survival and outcome and needs to be treated at the subacute phase of
      stroke.

      Objective : The aim of our study is to evaluate the consequences of obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome on the functional outcome and the survival after an ischemic stroke and to measure
      the impact of the treatment with continuous positive airway pressure on the outcome of
      patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.Patients and methods : We will
      prospectively explore by polysomnography, 300 consecutive patients hospitalized for an
      ischemic stroke in the stroke units of university hospitals at the sub acute phase after
      stroke (J15±4). 1) We will compare the functional outcome, the neurological impairment, the
      peripheral endothelial function, the continuous blood pressure measure on 24 hours recording,
      the quality of life and the survival at 3, 6 and 12 months in four groups of patients
      depending on their apnea/hypopnea index 2) In patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome, we will explore the impact on the functional outcome, the neurological impairment,
      and the survival at 3, 6 et 12 months of a treatment with continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP) randomly compared to a treatment with sham CPAP (non efficacious pressure) during 3
      months. Conclusion : This study should allow us to evaluate the consequences of obstructive
      sleep apnea syndrome on the outcome and the survival after ischemic stroke and the impact and
      the tolerance of the treatment with continuous positive airway pressure in patients with
      severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
