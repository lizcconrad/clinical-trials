        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects must be of non-child bearing potential, defined as postmenopausal
             women with no regular menstrual bleeding for at least 1 year prior to screening or
             female subjects surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to screening. All female
             subjects must have negative pregnancy results at screening.

          2. Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body
             mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 to 30 kg/m2

          3. Vital signs after 3 minutes resting in the supine position (laying down) should be
             within the following ranges:

               -  Oral body temperature between 35.0-37.8ºC

               -  Systolic blood pressure, 95-140 mmHg

               -  Diastolic blood pressure, 60-90 mmHg Blood pressure and pulse will be taken again
                  in the standing position. After 3 minutes standing, there shall be no more than a
                  20 mm Hg drop in systolic or 10 mmHg drop in diastolic blood pressure associated
                  with symptomatic postural hypotension.

          4. Subjects must be able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and
             comply with the requirements of the study. Subjects must be able to understand and
             sign the written informed consent.

          5. Health subjects must be in good health as determined by past medical history, physical
             examination, vital signed assessments, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at
             screening.

          8. Recent (within the last 3 years) and/or recurrent history/presence of autonomic
             dysfunction (e.g., recurrent episodes of fainting, palpitations, etc).

          9. Recent (within the last 3 years) and/or recurrent history/presence of acute or chronic
             bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             treated or not treated).

         10. Significant drug allergy or history of atopic allergy (asthma, urticaria, eczematous
             dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to aliskiren.

         11. Total white blood cell (WBC) count outside the normal laboratory reference range.

         12. History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
             blot) test result.

         13. A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or Hepatitis C test result.

         14. History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing, or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening on Day
             -1 of each treatment period.

         15. Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within 14 days prior to dosing.

         16. Lactating and breastfeeding females.

         17. History of head and neck angioedema.

         18. Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to initial dosing.
