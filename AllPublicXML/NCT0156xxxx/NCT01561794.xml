  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and the
      relationship between PK and pharmacodynamics (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration [MIC] and
      Mutant Prevention Concentration [MPC]) of intravenous BAYQ3939 (400 mg BID and 400 mg TID) in
      hospitalized patients with bacterial pneumonia or secondary infection of chronic respiratory
      disease with severe disease or a poor response to other antimicrobials. In addition, the
      efficacy of the ciprofloxacin, in terms of clinical response and microbiological response,
      will be investigated, but as a secondary endpoint.
