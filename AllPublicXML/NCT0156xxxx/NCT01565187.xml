    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter study utilizing standardized instruments for the psychological
      assessment of hand transplant candidates pre and post-transplant as well as those candidates
      excluded for transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The semi-structured psychological interview describes the assessment of significant
      psychosocial characteristics and it is based on the psychosocial domains of the &quot;Transplant
      Evaluation Rating Scale (TERS)&quot; by Twillman and colleagues for evaluating organ transplant
      candidates. The interview guide was developed as a tool to guide clinicians through the
      interview process for hand transplant candidates. The protocol highlights issues that are
      specific for reconstructive hand transplantation and give clinicians an immediate
      understanding of what type of information is necessary to conduct a comprehensive
      psychosocial assessment.

      Additionally, the psychological assessment provides standardized psychological screening
      procedures and continuous follow-up ratings by psychometrical testing. The test battery will
      be performed at the time of initial psychosocial assessment, immediately after transplant, at
      six and twelve months for the transplant candidates and at initial evaluation, six and twelve
      months for candidates excluded for transplant.
