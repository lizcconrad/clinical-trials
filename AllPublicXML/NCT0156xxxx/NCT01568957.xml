  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community ambulation is a highly complex skill requiring the ability to adapt to increased
      environmental complexity and perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Deficits in dual-tasking
      may severely compromise the ability to participate fully in community living. Unfortunately,
      current rehabilitation practice for stroke fails to adequately address dual-task limitations;
      individuals with stroke continue to exhibit clinically significant dual-task costs on gait at
      discharge. As a result, many stroke survivors are living in the community with residual
      deficits that may increase disability in the real world and lead to falls with devastating
      consequences. To address this issue, the proposed study investigates the efficacy of
      dual-task gait training on attention allocation and locomotor performance in
      community-dwelling stroke survivors. Because walking in the real world often requires
      time-critical tasks and obstacle avoidance, the investigators will test the impact of
      dual-task gait training on cognitive-motor interference during walking at preferred speed and
      at maximal speed (Aim 1), and on locomotor control during obstacle negotiation (Aim 2). The
      investigators will also evaluate the effects of the intervention on community reintegration
      and participation (Aim 3).
