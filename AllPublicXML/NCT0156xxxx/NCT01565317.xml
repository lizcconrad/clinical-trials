    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the impact of improving diabetes control through
      weight reduction and lifestyle changes on a common diabetes complication called peripheral
      neuropathy.

    <description>Weight Achievement and Intensive Treatment (Why WAIT) is a 12 -week multidisciplinary program for weight control and intensive diabetes management designed by the Joslin Diabetes Center for application in a multidisciplinary diabetes practice environment. Participants will be enrolled in a 12-week multidisciplinary intensive weight management including diet, exercise, behavioral and educational support. Participants will be enrolled in cohorts of 10-15 participants to encourage group interaction and support. Subjects will choose to come to the Joslin clinic every Tuesday or Wednesday evening for 2 hours. Participants will exercise for an hour and will attend a didactic session in the areas of nutrition, exercise and behavioral modifications.</description>
