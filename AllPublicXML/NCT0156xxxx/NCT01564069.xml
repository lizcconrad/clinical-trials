      Our hypothesis is that patients with intrathecal delivery systems for chronic non-cancer pain
      will report no improvement treatment efficacy when compared to patients with chronic pain
      managed with oral or systemic opioid therapies. Our secondary hypothesis is that patients
      with intrathecal delivery systems for chronic non-cancer pain will report no improvement in
      treatment efficacy when compared to patients with chronic pain who are managed with
      non-opioid therapies.
