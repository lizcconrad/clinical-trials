      The hypothesis is that home based clinical rehabilitation (CR) is less expensive than
      hospital based CR with similar clinical effectiveness. The investigators will compare the
      results of two forms of CR on

        1. direct and indirect healthcare costs

        2. effectiveness on mortality, morbidity, modifiable risk factors control, functional
           capacity measured by exercise testing, health related quality of life and satisfaction
           rate

        3. cost/effectiveness analysis

      The main reasons for patients not to participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program that
      usually develops by group in the hospital or in a gym, are problems of access to hospital,
      disgust for participating in a group activity and problems in reconciling their work and / or
      home with the program schedule. These problems could be overcome by outcome cardiac
      rehabilitation and thus could increase the number of patients benefit from treatment in
      either the environment extra or intra-hospital.

      Low and medium coronary patients sent to cardiac rehabilitation program at our center within
      the first 12 weeks after presenting with acute coronary syndrome or been revascularized will
      be included in the study. The prescription of intensity of effort is based on heart rate
      reached during the stress test for the initial evaluation in all cases, although at
      home-program heart rate will be monitored using heart rate monitor and / or by the Borg
      scale. In this way outpatient group patient could performed training sessions individually
      and at the time of day that best suits their capabilities. The other program components:
      control of risk factors, health education and counseling will be identical in both groups of
      patients.

direct healthcare costs: hospital admissions for cardiovascular causes, percutaneous or surgical revascularization, medical and nursing consultation, physical training sessions, medical explorations including the analytic explorations, medication consumption, emergency department visits, depreciation of equipment used.
Direct costs other than health: Transfer the patient for his attention, passenger costs if necessary.
Indirect costs: working days lost during program participation (2 months, family overloads caused by participation in the program (2 months).</description>

    <description>Training sessions: 8 weeks of supervised physical training sessions. Stress intensity will be calculated from the peak heart rate reached during stress test: 60-70% during the first month and 70-85% during the second one. Patients will be advised to do at least 1 hour of outdoor exercise with the same intensity on the days when they do not attend hospital.
Health education sessions and relaxation sessions: one per week.
Smoking and diet checking: as recommended by doctor.</description>
