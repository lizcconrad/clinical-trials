      Objective: To determine the preliminary outcome of external over the counter (OTC) povidone
      iodine (PI) application in the management of chronic and acute blepharitis vs. currently
      clinically accepted medical regimen, i.e. eyelid hygiene, antibiotic drops, or
      antibiotic/steroid ointments.

      Methodology: One hundred adult patients with chronic and acute blepharitis will be enrolled
      and randomized into four groups.

      In group one, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI
      twice daily for 10 days and the other eye with no intervention.

      In group two, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI
      and the other eye will receive warm soaked eyelid wash.

      In group three, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI
      and the other eye will receive 1 drop of azithromycin ophthalmic solution twice daily for 10
      days.

      In group four, 25 patients will be instructed to scrub the lid margin of one eye with 5% PI
      and the other eye will receive tobradex ointment applied to the lid margin.

      Subjective variables assessed included itchiness, foreign body sensation and eyelid edema
      (grade 0-4). Objective variables assessed included lid margin redness, meibomian gland
      plugging and presence/absence of collarets (grade 0-4). Cultures of lid margin at the
      initiation and at the cessation of treatment were obtained.

    <textblock>
      Final statiscial analysis for subjective and objective numerical values following treatment
      for each group of subjects (group 2,3,4) should show equal or almost equal efficacy in
      treatment of blepharitis.

    <description>Variables of interest will include:
A. Subjective Measures including patient-rated symptom scores for 1. Itching (grade 0-3) 2. foreign body sensation (grade 0-3) 3. ocular dryness (grade 0-3) 4. ocular burning (grade 0-3) and 5. swollen eyelids (grade 0-3) B. Objective Measures: Evaluation of 1. lid margin redness (grade 0-3) 2. meibomian gland plugging (grade 0-3) and 3. Presence of collarets and scurfs (Grade 0-3) 4. Cultures of eyelid margin at the start and at the conclusion of treatment at 10 days.</description>
