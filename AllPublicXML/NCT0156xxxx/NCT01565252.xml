      Study Rationale:

      As epidemiological research has shown negative effects of high egg consumption on increased
      all-cause mortality and diabetes and on diabetes outcomes, and egg modification may modulate
      their effects on diseases risks, it is important to test the effect of eggs with different
      composition on markers associated with dyslipidemia, dysglycemia and inflammation.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of n-3PUFA (Omega 3) fortified egg compared to
      omega-6 Israeli regular egg on metabolic, inflammation and other physiologic parameters.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      First endpoint:

      To assess the effect of high n-3 PUFA (Omega 3) egg, as compared to regular- high n-6 PUFA
      (Omega 6) Israeli egg, on glycemic levels after night fasting and post prandial of 2 egg
      breakfast test meal.

      Secondary endpoint:

      To compare the effect of high n-3 PUFA fortified egg versus high n-6 PUFA (Regular) egg on
      measures associated with CVD risks including: CRP, LDL oxidation, MDA, post prandial Flow
      mediated dilatation (FMD), liver enzymes, and blood lipids and lipoproteins, and further
      blood chemistry measures.

      Third endpoint:

      To assess the influence of n-3 Egg on erythrocytes fatty acid profile.

      Study design: Prospective, Crossover, Compared Study Study population: 20 Healthy subjects

      Study Methods:

      Subjects will complete two study stages. In first stage study participants will get 3 weeks
      regimen including 2 Regular, Israeli (high n-6 Pufa) eggs/day.

      In second stage after 3 weeks washout without eggs, study participants will get 3 weeks
      regimen with 2 high n-3Pufa eggs/day.
