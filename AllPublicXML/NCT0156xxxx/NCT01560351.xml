  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated low-frequency Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, combined with
      gambling cues, on gambling craving. Participants are pathological gamblers. A single real
      stimulation and a single shame stimulation are administered in a random order for each
      participant (cross-over study).
