  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity physical activity by half squat of the elderly people with hemiplegia
      significantly slow down the pulse wave velocity of the arteries of the lower limbs of the
      paralyzed side within 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a noninvasive method for assessing
      arterial stiffening in atherosclerosis. In hemiplegics, disuse of the affected limb is
      associated with the muscle wasting leading to development of local atherosclerosis. The
      brachial-ankle aortic PWV (baPWV) is an indicator of early stage disuse syndrome, and is
      measured with a device that is particularly useful in elderly hemiplegics.

      The LIPA regime was designed to result in an increase of 3.3% (about 40 kcal/day) of daily
      energy consumption compared to their individual baseline values. This included aerobic
      exercises and half squats (70Â° knee flexion) for altogether about 20 minutes, once daily. In
      addition, the subjects performed passive ankle dorsiflexion-plantar flexion, 30 times/minute
      for 10 min, once daily. The LIPA was aimed at affecting the passive range of motion in ankle,
      knee, and hip, and weight bearing on the affected leg in standing position.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in bar-PWV at 4weeks, 8 weeks and 12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>baPWV were measured using the recently developed device, form ABI/PWV (BP-203RPE; Nihon Colin). This device has four cuffs that can be used to simultaneously measure blood pressure in both arms and both legs, and automatically calculate the ABI. It also records pulse waves with the sensors in the cuffs, computes the difference between transmission time in the arm and transmission time in the ankle, calculates the transmission distance from the right arm to each ankle according to body height, and thus computes the baPWV values from the transmission time and transmission distance.</description>

    <description>They take a meal three times daily. They are a time to do the manual work every day. They watch the TV for two hours every day. And they do a walk of 30 minutes every day. They do a specific exercise. They were trained to conduct 40kcal period(about 20 min.) for adding to the amount of energy consumption of low-intensity physical activity at baseline.Specific exercise that was done the half squat(max knee flexion 70 degree). This squat is carried out in two seconds round trip. This squat is carried out in two seconds round trip. They grab the edge of the table. They put half the weight of the lower limbs paralyzed side. This observer once a week, to record their behavior over 24 hours. Intervention period is up to a maximum of 12 weeks.</description>
