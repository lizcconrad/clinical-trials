  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on EMA (European Medicines Agency) new guidelines on the clinical development of
      products for immunotherapy for the treatment of allergic diseases the aim of this study is to
      establish a dose-response relationship for clinical efficacy of Phleum pratense pollen
      extract subcutaneous vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In adherence to EMA guidelines, the Phase I Clinical trial was carried out using Phleum
      pratense extract in depot presentation using 3 different dose escalation scheme. The
      objective was to compare tolerance and safety of the three dose escalation scheme as well as
      to determine the maximum dose tolerated by the population.

      Once the range of tolerated doses was established, and following the strict norms of the EMA,
      a Phase II dose response clinical trial was designed wherein the efficacy of subcutaneous
      immunotherapy in depot presentation could be compared in 5 different doses. One of these
      doses will be the MTD established by the population in the first study, another will be lower
      than this dose, and three will be greater than it. The dose escalation scheme to be tested
      was chosen based on the results of the aforementioned clinical trial. As dictated by EMA
      norms, a control placebo will be used.

               -  Pollens whose seasons do not overlap with Phleum pratense and which are not
                  expected to produce symptoms during the study period.

               -  Other allergens which are not expected to produce symptoms during the study
                  period.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the time
             they begin the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with stable and continued use of allergy medication during the 2 weeks prior
             to their inclusion in the study.

          2. Patients sensitized to allergens with overlapping seasons but which are not
             cross-reactive with Phleum pratense and with specific IgE levels equal or less than
             class 2 CAP/PHADIA.

          3. Patients who have received immunotherapy in the 5 years prior to the study against
             either the allergen being tested or an allergen which is cross-reactive, or who are
             currently receiving immunotherapy for any other allergen.

          4. Patients with severe asthma or FEV1 &lt; 70% or with asthma which requires treatment with
             inhaled or systemic corticoids at the time of the study or in the 8 weeks immediately
             prior to the onset of treatment.

          5. Patients with immunological, cardiac, renal or hepatic diseases or any with any other
