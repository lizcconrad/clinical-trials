  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naltrexone is a medication that has been shown to help prevent relapse to opioid addiction
      and it has been reported to be clinically effective in parolee populations although it is
      rarely used. Recently a depot formulation with one-month duration has received FDA approval
      for the treatment of alcoholism and opiate dependence. This means that rather than having to
      take medication daily, individuals can receive one injection that lasts for approximately 30
      days. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this monthly injection of naltrexone
      is practical and useful in the prevention of relapse to opioids and re-incarceration when
      administered to inmates prior to release from prison. The investigators will also monitor HIV
      risk behaviors to determine whether the intervention reduces risky behaviors associated with
      intravenous drug abuse and the spread of viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. Volunteers will
      be randomized to receive an injection of depot naltrexone prior to release from prison or to
      contact study personnel in the community following release. Participants assigned to receive
      naltrexone in prison will receive 1 injection in prison, and 5 additional monthly injections
      for 5 months upon release. Participants assigned to contact study personnel upon release will
      receive all 6 injections in the community at RIH after their release from the ACI. Patients
      in both groups will be given identical follow up monthly for six months including measures of
      opiate use by self-report, and urine tests. An additional scheduled urine test will take
      place each month between monthly visits. There will also be a 12-month follow-up period for
      participants in both groups, which will consist of 2 visits, spaced 6 months apart, meaning
      that participants will be enrolled in the study for a total of about 18 months. All
      participants will be asked to complete brief questionnaires at follow-up visits to assess
      things such as services received, drug use, and depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Incarcerated adults with known release date.

          2. Meet DSM-IV criteria for current (and/or prior to incarceration) opioid dependence.

          3. Not interested in agonist (methadone, buprenorphine) treatment.

          4. Currently opioid free by history ('detoxed'), with negative urine for all opioids and
             no sign of opiate withdrawal after IV (or IM if no available venous access) injection
             of 0.8 mg naloxone.

          5. Good health by medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests.

          6. Age older than 18.

          7. Understands and signs a consent form.

          8. Able to speak and understand English.

          9. Females: not pregnant (urine hCG negative at baseline and prior to each injection),
             not planning conception; and planning appropriate contraception if sexually active.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current drug or alcohol dependence requiring long term residential treatment that
             would interfere with outpatient study participation. Dependence on substances that
             commonly co-occur with opioid dependence (e.g. cocaine, cannabis, alcohol) that do not
             rise to this level of severity will not be exclusionary in order to achieve a
             maximally representative sample.

          2. Liver failure and/or liver function test levels greater than three times normal.

          3. Pregnancy, lactation, or failure to use adequate contraceptive methods;

          4. Active medical illness that might make participation hazardous, e.g. untreated
             hypertension, hepatitis with AST or ALT &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal, unstable
             diabetes or heart disease. Adequately treated medical conditions are acceptable.

          5. Untreated psychiatric disorder that might make participation hazardous, e.g. untreated
             psychosis, bipolar disorder with mania, significant suicide risk. Adequately treated
             psychiatric disorders and appropriate psychotropic medications would be allowed.

          6. History of allergic reaction to naltrexone;

          7. Current chronic pain diagnosis for which opioids are required for pain relief.

          8. Obesity (BMI of 40 or greater) to reduce the likelihood of injection site reaction.

          9. Known intolerance and/or hypersensitivity to naltrexone, carboxymethylcellulose, or
             polylactide-co-polymers (PLG) or any other components of the diluents.
