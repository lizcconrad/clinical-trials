  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, will take a subject's &quot;T cells&quot; and &quot;teach&quot; them to be able to recognize and
      attack the ovarian cancer cells. This is done by putting in a gene or genetic material that
      will change how a subject's T cells work and hopefully get them to attack and kill ovarian
      cancer cells. These new T cells are called &quot;engineered T cells&quot; because the new gene is
      causing them to become directed toward the ovarian cancer cells rather than their usual
      targets. These are also called &quot;gene-modified T cells&quot;. For subjects who have the HLA A2
      tissue-type marker, the T cells would be engineered to recognize a substance called
      &quot;NY-ESO-1&quot;. After putting this new gene in T cells (a procedure called &quot;gene therapy&quot;) the
      investigators will grow the cells in the laboratory and give these cells back to subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label clinical trial. Patients with the HLA-A201, HLA-A205, and/or HLA-A206
      allele and whose tumor expresses the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen will be eligible to receive
      NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T. The trial is conducted entirely with outpatient procedures; however, patients
      may be hospitalized for the cytoreductive chemotherapy at the discretion of the investigator.
      Upon enrollment, patients will undergo leukapheresis for T cell collection, and their cells
      will be genetically engineered and expanded ex vivo. Seven days prior to receiving T-cells
      patients will undergo a cyclophosphamide conditioning regimen to potentiate the
      immunotherapy. The cell product will be infused as a single infusion (Day 0, typically
      Monday) to mitigate risks associated with unanticipated infusion reactions. Patients will be
      followed daily for the first week, weekly until 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks and then at 6
      months and every 3 months until disease progression. Patients will undergo disease monitoring
      by MRI/CT scan (as appropriate for disease) at baseline, day 28, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, and
      months 6, and every 3 months until progression. Tumor biopsies will be taken at baseline,
      Week 8, and upon progression. In patients who have progressive disease following initial
      infusion but whose tumors continue to express NY-ESO-1, these patients may be eligible for a
      second infusion with redirected T cells. At disease progression, the interventional portion
      of the protocol ends and long term follow-up (LTFU) begins, in accordance with FDA
      regulations. LTFU occurs semiannually for up to 5 years post infusion and then annually
      thereafter for up to 15 years.

             composition to cyclophosphamide or other agents used in the study
