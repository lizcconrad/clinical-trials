    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of CMC544 administered in
      combination with rituximab (R-CMC544), and in alternance with rituximab, gemcitabine and
      oxaliplatin (R-GEMOX) in the first phase of the study. After that, efficacy and safety of
      this combination will be evaluated preliminarily in patients with DLBCL in relapse or
      refractory, who are no candidates for autologous transplant.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, phase Ib/II, open-label, single arm trial evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of R-CMC544 alternated with R-GEMOX in patients with CD20 and CD22
      positive DLBCL in relapse after/refractory to 1st or 2nd line treatment, who are no
      candidates for autologous transplant.

      The study consists of 2 phases. In part 1 (potential dose de-escalation phase) subjects will
      be enrolled at a fixed dose of CMC544. In case of occurrence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT),
      cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects will evaluate a de-escalating dose of CMC544 in combination with
      set doses of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in order to obtain the MTD or recommended
      dose of CMC544 in this regimen. In part 2 (dose expansion phase) further safety and
      preliminary efficacy data of the proposed combination will be analyzed.

      All patients will receive two 56 day induction cycles of alternating R-CMC544 (given on day
      1) and R-GEMOX (given on day 29 and 43). Patients who obtain CR or PR, will then go on a
      consolidation of another two 56 day cycles of alternating R-CMC544 (given on day 1) and
      R-GEMOX (given on day 29 and 43).
