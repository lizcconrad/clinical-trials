  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the neuroprotective qualities of long-term, in
      home, exercise therapy program in human PD patients. It is hypothesized that an exercise
      intervention might delay the onset of levo-dopa therapy (i.e. evidence for neuroprotection).
      The first part involves a pilot-study in which the feasibility of the intervention and
      outcome measures will be tested.

      Neuroprotective therapy (i.e. therapy that slows the disease process) is an unmet medical
      need in Parkinson's disease (PD). Animal studies have shown that 'intensive' exercise
      improves motor function and may have neuroprotective properties. The promising animal results
      have not been translated to patients with PD so far. This is a two-cluster randomised control
      trial in which twenty patients (10 at each site) will undergo a 6-month exercise intervention
      on a stationary virtual reality bike and twenty patients (10 at each site)will serve as
      controls.

    <description>this test requires subjects to connect numbers on a screen from 1 to 25 (part A) and to connect numbers to letters. This neuropsychological test has already been proven to be sensitive to frontal lobe damage (e.g. Boll 1981) and has been recognised as an outcome for executive function in PD21. This test is performed using an online system called i-COMET that allows subject to complete the task weekly at home. Subjects have to login at the i-COMET website (https://i-comet.com) with a username and password that is provided to them by the research team.</description>
