  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children hospitalized due to an acute disease may suffer from acute malnutrition or chronic
      malnutrition caused by chronic diseases. According to various studies, about 10-20% of those
      admitted to hospitals in different countries suffer from malnutrition or are at risk of
      malnutrition.

      Several pediatric nutritional screening tools were recently published. However, there is no
      conventional pediatric nutritional screening tool and the effect of the recently published
      tools on further nutritional risk and the behavior of the attending staff are unclear.

      Study objectives: to test the validity and reliability of the STAMP nutritional screening
      tool (Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics) among children
      hospitalized in a pediatric medical center and to examine the effect of the STAMP tool use on
      the attitude of the medical staff to the patient nutritional status.

      An additional objective is to compare the skill of a nurse versus a dietician in performing
      the evaluation according to STAMP.

      Methods: for the validation, 50 children between 1 and 17 years of age from internal medicine
      and surgical departments will undergo a complete evaluation by an investigating dietician and
      assessment by the STAMP tool in order to determine the extent of the nutritional risk on a
      numerical scale. All the children will undergo STAMP evaluation by a nurse and another
      investigating dietician as well.

      In order to examine the effect of the tool on the medical staff awareness, 300 files of
      hospitalized children will be tested: 150 files at the beginning of the study and prior to
      using the tool and 150 after 6 months at the same ages and in the same departments.

      The effect of using the STAMP questionnaire will be examined according to the results of data
      collection from the beginning of the study and after 6 months. Questionnaire use, recording
      of appropriate diagnoses, collection of blood tests demonstrating the nutritional status,
      weight, height and waist circumference measurements will be obtained from the patients'
      medical files.

    <description>The height / weight tables accepted in England, CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and WHO (World Health Organization) will be used in order to compare weight and height. The children will be divided into 3 nutritional risk groups: low, moderate and high according to the STAMP toll assessment and the results will be compared to the dietician's complete assessment.Nutritional assessment will include: demographic and medical data, daily nutritional intake, blood tests, anthropometric measurements, patient's ability to comply with the nutritional requirements related to his age etc.</description>

    <description>Methods for testing the effect of STAMP tool use on the attitude of the medical staff to the nutritional status, measured by collection of data related to the nutritional status and recording them in the patient's file. In order to examine questionnaire acceptance by the medical staff, time period required to complete the questionnaire will be measured and in addition, the staff will be required to express their opinion regarding the speed and ease of using the questionnaire using the 4-point Likert scale. The staff will be asked about their subjective opinion about using the questionnaire.</description>
