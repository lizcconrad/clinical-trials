    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to monitor the changes of blood coagulation parameters in
      postmenopausal patients who are treated with adjuvant Hormonal Therapy for a total of 5
      years. The values of the standard coagulation parameters throughout the study will be
      compared with the baseline values.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be treated with standard adjuvant hormonal therapy for a total of 5 years
      or until disease relapse or until HT is permanently discontinued for other reasons. The
      choice of endocrine treatment strategy (drugs to be used or their sequence, if the sequential
      option has been decided) is left at the discretion of the participating site. Adjuvant HT
      will commence after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Percentage
      change (%) from baseline of the blood coagulation parameters at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of
      treatment. The blood coagulation parameters which will be measured are fibrinogen,
      prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

        Postmenopausal, ER and/or PgR positive breast cancer patients eligible for adjuvant
        hormonal treatment (HT), who are admitted for treatment and follow-up at the participating
        sites, will be enrolled in the trial. Study subjects will be treated with standard adjuvant
        hormonal therapy for a total of 5 years or until disease relapse or until HT is permanently
        discontinued for other reasons.

        The choice of endocrine treatment strategy (drugs to be used or their sequence, if the
        sequential option has been decided) is left at the discretion of the participating site.
        Adjuvant HT will commence after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or
        radiotherapy.
