    <description>AMG 208 is a small molecule inhibitor of c-Met which is a well-characterized receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on the surface of epithelial cells. C-Met receptor signaling has been shown to play a key role in the survival of cancer cells. AMG 208 inhibits both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent c‑Met cellular growth regulation. Inhibition of c-Met signaling with AMG 208 provides a potential mechanism for blocking tumor growth and survival.</description>
