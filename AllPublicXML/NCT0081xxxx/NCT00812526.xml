  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoregulation is the ability of a vascular bed to maintain blood flow despite changes in
      perfusion pressure. For a long time it had been assumed that the choroid is a strictly
      passive vascular bed, which shows no autoregulation. However, recently several groups have
      identified some autoregulatory capacity of the choroid. Choroidal autoregulation was first
      shown in a rabbit model where intraocular pressure (IOP) and arterial blood pressure could be
      varied independently. In these experiments regulation of choroidal blood flow was not only
      dependent on ocular perfusion pressure, but was also dependent on the value of IOP. This
      indicates that a myogenic mechanism contributes to choroidal autoregulation, because the
      regulatory capacity is dependent on the transmural pressure. In the model of myogenic
      autoregulation arterioles change their vascular tone depending on the pressure inside the
      vessel and outside the vessel. The present experiments are designed to test whether a
      myogenic mechanism may also be involved in choroidal autoregulation in humans. For this
      purpose the investigators perform experiments during which the IOP and the arterial blood
      pressure is increased. According to the myogenic theory of autoregulation one would expect
      stronger vasoconstriction at lower IOPs for the same increase in ocular perfusion pressure.
