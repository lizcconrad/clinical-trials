  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) is a potent mitogen for a wide range of cell types
      including fibroblasts, smooth muscle and connective tissue. Recombinant human platelet
      derived growth factor (R-Pdf/Gbb) has biologic activity similar to endogenous platelet
      derived growth factor (PDGF). Biologic activity of PDGF includes encouraging chemotaxis and
      proliferation of cells responsible for wound repair and it augments production of granulation
      tissue.

      The growth factor rhPDGF is found effective in patients having diabetic foot ulcer grade III
      and IV. The nature of wounds in the third degree burns is similar so far as healing process
      is concerned.

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypotheses that the application of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01%
      gel on the third degree thermal and electrical burns will heal these wounds within 3 months
      and there will be improvement in general condition of the patients without any complications.

      The R-Pdf/Gbb is recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor. It has been demonstrated
      that rhPDGF is effective in enhancing wound healing.

      OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of R-Pdf/Gbb gel
      in treating wounds caused by III degree thermal and electrical burns.

      HYPOTHESIS 1: That the applications of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel on III degree thermal and
      electrical burns will heal these wounds within 3 months.

      HYPOTHESIS 2: Subjects, who having III degree thermal and electrical burns with the treatment
      of R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel, will show improvement in general condition without any complications.

      We aim to test these hypotheses by evaluating the clinical outcome in about 120 patients
      after three months of treatment with R-Pdf/Gbb 0.01% gel applied once daily.
