  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of Avastin in combination with
      Herceptin and Xeloda as first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive locally recurrent
      or metastatic breast cancer. Patients will receive 3-weekly treatment cycles of Herceptin
      (8mg/kg iv on day 1 of first cycle, followed by 6mg/kg iv maintenance dose on day 1 of
      subsequent cycles), Xeloda (1000mg/m2 bid po on days 1-14 of each treatment cycle) and
      Avastin (15mg/kg on day 2 of first treatment cycle,and on day 1 of each subsequent cycle).The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size
      is &lt;100 individuals.

    <description>Tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.0. BOR was defined as the best response recorded for a participant from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Percentage of participants with a BOR of confirmed CR or PR (responders) was reported. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Confirmed responses were those which were confirmed by a repeat assessment, performed 4 weeks after the criteria for response first met.</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from enrollment to time of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Progression: at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.

        <description>Tumor response was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.0. BOR was defined as the best response recorded for a participant from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Percentage of participants with a BOR of confirmed CR or PR (responders) was reported. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Confirmed responses were those which were confirmed by a repeat assessment, performed 4 weeks after the criteria for response first met.</description>
