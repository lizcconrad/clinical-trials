  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of bortezomib (Velcade)
      plus prednisone for treating chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) and the safety of this
      drug combination in this patient population. Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that may
      occur after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The donor's immune system may recognize the
      participants body (the host) as foreign and attempt to &quot;reject&quot; it. Bortezomib has been used
      in other research studies, and information from those studies suggests that this drug may
      help to control the abnormal immune responses that underlie cGVHD.

      -  Each treatment cycle lasts five weeks, during which time participants will come to the
           clinic to receive bortezomib intravenously once a week for the first 4 weeks. Prednisone
           will be taken orally on a daily basis and dose reduction may be initiated after 1 cycle
           of therapy.

        -  During all treatment cycles, participants will have the following: physical exam and
           blood work. At the end of cycle 3 (week 15) the participants cGVHD will be evaluated.
           These assessments may include an eye examination, a skin examination, a pulmonary
           function test and/or, a flexion assessment test.

        -  Participants will receive 3 cycles of bortezomib.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate After a 15 Week Course of Bortezomib Plus Prednisone in Patients With cGVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients had their cGVHD assessed at Baseline and at 15 weeks or end of therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Participants had their cGVHD evaluated per NIH consensus criteria:
Complete response: resolution of all reversible manifestations of cGVHD.
Partial response: a decrease ≥ 1 point on a 3-point organ-specific scale or 2 points or more on a 10-point global scale without progression in any organ sites.
Stable disease: no evidence of cGVHD response without evidence of progressive cGVHD.
Progressive cGVHD: increase of ≥ 1 point on an organ-specific 3-point scale, addition of a new immunosuppressive agent prior to the completion of 15 weeks of combination therapy, or requirement an increase in the total daily dose of corticosteroids above a participant's baseline corticosteroid dose during the 15-week combined treatment period.
Mixed response: a response in primary sites of cGVHD involvement but interval progressive cGVHD in other organs or sites.
Responses were not scored for oral or ocular cGVHD, since topical therapies were permitted during the study.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Patients Tolerating &gt;50% Steroid Dose Reduction After a 15 Week Course of Bortezomib Plus Prednisone in Patients With cGVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>After 15 weeks of bortezomib plus prednisone therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The participants' total daily steroid dose was recorded at baseline and after a 15 week course of treatment. Starting at a dose of 0.5-1 mg/kg, dose reduction of steroids was permitted after 1 cycle of therapy. The suggested taper was 10-25% every 1-2 weeks. .</description>

        <description>Participants had their cGVHD evaluated per NIH consensus criteria:
Complete response: resolution of all reversible manifestations of cGVHD.
Partial response: a decrease ≥ 1 point on a 3-point organ-specific scale or 2 points or more on a 10-point global scale without progression in any organ sites.
Stable disease: no evidence of cGVHD response without evidence of progressive cGVHD.
Progressive cGVHD: increase of ≥ 1 point on an organ-specific 3-point scale, addition of a new immunosuppressive agent prior to the completion of 15 weeks of combination therapy, or requirement an increase in the total daily dose of corticosteroids above a participant’s baseline corticosteroid dose during the 15-week combined treatment period.
Mixed response: a response in primary sites of cGVHD involvement but interval progressive cGVHD in other organs or sites.
Responses were not scored for oral or ocular cGVHD, since topical therapies were permitted during the study.</description>
