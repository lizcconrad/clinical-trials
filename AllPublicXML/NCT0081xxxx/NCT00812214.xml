  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that treating insomnia in migraineurs, many of whom also have tension
      headaches, prolongs total sleep time to the extent that it decreases overall headache
      frequency. Chronic headache sufferers also feel more tired during the day2, undoubtedly
      affecting daytime functioning, which is hypothesized to improve as well with prolonged total
      sleep time.

      The objective of the study is to determine the effect of prolonging total sleep time in
      migraineurs with insomnia on overall headache frequency, daytime alertness, fatigue, and
      functioning. The prolongation of total sleep time is accomplished by bedtime administration
      of 3 mg eszopiclone (Lunesta™), compared with placebo through a parallel-group design.

        Subjects included in the study are men and women, 18 to 64 years of age (inclusive), with
        IHS-II migraine with/without aura and DSM-IV primary insomnia (sleep onset/sleep
        maintenance). The required migraine frequency is 4-12 times per month, with a maximum of 20
        days with headache per month, for 1 month or longer prior to screening. The requirement
        with regard to insomnia is a usual, estimated total sleep time of 6½ hours per night or
        less, for 1 month or longer prior to screening, due to problems falling asleep, waking up
        during the night, or waking up early. The sleep and headache eligibility criteria are
        confirmed at the randomization visit on the basis of the daily diary.
