  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic disease in which psoriatic plaques may appear on the knees,
      elbows, scalp and trunk. Evidence suggests the role of neurogenic inflammation in the
      pathogenesis of psoriasis. Botulinum toxin has been shown to have an effect on inhibiting
      neurogenic inflammation.

      Recently, it was reported that patients who suffered from dystonia and had concomitant
      psoriasis, when treated with botulinum toxin for dystonia noted a dramatic improvement of
      their psoriatic lesions.

      This pilot study will determine the safety and efficacy of botulinum toxin in the management
      of psoriasis vulgaris.
