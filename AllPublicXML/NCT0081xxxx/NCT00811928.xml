    <measure>Number of Participants With Proven or Probable Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Infection (IFI) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks (84 days) plus 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants developing a proven or probable IFI from randomization to the last dosage date (up to 12 weeks [84 days]) plus 7 days. IFI diagnosis criteria may include: persistent fever, failure of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment concomitant with lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, microbiological criteria with corresponding clinical signs and symptoms.</description>

    <description>Number of participants who developed a proven or probable IFI from randomization date to Day 100 of follow-up visit. IFI diagnosis criteria may include: persistent fever, failure of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment concomitant with lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, microbiological criteria with corresponding clinical signs and symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time From Randomization to the First Onset of Proven or Probable IFI</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>The time measured in days to the first occurrence of proven/probable IFI diagnosis in the entire FAS population from randomization to Day 100 of follow-up visit. Participants may not have accepted immediate antifungal treatment and later received antifungal treatment based upon further investigator review of the participant's IFI condition. IFI diagnosis criteria may include: persistent fever, failure of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment concomitant with lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, positive blood/biopsy cultures with corresponding clinical signs and symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time From Randomization to Administration of First Systemic Antifungal Intravenous (IV) Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks (84 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The time measured in days from randomization to the administration of the first concomitant systemic anti-fungal therapy in the entire FAS population. Not all participants who accepted systemic anti-fungal therapy may have had a IFI clinical diagnosis. IFI diagnosis criteria for antifungal therapy administration may include: persistent fever, failure of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment concomitant with lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, microbiological criteria with corresponding clinical signs and symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinical Failure During Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks (84 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical failure was defined as follows:
Presence of a proven or probable IFI
Systemic antifungal treatment (IV) for 4 consecutive days or more than 10 days total
Discontinuation due to adverse event (AE) possibly or probably related to study drug
Lost-to-follow-up or discontinuation from the study for any reason with loss to follow-up during the Treatment Phase</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants in Whom All-cause Mortality Occurred Within 100 Days From Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization date to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants in Whom Mortality is Unlikely, Possibly, and Probably Related to Fungal Infection Occurred Within 100 Days From Randomization</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization date to Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Exact Causes of Death and Their Relationship to IFI Episode Were As Follows:
Unlikely related: participant completed treatment and cause of death was due to primary disease or complication
Possibly related: IFI undergoing treatment without stabilization, or with failure to have a complete remission, where cause of death might have been due to IFI, including progression or relapse of primary disease
Probably related: autopsy or clinical signs suggested that progression of IFI was the probable cause of death</description>
