      Osteoclastic bone resorption depends on both the capacity to generate osteoclasts
      (osteoclastogenesis) and on individual osteoclast activity. The investigators objective is to
      study the effect of anti-TNF therapy on the number of osteoclast precursors in the peripheral
      blood of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis, on in vitro osteoclastogenesis and on osteoclast
      activity before and during the treatment of patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis with
      Adalimumab.

      Osteoclasts (OCs) are cells specialized in bone degradation that participate in bone and
      joint destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Experimental models have clearly demonstrated
      that OCs are essential for local bone resorption in arthritis. In RANKL knockout mice(1; 2),
      in rats receiving OPG(3-6) or in c-fos(-/-) hTNF transgenic mice(7) induction of arthritis
      leads to inflammation but not to bone erosion. Systemic osteoporosis is an important
      comorbidity in RA(8; 9). Increased systemic bone resorption due to OC activation occurs even
      in early (&lt; 2 years) RA and correlates with disease activity(10). Bisphosphonates are
      effective in preventing systemic bone loss in inflammatory diseases, but for unknown reasons
      do not seem to influence periarticular bone erosion and joint destruction. Finally, a
      systemic factor affecting osteoclastogenesis seems to be present in RA, as shown by an
      increased formation of OCs from bone marrow of patients with severe arthritis when compared
      to controls(11).

      TNF-alpha is a major pathologic mediator in RA. It may induce bone resorption either
      directly, stimulating osteoclastogenesis(12; 13) or indirectly, by influencing RANKL, OPG and
      prostaglandin production by osteoblasts(14; 15). These pathways may be important for the
      pathophysiology of several diseases such as periodontitis, Rheumatoid arthritis and
      osteoporosis(16; 17). In mice, TNF-alpha increases the number of osteoclast precursors in
      vivo but its role may, however, be more complex and implicate also
      osteoclastogenesis-inhibiting mechanisms(18; 19); in fact, in certain conditions, TNF-alpha
      may decrease osteoclastogenesis(20), so the in vivo effect of blocking TNF may be difficult
      to predict from these models.

      Anti-TNF agents reduce bone destruction in RA but it is not clear how this effect is achieved
      since, as described in the preceding paragraph, TNF has been shown to have antagonistic
      effects in osteoclast formation and activity. Moreover, little is known of the effect of
      anti-TNF therapy on osteoclast biology in humans.

      Working hypothesis

      This project is based on two different but closely related hypothesis:

        1. Treatment with anti-TNF agents (Adalimumab in this case) may reduce the number of
           circulating osteoclast precursors, in vitro osteoclastogenesis and in vitro bone
           resorption.

        2. Addition of Adalimumab to the culture medium used to differentiate osteoclasts in vitro
           may inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.

      Objectives

      Osteoclastic bone resorption depends on both the capacity to generate osteoclasts
      (osteoclastogenesis) and on individual osteoclast activity. Our objective is to study the
      effect of anti-TNF therapy on the number of osteoclast precursors in the peripheral blood of
      patients with RA, on in vitro osteoclastogenesis and on osteoclast activity before and during
      the treatment of patients with RA with Adalimumab.

      Research plan

      Trial design : As a clinical trail aimed at studying the impact of anti-TNF treatment on
      osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity we will study one cohort of patients with RA
      before and at two points after beginning of the therapy, 3 and 6 months, so that each patient
      will be his/her own control (before/after study). The two time points after introduction of
      the therapy are needed for two reasons : 1) The time when an eventual effect on the
      parameters studied may reach its peak is not known and 2) To assure that the parameters
      measured are stable over time.

      Outcomes:

      Primary outcomes will be the difference in the following parameters before and after
      treatment with Adalimumab (3 and 6 months):

        1. the number of osteoclast precursor (CD14+) cells in the peripheral blood

        2. the number of osteoclasts generated in vitro

        3. the amount of bone resorption in vitro

      Secondary outcomes:

        1. Parallel in vitro differentiation assays (number of osteoclasts generated and amount of
           bone resorption) in the presence of exogenous Adalimumab in the concentration range
           found in the plasma of treated patients to detect a direct effect of the medication in
           vitro in osteoclastogenesis.

        2. disease activity defined as a DAS28 score (21; 22)

        3. Change in functional status by the M-HAQ (23)

      Patient cohort:

      Inclusion criteria: Patients satisfying the ACR Criteria for RA(24) and having received a
      prescription of Adalimumab from a rheumatologist at the Centre hospitalier universitaire de
      Sherbrooke. Patients having received other anti-TNF therapies are eligible only after 5
      half-lives of the previous medication. Patients must be willing to sign an informed consent.
      Concomitant medication other than anti-TNFs and other biologicals is allowed and the treating
      rheumatologist can adjust it on the best interest of the patients. This study has, thus, no
      impact on the routine treatment of the patients. Concomitant medication will be recorded and
      considered in the final analysis.

      Exclusion criteria : Patients under age 18 or not capable or willing to provide informed
      consent, patients starting Adalimumab less than five half lives after the interruption of a
      previous anti-TNF therapy.

      Sample size and statistics: The sample size was calculated based on the distribution and
      variance of the primary outcome, i.e. the number of osteoclasts generated in vitro. From a
      population of 51 normal donors in our laboratory the number of osteoclasts generated was
      601.1 ± 156.8 osteoclasts/well (data presented at the 2007 annual meeting of the Canadian
      Rheumatology Association, in press at the Journal of Rheumatology). We considered a test
      significance level of 5% (α = 0.05) and the power of 80% to detect a difference of at least
      100 osteoclasts/well between the groups (paired two-tailed t-test), which led to a total of
      22 patients. Considering a 10% loss due to technical reasons the sample size was established
      at 25 patients.

      Methodology

      Blood samples: 50 ml of blood in heparin will be collected from each patient no more than 2
      months before the beginning of treatment with Adalimumab and 3 and six months after the first
      administration of the drug (± 2 weeks). DAS-28, HAQ scores, comorbidities and concomitant
      medication will be determined and recorded at the same times and the coded data stored in a
      secure database.

      Osteoclast Studies:

      Osteoclastogenesis: PBMCs will be isolated from 50 ml of blood by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient and
      the number of CD14+ OC precursors will be determined by FACS. The whole population of PBMCs
      will be plated in 48-well tissue culture plates containing a bone slice or a glass slide, and
      the cells will be allowed to differentiate for 21 days in the presence of recombinant RANKL
      (75 ng/ml) and M-CSF (10 ng/ml). The cells are then fixed and stained for TRAP activity and
      with hematoxylin. The number of TRAP+ cells containing three or more nuclei will be counted
      in each well. Triplicates will be used for each patient. In parallel wells the cells will be
      incubated in the same conditions but in the presence of Adalimumab in concentration
      comparable to that found in vivo after treatment.

      OC resorptive activity: For bone resorption assays, cells differentiated for 21 days on bone
      slices will be stained for TRAP and 0.2 % toluidine blue. Resorption surface area will be
      quantified using the image analysis program, Simple PCI. Parellel assays will be done in the
      presence of Adalimumab.

      Statistical analysis:

      The groups before and after intervention will be compared using parametric paired two-tailed
      tests for the variables with a normal distribution and with non parametric tests whenever
      appropriate.

      Anticipated results

      These studies will allow us to determine if treatment with Adalimumab has an effect on the
      number of circulating osteoclast precursors, on the generation of osteoclasts and on the
      bone-resorbing activity of these cells. It will also allow to determine if Adalimumab, in
      concentrations found in vivo, may have a direct impact on human osteoclastogenesis and bone
      resorption. Perhaps more importantly, correlation of the osteoclast results with the clinical
      parameters studied may allow us an insight on whether an eventual effect on osteoclasts may
      correlate with the clinical response to the medication, indicating a possible additional
      mechanism of action of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
