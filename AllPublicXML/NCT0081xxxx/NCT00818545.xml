    <textblock>
      The stratum corneum (SC) is the superficial layer of the epidermis situated at the interface
      between the body and its outside environment. Its strategic position confers it a crucial
      role of protection against aggressions. After disruption, the kinetic of cutaneous barrier is
      slower in elderly comparatively to young subjects.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate, by characterizing molecular events, the
      effectiveness of ER4017 (Hydroxypropyltetrahydropyrantriol) to restore kinetic barrier
      function after acute disruption of stratum corneum in ederly subjects.

      10 male volunteers aged from 60 to 75 years are randomized to receive topical application of
      ER4017 versus placebo on skin inner forearms twice a day during 3 months. After sequential
      selloptape strips, epidermal samples of treated and control skin are removed under local
      anesthesia, using a dermatome. Differential gene expression analysis is performed using micro
      array techniques and quantitative RT-PCR.

      treatment, randomized on the location, double blind, placebo control, internal control
      subject, prospective study.

      Structural modifications of the superficial dermis during the aging process associated to
      alterations in the GAG- and PG profile appear to impact the quality of the dermal epidermal
      junction (DEJ). Previous biological and clinical evaluations of ER4017, a C-glycoside
      biomimetic of xylose, showed its capacity to stimulate GAG- and PG synthesis and to improve
      morphogenesis of the whole DEJ.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the gene expression in human epidermis treated with
      ER4017 following sequential sellotapes strips after a 3 months ER4017 topical application.
      For this purpose, the modulation of gene expression is determined using a cDNA microarray
      technology. Stratum corneum disruption is performed following 3 months topical application on
      skin inner forearms. All the experiments are performed in 10 elderly healthy men. Volunteers
      are clinically and biophysically evaluated at baseline and then at monthly intervals or at 3
      months respectively.
