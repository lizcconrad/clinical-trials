      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Morcher Iris Diaphragms
      in the treatment of congenital and acquired aniridia. Morcher Iris Diaphragms are intraocular
      devices designed to provide an artificial pupil for patients suffering from partial or
      complete aniridia. These devices are constructed from clinical quality, ultraviolet
      light-absorbing, opaque black polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). After surgical implantation,
      patients are monitored over the course of one year to measure any changes to visual acuity
      and improvements in light and glare sensitivity.

      Aniridia is a condition where the iris, the colored portion of the eye, is either partially
      or completely absent. The iris is responsible for regulating the amount of light that enters
      the eye by adjusting the size of the pupil opening.

      Aniridia can either be a congenital condition, a genetics-based abnormality affecting the
      formation of the iris, or it can be acquired through surgical or physical trauma to the eye.

      Aniridia can also vary in the level of severityâ€”a mild case would involve a thinner iris or
      iris remnant with a normal pupil. A severe case may involve complete absence of the iris and
      impairment of the muscles responsible for adjusting pupil size.

      People who suffer from aniridia also commonly suffer from other eye conditions. The more
      common ones include glaucoma, cataract, and nystagmus. Often, other structures in the eye are
      affected including the cornea, the natural lens, and the retina. Aniridia can cause severe
      visual disability if left untreated.

      Common treatments for aniridia involve having the patient use colored or tinted glasses or
      contact lenses to reduce the amount of light entering the eye.

      In this trial, Morcher Iris Diaphragms are being evaluated as a potential treatment to
      improve the symptoms associated with aniridia.The Morcher Iris Diaphragm is a device
      manufactured in Germany by Morcher GmbH [website: http:// www.morcher.com]. In Europe, these
      devices have been utilized to treat aniridic patients for over 25 years. Additionally, these
      devices hold the European CE mark of conformity.

      When a patient is implanted with a Morcher Iris Diaphragm, their surgery involves additional
      standard of care surgical procedures. Typically, a device is implanted during cataract
      surgery along with an intraocular lens (IOL). Devices can also be implanted during an IOL
      exchange procedure or IOL exchange with anterior vitrectomy. All implantation procedures take
      place in an operating room under local or general anesthesia. In some cases, a single-piece
      Morcher iris reconstruction lens containing both an artificial iris and a lens is implanted.
      Also, depending on the patient, and the condition of their eye, the lens and device implant
      may need to be sutured in place. Typically, this involves suturing the lens to the iris
      device and then, suturing this all to the sclera, the white portion of the eye.

      All patients undergoing surgery are prescribed two different eye drops, an antibiotic and a
      corticosteroid. These medications are used for up to a maximum of 6 weeks following
      implantation of the device. There are five postoperative follow-up visits that every patient
      must complete. All visits are spaced out at specific intervals over the course of a one-year
      period. At each visit, standard of care procedures are performed and, at certain time points
      in this follow-up interval, digital photos and endothelial cell counts are obtained. In the
      cases where both eyes will be implanted, surgery for each eye will be scheduled 6 months
      apart.

      As of June 2014, Sixty-six patients had been implanted with the Morcher Iris Diaphragms, and
      all completed the one-year post-operative follow-up period. The study is currently in the
      data analysis phase. No patients are being enrolled currently.

    <description>This is a non-randomized, non-comparative interventional surgical series. Patient will undergo surgery to implant a Morcher artificial iris into their affected eye(s). After surgery, patients will complete five postoperative follow-up examinations. At each examination, they will be evaluated for changes in light and glare sensitivity, changes in visual acuity, and any additional ocular changes attributable to the device.</description>
