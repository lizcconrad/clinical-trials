  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent medical condition. Patients with PAD
      are usually diagnosed on the basis of the ankle-brachial index. The ankle-brachial index is
      the ratio of ankle pressure to arm pressure based on measurement of blood pressures in the
      arms and legs using a Doppler device. The need for dedicated equipment and trained personnel,
      along with the time required to perform the test, have been identified as barriers to
      widespread implementation of ankle-brachial index screening. The use of automated
      oscillometric devices for blood pressure measurement and determination of the ankle-brachial
      index has been applied with variable success. It will be beneficial to investigate a reliable
      oscillometric-based procedure that can accurately measure leg pressures for the
      ankle-brachial index across the entire spectrum of PAD severity.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal oscillometric-based technique for
      estimation of Doppler-derived systolic arm and ankle blood pressures for calculation of the
      ankle-brachial index in patients with and without PAD.

      Subjects with suspected arterial disease in the non-invasive lab will be enrolled. Arm,
      ankle, and toe pressure measurements will be made in the supine position using Doppler,
      oscillometric methods, and photoplethysmographic sensor. Arm and ankle pressures from a
      subset of subjects will be obtained in both seated and supine positions. The ankle-brachial
      index and toe-brachial index will be calculated.
