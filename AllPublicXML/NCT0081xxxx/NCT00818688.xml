  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We performed a national cross-sectional and prospective large epidemiological cohort study in
      patients with ST. Office- and hospital-based vascular medicine French practitioners enrolled
      all consecutive patients with a symptomatic ST of the lower limbs at least 5 cm long
      documented by compression ultrasonography. Follow-up was three months. All events were
      adjudicated by a central committee.

    <textblock>
      Between March 2005 and October 2006, 844 patients (median age [range]: 65 [18-98] years; 547
      women) were included. At inclusion, confirmed deep-vein thrombosis and/or symptomatic
      pulmonary embolism was associated with ST in 24.9% (n=210) of patients. Among the 600
      patients with isolated ST (i.e. without deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at
      inclusion), 10.4% (n=56) developed venous thromboembolic complications at three months,
      including the following symptomatic events: pulmonary embolism (0.4%, n=2), deep-vein
      thrombosis (2.8%, n=15), extension of ST (3.1%, n=17) and recurrence of ST (1.9%, n=10).
      These complications occurred despite the use of various anticoagulant strategies in 90.5%
      (n=540) of patients; four independent risk factors increased the risk of these complications:
      male sex, cardiac or respiratory insufficiency, history of deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary
      embolism and no history of varicose veins.
