    <textblock>
      The ATENA phase III randomized parallel-group multicenter trial is designed to compare 5
      years of adjuvant exemestane versus 5 years of observation in postmenopausal women with
      operable breast cancer who have received 5-7 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The primary
      endpoint for the core protocol is disease-free survival (DFS). Exemestane treatment is
      planned for 5 years unless disease relapse or excessive toxicity is documented, the patient
      refuses further treatment or any new anti-cancer therapy is initiated.

      -  Patients must have completed at least 5 years and not more than 7 years of continued
           treatment with tamoxifen (20 mg/day), while tamoxifen could have been discontinued up to
           6 months prior to study entry.

        -  A substudy (ATENA lipid substudy)is designed to evaluate changes in the patients' serum
           lipid profile during study treatment.
