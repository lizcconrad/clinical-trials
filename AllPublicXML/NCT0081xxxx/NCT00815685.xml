  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The data collected through this pilot study will allow us to increase our understanding of
      cancer cachexia and the effect of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) on cancer cachexia. Our
      long-term goal is to improve nutritional treatment and reduce illness in the cancer patient
      population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People who have cancer can get what is called cancer cachexia (CC). The symptoms of CC
      include getting full quickly when eating (early satiety), loss of appetite, weakness
      resulting in weight loss and loss of lean body mass. Even a weight loss of 5% in cancer
      patients reflects poor health, hospitalization, and a higher rate of illness. Research shows
      that the elderly are at higher risk for deficiency of vitamins and trace minerals. Other
      pre-existing chronic diseases and drug therapies in this population may increase the needs of
      certain nutrients. Recent studies have also shown that advanced malnutrition is much more
      difficult to treat in the elderly than in younger adults, and the consequences of failure to
      treat it delays recovery and can decrease function and quality of life. At this time, the
      ways to treat CC include giving medications to increase appetite and giving nutritional
      supplements that are high in calories and protein.

      Recent studies have shown that certain types of fats that are present in fish, walnuts and
      other foods that we eat called Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) may help with weight gain,
      especially gain in muscle and improve quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer.
      However, EPA has never been studied in prevention of cancer cachexia in cancer patients
      showing early signs of weight loss. Based on these early, small studies, it is clear that we
      need to study if and how EPA can prevent loss of muscle and weight in cancer patients and
      prevent this from becoming worse.

    <description>There is no expected range for &quot;normal&quot; activity since there is not currently a clinical indication for these molecular markers. Comparison of ranges can be made between groups (such as those that received treatment and not). This was an exploration of potential in the pilot study and further research is indicated to better understand the metabolic abnormalities observed in cancer cachexia as well as potential benefits of using agents such as EPA.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive Lovaza at a dose of 4 g for 6 weeks. Participants will be examined at six weeks for change in protein status as indicated by change in morphological (Height, weight, body mass index, body composition, lean body mass, body fat %), and biochemical (serum prealbumin) markers of protein status and immunological cytokines (Il-6, TNF- α) markers implicated in cancer cachexia. At baseline, 3 and 6 weeks, participants will undergo interviews and laboratory analysis for determining compliance and treatment-related toxicity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and Women 25-80 years of age (inclusive)

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of Cancer (other than pancreatic cancer) Unintentional weight loss
             of &gt;5% of body weight within 3 months of admission to the study

             until recovery to normal; LFTs will be considered valid for consideration of
             eligibility if drawn within the previous 2 weeks, otherwise new labs will be drawn.

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent : Each participant must be aware of
             the nature of his current medical condition and must be willing to give consent after
             being informed of the experimental nature of therapy, alternatives, potential
             benefits, side-effects, risks and discomforts.

          <title>Number of Participants With Proteasome Activity That Was Inhibited in the Range of 6%-29%.</title>
          <description>There is no expected range for “normal” activity since there is not currently a clinical indication for these molecular markers. Comparison of ranges can be made between groups (such as those that received treatment and not). This was an exploration of potential in the pilot study and further research is indicated to better understand the metabolic abnormalities observed in cancer cachexia as well as potential benefits of using agents such as EPA.</description>
