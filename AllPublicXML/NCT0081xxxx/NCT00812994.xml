  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study intended to determine if there are baseline differences in serum neurosteroid levels
      and neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in healthy controls vs unmedicated depressed subjects,
      and whether the levels of these change with antidepressant treatment. Study also intended to
      determine if baseline neurosteroid/ BDNF levels, and the change in these levels with
      =treatment, are correlated with clinical antidepressant response to escitalopram (Lexapro).

      The study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research, and all participants gave
      informed consent. The depressed subjects began treatment with placebo for one week, followed
      by escitalopram for eight weeks (10 mg per day x 4 weeks, followed by 20 mg per day x 4
      weeks, as tolerated) in a double-blind, fixed-order, within-subject cross-over manner. The
      depressed subjects and the psychiatric rater were unaware of the study design and the
      sequence and duration of treatments. Depressed and control subjects underwent venipuncture to
      obtain blood for assays. The controls underwent venipuncture once, and the depressed subjects
      had venipuncture just prior to beginning active escitalopram treatment and again after 8
      weeks of escitalopram treatment. Blood was also collected at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment in
      the depressed subjects for assay of citalopram and citalopram metabolites, to gauge
      medication compliance. Finally, depression severity and global clinical change were assessed
      in the depressed subjects at Baseline and at the end of Week 8 of escitalopram treatment.

      <textblock>
        Male subjects with unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (DSM-IV) with a minimum score of 22
        on the 10-item Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) who were medication-free
        for at least 6 weeks, were enrolled. Fifteen individually age-matched (+ 3 years) healthy
        male controls with no history of psychiatric illness were also enrolled. Subjects' ages
        ranged from 22- 55 y.o. (mean + S.D.= 41.4 + 8.75 y.o.). All subjects were required to pass
        a urine toxicology screen (assessing the presence of drugs of abuse) on the day of testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Individuals with co-morbid panic disorder were excluded, since they may poorly tolerate
        typical starting doses of antidepressants , and individuals with co-morbid post-traumatic
        stress disorder were excluded, since they may have neuroendocrine regulatory responses
        different from those of depressed subjects without PTSD. Exclusion criteria for both groups
        included recent (within 6 months) alcohol or drug abuse as defined by DSM-IV criteria,
        concurrent psychotherapeutic interventions, poor medical health or abnormal clinical labs,
        active suicidality, and use of medications that could interfere with the study.
