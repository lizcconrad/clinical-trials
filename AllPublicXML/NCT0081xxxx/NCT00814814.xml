  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of cardiac arrest is complicated by the lack of a readily available tool
      identifying individuals who are likely to be successfully resuscitated. S100 beta is a
      protein that originates in the astroglial cells of the brain, and NSE (Neuron Specific
      Enolase) is another protein that originates in the neurons themselves. In the laboratory, the
      concentration of these proteins correlate with evidence of brain damage after head trauma,
      stroke and exposure to low levels of oxygen. The concentration of these proteins in the blood
      of human survivors of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans is much higher than in patients
      who were resuscitated but did not survive. However, it is still unclear whether survivors
      from cardiopulmonary resuscitation have higher levels of these proteins in their blood if
      they survive with neurological injury secondary to the arrest and resuscitation.

      Hypothesis: In humans, the blood concentrations of protein S100 beta and NSE during and after
      resuscitation can predict who will die despite cardiopulmonary resuscitation and who will
      survive with neurological injury secondary to the arrest and resuscitation.
