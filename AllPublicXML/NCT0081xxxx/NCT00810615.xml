  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) improves the
      cognitive function of OIF/OEF individuals who have chronic mild to moderate traumatic brain
      injury (TBI). Cognitive function includes such things as thinking, remembering, recognition,
      concentration ability and perception. Traumatic brain injury is common with head injuries
      caused by blows to the head, nearby explosions, or concussion. Subjects will be assigned to
      an intervention or sham arm. Computer based cognitive tests will be used as outcome measures.
      Subjects are enrolled by invitation only.
