  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired retinal blood flow has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.
      Patel et al. (1992) showed that retinal blood flow increases with the level of diabetic
      retinopathy. Grunwald et al. (1996) reported that patients with insulin dependent diabetes
      mellitus (IDDM) of relatively short duration have increased retinal blood flow, even before
      the onset of diabetic retinopathy. On the other hand the data of Bursell et al. (1996)
      indicate that IDDM patients have reduced retinal blood flow, when they have normal blood
      glucose levels, but this study may have considerable methodological limitations. Acute
      elevations of blood glucose levels, however, result in an increase in retinal blood flow
      (Grunwald et al. 1987, Bursell et al. 1996). Based on previous experimental data the
      investigators hypothesize that ocular blood flow is increased in early diabetes and reduced
      at later stages of the disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that metabolic conditions
      such as hyperglycemia influence outcome parameters and thereby might have confounded results
      regarding ocular blood flow in diabetic retinopathy. The investigators will therefore study
      patients with IDDM during euglycemic conditions.
