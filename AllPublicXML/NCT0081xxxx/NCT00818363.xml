    <textblock>
      This is a research study testing SABER™-Bupivacaine (an experimental pain-relieving
      medication). SABER™-Bupivacaine is designed to continuously deliver bupivacaine, a common
      local anesthetic, for a few days in order to treat local post-surgical pain.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate safety (if there are any side effects) associated
      with the use of SABER™-Bupivacaine and how well it works in reducing pain and opioid-related
      side effects following shoulder surgery.
