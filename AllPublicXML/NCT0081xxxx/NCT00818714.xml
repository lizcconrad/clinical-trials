      This protocol is designed to use stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to deliver a
      boost dose to residual primary tumor after definitive doses of standard external beam
      radiation have been delivered concurrently with chemotherapy. It is designed to determine the
      toxicity profile(side effects) in the context of dose escalation of stereotactic body
      radiation therapy (SBRT) after definitive therapy with concurrent chemoradiation and to
      define the maximum tolerated dose.

      Serum levels of TGF-Beta1 have been demonstrated to correlate with the incidence of the
      radiation toxicity, pneumonitis in patients treated with standard external beam radiation.
      This study will serially follow TGF-Beta1 levels in patients to see if the same correlation
      exists with SBRT toxicity.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer will be required by either
             biopsy or cytology. The following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell
             carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, or
             non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise specified.

          2. Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as specific
             subsets of AJCC stage III based on only one of the following combinations of TNM
             staging:

               -  T1N2-3M0

               -  T2N2-3M0

               -  T3N1-3M0

               -  Patients with T4 tumors (by any definition) are not eligible

          3. Patients must have completed treatment with concurrent chemotherapy and external beam
             radiation therapy to radiation doses &gt;59.4Gy but &lt;70.2Gy to the primary tumor and
             doses &gt;45Gy but &lt;70.2Gy to mediastinal structures within 6 to 9 weeks of the first
             SBRT &quot;Boost&quot; treatment.

          4. Patients must have had repeat staging performed after their chemoradiation and within
             28 days of their first protocol treatment including: CT scan of chest and upper
             abdomen, FDG-18 PET scan and MRI of the brain. These studies must demonstrate no
             disease outside of the thorax.

          5. The primary tumor must be deemed technically resectable after chemoradiation by an
             experienced thoracic cancer clinician, with a reasonable possibility of obtaining a
             gross total resection with negative margins (defined as a potentially curative
             resection, PCR). However, the patient must not be a candidate for PCR based on
             pathologic evidence of persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy after chemoradiation or
             because of underlying physiological medical problems that would prohibit a PCR due to
             a low probability of tolerating general anesthesia, the operation, the postoperative
             recovery period, or the removal of adjacent functioning lung. These types of patients
             with severe underlying health problems are deemed &quot;medically inoperable.&quot; Standard
             justification for deeming a patient medically inoperable based on pulmonary function
             for surgical resection of NSCLC may include any of the following: Baseline FEV1 &lt; 40%
             predicted, post-operative predicted FEV1 &lt; 30% predicted, severely reduced diffusion
             capacity, baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50%
             predicted, severe pulmonary hypertension, diabetes mellitus with severe end organ
             damage, severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease, or severe chronic
             heart disease.

          6. Patients must be â‰¥ 18 years of age.

          7. The patient's Zubrod performance status must be Zubrod 0-2.

          8. Women of childbearing potential and male participants must use an effective
             contraceptive method such as condom/diaphragm and spermicidal foam, intrauterine
             device (IUD), or prescription birth control pills.

          9. Pretreatment Evaluations Required for Eligibility include:

               -  CT scan (preferably with intravenous contrast) to include the entirety of both
                  lungs, the mediastinum, liver, and adrenal glands; Primary tumor dimension will
                  be measured on CT.

               -  Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scan using FDG with adequate
                  visualization of the primary tumor and draining lymph node basins in the hilar

               -  MRI of the brain

         10. Patients must sign a study-specific consent form.
