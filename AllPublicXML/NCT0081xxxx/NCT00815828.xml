      The object of this study is to evaluate patients with a diagnosis of GD who are included in a
      program of RE carried out with rubber tubes, comparing the frequency of women who will use
      insulin in the group who will participate in the program with the group that won't do the
      exercises, and to verify the impact of the program on the adequacy of capillary glycemic
      control of the pregnant women.

             exercises

          -  With single pregnancy without fetal malformation:gestational age between 24 and 34
             weeks, which have no other condition that contraindicate the conduct of exercises,

          -  Patients who start any form of physical activity after being randomized to the control
             group

             after being randomized to the intervention group

          -  Patients who were to use another product than insulin as a form of glycemic control

          -  Patients to abandon the study
