  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) because pancreatic
      beta-cells no longer produce sufficient insulin. Insufficient beta-cell function can be
      caused by an autoimmune killing of the beta-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D), or by poorly
      understood mechanisms in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) improves
      function of the insulin-producing beta cells, but GLP-1 has a very short circulating
      half-life because it is cleaved by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4). One current
      treatment being used to improve glycemia control in patients with T2D is sitagliptin, an
      inhibitor of DPP-4. By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases GLP-1 levels, resulting in
      improved beta cell function. Sitagliptin is now being tested in individuals with new-onset
      T1D to determine whether it may help to preserve beta cell function. Because T1D is a disease
      in which the immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, we wish
      to determine if and how sitagliptin alters immune function. Sitagliptin has been shown by
      Merck to be safe and effective with no overt immuno-toxicities. However, several lines of
      evidence suggest that DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin could be immunomodulatory.

      This randomized clinical trial will study immune function in healthy volunteers given
      short-term (4 week) treatment with either sitagliptin or placebo. During the study, we will
      take blood samples at various time intervals before, during and after treatment. We will
      compare the immune response with and without sitagliptin treatment using blood samples from
      healthy individuals. We will measure changes in the magnitude and type of immune responses.
      The study period is nine weeks. The study s primary outcome will be changes in blood plasma
      levels of a protein marker associated with decreased inflammation: Transforming Growth Factor
      Beta 1 (TGF beta 1). In addition, we plan to use these blood samples to measure sitagliptin s
      effect on expression levels of several cytokines (immune proteins). We will also measure the
      level of proliferation in stimulated PBMCs (blood immune cells) and gene expression in whole
      blood after sitagliptin treatment.

      Patients with diabetes have high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) because pancreatic
      b-cells no longer produce sufficient insulin. Insufficient b-cell function can be caused by
      an autoimmune killing of the b-cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D), or by poorly understood
      mechanisms in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide -1 (GLP-1) improves function of
