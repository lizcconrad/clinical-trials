  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a pure heart rate-lowering agent
      (Ivabradine) reduces vascular inflammatory stress in patients with acute coronary syndromes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The activation of inflammatory pathways plays an important contributory role in coronary
      plaque instability and subsequent rupture, which can lead to the development of acute
      coronary syndromes. Elevated levels of serum inflammatory markers such as high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) represent independent risk factors for further cardiovascular
      events. Raised resting heart rate (HR) has been shown to be associated with cardiovascular
      events. Ivabradine is a new HR-reducing agent, which has demonstrated antianginal and
      anti-ischemic properties in patients with stable angina. In an atherosclerosis model,
      selective HR reduction with ivabradine has been shown to decrease markers of vascular
      oxidative stress, to improve endothelial function, and to reduce atherosclerotic plaque
      formation. We hypothesized that the addition of ivabradine to standard medical therapy has a
      beneficial effect on markers of inflammatory stress in acute coronary syndrome patients.

    <description>Eligible patients will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment arms, namely, double-blind ivabradine, or placebo, after hospital admission (at 48 hours). The starting dose of ivabradine will be 5 mg (or matching placebo) twice daily in all patients. Patients receiving 5 mg twice daily (or matching placebo) 1 week after the inclusion with a resting HR of ≥60 beats per minute will receive the target dose of 7.5 mg twice daily (or matching placebo).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female.

          2. Age &gt; 18 years.

          3. Ischemic symptoms suspected to represent a non-ST segment elevation acute coronary
             syndrome defined as:

             Clinical history consistent with new onset, or a worsening pattern, of characteristic
             ischemic chest pain occuring at rest or with minimal exertion (lasting longer than 10
             min) and planned to be managed with an early invasive strategy with intention to
             perform a percutaneous coronary intervention as early as possible and not later than
             72 hours of randomization, and at least one of the following:

               1. ECG changes compatible with new ischemia (ST depression of at least 1 mm or
