  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy, safety
      and cost of two regimens, Rapamycin / MMF / steroid therapy and Cyclosporine A Neoral / MMF /
      steroid therapy, used in the prevention of acute rejection following renal transplantation.

      This pilot study is designed to show differences in efficacy, safety and cost between the two
      regimens. Its main purpose is to provide information, if calcineurin free immunosuppressive
      treatment is a valuable alternative in the treatment of de novo kidney transplant recipients.
      Furthermore, by investigating the side effects in both arms it will be possible to decide, if
      the absence of calcineurin inhibition and lack of nephrotoxicity will outweigh the adverse
      effects of Rapamycin. With the obtained information it will be possible to plan a larger
      trial, which is warranted to compare the mentioned treatment regimens in more detail.
