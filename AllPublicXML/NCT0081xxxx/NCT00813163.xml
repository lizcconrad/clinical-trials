      The purpose of this study is to see the effect of PEP02 in the treatment of metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine monotherapy or a gemcitabine-based combination regimen is the standard first line
      therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer. After disease progression, there is no standard
      treatment available. In animal studies and a previous phase I trial, PEP02 has shown
      anti-tumor activity and preliminary efficacy in pancreatic cancer. In addition, a phase II
      study of free-form irinotecan single agent has already shown encouraging activity as
      second-line treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer refractory to gemcitabine.
      The liposome formulation of PEP02 theoretically has therapeutic advantages over free-form
      irinotecan, such as site-specific delivery and extended release of drug. Hence PEP02 may be
      able to provide better efficacy than free-form irinotecan.

      The primary purpose of this phase II study is to evaluate the activity of PEP02 as a
      second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer failed to gemcitabine
      treatment. The primary goal is to measure the 3-month survival rate. An optimal Simon's
      2-stage design will be used for this exploratory phase II study.
