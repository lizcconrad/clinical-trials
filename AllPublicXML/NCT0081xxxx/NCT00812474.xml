  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a common disease affecting 1/1000 Canadians. Cognition impairment
      is reported in 40-65% of patients and is socially and functionally disabling. Although
      multiple sclerosis is widely regarded as a white matter disease, cortical disease burden is
      increasingly emphasized. Studies confirm that gray matter (GM) disease is grossly
      underestimated by conventional MRI. Although the cause for MS is unknown vascular impairment
      is implicated in nerve cell death. Several studies have shown perfusion abnormalities in the
      central GM and white matter (WM) structure. Severity of perfusion reduction correlates with
      lesion load, atrophy, MS subtype and disease duration. Further extent of cortical atrophy
      correlates with neurocognitive impairment. We hypothesize that cortical perfusion is a marker
      of cortical disease severity and correlates with neurocognitive impairment. To show this we
      will measure regional cortical perfusion and regional brain and WM lesion volumes in 26
      predefined brain regions using a template developed for Alzheimer's disease. Regional
      perfusion will be correlated with neurocognitive tests validated for MS use. Patients will be
      divided into impaired and non impaired and perfusion compared controlling for known
      confounding factors. If confirmed cortical perfusion may be utilized as a surrogate marker of
      cognitive outcome in therapeutic studies.
