      This study is intended to determine the dose response and duration of action of GSK2190915 in
      mild asthmatic adult subjects who experience exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Subjects
      will be invited to complete a screening visit, during which time exercise induced
      bronchoconstriction must be demonstrated, defined as a decrease between 20-40% in FEV1
      compared to baseline immediately following exercise challenge. Eligible subjects will
      complete a randomized, double-blind, five-way crossover study. Subjects will be randomized to
      a single dose of either 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg GSK2190915, or placebo during each
      treatment period. Each treatment period will last 2 days and will include various assessments
      following exercise challenge at 2, 9.5, and 24 hours post dose. A minimum 7 day washout
      between treatment periods will be required. Regardless if a subject completes or prematurely
      withdraws from the study, a follow up visit will be completed 7-21 days following last dose.

    <measure>Maximal Percentage Change From Pre-exercise Baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) to the Minimum FEV1 Collected Within 60 Minutes Following the Exercise Challenge at 24 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre dose) and 60 minutes following the exercise challenge at 24 hours post dose of each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge. The maximal percentage change within 60 minutes following exercise challenge was derived by taking minimum (i.e., most negative) percentage change in FEV1 over 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge. Percent change FEV1 = 100*(FEV1 - Pre-challenge FEV1)/ Pre-challenge FEV1. If the exercise challenge was not completed successfully (i.e. heart rate maintained at &gt;=80% of the predicted value for 6 minutes), FEV1 maximal percent change (0-60)was set to be missing. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects model, including period, treatment and covariates for predose FEV1. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals for treatment difference between each active dose and placebo for each challenge time point were calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre dose) and 60 minutes following the exercise challenge at 2 and 9.5 hours post dose of each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge. The maximal percentage change within 60 minutes following exercise challenge was derived by taking minimum percentage change in FEV1 over 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge.

    <measure>Weighted Mean (WM) for FEV1 Percentage Change From Baseline Recorded During 0 to 60 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge (FEV1 WM0-60)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre dose) and 0 to 60 minutes following exercise challenge at 2, 9.5 and 24 hours post dose of each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge.Weighted mean FEV1 percentage change recorded during 0-60 minutes post challenge was determined for each challenge, by dividing area under curve (AUC) for percent change from Baseline FEV1 measurements at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge by time interval. Actual times were used to determine time interval where available; otherwise planned relative time was used. If one or more FEV1 values were missing, AUC was calculated over time interval of available values. If intermittent values were missing over a participant's profile,it was assumed to be linear between 2 available values for calculation of AUC. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects model, including period, treatment and covariates for predose FEV1.</description>

    <measure>Time to FEV1 Recovery to Within 5 Percent of Baseline Following Exercise Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 60 minutes following exercise challenge at 2, 9.5 and 24 hours post dose of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The time from maximal percentage change in FEV1 to recovery to within 5% of pre challenge Baseline (in minutes) was derived using actual sampling times. Time to FEV1 recovery= [SAS date/time of recovery(a) FEV1 - SAS date/time of FEV1 Maximum % Change0-60] / 60, where &quot;a&quot; is earliest recorded FEV1 either above pre-challenge Baseline or within 5% below pre challenge Baseline. Any unscheduled FEV1 measurements taken after last scheduled post challenge measurement was considered when deriving this endpoint. A corresponding censoring variable was derived for analysis to indicate whether recovery to within 5% of pre-challenge Baseline was achieved. The censoring variable was set to 1 if recovery to within 5% of Baseline was achieved. If recovery was not evident from data collected, time to recovery was calculated using the date/time of the last available post challenge FEV1 assessment and censoring variable was set to zero. Analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model.</description>

    <description>Rescue medication was provided to participants at any time and it was strongly recommended for participants with a FEV1 decrease of at least 40% following exercise challenge compared to Baseline. Rescue medication was administered 0 to 90 minutes post exercise challenge. Statistical analysis was supposed to be performed using logistic regression, however, the data was too sparse to permit any formal statistical analysis.</description>

        <title>Maximal Percentage Change From Pre-exercise Baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) to the Minimum FEV1 Collected Within 60 Minutes Following the Exercise Challenge at 24 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge. The maximal percentage change within 60 minutes following exercise challenge was derived by taking minimum (i.e., most negative) percentage change in FEV1 over 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge. Percent change FEV1 = 100*(FEV1 – Pre-challenge FEV1)/ Pre-challenge FEV1. If the exercise challenge was not completed successfully (i.e. heart rate maintained at &gt;=80% of the predicted value for 6 minutes), FEV1 maximal percent change (0-60)was set to be missing. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects model, including period, treatment and covariates for predose FEV1. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals for treatment difference between each active dose and placebo for each challenge time point were calculated.</description>

        <title>Maximal Percentage Change From Pre-exercise Baseline FEV1 to the Minimum FEV1 Collected Within 60 Minutes Following the Exercise Challenge at 2 and 9.5 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge. The maximal percentage change within 60 minutes following exercise challenge was derived by taking minimum percentage change in FEV1 over 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge. Percent change FEV1 = 100*(FEV1 – Pre-challenge FEV1)/ Pre-challenge FEV1. If the exercise challenge was not completed successfully (i.e. heart rate maintained at &gt;=80% of the predicted value for 6 minutes), the FEV1 maximal percent change (0-60)was set to be missing. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects model, including period, treatment and covariates for predose FEV1. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals for treatment difference between each active dose and placebo for each challenge time point were calculated.</description>

        <title>Weighted Mean (WM) for FEV1 Percentage Change From Baseline Recorded During 0 to 60 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge (FEV1 WM0-60)</title>
        <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge.Weighted mean FEV1 percentage change recorded during 0-60 minutes post challenge was determined for each challenge, by dividing area under curve (AUC) for percent change from Baseline FEV1 measurements at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge by time interval. Actual times were used to determine time interval where available; otherwise planned relative time was used. If one or more FEV1 values were missing, AUC was calculated over time interval of available values. If intermittent values were missing over a participant’s profile,it was assumed to be linear between 2 available values for calculation of AUC. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects model, including period, treatment and covariates for predose FEV1.</description>

          <title>Weighted Mean (WM) for FEV1 Percentage Change From Baseline Recorded During 0 to 60 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge (FEV1 WM0-60)</title>
          <description>FEV1 was recorded in triplicate, with participant encouraged to inhale fully despite any presence of chest tightness. For FEV1, a pre-challenge Baseline was defined for each challenge time point as maximum of triplicate measurements performed prior to challenge.Weighted mean FEV1 percentage change recorded during 0-60 minutes post challenge was determined for each challenge, by dividing area under curve (AUC) for percent change from Baseline FEV1 measurements at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes post challenge by time interval. Actual times were used to determine time interval where available; otherwise planned relative time was used. If one or more FEV1 values were missing, AUC was calculated over time interval of available values. If intermittent values were missing over a participant’s profile,it was assumed to be linear between 2 available values for calculation of AUC. Analysis was performed using a mixed effects model, including period, treatment and covariates for predose FEV1.</description>

        <title>Time to FEV1 Recovery to Within 5 Percent of Baseline Following Exercise Challenge</title>
        <description>The time from maximal percentage change in FEV1 to recovery to within 5% of pre challenge Baseline (in minutes) was derived using actual sampling times. Time to FEV1 recovery= [SAS date/time of recovery(a) FEV1 – SAS date/time of FEV1 Maximum % Change0-60] / 60, where &quot;a&quot; is earliest recorded FEV1 either above pre-challenge Baseline or within 5% below pre challenge Baseline. Any unscheduled FEV1 measurements taken after last scheduled post challenge measurement was considered when deriving this endpoint. A corresponding censoring variable was derived for analysis to indicate whether recovery to within 5% of pre-challenge Baseline was achieved. The censoring variable was set to 1 if recovery to within 5% of Baseline was achieved. If recovery was not evident from data collected, time to recovery was calculated using the date/time of the last available post challenge FEV1 assessment and censoring variable was set to zero. Analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model.</description>

          <title>Time to FEV1 Recovery to Within 5 Percent of Baseline Following Exercise Challenge</title>
          <description>The time from maximal percentage change in FEV1 to recovery to within 5% of pre challenge Baseline (in minutes) was derived using actual sampling times. Time to FEV1 recovery= [SAS date/time of recovery(a) FEV1 – SAS date/time of FEV1 Maximum % Change0-60] / 60, where &quot;a&quot; is earliest recorded FEV1 either above pre-challenge Baseline or within 5% below pre challenge Baseline. Any unscheduled FEV1 measurements taken after last scheduled post challenge measurement was considered when deriving this endpoint. A corresponding censoring variable was derived for analysis to indicate whether recovery to within 5% of pre-challenge Baseline was achieved. The censoring variable was set to 1 if recovery to within 5% of Baseline was achieved. If recovery was not evident from data collected, time to recovery was calculated using the date/time of the last available post challenge FEV1 assessment and censoring variable was set to zero. Analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Using a Short Acting Beta-2 Agonist (Rescue Medication) During 0 to 90 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge</title>
        <description>Rescue medication was provided to participants at any time and it was strongly recommended for participants with a FEV1 decrease of at least 40% following exercise challenge compared to Baseline. Rescue medication was administered 0 to 90 minutes post exercise challenge. Statistical analysis was supposed to be performed using logistic regression, however, the data was too sparse to permit any formal statistical analysis.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Using a Short Acting Beta-2 Agonist (Rescue Medication) During 0 to 90 Minutes Following Exercise Challenge</title>
          <description>Rescue medication was provided to participants at any time and it was strongly recommended for participants with a FEV1 decrease of at least 40% following exercise challenge compared to Baseline. Rescue medication was administered 0 to 90 minutes post exercise challenge. Statistical analysis was supposed to be performed using logistic regression, however, the data was too sparse to permit any formal statistical analysis.</description>

        <description>All participants rested for at least 10 minutes in the supine position prior to ECG recordings. ECG Baseline values for each treatment period was calculated using the mean value of triplicate pre dose readings. Triplicate readings were taken at least five minutes apart. Assessment was performed at pre dose, 2 hours, 9.5 hours, 24 hours prior to exercise challenge and 60 minutes following exercise challenge at 2 hours. Participants with not clinically significant (NCS) abnormal values were reported. Potential clinical importance range for the ECG parameters are as follows: absolute QTc interval &gt;450 millisecond (msec), increase from Baseline QTc &gt;60 msec, PR interval &lt;110 and &gt;220 msec and QRS interval &lt;75 and &gt;110 msec. No participants reported clinically significant abnormal values.</description>
