      To assay the influence of personality profile to promote behavior change adherence for
      physical activity using a pedometer. The investigators also studied the metabolic profile,
      diagnosis of depression, intention to change behavior, physical activity referred and the
      quality of life. Casuistic and Methods: a randomized &quot;quasi-experimental&quot; enrolling 48 T2DM
      patients using a pedometer for 6 weeks. The intervention group received phone calls
      stimulating them to increase their walking activity. The control group received only one
      telephone call to explain pedometer use. The investigators also analyzed the personality
      profile, quality of life, and metabolic and anthropometric indexes.
