      This was an open-label, uncontrolled, and multi-centered phase II clinical trial for
      evaluation of the clinical efficacy and hemodynamics and safety of nesiritide. The study was
      conducted in hospital setting and all patients exhibited symptoms of acute decompensated
      heart failure, requiring treatment with intravenous drug administration. The total duration
      was 180 days, including a screening phase, an open treatment phase (24 hours in all) and a
      safety follow-up phase (day 30 and day 180). Screening phase: Right heart floating catheter
      was placed for patients with acute decompensate heart failure who met the inclusion criteria
      while not the exclusion criteria to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The results
      should be =20 mmHg. Open treatment phase: Nesiritide was administered by intravenous
      injection at a dose of 2 µg/kg for 60 second, followed by intravenous infusion at a dose of
      0.01 µg/kg for 24 hour. All the patients were monitored for hemodynamics for 24 hour. Safety
      follow-up phase: On day 30, all the patients were required to return to the study center for
      follow-up. Information about death, severe adverse event, re-hospitalization and serum
      creatinine was collected. On day 180, all the patients were followed up by telephone.
      Information about death and severe adverse event was collected. Pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressure will be measured at 15 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hour and 24 hour, compared with baseline
      value. Nesiritide is white to off-white sterile lyophilized lump or powder, supplied in
      transparent 5 mL glass vials. The investigational drug was administered via infusion pump.
      Infusion rate was adjusted according to body weight. The drug was administered directly via
      venous cannula or the nearest injection port to the venous cannula for 60 second. The dosage
      of nesiritide was 2 µg/kg. The infusion rate of nesiritide was adjusted to 0.01 µg/kg/min
      (cannot exceed 0.01 µg/kg/min).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Systolic blood pressure&gt; 90 mmHg

          -  The subjects must present with dyspnoea at resting state or with minimum activity
             amount (such as standing up)

          -  Onset at this time was complicated with symptoms of acute decompensate heart failure,
             and it was serious enough to call for hospitalization and treatment with intravenous
             drug administration

          -  Acute decompensate heart failure was caused by cardiogenic factors rather than
             pulmonary factors (for example, it was neither cor pulmonale nor chronic heart failure
             complicated with pneumonia)

          -  The patients must have at least two of manifestations that related with this acute
             onset.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with systolic blood pressure =90 mmHg

          -  patients who had been administered with intravenous nitroglycerin or other intravenous
             vasoactive drugs within 2 hour before administration of the investigational drug

          -  Patients who had known or suspected acute coronary syndrome (Myocardial infarction
             with or without increased ST segment, or unstable myocardial infarction) within 2
             weeks before administration of the investigational drug

          -  Patients with cardiac shock or clinical manifestation of uncorrected hypovolemia or
             sodium depletion (such as clinical signs of excessive diuresis or dehydration), or
             clinical manifestation induced by other forbidden venous vasoactive agents

          -  Patients with such extremely emergent and unstable clinical conditions that not
             tolerant to Swan-Ganz catheter or temporal baseline evaluation

          -  patients with obvious cardiac valvular stenosis (subjects treated by valve-replacement
             can be included), hypertrophic, restrictive, or obstructive myocardial disease,
             primary pulmonary hypertension, or complex congenital heart disease.
