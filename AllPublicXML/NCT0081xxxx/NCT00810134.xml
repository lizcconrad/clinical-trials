    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare PTFE-graft bypass surgery versus Viabahn endoprosthesis
      for femoropopliteal arterial occlusion in intermittent claudication and critical ischaemia in
      patients who would be technically amenable for both treatments. The primary objective is to
      compare primary patencies of the two treatments. The secondary objective of the study is to
      evaluate secondary patency, functional status, the quality of life and costs of the new
      endovascular therapy.

    <textblock>
      Femoropopliteal bypass graft surgery with PTFE-prosthesis has proven to be an acceptable
      treatment for stable incapacitating claudication and critical ischaemia in patients with
      superficial femoral artery occlusion. Preliminary results of a thrupass endoprosthesis in the
      treatment of femoral lesions are promising. Less morbidity and better cost-effectiveness are
      suggested to be achieved in treatment of chronic lower limb ischaemia with endovascular
      treatment comparing to surgical treatment.

      A randomised multicentre trial aims to enrol a pilot group of 60 + 60 patients to be followed
      for 3 years. Patients are treated either with Viabahn thrupass endoprosthesis (Gore corp.) or
      with 6 mm PTFE-prosthesis bypass graft surgery. Primary patency at three years is the primary
      end point and secondary patency, functional success, costs and quality of life are the
      secondary end points.
