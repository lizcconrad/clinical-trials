    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and 12-lead ECG. A
             subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference
             range for the population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:

               -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
                  oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or

               -  Is post-menopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle
                  stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed to confirm a post-menopausal
                  status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 mlU/ml is confirmatory.

          -  A male is eligible to enter and participate in the study if he is surgically sterile
             OR if he either agrees to abstain from sexual intercourse with a female partner or
             agrees to use a condom/spermicide, in addition to having his female partner use
             another form of contraception as outlined in Section 7.1.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50 kg (110 lbs.) for men and &gt;= 45 kg (99 lbs) for women and body mass
             index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject or the
             subject's legal representative prior to screening.

          -  Subject must be capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance
             with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination, or screening
             investigations, the Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  Has a positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen; positive hepatitis C (HCV)
             antibody or detectable HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA); or positive HIV-1 antibody result.

          -  Has a history of regular alcohol consumption averaging &gt;7 drinks/week for women or &gt;14
             drinks/week for men within 6 months of the screening visit.

        Note: 1 drink is equivalent to 12 g alcohol = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces (360
        ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to the start of dosing until
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample during each treatment period.

          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated
             restrictions while participating in the study.

          -  The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research
             trial within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect
             of any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.

          -  Participation in the study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 mL
             within a 56 day period.

        Note: This does not include plasma donation.

        - History or presence of allergy or intolerance to the study drug or its components or
        drugs of its class, or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
        physician responsible, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if heparin is used
        during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced
        thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

        Note: &quot;Study&quot; or &quot;investigational&quot; drugs include GSK1265744 or placebo.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG per protocol

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.

          -  Has a history of regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3
             months of the screening visit.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug and/or alcohol screen.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including antacids, vitamins, herbal
             and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort and iron supplements) within 7 days
             (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures
             or compromise subject safety
