  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of Zolpidem CR to that of
      placebo in improving sleep efficiency in people with dementia admitted to the hospital
      because of their symptoms. You can participate in this study if you have dementia of the
      Alzheimer's type or vascular dementia. This study involves placebo; a placebo is a tablet
      that looks exactly like Zolpidem CR, the study drug, but contains no active study drug. We
      will use placebos to see if the study results are due to the study drug or due to other
      reasons. Zolpidem CR is also called Ambien CR and is widely available by prescription.
      Zolpidem CR is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the short-term
      treatment of insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep patterns normally change with age. Sleep/wake cycles appear to be compromised in people
      suffering from dementia. Most research involving sleep in dementia has involved community
      dwelling or nursing home residents. Relatively little is known about the sleep patterns of
      patients with dementia who develop acute behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and necessitate
      hospitalization. The relationship between sleep disturbances in these patients and
      behavioral/psychiatric symptoms is also insufficiently studied. The current study will
      examine these two sets of data (sleep/wake cycles and clinical symptoms) in a population of
      elderly subjects with Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT) or vascular dementia (VD) during
      their hospitalization period. We will compare the sleep outcome measures (primarily sleep
      efficiency) and clinical outcome measures in subjects treated with Zolpidem CR or Placebo. We
      will utilize a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to test our hypothesis
      that targeting sleep disturbances in hospitalized elderly subjects with DAT or VD leads to
      improvement in sleep and clinical outcomes.

    <time_frame>Post-intervention, up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep efficiency during the down interval. The down interval signifies the period of time (in minutes) at night when subjects are in bed and trying to sleep. Sleep efficiency is calculated as (100*sleep minutes)/[time interval from sleep onset (as defined by the sleep latency) to sleep offset (the end of the last sleep episode in the Down interval)].
The time period was different for each patient, it was their duration of hospitalization. The first 48 hours patients were not on the study drug, so the reported least squares mean is an estimate of the mean for the subsequent time period where the patients received different therapies. These means are corrected for differences that might have existed during the first 48 hours. The results would be similar to the results attained from considering the mean during the first 48 hours as a baseline covariate in an Analysis of Covariance, but would be more robust to missing data.</description>

Inclusion criteria included age between 60-99 years and a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia and/or vascular dementia using DSM-IV criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>3 subjects signed informed consent (IC) but were never randomized, and are not included in the table below. One changed his mind prior to randomization; another had untreated sleep apnea, discovered the day after he signed IC; the IC of a third subject was not received from her health care proxy until after her discharge from the hospital.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Sleep Efficiency</title>
        <description>Sleep efficiency during the down interval. The down interval signifies the period of time (in minutes) at night when subjects are in bed and trying to sleep. Sleep efficiency is calculated as (100*sleep minutes)/[time interval from sleep onset (as defined by the sleep latency) to sleep offset (the end of the last sleep episode in the Down interval)].
The time period was different for each patient, it was their duration of hospitalization. The first 48 hours patients were not on the study drug, so the reported least squares mean is an estimate of the mean for the subsequent time period where the patients received different therapies. These means are corrected for differences that might have existed during the first 48 hours. The results would be similar to the results attained from considering the mean during the first 48 hours as a baseline covariate in an Analysis of Covariance, but would be more robust to missing data.</description>
