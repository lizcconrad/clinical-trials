    <textblock>
      VTE prophylaxis is not as routinely employed in medically ill patients as compared to
      surgical patients. This retrospective chart review project will evaluate the effectiveness of
      VTE prophylaxis in medically ill patients at the University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics
      compared to current literature. The study will ultimately serve as a quality improvement
      project to help improve patient care.

    <description>(1) a risk-assessment tool completed at the time of a hospital admission, (2) structured educational sessions on VTE prevention, and (3) audit-feedback where institutional data was reviewed during the educational sessions. These sessions were given once to the clinical pharmacists and on three separate occasions to the medicine house officers.</description>

        Data was collected on consecutive patients â‰¥18 years with a hospital length of stay of &gt;48
        hours admitted to the cardiology, pulmonary, or general medical services. Admission dates
        were a sample of two different two-week blocks (January 1-14, 2006 and April 1-14, 2006).
        These blocks were chosen to be consistent with dates of analysis in the pre-intervention
        cohort. Patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation were excluded.
