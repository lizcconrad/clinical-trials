      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of sunitinib malate when given
      together with hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors that have
      not responded to chemotherapy. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Hydroxychloroquine may help sunitinib malate work better in treating solid tumors. Giving
      sunitinib malate together with hydroxychloroquine may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of sunitinib (sunitinib
      malate) (Sutent), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic activity that
      inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), stem cell factor receptor
      (c-kit) and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), in combination with
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an inhibitor of autophagy, in patients with advanced solid tumors
      that are refractory to standard chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluating blocks of tissue from pre-treatment diagnostic biopsies and tissue from
      biopsies taken during therapy, when available from enrolled patients, for expression of
      markers beclin1, light chain 3 (LC3), sequestosome 1 (p62) and hypoxia up-regulated 1
      (GRp170) as indicators of autophagy potential.

      II. Evaluating pre- and post- treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumor
      tissue, when available, for the presence of autophagosomes by electron microscopy (EM) as
      indication of flux through the autophagy pathway.

      III. Evaluating pre- and post- treatment PBMC for changes in the expression of LC3, p62 and
      GRp170 with the use of single agent sunitinib and the use of the combination of sunitinib
      with hydroxychloroquine.

      IV. Evaluating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pre- and post- treatment with single agent
      sunitinib and sunitinib + HCQ, and characterize these for markers of autophagy. (exploratory)
      V. To determine whether the steady-state plasma concentration of HCQ correlates with
      inhibition of autophagy and whether a pharmacokinetic interaction exists between sunitinib
      and HCQ.

      VI. To examine, when available, post treatment tumor biopsies for vascular markers to detect
      decreased vascular proliferation by staining cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thrombospondin-1, and cluster of differentiation 105
      (CD105) staining to monitor micro vessel density.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of hydroxychloroquine.

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and
      hydroxychloroquine PO once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-42 (beginning day 4 of
      course 1). Treatment repeats every 42 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

             tumor, malignant seizures, untreated CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis or CNS
             metastases)

          -  Patient must not have ongoing ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias of grade = 2 as
             described by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Active Version of the
             National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (CTCAE); patients with a history of serious ventricular arrhythmia (ventricular
             tachycardia [VT] or ventricular fibrillation [VF] &gt; 3 beats in a row) are also
             excluded; additionally, patients with ongoing atrial fibrillation are not eligible

          -  Corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;= 500 msec on baseline electrocardiogram (EKG)

             cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolus

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are excluded due to possibility
             of unknown side effects on the immune system by these agents; the potential impact of
             pharmacokinetic interactions of retroviral therapy with sunitinib is unknown;
             appropriate studies may be undertaken in patients with HIV and those receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy in the future

          -  Because sunitinib is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily
             A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) liver enzyme, the eligibility of patients taking medications
             that are potent inducers or inhibitors of that enzyme will be determined following a
             review of their case by the principal investigator; every effort should be made to

          -  Must not have psoriasis or porphyria

          -  Must not have known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compound

             or any of their components

          -  Must not be taking hydroxychloroquine for treatment or prophylaxis of malaria

             administration of antimalarials)

          -  History of gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within the
             previous 28 days

          -  Serious, non-healing infection, bone fracture or nonhealing ulcer or wound

          -  Current treatment on another clinical trial; participation in non-therapeutic clinical
             trials is permissible

          -  Patients with nephrotic syndrome

          -  Cataracts that would interfere with required funduscopic examinations, or severe
