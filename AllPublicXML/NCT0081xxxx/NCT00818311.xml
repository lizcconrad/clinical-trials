  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photomodulation is a process which manipulates or regulates cell activity using light sources
      without thermal effect. Different studies have investigated the use of non-thermal low dose
      light emitting diode (LED) array for improving the appearance of photo aging damage. The
      photomodulation concept includes a low energy, narrow band or coherent light with specific
      pulse sequences and durations.

      Preliminary investigations done by McDaniel et al. demonstrated that fibroblast activity
      could be regulated using pulsing light at specific wavelenghts. Using a variety of LED light
      sources, his group has demonstrated that by varying light pulses and other parameters,
      procollagen synthesis could be upregulated in human skin fibroblast culture [McDaniel DH, et
      al.Lasers Surg Med. 2002; 14-251]. A clinical correlation was also shown based on different
      clinical trials data on around 1000 subjects, LED has shown up to 90% improvement in wrinkles
      and an increase of collagen synthesis versus control with little or no side effects
      associated [Weiss, RA et al. Lasers Surg Med 2005; 36(2): 85-91- Weiss, RA et al.: J Drugs
      Dermatol 2004; 3(6): 605-610 - Weiss RA et al. Dermatol Surg 2005; 31(9):1999-1204 - Russel
      BA et al. J Cosmet Laser Ther 2005; 7 (3-4):196-200 - Bhat J et al. Laser Med Sci 2005;
      20(1):6-10]. Based on these promising clinical data, Light BioScience submitted a dossier to
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and obtained in January 2005 the FDA approval for its
      GentleWaves® Light Emitting Diode (LED) for the non-invasive treatment of periorbital (eye
      area) wrinkles and rhytids. The LED technology has been considered by FDA as non significant
      risk. In Europe, the GentleWaves® Light Emitting Diode has obtained the notified body
      certification for the same indication. This medical claim is associated with cosmetic
      improvement of aging and sun-damaged skin, further validation the science of LED
      photomodulation skin rejuvenation [Investigator's Brochure. Version 1].

      This approval has been obtained with a professional LED GentleWaves® device used under a
      physician's responsibility. The initial regimen of 35 seconds twice per week with at least
      two days in between treatment for a total of 4 weeks duration of treatment has demonstrated
      efficacy for the treatment of typical signs of photo aging and no adverse effect.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate different treatment regimens in order to be able to
      develop new indications or to optimize the result already obtained in the treatment of
      wrinkles around the eyes. We therefore propose to perform a safety clinical trial with male
      and female volunteers with different schedules per day or per week.

      A total of 100 subjects (male and female) will be randomized in the study according to the
      following schedule of exposure:

      Group A: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED twice a week for one
      cycle (35 seconds) with an interval between treatments of at least 2 days, during a treatment
      period of 4 weeks.

      Group B: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED twice a week for two
      consecutive cycles (35 seconds each) with an interval between treatments of at least 2 days,
      during a treatment period of 4 weeks.

      Group C: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35
      seconds) twice a day (morning and evening). This treatment will be repeated twice a week with
      an interval between treatments of at least 2 days, during a treatment period of 4 weeks.

      Group D: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for one cycle (35
      seconds) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4 weeks.

      Group E: 20 subjects (8 males - 12 females) will be exposed to the LED for two consecutive
      cycles (35 seconds each) every day (from Monday to Friday) during a treatment of period of 4
      weeks.
