      ***Please note that this study does not offer comprehensive treatment program for alcohol
      abuse or depression. Please do not contact the study staff if you are seeking psychological
      treatment. Further, this study is only enrolling people who are clients at Career and

      The hypothesis is that writing about feelings and thoughts will help people who are in group
      treatment feel less depressed and abuse alcohol less.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Expressive writing applied to a variety of populations (e.g., HIV, cancer, PTSD, depression)
      has been associated with health improvements, reductions in symptoms of emotional distress,
      and one preliminary study found reductions in alcohol misuse among college students. Data
      suggest that expressive writing is a technique to facilitate emotional processing that can
      influence a number of clinical outcomes by facilitating cognitive restructuring (Hunt, 1998;
      Pennebaker, 2004). In addition to examining cognitive content change following expressive
      writing, we believe the effects of emotional writing on mood and drinking may involve two
      additional processes that have been found significant for both depression and alcohol misuse,
      namely experiential avoidance and ruminative thinking. We hypothesize that expressive writing
      will lead to less drinking and enhanced mood by reducing: (1) negative thought content, (2)
      experiential avoidance of unpleasant private events (e.g., negative thoughts, feelings,
      bodily sensations), and (3) ruminative thinking.
