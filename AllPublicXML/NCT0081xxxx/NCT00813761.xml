          -  Have a contact lens spherical distance requirement between +6.00D and -9.00D in both
             eyes.

          -  Astigmatism of 1.00D or less in the better eye and 1.50D or less in the other eye.

          -  Have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Requires concurrent ocular medication.

          -  Any systemic illness which would contraindicate lens wear or the medical treatment of
             which would affect vision or successful lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant corneal edema, corneal vascularisation, tarsal abnormalities,
             bulbar injection or any other abnormality of the cornea that would contraindicate
             contact lens wear.

          -  Worn lenses on an extended wear basis in the last 3 months.

          -  Diabetic.

          -  Infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease
             (e.g., HIV).

          -  Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lens wear in the previous
             8 weeks.

          -  Has had refractive surgery. Has had eye injury/surgery within 8 weeks immediately
             prior to enrolment for this study.

          -  Abnormal lacrimal secretions.
