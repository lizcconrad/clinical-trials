    <textblock>
      This study is testing the effects of exercise and dietary change on weight reduction and
      biological markers associated with breast cancer risk in breast cancer survivors of Hispanic
      or African descent (n=45). This is a randomized, crossover pilot and feasibility study to
      test the effects of a 30-minute circuit-based exercise program that combines resistance
      training with aerobic exercise in conjunction with a low-fat calorie reduced diet.
      Participants will be randomized to either an immediate 6-months of exercise and dietary
      change, or a delayed group who will begin their exercise and dietary change program 6-months
      after the study begins. Participants in the immediate group will be followed for an
      additional 6-months in order to evaluate adherence to the exercise and dietary change
      recommendations. Participants in both groups will exercise at a neighborhood Curves® facility
      at least 5 times per week for six months and will participate in a series of nutrition
      education classes.
