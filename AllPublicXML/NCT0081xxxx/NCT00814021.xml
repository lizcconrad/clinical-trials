      RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with
      kidney cancer that has spread to the brain.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in the brain after 2 courses of sunitnib malate in
           patients with previously untreated or recurrent brain metastases secondary to renal
           cancer following radiotherapy or surgery.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate duration of response.

        -  Evaluate objective response of non-CNS targets.

        -  Evaluate time to disease progression.

        -  Evaluate overall and progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate neurological symptoms associated with the tumor.

        -  Evaluate feasibility and overall tolerance of this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
