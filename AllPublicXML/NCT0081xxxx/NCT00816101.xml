    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot clinical study is to compare healing rates, pain levels, and
      incidence of wound complications including infection with the use of a moist PROCELLERA™
      Antimicrobial Wound Dressing when compared to a standard dressing, Mepilex® Border Lite,
      following curettage and electrodesiccation of skin lesions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Who Experienced 50% or Greater Wound Healing</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were assessed to see whether or not the wound area was reduced by at least 50%, and the number of such participants is reported</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients Reporting Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded their subjective pain level on a 0-10 Numeric Pain Chart 3x/day (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable), until they had no pain for 3 consecutive days. Participants were also given a Patient Medication Log to complete at home to record RX and OTC medication they took to relieve pain. They were instructed to write the medication name, dosage, and amount of pills they took, as well as time taken, every day they took pain medication. Participants reporting pain had an associated score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Erythema at Week 3</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At each weekly follow up visit, wound erythema was evaluated by the clinician on a scale of 0-4, with &quot;0&quot; being &quot;No erythema&quot;, &quot;1&quot; being &quot;Very slight erythema&quot;, &quot;2&quot; being &quot;Well defined erythema&quot;, &quot;3&quot; being &quot;Moderate to severe erythema&quot; and 4 being &quot;Severe erythema to slight eschar formation&quot;</description>

They were instructed to write the medication name, dosage, and amount of pills they took, as well as time taken, every day they took pain medication.
