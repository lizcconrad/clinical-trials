  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions.The goal of this proposal is
      to produce a new treatment that would benefit subjects who have peanut allergy by lowering
      the risk of anaphylactic reactions (desensitization), and changing the peanut-specific immune
      response in subjects who have peanut allergy (tolerance).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is known to cause severe anaphylactic reactions. Compared with other food
      allergies it tends to be more persistent and also its prevalence seems to be rising.
      Currently there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to
      decrease the risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut
      using peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT). We are also studying the effect of peanut OIT on the
      peanut specific immune response to determine if tolerance to peanut protein will develop.
      Children ages one to six years of age with peanut allergy will be randomized to peanut OIT or
      placebo (active subjects). Thirty subjects will also be recruited as controls. These subjects
      will not receive any peanut or placebo but only have skin prick testing and lab work in
      addition to a history and physical exam. Active subjects will undergo a modified rush
      immunotherapy on the first day and then increase the doses at least every two weeks up to a
      maintenance dose of 4 grams (equivalent to about 13 peanuts). Doses will be taken daily at
      home except for dose increases which will be done on the research unit. Outcome variables of
      interest include response to double-blind placebo controlled food challenge, skin prick
      testing, peanut specific IgE, and adverse events. These results will be compared between the
      start and end of peanut OIT using appropriate statistical analysis.

    <description>Upon completion of 60 months of peanut OIT treatment, subjects discontinued peanut OIT for 4 weeks. The primary clinical efficacy outcome of the study was the percentage of peanut allergic subjects who completed a 5 gm peanut protein double-blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCPFC) without developing symptoms 4 weeks after discontinuing peanut OIT.</description>

    <description>Upon completion of 60 months of peanut OIT treatment, subjects underwent a double-blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCPFC) to assess desensitization. The secondary clinical efficacy outcome of the study was the percentage of peanut allergic subjects who completed a 5 gm peanut protein double-blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCPFC) without developing symptoms after completing peanut OIT therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>first day of peanut OIT dosing</time_frame>
    <description>The first day of peanut OIT dosing involved multiple increasing doses of peanut flour in what was called an initial escalation day up to a maximum dose of 6 mg of peanut protein. The secondary outcome measure assessed the percentage of subjects were successfully able to reach this 6 mg dose.</description>

    <description>During the desensitization phase of the study, subjects under go an initial day escalation up to a maximum of 6 mg of peanut protein. They then undergo biweekly dose escalation over approximately 10 months up to a maximum dose of 4000 mg of peanut protein. This outcome reports the percentage of subjects that achieve this.</description>
