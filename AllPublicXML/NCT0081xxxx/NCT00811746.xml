  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if eszopiclone is as effective as ramelteon when
      used as a pre-medication (sleeping pill) in sleep studies performed to diagnose and treat
      sleep apnea.

      Many Veterans suffer from sleep disordered breathing with a high prevalence of undiagnosed
      obstructive sleep apnea. One test that can be effective in the diagnosis of sleep apnea is
      the polysomnogram (PSG). Split-night PSG consists of a diagnostic phase in the first half of
      the night and a continuous positive airway pressure titration (CPAP) in the second half of
      the night. CPAP is the standard, most effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnea. Due to
      the unfamiliar sleep environment of the laboratory and instrumentation that must be used
      (application of electroencephalogram leads), patients are frequently not able to sleep
      adequately. In these cases, the PSG must be repeated. Oral hypnotic agents are often used as
      a pre-medication to increase the yield of PSG in an attempt to decrease the need for repeat
      studies.

      Numerous data is available on the effects of premedication with oral short-acting hypnotics
      on PSG quality and efficacy of CPAP titration. In one study, eszopiclone, a nonbenzodiazepine
      gaba-receptor agonist short-acting hypnotic, has been shown to improve PSG quality and CPAP
      titration. Another short-acting hypnotic, ramelteon, was recently approved by FDA but the
      effects of ramelteon in improving PSG quality and efficacy of CPAP titration are unclear. The
      advantage of ramelteon over eszopiclone is the lack of drug dependency or abuse potential.
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ramelteon compared to eszopiclone when
      administered prior to split-night PSG and CPAP titration.
