  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of visual
      acuity after treatment using either Lucentis® or Triamcinolone® compared to no treatment, in
      patients with radiation retinopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30-40% of patients develop a deterioration of visual acuity within 5 years
      after treatment of uveal melanoma using radiation therapy and TTT due to radiation
      retinopathy (Shields 2002, Bartlema 2003). By administration of either Lucentis® or
      Triamcinolone® we hope to treat complications of radiation therapy, by demonstrating a
      statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and a reduced amount of macular edema
      and vascular leakage. Additionally, we hope to obtain a better understanding of the
      pathophysiologic processes involved, by demonstrating a possible relation between high levels
      of angiogenic factors (VEGF) in the anterior chamber fluid, and radiation retinopathy. In
      conclusion, we hope to provide evidence for a new therapy in patients with retinopathy, due
      to radiation in uveal melanoma. There is no scientifically proven treatment available at this
      time.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The eye was previously irradiated for treatment of a uveal melanoma;

          -  Decrease of visual acuity after irradiation therapy by more than 10 letters (ETDRS)
             and is now 20/40 or less;

          -  Vision decrease is considered to be due to central radiation retinopathy with
             significant macular edema or optic disc edema;

          -  Age 18 years or older;

          -  The patient is fully competent;

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the trial is given.

             duration of the trial (one year)

          -  Patient is willing and able to return for follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vision decrease is considered to be due to ischemic radiation retinopathy without
             macular edema or optic disc edema;

          -  Other, approved therapy indicated for treatment of condition;

          -  Presence of metastasis;

          -  Evidence of any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial;
