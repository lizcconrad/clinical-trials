      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use and efficacy of the 3DKnee™ System for total
      knee replacement surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement surgery is widely accepted as effective treatment for degenerative
      joint disease (DJD), osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Relief of patient pain and
      return of mobility are the primary goals that can be accomplished by this surgery. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the use and efficacy of the 3DKnee™ System for total
      knee replacement surgery. The study will take place at multiple sites across the United
      States and be managed by the Encore Medical Clinical Affairs Department. The study will
      include only patients who meet the indications for use criteria for the 3DKnee™ System and
      who are candidates for primary knee arthroplasty.
