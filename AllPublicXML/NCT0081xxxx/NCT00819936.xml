      Summary Question: Does backward walking offer additional therapeutic value in patients after
      aortic aneurysm surgery? Participants: The study of backward walking as an addictive
      physiotherapy procedure was conducted in the group of 65 patients who underwent abdominal
      aorta surgery. The patients were randomly divided into three subgroups and three various
      models of physiotherapy were applied. Control group has only routine physiotherapy since
      therapeutic group I and II have also walking exercises forward in group I and backward in
      group II respectively.
