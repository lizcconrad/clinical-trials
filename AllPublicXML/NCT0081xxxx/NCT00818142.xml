      We propose to conduct a monthly group of persons with type 1 diabetes who also withhold
      insulin. Subjects will be asked to complete a 2-page survey (check-in sheet) at the beginning
      of each session and a 5-page survey (Diabetes and Eating Disorders Survey) on their first
      session and at their last session of their group.

    <description>The ED/DM Recovery Group focuses on assisting individuals with diabetes and an eating disorder - specifically the struggle of withholding insulin. The group utilizes strategies and tools that have been taught in other EDI programs, and also builds on the strengths of a group. The group is a means for learning and support as the individuals continue a regular schedule of school, work, and/or family life.</description>
