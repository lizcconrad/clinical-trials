    <description>Pain severity was rated by the participants in a paper diary. Pain severity rating scale : 0 (no pain), 1 (mild pain), 2 (moderate pain), or 3 (severe pain). Pain relief (PR) is defined as a reduction in headache severity from Grade 3/2 at baseline to Grade 1/0 post dose.</description>

    <measure>Pain Freedom (PF)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Headache pain severity, relative to the administration of study medication, was rated by the participants in a paper diary. Pain severity rating scale: 0 (no pain), 1 (mild pain), 2 (moderate pain), or 3 (severe pain). Pain freedom (PF) is defined as a reduction in headache severity from Grade 3/2 at baseline to Grade 0 (no pain) post dose.</description>

    <measure>Normal Rating of Functional Disability (NRFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Level of functional disability was assessed on a paper diary by the participants. Level of functional disability was rated as: normal, mildly impaired, severely impaired, or unable to do activities, requires bedrest. Functional disability ratings was dichotomized to Normal and Not Normal (mildly impaired, severely impaired, or unable to do activities, requires bedrest) for analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction (TS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction was assessed on a paper diary by the participants. Level of satisfaction was rated as: completely satisfied, very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied, or completely dissatisfied. The overall 24-hour assessment of study medication was dichotomized to Satisfaction (completely satisfied, very satisfied, somewhat satisfied) and Non-satisfaction (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dissatisfied, or completely dissatisfied) for analysis.</description>
