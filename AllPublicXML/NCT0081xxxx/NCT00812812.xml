    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the efficacy of oral paroxetine 10 to 40 mg/day (initial
      dose:10 mg/day) versus placebo administered once daily (after evening meal) for 8 weeks in
      children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the change from
      baseline to Week 8/end-of-study in the CDRS-R total score in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled parallel-group study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Children's Depression Rating Scale -Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R has been widely used for the evaluation of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The CDRS-R total score is the sum of the responses to 17 questions. Each question is graded on a 5- or 7-point scale. The highest possible score is 113 (the most severe measure of depression), and the lowest is 17 (not suffering from depression). CDRS-R scores were assessed by the investigator. The change from Baseline in the CDRS-R total score was calculated as the total score at Week 8 minus the total score at Baseline. The data were adjusted with the total score at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement (CGI-GI) Responders at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-GI is assessed on an 8-grade scale: 0, not assessed; 1, very much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; and 7, very much worse. CGI-GI was assessed by the investigator. Participants who were rated as 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) were categorized as CGI-GI responders.</description>

    <description>CGI-SI is assessed on an 8-grade scale: 0, not assessed; 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; and 7, among the most extremely ill. CGI-SI was assessed by the investigator. The change from Baseline in CGI-SI score was calculated as the score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 minus the score at Baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 8 or Withdrawal (up to Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics for the plasma paroxetine concentrations at each time point were calculated by the dosage just before blood sampling using data from participants in whom plasma samples were collected at either 12 hours (plus or minus 2 hours) or 24 hours (plus or minus 2 hours) after the last administration of the study drug at Week 8 or Withdrawal (up to Week 8).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study consisted of 3 phases: a 2-week placebo run-in phase, an 8-week treatment phase, and a 0- to 3-week taper phase. In the run-in phase, placebo was administered once daily for 2 weeks. In the treatment phase, paroxetine or placebo was orally administered once daily for 8 weeks. In the taper phase, the dose was gradually reduced.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Paroxetine at the initial dose of 10 milligrams (mg) was orally administered once daily for the first 2 weeks of the treatment phase (total of 8 weeks). During the next 6 weeks, paroxetine 10 to 20 mg for participants aged 7 to 11 years or 10 to 40 mg for participants aged 12 to 17 years was orally administered. The dose was up-titrated by one level at a time (an increment of 10 mg/day) at intervals of at least 2 weeks based on clinical judgment. During the taper phase, (0 to 3 weeks), the last dose level in the treatment phase was reduced by 10 mg/day at intervals of 1 week to the final dose level of 10 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Children's Depression Rating Scale -Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The CDRS-R has been widely used for the evaluation of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The CDRS-R total score is the sum of the responses to 17 questions. Each question is graded on a 5- or 7-point scale. The highest possible score is 113 (the most severe measure of depression), and the lowest is 17 (not suffering from depression). CDRS-R scores were assessed by the investigator. The change from Baseline in the CDRS-R total score was calculated as the total score at Week 8 minus the total score at Baseline. The data were adjusted with the total score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the CDRS-R Total Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6</title>
        <description>The CDRS-R has been widely used for the evaluation of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The CDRS-R total score is the sum of the responses to 17 questions. Each question is graded on a 5- or 7-point scale. The highest possible score is 113 (the most severe measure of depression), and the lowest is 17 (not suffering from depression). CDRS-R scores were assessed by the investigator. The change from Baseline in the CDRS-R total score was calculated as the total score at Week 8 minus the total score at Baseline. The data were adjusted with the total score at Baseline.</description>

In the next 6 weeks, paroxetine 10 to 20 mg for participants aged 7 to 11 years or 10 to 40 mg for participants aged 12 to 17 years was orally administered. The dose was up-titrated by one level at a time (an increment of 10 mg/day) at intervals of at least 2 weeks based on clinical judgment. During the taper phase (0 to 3 weeks), the last dose level in the treatment phase was reduced by 10 mg/day at intervals of 1 week to the final dose level of 10 mg/day.</description>
