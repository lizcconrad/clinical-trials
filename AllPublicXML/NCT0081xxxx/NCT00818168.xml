    <textblock>
      This observational study is in line with the German educational plan with the aim to
      implement a tool to increase and monitor the awareness of tuberculosis screening and to
      reinforce the patient eligibility for a treatment with Remicade according to the Summary of
      Product Characteristics (SmPc).

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had the Mendel Mantoux Test as the First Screening Test for Active or Latent Tuberculosis (TB) Before Starting Treatment</measure>

    <description>In order to increase the attending physician's awareness of the required tuberculosis screening and to support the screening itself, tuberculosis screening was performed and documented before treatment administration (baseline). The number of participants who had the Mendel Mantoux test (tuberculin sensitivity skin test by intradermal injection) as the first screening test was presented in three categories:
Yes

    <description>In order to increase the attending physician's awareness of the required tuberculosis screening and to support the screening itself, tuberculosis screening was performed and documented before treatment administration (baseline). The number of participants who had the in-vitro TB test (cellular blood test, i.e. gamma interferon release assays) as the first screening test was presented in three categories:

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had a Chest X-ray as Part of TB Screening for Active or Latent Tuberculosis Before Starting Treatment</measure>

    <description>In order to increase the attending physician's awareness of the required tuberculosis screening and to support the screening itself, tuberculosis screening was performed and documented before treatment administration (baseline). If done according to guidelines, complete TB screening comprised a TB screening test and a chest X-ray. The number of participants who had a frontal chest X-ray was presented in three categories:
Yes

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Disease Activity by Means of the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) at the Time of Enrollment and at the First Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and time of first infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The BASDAI score was calculated based on the responses to questions 1-6, with each component rated on a scale of 0 (best) to 10 (worst) based on the severity of various characteristics. A decrease in BASDAI over time indicated improvement in disease activity. The score corresponded to the sum of the point values from questions 1-4 and the mean of the point values from questions 5 and 6, subsequently divided by five. BASDAI was calculated at the time of enrollment (baseline) and at the time of first infusion.</description>

        <description>The BASDAI score was calculated based on the responses to questions 1-6, with each component rated on a scale of 0 (best) to 10 (worst) based on the severity of various characteristics. A decrease in BASDAI over time indicated improvement in disease activity. The score corresponded to the sum of the point values from questions 1-4 and the mean of the point values from questions 5 and 6, subsequently divided by five. BASDAI was calculated at the time of enrollment (baseline) and at the time of first infusion.</description>
