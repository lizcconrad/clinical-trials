  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the investigators' study is to find the best way to provide information about
      sun protection and skin cancer detection. The investigators want to see which of two methods
      most improves sun protection and screening attitudes and practices. The investigators hope to
      improve these attitudes and practices among people who are at higher risk for melanoma.
      People at higher risk for melanoma are first degree relatives (mother, father, sibling or
      child) of people diagnosed with melanoma.

      Eligible patients will be contacted to find out whether they have any living first degree
      relatives that we may contact to discuss their participation in our study.

      Eligible first degree relatives (FDRs) will participate in our study as outlined under
      Interventions.

    <description>We will send 3 sets of materials via mail, containing information about melanoma prevention and detection, 1 set each month for 3 months. Materials published by:
The American Cancer Society
The American Academy of Dermatology
The Skin Cancer Foundation
The pamphlets contain information about ways to reduce risk for skin cancer including:
Sun protection practices
Risk factors for melanoma
Information about what melanoma looks like
How to do skin self-examinations
There will also be a telephone discussion with a health educator, discussing melanoma and other information contained in the pamphlets.</description>

    <description>We will send 3 separate pamphlets created specifically for participants. We will send 1 pamphlet each month for 3 months. The information in the pamphlets will be based on answers from the first survey. These pamphlets will contain information about:
Melanoma and skin cancer protection guidelines
The benefits of skin screening practices
Ways to protect yourself from the sun
In addition to these pamphlets, there will be a telephone discussion with a health educator to discuss melanoma and other information contained in the pamphlets.</description>

    <description>Both groups will complete 3 surveys; at the beginning, 3 months later, 6 months after the second survey. Each survey will ask about:
knowledge of melanoma
current and past skin cancer screening practices
current and past sun protection practices
attitudes about skin cancer and sun protection
feelings about relative's melanoma diagnosis and treatment</description>

          -  No personal history of CMM or non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  No personal history of dysplastic nevi

        Exclusion Criteria - FDR:

          -  2 or more first degree relatives with CMM

          -  Has had a total cutaneous examination (TCE) in the past 3 years AND has done skin
