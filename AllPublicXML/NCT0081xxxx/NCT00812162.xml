  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify how adult men respond to a weight loss diet that
      includes pork and eggs and increasing the number of meals consumed throughout the day. This
      is a 13-week study (12-weeks of weight loss and 1-week of baseline measurement).

    <measure>The primary aim is to examine the effects of increased protein intake on appetite, selected appetite hormones (insulin, leptin, ghrelin), whole body energy expenditure, and body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass) changes.</measure>

    <measure>The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of meal frequency on appetite by asking the men to frequently rate their appetite on days that they purposefully eat 3 vs. 6 times/day.</measure>
