      REFLEXION is a double blind extension of the study 27025 (NCT00404352) (REFLEX). The purpose
      of the study is to obtain long-term follow-up data in subjects with clinically definite
      multiple sclerosis (MS) and subjects with a first demyelinating event at high risk of
      converting to MS, treated with fetal bovine serum [FBS]-free/human serum albumin [HSA]-free
      formulation of interferon [IFN]-beta-1a (RNF).

      The objective of the study is to investigate whether RNF treatment initiated after the first
      clinical event versus delayed treatment results in the prolongation of time to Clinically
      Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) conversion up to Month 36 and up to Month 60 since
      randomization in Study 27025 (REFLEX). Furthermore, the study is intended to explore whether
      RNF treatment initiated after the first clinical event versus delayed treatment delays
      disability (including development of secondary progressive MS) and reduces disease activity
      (including the annual relapse rate [ARR]) in the long term (up to Month 36 and up to Month 60
      since randomization in Study 27025 (REFLEX). The study will also assess the long-term safety
      profile of RNF (up to Month 36 and up to Month 60 since randomization in Study 27025
      (REFLEX).

    <measure>Time to Conversion to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) Defined by Either a Second Attack or a Sustained Increase (Greater Than or Equal to 1.5 Points) in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score up to 36 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 of Study 27025) up to 36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>CDMS was defined by the occurrence of a second attack or relapse over 36 months in participants who presented with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) accompanied by an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]) was calculated. Time to conversion to CDMS was represented by Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative percentage (%) of participants with CDMS.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 of Study 27025), Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The MSFC is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure which consists of three sub-tests; Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3(PASAT-3). The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-Hole Peg Test is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Standardized results (Z-scores) of these sub-tests and the overall MSFC Z-score as an average of these three Z-scores was calculated. Higher Z-scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicates an improvement (range -3 to +3).</description>

        <title>Time to Conversion to Clinically Definite Multiple Sclerosis (CDMS) Defined by Either a Second Attack or a Sustained Increase (Greater Than or Equal to 1.5 Points) in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score up to 36 Months</title>
        <description>CDMS was defined by the occurrence of a second attack or relapse over 36 months in participants who presented with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) accompanied by an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]) was calculated. Time to conversion to CDMS was represented by Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative percentage (%) of participants with CDMS.</description>

The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-Hole Peg Test is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Standardized results (Z-scores) of these sub-tests and the overall MSFC Z-score as an average of these three Z-scores was calculated. Higher Z-scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicates an improvement (range -3 to +3).</description>

        <description>BAbs are all antibodies which are capable of binding to the investigational drug molecule (RNF) irrespective of their binding site. NAbs are defined as a subgroup of BAbs which bind to the active sites of the RNF and therefore neutralize its potency. NAbs were detected using a viral cytopathic assay. BAbs were measured by using an ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).</description>

          <description>EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated. A confirmed EDSS progression was defined EDSS greater than or equal to 1.0 point confirmed during a visit performed 6 months later. Time to confirmed EDSS progression was represented by Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative percentage (%) of participants with confirmed EDSS progression.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score at Month 60</title>
        <description>The MSFC is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure which consists of three sub-tests; Timed 25-Foot Walk, 9-Hole Peg Test and Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3(PASAT-3). The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-Hole Peg Test is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that specifically assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Standardized results (Z-scores) of these sub-tests and the overall MSFC Z-score as an average of these three Z-scores was calculated. Higher Z-scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicates an improvement (range -3 to +3).</description>
