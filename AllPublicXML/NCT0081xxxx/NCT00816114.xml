  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers propose to do a chart review of all patients that are treated
      outside of a clinical trial with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or any other tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor that becomes FDA approved for the managements of CML that come to MDACC for a
      second opinion. This is an important population of patients that differs in their management
      from patients treated in clinical trials for several reasons including but not limited to:

        1. It represents a very large patient population receiving standard-dose therapy with TKI.
           We estimate that we have evaluated over 300 patients that fall in this category.

        2. The follow-up for patients in the largest trial using standard-dose imatinib (the IRIS
           trial, with 553 patients in treated with imatinib) has been limited after the first 12
           months. For example, the rate of molecular responses after the first 12 months of
           therapy was not obtained as samples stopped being collected at that time point.

        3. Registration studies for dasatinib and nilotinib have similar limitations with limited
           follow-up and available information coming only from databases from the sponsors to
           which there is limited access to investigate dosing, chronic toxicities, second
           malignancies and other important aspects of therapy.

        4. Patients who are or become pregnant during therapy with TKI have not been eligible for
           clinical trials with TKI or had to be taken off study. Thus, there is no information on
           the effect of TKI on imatinib on pregnancy and conception. We have followed several such
           patients at MDACC.

        5. This is a patient population that follows therapy mostly as directed by their local
           oncologists. This is frequently less stringently adhered to the recommended guidelines
           for TKI therapy, with more frequent treatment interruptions, and frequently using
           suboptimal doses of imatinib (i.e., less than 300mg daily). The effect of these
           treatment interruptions and suboptimal dosing on response and development of resistance
           is unclear.

      Researchers plan to conduct a chart review of these patients to study their treatment course
      before their initial evaluation at MDACC, and between and during visits to MDACC.

      PATIENT POPULATION:

      All patients with CML in any phase of the disease (chronic, accelerated or blast phase) that
      has received treatment with any tyrosine kinase inhibitor (eg, imatinib, dasatinib,
      nilotinib) regardless of prior treatment history that has had at least one clinic visit at
      MDACC will be eligible.

      STUDY PLAN:

      The following information will be collected:

        -  Demographic information including age, gender, ethnicity, education, and work history.

        -  All laboratory values obtained at MDACC or other institutions, including CBC, blood
           chemistries, electrolytes, bone marrow aspirations and biopsies, cytogenetic analyses,
           mutation analysis, FISH, and PCR, and other tests obtained during regular care of these
           patients.

        -  Treatment history including starting and stopping dates, doses, treatment interruptions,
           dose changes and reasons for dose modifications.

        -  Information about toxicity including type, grade, dates of onset and resolution,
           interventions to manage toxicity, and sequelae.

        -  Information regarding pregnancy or conception during imatinib therapy for both male and
           female patients, including dates of pregnancy, outcome of pregnancy, interventions
           during pregnancy, management of CML during pregnancy, complications during pregnancy,
           status of the product, condition of the born child, and information on lactation.

        -  This information will be reviewed from the documents received as part of the routine
           communication with the local oncologist or from the studies obtained at MDACC.

        -  There will be no treatment changes or recommendations as a result of this study. This
           study will be strictly limited to review of charts. Patients will continue their
           treatment as recommended by their local oncologist and treating physician at MDACC.

        -  These results will be compared to similar patients treated with imatinib in the context
           of clinical trials both from published literature and from other studies conducted at
           MDACC. The efficacy, safety and prognostic markers will be compared.

        -  We will review data from July 1, 1998 to September 1, 2017.

      SAMPLE SIZE:

      Approximately 3000 charts will be reviewed.
