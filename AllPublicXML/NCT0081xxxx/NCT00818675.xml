  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized discontinuation study of ridaforolimus in patients with advanced NSCLC
      who have failed at least 1 but no more than 3 prior treatment regimens and who have KRAS
      mutant lung cancer. Following 8 weeks of open-label ridaforolimus lead-in there will be an
      assessment of disease status. Patients assessed by the investigator to have stable disease
      after 8 weeks will be randomized to double-blind treatment with ridaforolimus or placebo.
      Patients assessed to have partial or complete response will continue on open-label
      ridaforolimus. Patients assessed to have disease progression will be discontinued from study.

      Allocation and Arms Additional Information: All Patients will receive an 8-week

      open-label lead-in treatment of ridaforolimus. After this 8 week period patients will be
      re-assessed for disease status. Patients who are stable after 8 weeks are randomized in a
      double-blind fashion to continue treatment with ridaforolimus or to a placebo until disease
      progression. (Those patients who have stable disease but are randomized to placebo may
      cross-over to open-label ridaforolimus at the time of disease progression.)

      Those patients with tumor shrinkage during the open-label lead-in treatment will continue on
      open-label ridaforolimus, while those patients who have disease progression at 8-weeks are
      taken off-study.
