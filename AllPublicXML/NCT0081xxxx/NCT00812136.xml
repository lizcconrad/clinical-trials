      Asthma disproportionately affects minorities, but few studies have evaluated interventions to
      improve asthma outcomes in minority children.The purpose of the study is to determine whether
      Parent Mentors (PMs) are more effective than traditional asthma care in reducing minority
      children's asthma morbidity, costs, and use of services, while increasing families' quality
      of life and parental self-efficacy.
