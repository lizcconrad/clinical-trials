  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the tolerance and overall survival in
      patients with stage ⅣAB NPC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and concurrent
      chemoradiation.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the distant metastases free survival, and
      disease-free survival of patients with stage ⅣAB treated with this regimen

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent chemoradiation is the standard treatment for locally advanced NPC. The survival
      benefit gained from adding neoadjuvant chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiation has never
      been defined. In the present trail, we hope to assess the tolerance and survival benefits of
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation in patients with stage ⅣAB
      NPC.

    <description>All patients will receive docetaxel 75 mg/m2 on day 1; cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1; and a continuous fluorouracil infusion at 500 mg/m2/d on days 1 through 5. Cycles are repeated every 21 days for a total of three cycles. Patients then will receive definitive radiotherapy with 3D-CRT or IMRT, and cisplatin (40mg/m2) weekly during external radiotherapy.</description>
