  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of the combination of RAD001
      and PKC412 as a cancer treatment, and to establish the highest dose of RAD001 that can be
      given in conjunction with PKC412. These drugs have been used in other research trials for
      individuals with solid and hematology malignancies. Past research on PKC412 shows that it
      blocks the abnormal functioning of an enzyme called FLT3. FLT3 is found in your cells in
      either a normal (wild type) or genetically changed form and plays a role in the survival and
      growth of AML cells. RAD001 is an inhibitor of a central growth pathway that involves the
      protein MTOR. The MTOR pathway is overactive in cancer cells, causing the cells to grow
      abnormally. By inhibiting the abnormal growth activity of the MTOR pathway, RAD001 slows down
      and possibly stops the growth of cancer cells.

      -  This is a dose-escalation study in which 3 participants will be given a particular
           starting dose of RAD001 on a certain schedule. If the dose and schedule are well
           tolerated, then the next 3 participants enrolled will be assigned a new dosing schedule
           and/or a higher dose of RAD001. This will continue until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
           is reached for RAD001.

        -  Each cycle of treatment consists of 28 days on an outpatient basis. Participants will
           receive RAD001 as the assigned schedule and dosage on day 1 and on days 8 through 28 for
           the first cycle. For all subsequent cycles RAD001 will be taken once daily.
           Additionally, all participants will take PKC412 twice a day on days 2 through 28 for the
           first cycle. For all subsequent cycles PKC412 will be taken twice daily.

        -  During the course of the trial the following evaluations and procedures will be
           completed at various times: review of medical history; review of concomitant
           medications; physical exam; performance status; vital signs; EKG; chest x-ray; blood
           tests and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy.
