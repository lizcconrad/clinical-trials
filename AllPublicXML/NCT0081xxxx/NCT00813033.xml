  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents need understandable information in order to make appropriate choices for their
      child's health care. This is especially true when making decisions about invasive medical
      procedures. Parents need to understand what will happen, the risks involved, how these risks
      will be managed and what other options they have before they can decide what is best for
      their child. The present proposal involves the creation of a novel patient decision aid about
      the gastro endoscopy procedure, called a &quot;scope.&quot; The purpose of the aid is to provide
      parents with information so they are able to discuss the options with their child's health
      care providers.

      True informed consent depends on effective, bi-directional communication between parents and
      their child's healthcare providers. Many things affect the quality of the consenting process
      including the parents' level of health literacy, English proficiency and cultural
      perspectives. Our long-term goal is to develop a standardized consenting process that
      ultimately addresses the needs of the patient and the patient's family so that a truly
      informed decision can occur. The specific hypothesis is that incorporating the use of a
      multimedia patient decision aid to assist in the education of patients and their families
      about an invasive medical procedure (i.e. gastro-endoscopy) will improve knowledge and
      positively impact the ability of the parent to act on this knowledge when making decisions
      regarding their child's health care.
