      Multicenter, double-blinding, randomized controlled, phase II clinical trial on combined
      chemotherapy of Endostar (Recombinant Human Endostatin) for untreated patients with advanced
      melanoma, To compare the efficacy and safety of Endostar combined with Dacarbazine and
      monotherapy of Dacarbazine for advanced melanoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dacarbazine (DTIC) has been approved for treating metastatic melanoma in the 1970s, and as a
      single agent gives a response rate of about 20%. There have been efforts to ameliorate this
      poor result by using DTIC in different combinations without a significant improvement. In
      addition, new studies with melanoma cells in vitro show that DTIC combination with Endostar,
      suggesting a potential clinical benefit from the concomitant treatment of DTIC and
      antiangiogenesis therapy. Endostar is a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which
      could suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent
      human genome. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination therapy of
      endostar and DTIC is safe and can increase response rate and progression-free survival in
      patients (pts) with metastatic melanoma. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      Endostar plus DTIC and hope provide a new hope for the advanced melanoma patients.
