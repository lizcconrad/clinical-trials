        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female age 18 years or older.

          2. A history of cutaneous herpes zoster infection and sustained pain associated with the
             site of the herpes zoster skin rash for &gt;6 months, after onset of the herpes zoster
             skin rash.

          3. Well established consistent pain during baseline phase.

          4. Completed a washout period of 7 days for existing pain medications.

          5. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          6. A willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          2. Female subjects who are not surgically sterile (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal
             ligation), postmenopausal for at least one year, or are not willing to practice
             adequate methods of contraception if of childbearing potential.

          3. Previous neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy for PHN.

          4. Treatment with local anesthetic nerve blocks within the last 30 days.

          5. Failure of an adequate dose of 3 or more first line drug treatments for PHN-related
             pain due to efficacy.

          6. Any other type of pain which may impair the self assessment of the pain due to PHN.

          7. Skin conditions in the affected dermatome that could alter sensation.

          8. Participation in other studies within 30 days before the current study begins and/or
             during study participation.

          9. Taking CYP1A2 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, certain fluoroquinolones (e.g.,
             ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, pefloxacin, etc), mexiletine, and zileuton.

         10. History of drug or alcohol abuse during the last 5 years.

         11. Creatinine clearance &lt;50 mL/min.

         12. History of malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ.

         13. History of chronic hepatitis B or C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

         14. Clinically significant hepatic, respiratory, hematological, cardiovascular or
             neurological disease.

         15. Immunocompromised state.

         16. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
