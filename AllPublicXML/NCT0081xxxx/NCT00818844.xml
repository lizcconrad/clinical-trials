      The purpose of this study is to compare the macular volume of patients treated with a 3-month
      course of topical Nepafenac (0.1% solution) to patients treated with a placebo course
      following epiretinal membrane surgery.

             Institutional Review Board.

          -  Must agree to comply with study visit schedule and other study requirements.

          -  Must have vision loss associated with idiopathic epiretinal membrane and secondary
             retinal edema.

          -  Must have pre-operative central foveal thickness greater than 300 microns.

          -  Prior cataract surgery must be at least 6 months postoperative.

               -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vision loss associated with maculopathies other than idiopathic epiretinal membrane
             and secondary retinal edema (e.g. branch retinal vein occlusion, central retinal vein
             occlusion, wet macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, posterior uveitis).

          -  Dry macular degeneration (drusen) with central geographic atrophy.

          -  Concomitant cataract surgery performed at the time of study vitrectomy.

          -  Prior vitrectomy surgery in the study eye(s).

          -  Prior macula laser treatment in the study eye(s).

          -  Prior periocular steroid injections in the study eye(s) within preceding 6 months.

          -  Prior cataract surgery in the study eye(s) within the last 6 months.

          -  Any systemic or ocular disease or disorder, complicating factors or structural
             abnormality that would negatively affect the conduct or outcome of the study.

          -  Use of topical ocular medications during the study period.

          -  Antibiotics (systemic or topical) outside of study protocol may not be used within 7
             days of preoperative/baseline visit or anytime after this visit for the duration of
             the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not using reliable means of birth control.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Enrollment of more than one person per household at the same time.

          -  Enrollment of the investigator or his or her staff, family members of the
             investigator, family members of the investigator's staff, or individuals living in the
             households of these individuals.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering
             this study. Note: Patients may have both eyes enrolled in this study provided that 2nd
             eye enrollment takes place 30 days after completion of the first eye. Second eye will
             receive the same study treatment as first eye.

               -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
