  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to examine how a common genetic pattern affects thyroid function. Recent
      studies have demonstrated that a substance (enzyme) produced by a gene has an important role
      in controlling circulating thyroid hormone levels. A commonly found pattern in this gene
      exists in many individuals and might affect the function of the enzyme. These individuals
      need higher doses of thyroid hormone medication in certain situations (e.g. in the treatment
      of thyroid cancer after the thyroid gland has been removed) than those individuals without
      the variation.

      We intend to study this by looking at the response to a hormone-test in healthy volunteers
      with different genetic patterns.

      We plan to screen healthy volunteers using a blood test to identify their genetic pattern
      relating to the enzyme we are interested in. From this group, forty-five healthy volunteers
      will be recruited for the hormone-test. This test (called the TRH test) uses a hormone
      produced by the brain and stimulates the pituitary and thyroid gland. The response to this
      test will allow us to compare the function of the thyroid system in relation to the genetic
      pattern of the volunteer.

      We hypothesize that the stimulation of the thyroid hormone system will be decreased in
      volunteers with a specific genetic pattern and that these individuals will release less
      active thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland in response to the TRH test.

      This study will provide new information on the effect of a common genetic pattern on thyroid
      hormone function and will help us to better understand the way in which the thyroid hormone
      system operates. Ultimately, the results of this study might help to provide a more
      individualized therapy for patients in need of thyroid hormone replacement.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Subjects will be healthy male and female adult volunteers, between the ages of 18
                  and 65, able to provide informed consent. Patients younger than 18 are excluded
                  as this is a purely physiologic study and we are unable to justify any potential
                  risk. However, should our preliminary findings show potential clinically relevant
                  benefits for children, the protocol could be modified to include them. Patients
                  older than 65 are excluded due to intrinsic differences in thyroid hormone
                  dynamics, compared with younger subjects, which could confound study
                  interpretation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. BMI less than or equal to 19 or greater than or equal to 35 Kg/m(2)

          2. Hypothyroidism, or TSH levels above the normal limits (current replacement therapy or
             TSH greater than 4.0 mcIU/mL)

          3. Hyperthyroidism, or TSH levels below the normal limits (current or previous therapy or
             TSH less than 0.4 mcIU/mL)

          4. Autoimmune thyroid disease (as defined by a positive anti-TPO, or anti-TSH receptor
             antibody titer)

          5. Hypertension (Blood pressure greater than 140/90 or use of antihypertensive
             medication)

          6. Liver disease or ALT serum concentrations greater than 1.5 times the upper laboratory
             reference limit.

          7. Renal insufficiency or estimated creatinine clearance less than or equal to 50 mL/min
             (MDRD equation).

          8. History of, and/or current Diabetes Mellitus (fasting glucose greater than 126 mg/dL)

          9. Iodine deficiency (spot urine iodine concentration less than 42 mcg/L)

         10. History of, and/or current coronary artery disease

         11. History of, and/or current asthma

         12. History of, and/or current seizures or chronic headache

         13. History of, and/or current depression

         14. History of pituitary tumor

         15. Pregnancy (women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior
             to inclusion and at the time of TRH testing)

         16. Known allergy to TRH

         17. Current use of prescription medication or certain non-prescription medications and
             dietary supplements which could affect thyroid function and/or metabolism.
