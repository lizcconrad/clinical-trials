      RATIONALE: Dasatinib and vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving dasatinib together with vorinostat may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of dasatinib when
      given together with vorinostat in treating patients with accelerated phase or blastic phase
      chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose of dasatinib and vorinostat in patients with
           accelerated phase or blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia or Philadelphia
           chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To assess, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To perform correlative studies relevant to this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral dasatinib twice daily on days 1-21 and oral vorinostat twice daily on
      days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood sample collection periodically for
      correlative laboratory studies. Samples are assessed by RT-PCR for DNA damage response and
      proapoptotic elements (GADD45, FANC, and FOXO3A); cytogenetic analysis; flow cytometry;
      mutation analysis of bcr-abl; and gene expression array analysis.
