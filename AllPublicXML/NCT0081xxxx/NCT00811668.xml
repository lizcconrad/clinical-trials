  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with underlying heart diseases like hypertensive heart disease, coronary heart
      disease or dilative cardiomyopathy obstructive sleep-apnea, central sleep-apnea and
      Cheyne-Stokes-respiration are common finding in polysomnography.

      In a lot of these patients it is neither a purely obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome nor a
      complete Cheyne-Stokes-respiration but a combination of both sleep related respiratory
      disturbances.

      Previous studies showed an improvement of the central respiratory disorder, for example
      Cheyne-Stokes-respiration, under continuous positive pressure breathing (CPAP) and an
      improvement of the left ventricular pump function. (Naughton 1995, Tkacova 1997).

      However, the recently published CanPAP study could not prove any improvement in the mortality
      among CPAP therapy patients in comparison to the optimal medical treatment, although under
      this therapy, the number of breathing disturbances, the oxygen saturation at night and the
      ejection fraction of the left ventricle showed a significant improvement.(Bradley 2005)

      Earlier studies proved the adaptive servo ventilation to be an effective therapy for patients
      with central sleep-apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration respectively. (Teschler 2001)
      Teschler's study showed that the adaptive servo ventilation therapy with a reduction of
      central sleep apnea down to 10/hours succeeded. With the SOMNOvent CR a new therapy-algorithm
      has been developed for the adaptive servo ventilation in patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration with underlying heart disease. In the first validation
      study this therapy was very effective and presented only few adverse effects in the patients.
      (Galetke 2007)

      The goal of the study was to compare this new therapeutic option (SOMNOvent CR) with the
      established method of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with combination
      of obstructive sleep-apnea syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes-respiration with underlying heart
      disease.

      Patients who meet all the above mentioned criteria and who were diagnosed as sleep-apnoea
      syndrome patients in our hospital were asked to participate in the study.

      We divided the patients in two groups:

      Group 1: started with CPAP and continued with SOMNOvent CR Group 2: began with SOMNOvent CR
      and ended with CPAP

      First of all a CPAP-titration was applied to both fixed groups during the second night.
      During the third night they received either the CPAP- pressure (first group) or the adaptive
      servo ventilation (second group. The patients were discharged from the hospital continuing
      with the procedure of the third night.

      After four weeks a new admission for the sleep laboratory was necessary and, during the first
      night, a control investigation with the procedure of the last four weeks. The procedure
      changed during the next night, so that the patients of the first group now slept with the
      SOMNOventCR-device and the patients of the second group with the CPAP-device.

      After a wash-out-period of a week and a four-week treatment with the last procedure a final
      in-hospital polysomnography was performed in which adaptive servo ventilation was applied to
      the first group and fixed CPAP to the second group.

      After the study ended, the patients received the therapy procedure which was the most
      effective and which was better tolerated.

      The following analyses were carried out in addition to the polysomnographic measurements:

      Admission 1: Berlin questionnaire, European sleep questionnaire, echocardiography, 6 minute
      walking test, patients questionnaire.

      Admission 2: ESS, Berlin questionnaire, echocardiography, 6 minute walking test, patients´
      questionnaire.

      After the wash-out-period: ESS, Berlin questionnaire, patients questionnaire.

      Admission 4: ESS, Berlin questionnaire, echocardiography, 6 minute walking test, patients
      questionnaire.
