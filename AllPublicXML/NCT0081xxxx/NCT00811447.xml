      Primary objective:

      To detect a statistically significant increase in time to progression (TTP) of disease for
      the test group (Taxotere® [Docetaxel] combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil [TCF])
      relative to the control group (Cisplatin combined with 5-fluorouracil[CF])

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To detect a statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS) for the test
           group relative to the control group.

        -  To compare response rate (RR), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of responses,
           safety profiles, quality of life (QOL), and disease-related symptoms.
