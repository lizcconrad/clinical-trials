  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility, practicality, utility and usability of a
      semi-quantitative urine pregnancy test (dBest One Step hCG Panel Test Kit) recently approved
      by the food and drug administration (FDA) for both Professional (physician office) and
      over-the-counter (consumer) use. The study seeks to:

        1. Assess the correlation of this pregnancy test results with serum values (as distinct
           from urine) hCG.

        2. Assess whether or not time of day of urine collection has any impact on the outcome of
           the dBest test.

        3. Assess user comprehension of the pregnancy test, especially assessment of the result.
