  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two parts to this study: (1) an information gathering phase leading to development
      of a new decision aid (phase 1); and (2) a study to test the newly developed decision aid
      (phase 2).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 - The purpose of this part of the research study is to conduct individual interviews
      and focus groups (group discussions) to learn more about the things or behaviors that help
      men to stay healthy and the decision making process for prostate cancer screening. We will
      discuss men's general health concerns, knowledge, beliefs, and concerns regarding prostate
      cancer and screening for prostate cancer. We will use the results from this study to develop
      a decision aid to help first-degree relatives of prostate cancer patients make informed
      decisions about whether to undergo testing or not to undergo testing for prostate cancer. The
      new decision aid will include a digital videodisc (DVD) and an accompanying booklet. We hope
      to learn from you the needs and concerns of first-degree relatives, what information to
      include in the decision aid, what language to use, and the best way to present this
      information.

      Phase 2 - The purpose of this part of the research study is to test the usefulness and
      acceptability of a new decision aid we developed specifically for first-degree relatives
      (FDRs) of prostate cancer patients. We will compare the new decision aid to another widely
      available decision aid that was not developed specifically for first-degree relatives. The
      goal is to see if the new decision aid will change knowledge (about prostate cancer and
      screening) and increase satisfaction with decision making (intention or decision made). If we
      find some evidence that the new decision aid is relevant (useful) and acceptable, we will
      then do a larger study with several hundred men to determine more definitively whether the
      new decision aid is better than already existing general decision materials and for which men
      it works best.

      Because the correct decision (whether to undergo screening or not to undergo screening) is
      not known at this time, the goal of decision aids is to present both (in a balanced manner)
      the potential harms and benefits of screening. Therefore, this study focuses on the informed
      decision making (knowledge and satisfaction with decision).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Index Patients - African American and White (non-Hispanic) index patients who have
             completed definitive treatment for prostate cancer will be approached to participate.

          -  Index Patients Must: (a) reside in the tri-county Tampa Bay area (Hillsborough,
             Pinellas and Pasco Counties, FL) to simplify logistics of arranging face-to-face focus
             groups; (b) be willing to attend a focus group; (c) be able to speak, read and write
             in English; and (d) be able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Index patients will be asked to nominate at least one male FDR (son or brother) with
             no history of prostate cancer.

          -  Unaffected FDRs - Inclusion criteria for FDRs includes: (a) be non-Hispanic African
             American or White males between the ages of 40 and 70; (b) have no self-reported
             history of a diagnosis of any form of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), (c)
             have no self-reported history of prostate biopsy, or transrectal ultrasound to
             investigate or rule out diagnosis of prostate cancer; (d) have not participated in the
             phase (formative) portion of this study (i.e., must be &quot;na√Øve&quot; to the intervention);
             (e) be able to speak, read and write English; (f) self-report access to a DVD player;
             and (g) be able to provide written informed consent. FDRs with a relative in active
             definitive prostate cancer treatment (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy,
             except for hormone therapy) or who has completed treatment in the past 30 days will
             not be eligible. FDRs with multiple living relatives who been diagnosed with prostate
             cancer will be excluded to reduce heterogeneity of our phase 2 sample; this exclusion
             criterion is expected to have a minimal influence on accrual in light of our previous
             data on the percentage of men with multiple affected relatives (less than 5%).
