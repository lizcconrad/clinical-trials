  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to prospectively monitor the incidence of adverse drug
      reactions, specifically NSF during routine use of gadoversetamide in a large number of
      patients with moderate renal insufficiency (eGFR 30-59) and severe renal insufficiency or
      end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis (eGFR &lt;30).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Referred for contrast-enhanced MRI using gadoversetamide;

          -  Have a documented estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2
             within the past 6 months or ESRD requiring dialysis; and

          -  Willing and able to provide written consent (themselves or by a legally authorized
             representative) and agree to abide by study requirements, including being seen by a
             dermatologist and undergoing a skin biopsy if NSF is suspected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have experienced a previous hypersensitivity reaction to a GBCA;

          -  Have pre-existing NSF or NSF-like symptoms; or

          -  Have been exposed to a GBCA within 12 months prior to the index procedure; or

          -  Has a medical condition or other personal situation that would prevent providing
             follow-up information, completing clinic visits or otherwise supplying meaningful data
             to meet study objectives.
