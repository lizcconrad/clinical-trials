  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Octagam is a human normal immunoglobulin (IGIV) solution for intravenous administration.
      Octagam 5% is currently registered in more than 60 countries. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and the kinetics of Octagam 10% for replacement therapy in primary
      immunodeficiency diseases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the safety of Octagam 10% in replacement
      therapy in PID and to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Octagam 10% with that of the
      previously used Octagam 5%.

      The secondary objective is to investigate the efficacy of Octagam 10% in replacement therapy
      in PID by monitoring the rate of occurence of serious bacterial infections, the rate of other
      infections, the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of total serum IgG and IgG subclasses (IgG1,
      IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4), the trough (pre-next-dose) levels of selected antigen specific
      antibodies, the use of antibiotics, the rate of absence from school/ work, and the number of
      days in hospital.

      <population>The study was terminated prematurely. Owing to the limited data available (only 5 patients enrolled, of whom 2 completed the study and 3 ended treatment prematurely), efficacy and PK analyses were not performed. The safety analysis did not yield any unexpected results suggestive of a change in the risk–benefit evaluation of Octagam 10%.</population>
