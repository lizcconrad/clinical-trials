  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major goal of this project is to adapt an existing group-based psychosocial program to
      enhance community functioning in older people with serious mental illness (SMI). The focus of
      the adaptation is designing and evaluating an individually based rehabilitative program for
      older people with SMI who either cannot or choose not to access a group program.

    <description>The program progresses in three steps. First, participants receive a 10-week Basic Skills for Community Living course covering essential skills from each of the five modules to ensure that all participants establish basic competency in a core set of skills. Second, clinicians assess participants' functioning to identify skill areas that warrant additional improvement and engage participants in a shared decision making process to select skill areas to pursue in greater depth. Third, clinicians have weekly 60 minute sessions with participants in community settings for 7 months to provide training and to facilitate and support acquisition of core skills and rehabilitation goals.</description>
