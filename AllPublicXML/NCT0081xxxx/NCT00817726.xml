    <textblock>
      -  Purpose - to validate a combination of biological and clinical markers in the
           rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) population as indicative of the
           pre-symptomatic stage of Parkinson's disease (PD).

        -  Procedures - All subjects (RBD diagnosis and controls) will have 1) a medical and neuro
           history and physical including videotape of movements, 2) neuropsychological testing, 3)
           a sleep study, 4) olfactory testing, 5) blood draw for serum testing , 6) functional
           MRI. All of these procedures are often performed clinically in the diagnosis of PD.
           Enrollment of subjects with PD is complete. Any testing performed prior to enrollment as
           part of the clinical evaluation may be used in place of repeating the procedure for the
           study. Subjects will be followed for 5 years. It is hypothesized that a 5 year follow up
           may capture a significant number of pre-Parkinson's subjects who will be diagnosed.
           Subjects may be offered a repeat enrollment after 5 years.
