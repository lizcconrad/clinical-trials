  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the pattern of organic volatile compounds (VOCs) in
      the exhaled breath detected by biosensors in adults with persistent mild asthma. The analysis
      of VOCs detected by biosensors in asthmatic adults will be compared with that in a control
      group of healthy subjects and with exhaled nitric oxide (NO).

      Identification of breath VOC patterns may be a completely noninvasive new technique for
      assessing airway inflammation. A device containing a series of nanosensors can be used for
      breath analysis of VOC patterns through integration with a suitable algorithm for pattern
      recognition.

      Preliminary data indicate that exhaled breath patterns detected by biosensors in healthy
      subjects are different from those in patients with asthma. In patients with asthma, analysis
      of exhaled breath using biosensors will be compared with exhaled NO measurement for studying
      a possible correlation with an independent method for assessing airway inflammation and with
      spirometry for assessing a possible correlation with lung function.

      Measurement of exhaled NO is a well-established, validated, and standardized method for
      assessing and monitoring of airway inflammation in patients with asthma who are
      steroid-naive. In patients with asthma, exhaled NO concentrations are correlated with blood
      eosinophil cell counts and with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR).

      This study could contribute to the identification and development of a completely new
      non-invasive technique for assessing airway inflammation with important implications for
      diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of patients with asthma.

      Establishing the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on breath analysis by biosensors in
      patients with asthma is relevant for future studies aimed to use this technique in asthma
      management.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is male or female, at least 15 years of age and no more than 70 years.

          -  Patient has mild persistent asthma (step 2) of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and
             Management of Asthma issued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the
             National Institutes of Health as defined by a history of symptoms at least once a week
             but less than daily (step 2) (5).

          -  Current asthma treatment includes short-acting inhaled β-agonist alone as needed.

          -  Patient fulfils all the following signs and symptoms of asthma:

               -  History of symptoms including, but not limited to dyspnea, wheezing, chest
                  tightness, cough, or sputum production for at least 12 months.

               -  A forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of at least 80% of the predicted
                  value (pre-bronchodilator) while withholding β-agonist for at least six hours.

               -  Patient has a diagnosis of asthma as defined by 1) an increase in FEV1 or PEF of

                  OR 3) a fall in FEV1 of at least 15% after an exercise challenge which was
