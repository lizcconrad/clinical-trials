    <textblock>
      Animal studies have shown that preconditioning with hyperbaric oxygen can induce central
      nervous system and heart ischemic tolerance. This study was designed to determine the
      protective effect of hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning on brain and myocardium
      ischemia-reperfusion injury during coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

      60 patients scheduled to undergo coronary revascularization were recruited for this trial.
      Exclusion criteria included Emergency operation, age older than 80 years, learning
      difficulty, previous cerebrovascular disease, visual or hearing impairment, history of
      pneumothorax, Claustrophobia, middle ear disease, EF &lt; 35%. Patients were randomized either
      to the control group or hyperbaric oxygen group. The laboratory analysis of markers included
      S100B, NSE and troponin I. The assessment of cognitive dysfunction was performed 5 days
      before surgery and 7 days after surgery and haemodynamic measurements, length of stay in ICU,
      length of stay in hospital post-operation were recorded.
