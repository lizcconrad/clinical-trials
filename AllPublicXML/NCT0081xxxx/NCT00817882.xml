  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Back pain has a major impact on people's ability to work. Health professionals need to know
      how they can best use their limited resources to address the occupational needs of people
      with chronic low back pain. Vocational rehabilitation is the process that helps people with
      health problems to stay at, return to and remain at work. This study comprises the second
      phase of a three year study of back pain and vocational rehabilitation. The first phase
      gathered data from patient interviews and postal surveys of GPs and GP practice managers.
      These findings have been used to inform this second phase; a feasibility randomised
      controlled trial. The participants will be thirty employed people with back pain who have
      been offered an NHS rehabilitation programme, and who are concerned about their ability to
      work with low back pain. Those who consent will be randomised into two groups. One group will
      receive routine rehabilitation. The other will receive routine rehabilitation plus an
      individually tailored vocational intervention carried out by the researcher. Following the
      trial, individual interviews will be carried out with each of the participants by an
      independent researcher. An economic study will evaluate the possibility of measuring the
      cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The hypothesis is that an enhanced vocational
      intervention plus routine rehabilitation will be more effective in improving patients' work
      ability than routine rehabilitation alone.
