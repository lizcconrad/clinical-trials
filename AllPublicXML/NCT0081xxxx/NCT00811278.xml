    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids are widely used as the primary therapy for asthma, which affects
      approximately 20 million people in the United States. While many patients respond to
      corticosteroid therapy, as many as 25-30% of patients with severe asthma have asthma that is
      difficult to treat or steroid insensitive. Predictive biomarkers for the rapid identification
      of patients with asthma who will achieve adequate control of their symptoms with inhaled
      corticosteroids has the potential to significantly improve asthma management. This proposal
      is based on the hypothesis that alterations in gene expression in epithelial cells of the
      buccal mucosa can be used as a reliable biomarker to predict corticosteroid response in
      patients with asthma. The goals of this proposal will determine if gene expression in
      epithelial cells of the buccal mucosa from patients with asthma is in concordance with gene
      expression profiles that have been identified through more invasive sampling techniques of
      the airway epithelium of asthma patients. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1)
      investigate the level of variability in gene expression of a subset of inflammatory markers
      in buccal epithelium from adult patients with asthma. Aim 1 will be carried out by collecting
      buccal samples from three cohorts of subjects (18-55 years of age) from the Pulmonology and
      Allergy Clinics at Truman Medical Center during regularly scheduled outpatient visits as
      follows: 1) healthy control adult subjects (n=10), 2) patients with asthma treated only with
      a short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA, n=10), and 3) patients with asthma treated with low-dose
      ICS (n=10). Relative gene expression of inflammatory markers will be determined using
      quantitative RT (reverse transcription)-PCR and variability in gene expression will be
      determined within and between the three cohorts. Data from the pilot studies described in
      this proposal will aid in the determination of appropriate study population sizes for future
      investigations with the long-term objective to use changes in gene expression (in buccal
      epithelial cells) as a dynamic biomarker for determining corticosteroid response in patients
      with asthma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. healthy control adult subjects (n=10),

          2. patients with mild to moderate asthma (n=20) (Table 2, Appendix 4).

        A diagnosis of asthma will be defined as episodic airflow obstruction which is reversible
        (improvement in FEV1 &gt;12% when measured via spirometry) after administration of a SABA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. currently smokers or have been smokers in the past 6 months

          2. a diagnosis of COPD, bronchiectasis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis,
             diagnosis of bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonia in the past 6 months, or other
             diagnoses of chronic lung disease.

          3. subjects being treated with oral systemic corticosteroids for other diseases, those
             using intranasal steroids in a 2 week period preceding the study, or those requiring
             an oral corticosteroid burst in the past 6 weeks, or who are receiving treatment with
             immune modulator medications will also be excluded from the study.
