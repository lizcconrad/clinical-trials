      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety of oral administration of the medical
      food Hoodia to patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease.

      Oral administration of Hoodia is common in many western world countries for appetite
      suppression and as a food supplement or medical food used for dietary purposes.

      Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is a common, often &quot;silent&quot; liver disease which affects
      about 2%-5% of Americans. NASH is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome, diabetes
      type-2 and obesity and can lead to cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplantation or death.This
      clinical trial has been designed to assess the safety of short term oral administration of
      Hoodia to patients with NASH.
