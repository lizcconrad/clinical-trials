    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of posaconazole on unboosted
      fosamprenavir pharmacokinetics, and vice versa, in healthy volunteers.A second objective is
      to determine the safety of combined use of fosamprenavir with posaconazole in healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections with fungi and yeast frequently occur in patients infected with the human
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).

      Fosamprenavir is a PI that is used to treat HIV-infection in combination with ritonavir. Once
      hydrolyzed to amprenavir, this substance is a substrate for CYP3A4. Ritonavir is an extremely
      potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and serves as a booster of the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir.
      Posaconazole is a very potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and therefore might enhance amprenavir
      pharmacokinetics in a similar way as ritonavir.

      The current study is designed to test this hypothesis. When there is an indication for
      antifungal therapy in an HIV-infected patient, temporal replacement of ritonavir by
      posaconazole would be an attractive option for combined treatment of HIV and fungal
      infection.
