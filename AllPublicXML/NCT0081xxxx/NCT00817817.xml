    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, comparative, randomized, parallel, multicenter study in asthmatics to
      determine whether the administration of dry powder inhaled mometasone furoate (MF) 400 μg in
      a monodose capsule device would be comparable to administration of powder inhaled MF 400 μg
      in a multidose device.

          -  Must be &gt;=18 years of age, of either gender &amp; of any race.

          -  Must have had a diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months, characterized by recurrent
             episode of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness &amp; coughing.

          -  Baseline FEV1 must be &gt;=55% and &lt;=85% of predicted at the Screening Visit, when all
             restricted medications have been withheld for the specified intervals.

          -  Must demonstrate evidence of an increase in absolute FEV1 of &gt;=12%, with an absolute
             volume increase of at least 200 mL, after reversibility testing at the Screening Visit
             or documented in the patients chart reversibility up to 1 year previous to inclusion.

          -  Must be free of any clinically significant disease (other than asthma), that would
             interfere with study evaluations.

          -  Must be willing to give written informed consent and be able to adhere to dose &amp; visit
             schedules.

          -  Must agree to inform their own usual treating physician about their participation in
             the study.

          -  Non-pregnant women of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable,

             prescribed IUD; 3) condom in combination with a spermicide; 4) Monogamous relationship
             with a male partner who has had a vasectomy or is using a condom plus spermicide
             during the study. They must have started this birth control method at least 3 months
             prior to Screening (with the exception of condom in combination with a spermicide), &amp;

             potential who are not currently sexually active must agree and consent to using a
             double-barrier method should they become sexually active during the course of this
             study. Women who are surgically sterilized or are at least 1 year postmenopausal are
             considered not to be of childbearing potential. However, all female subjects must have
             a urine pregnancy test obtained at screening, prior to initiation of treatment, &amp; at
             the end of the trial, which must be negative.
