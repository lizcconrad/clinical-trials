  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently it has been suggested that specific mutations in the EGFR gene in lung cancer
      patients is associated with response to a novel drug targeting the EGF system. Recent
      research also indicates that there is a possible association to the degree of aggressiveness
      of the disease.

      The importance of these mutations is controversial, because the data are based on small
      studies with highly selected patients.

      In this project the investigators want to study the types and frequencies of EGFR mutations
      in both untreated and treated patients in a systematic manner and relate this to survival.

      The thorough registration of patient data in DK enables us to create a strong The
      investigators expect this knowledge to be of greatest importance for future rational use of
      drugs targeting the EGF receptors.

      Aim:

        1. To establish a method for identifying the mutations in the EGFR gene in small clinical
           samples from lung cancer patients.

        2. In a retrospective study(n=500) relate survival to the frequency and types of mutations
           in the EGFR gene in a Danish population of patients with advanced, inoperable non small
           cell lung cancer (NSCLC) diagnosed prior to the introduction of treatment directed
           towards EGFR.

        3. In a prospective study (n=300), to identify the mutations in the EGFR gene in patients
           treated with erlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting the EGFR. Presence of
           mutations will be related to the expression of other parts of the EGF system, to
           mutations in the gene coding for K-RAS and to treatment response.
