    <textblock>
      Secondary hyperaldosteronism and the non-osmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) are
      the major factors in sodium and water retention in pulmonary arterial hypertension with right
      ventricular failure. Natriuretic doses of mineralocorticoid antagonist and aquaretic doses of
      V2 receptor antagonist will attenuate the sodium and water retention respectively, and be
      associated with clinical improvement.

    <textblock>
      Much has been learned about the pathophysiological state that underlies the development of
      increased total body volume and edema in left ventricular failure. Very little, however, is
      known about the mechanism underlying systemic hypervolemia in patients with isolated right
      ventricular dysfunction. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) represent a
      model of isolated right ventricular dysfunction in which these mechanisms may be elucidated.
      Aldosterone has now been shown to have many properties that are likely to be detrimental in
      congestive heart failure (CHF) and that are not shared by angiotensin II. Aldosterone
      blockade has been associated with improved mortality in patients with left ventricular
      failure, already receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. But its role in
      isolated right ventricular failure has not been elucidated. The plasma arginine vasopressin
      levels are disproportionately elevated for the degree of serum osmolarity in patients with
      heart failure and result in water retention and hyponatremia. Conivaptan, a vasopressin
      receptor antagonist, appears to reduce body weight and improve signs of left heart failure,
      though there is no study to evaluate its role in right ventricular failure with edema.

      This study will examine the role of spironolactone and conivaptan in patients with right
      ventricular failure and pathophysiology of sodium and water retention in these patients.
