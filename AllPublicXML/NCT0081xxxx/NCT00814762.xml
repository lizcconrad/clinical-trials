      This multicenter observer-blind study will determine the safety and reactogenicity of GSK
      Biologicals' investigational HIV vaccine 732461 in two sequentially enrolling cohorts of
      HIV-infected subjects treated with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) and HIV
      infected treatment naïve subjects, respectively.

          -  Known to be HIV-1 infected and under care of an HIV physician for a minimum of 6
             months. However, subjects who initially presented with primary HIV infection need to
             have been diagnosed and under care for 12 months.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to any study procedure.

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they can and will comply with the

             the duration of the study.

          -  CD4 count ≥ 450 cells per mm³

        Additional inclusion criteria for subjects enrolled in the first cohort (HIV-infected
        subjects receiving HAART):

          -  Stable on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least one year.

          -  Undetectable viral load

        Additional inclusion criteria for subjects enrolled in second cohort (treatment-naïve

          -  HAART-naïve (never received anti-retrovirals after HIV diagnosis)

          -  VL 5000-80000 copies/mL at screening

          -  Commencement of HAART is not expected based on current assessment within next year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             study period.

          -  Drug therapy with immunomodulators or steroids within the three months preceding the
