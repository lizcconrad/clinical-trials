      Study Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to assess that Liquid Acupuncture(Herb Acupoints Injection)
      Therapeutics could achieve permanent efficacy response in Chronic Hepatitis B.

      Efficacy Assessment:

      At cessation of the Treatment(about at 24 weeks)comparing Testing Data with the Normal
      Criteria and their individual baseline.Continue for monitoring the Status 1-5 years.

      Data Analysis:

      Each 4 weeks collecting Patients' testing data and fill a table.A summary table will be
      presented as frequency tables for categorical variables as number or percentage.

      Inclusion Criteria &amp; Outcome:

      Documented chronic hepatitis B infection positive serum HBV-DNA 10^5 copies/mL &amp; above.

      Permanent efficacy response after whole treatment circle close(about 24 weeks,someone may be
      later than 24 weeks but within 48 weeks)

        -  HBeAg loss(if HBeAg positive)

        -  Liver Function normal(if Liver Function off normal)

        -  HBV DNA non-detectability (PCR &lt;500 copies/ml)

        -  Image of chronic diffuse hepatic disease will recover up to normal if have.

        -  HBsAg titer will decrease continually up to loss after cessation of the treatment.

      Treatment Procedure:

      Patients will be involved in the study for up to 24-48 weeks from enrollment. There is no
      external sponsor, commercial sponsor nor governmental agency on this study. The study will be
      conducted only by Dr. Yu, Ke Heng,who is master of the Liquid Acupuncture(Herb Acupoint
      Injection)practice more than 30 years.About 30 subjects will be involved in the study
      overall. All the subjects can be filled up worldwide.

      Patients will be required to rent apartment or house for staying at the city(Xiamen
      city,China preferred).Dr. Yu will go to the Patients' site for treatment practice weekly,each
      4 weeks is one circle(the first 3 weeks for treatment practice and last week for Test
      collection).Appointed Hospitals for test must be certificated and qualified(Chang Gang
      Hospital preferred).Dr. Yu will explain the test results individually.

    <description>Liquid Acupuncture(Herb Acupoints Injection) Therapeutics was researched and developed by Herbalist Yu Ru Lin in early of 1950s and used by Yu Medical Garden till now. It is an integrated therapeutics,according to individual condition, select the Acupoints(not limit to current used common acupoints) and proper herbs made individually.It is a special medical treatment conception, which theory is utilizing patients' condition, mobilizing their individual internal curability,therefore the final efficacy can be retrieved.</description>
