    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data regarding the safety and feasibility of the
      GO-LIF procedure for spinal fixation and stabilization, in conjunction with conventional
      approaches for interbody lumbar fusion. This is in order to allow for evidence-based
      comparison to pedicle-screw-based techniques as described in the literature.

    <intervention_name>GO-LIF - Guided Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion</intervention_name>
    <description>All patients will undergo single-level instrumented interbody spinal fusion surgery with instrumentation.
Upon induction of general anesthesia, the patient will be positioned prone on a radiolucent operating table and prepared according to standard hospital procedure. An interbody fusion will be performed according to standard procedure and as indicated by the surgeon. The interbody fusion portion of the surgery will be carried out using any current technique - such as PLIF, TLIF, PLF, PLLF, XLIF or ALIF. The fusion strategy can be performed in an open or minimally invasive manner, as indicated. The interbody device will be inserted after the screws trajectory will be drilled and a 4.5mm Trajectory holder is in place. This will assure the surgeon that no collision will occur between the interbody and the screws.
Upon completion of the fusion stage of the surgery, SpineAssist will be used to introduce the GO-LIF screws for fixation of the spinal levels to be fused.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Men and women, 18-80 years of age.

          2. The capability to comprehend the nature and rationale of the study and to consent to
             participating in the study.

          3. Unequivocal medical indication for the fixation surgery of a single motion segment of
             the lumbar spine.

          4. Correct coronal profile of the lumbar spine. An asymmetric collapse of the disk space
             in the coronal plane between the vertebral bodies envisioned for instrumentation is by
             itself not an exclusion criterion.

        Or any of criteria below:

          1. Patients with Grade II or Grade III spondylolisthesis in the sagittal plane with
             preserved or normal sagittal alignment requiring single-level instrumented interbody
             fusion from L1 to S1. (Not excluding patient with a need to decompression)

          2. Patients must have normal alignment of the spine in the coronal view. 2. The interbody
             fusion approach may be TLIF or PLIF or ALIF or other, as clinically indicated.

             3. The procedure may be combined with a Micro-decompression and/or Micro-discectomy
             and/or direct or indirect decompression and/or laminectomy or laminotomy and/or other
             procedures, as clinically indicated - as long as such procedures do not compromise the
             structural integrity of the pedicles of the inferior vertebra or the vertebral body of
             either vertebra of the levels involved..

             4. Patient is 18 years or more 5. Patient is willing and able to comply with study
             requirements

             Exclusion Criteria:

               1. Lumbar hyperlordosis &gt; 70° between the end plate of the lumbar vertebral body 1
                  and the end plate of the sacral vertebral body 1.

               2. Deformities of the vertebral bodies envisioned for instrumentation or the sacrum.

               3. Spondylolisthesis &gt; grade 2 acc. to Meyerding.

               4. Scoliosis and other deformities in the coronal plane.

               5. Fractures of the vertebrae envisioned for instrumentation.

               6. Osteoporosis or osteopenia (see below for examination criteria).

               7. Therapy with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

               8. Bone metabolism diseases, such as osteomalacia or Paget's disease.

               9. Post inflammatory instability of the vertebral spine.

              10. State after radiation therapy of the relevant vertebral spine region.

              11. Current Marcoumar or heparin therapy for more than 6 months at the time of
                  operation.

              12. Malignant diseases with or without bone metastases.

              13. Immunologic-inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis).

              14. Diabetes mellitus.

              15. Infectious diseases.

              16. BMI &gt; 30.
