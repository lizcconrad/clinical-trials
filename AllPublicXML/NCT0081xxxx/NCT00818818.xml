  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effect of low doses of pentavalent antimony
      (meglumine antimoniate) to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis ulcers in patients older than 65
      years. The hypothesis is that older patients may have a positive response with a lower dose
      of pentavalent antimony, avoiding the frequent adverse events observed with the standard
      dose. The design is that of an open uncontrolled trial enrolling 20 patients infected with
      the parasite Leishmania braziliensis in an endemic area of the State of Bahia, Brazil. The
      endpoint of cure or therapeutic failure will be evaluated at the third month of follow-up
      after treatment to avoid the impact of spontaneous cure as a confounding factor.
