  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric bypass surgery has in many studies shown total remission of type 2 diabetes as early
      as 1 - 2 days after surgery and this is before any real weight loss has occurred. This
      suggest that the remission of the diabetes is due to the direct effect of the operation more
      that the secondary effect of the weight loss. The reason for the major effect on the glucose
      metabolism after gastric bypass surgery is still unaccounted for.

      This PhD. project will try to unveil some of the mechanisms that could explain the effect of
      gastric bypass surgery on the glucose metabolism seen in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      The hypothesis of the study is that a factor &quot;X&quot; will course the remission of the diabetes.
      This factor &quot;X&quot; is related to the anatomic changes of the gastro intestinal tract, by
      eliminating the foods passage through the distal part of the ventricle and the duodenum, in
      combination with the Roux- en-Y sling.

      The PhD. project will consist of clinical trails on patients that will undergo gastric bypass
      surgery. The studies will take place before and within the 1. week after surgery. The
      investigators will measure different hormones and adipokines in fast and the postprandial
      state. To discover possible new proteins the investigators will run proteomic on some
      samples. All the results will be compared to the same parameter on patients undergoing
      gastric banding, where the anatomy of the intestine hasn't been changed.
