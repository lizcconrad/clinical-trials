    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the reduction in mean glycated hemoglobin
      levels (HbA1c) between 2 doses of oral HDV-I and placebo in type 2 diabetic patients on
      background metformin therapy at the end of 18 weeks of treatment.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the effects of oral HDV-I versus placebo on the 7-point glucose test,
           fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin
           resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β),
           frequency of hypoglycemic events, body weight, and lipid levels; and

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral HDV-I.
