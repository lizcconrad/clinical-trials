  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FOLFOX4 plus Avastin has been suggested as firstline regimen for advanced colorectal cancer
      by NCCN, a new angiogenesis inhibitor, known as Endostar(Recombinant Human Endostatin),
      prolonged the overall survival, time to progression and improved response rate in metastatic
      lung cancer in a large phase III clinical trial in china, so we design this trial to evaluate
      the safty and efficacy of FolFox4 plus Endostar in patients with advanced colorectal cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endostar is free supported by Shangdong Simcere Medgene biotech co.,Ltd. Endostar combination
      with Chemotherapy has been the first line treatment regimen to advanced NSCLC. Clinical data
      proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could
      suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human
      genome. China NCCN colon or rectal cancer clinical practice guideline recommends Chemotherapy
      plus angiogenesis inhibitor as the first line treatment scheme. So we design FOLFOX4 plus
      Endostar to treat advanced colorectal cancer to research the RR and safety. We believe this
      treatment regimen may be a new approach to the advanced colorectal cancer patients.
