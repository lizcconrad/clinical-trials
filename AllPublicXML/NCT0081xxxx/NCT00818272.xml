      This observational study is in line with the German educational plan with the aim to
      implement a tool to increase and monitor the awareness for tuberculosis screening and to
      reinforce the patient eligibility for a treatment with Remicade according to the Summary of
      Product Characteristics (SmPc).

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Had the Mendel Mantoux Test as the First Screening Test for Active or Latent Tuberculosis (TB) Before Starting Treatment</measure>

    <description>In order to increase the attending physician's awareness of the required tuberculosis screening and to support the screening itself, tuberculosis screening was performed and documented before treatment administration (baseline). The number of participants who had the Mendel Mantoux test (tuberculin sensitivity skin test by intradermal injection) as the first screening test was presented in three categories:
Yes

    <description>In order to increase the attending physician's awareness of the required tuberculosis screening and to support the screening itself, tuberculosis screening was performed and documented before treatment administration (baseline). The number of participants who had the in-vitro TB test (cellular blood test, i.e. gamma interferon release assays) as the first screening test was presented in three categories:

    <description>In order to increase the attending physician's awareness of the required tuberculosis screening and to support the screening itself, tuberculosis screening was performed and documented before treatment administration (baseline). If done according to guidelines, complete TB screening comprised a TB screeing test and a chest X-ray. The number of participants who had a frontal chest X-ray was presented in three categories:
Yes

    <measure>Assessment of Disease Activity by Means of the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) at the Time of Enrollment and at the First Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and time of first Infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI score is used to quantify the symptoms of participants with CD. The CDAI incorporates 8 items added together that are indicators of disease severity. Scores range from 0 to 600; higher scores indicate worse disease activity. Participants with scores below 150 have inactive disease whereas those with scores above 450 are considered critically ill. A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity. CDAI was calculated at the time of enrollment (baseline) and at the time of first infusion.</description>
