    <textblock>
      To test if usual at home night time sleep duration as measured with activity monitors and
      questionnaires will predict changes in kidney function as measured by kidney filtration rate
      and of cardiovascular function as measured by C-reactive protein in the blood. The study will
      explore the role of decreased sleep time or decreased sleep quality as a non-traditional risk
      factor for the progression of CKD and for the development of cardiovascular disease in CKD.
