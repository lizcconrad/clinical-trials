      A 10 week evaluation, crossover design study including a 3 week washout period between
      treatments, to determine the effects of Combigan® (fixed combination brimonidine tartrate
      0.2%/timolol maleate 0.5%) and Cosopt® (fixed combination dorzolamide hydrochloride-timolol
      maleate ophthalmic solutions) on ocular blood flow as measured by retrobulbar blood flow.

        <description>End diastolic velocity (EDV) of retrobulbar blood flow as measured by color Doppler imaging (CDI) in the nasal short posterior ciliary artery after 1 month of treatment. CDI is a high-resolution ultrasound system which provides visualization of the flow of blood through a vessel. EDV is the maximum blood flow speed within a vessel at the end of diastole (minimum pressure exerted in a blood vessel in between heart beats).</description>

          <title>Retrobulbar Blood Flow (End Diastolic Velocity) as Measured by Color Doppler Imaging in the Central Retinal Artery</title>
          <description>End diastolic velocity (EDV) of retrobulbar blood flow as measured by color Doppler imaging (CDI) in the central retinal artery after 1 month of treatment. CDI is a high-resolution ultrasound system which provides visualization of the flow of blood through a vessel. EDV is the maximum blood flow speed within a vessel at the end of diastole (minimum pressure exerted in a blood vessel in between heart beats).</description>
