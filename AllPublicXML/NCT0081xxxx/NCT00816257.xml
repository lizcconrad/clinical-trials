  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in the registry will be recipients of single and double lung
      transplantation (bilateral sequential, heart-lung, or living related donor grafts). During
      the routine management of lung recipients frequent surveillance of the lung allograft is
      necessary. This routinely involves: measurement of pulmonary functions, chest radiography,
      collection of peripheral blood to assess other organ function and monitor therapeutic drug
      levels, and bronchoscopic evaluation allowing for collection of lung lavage fluid and lung
      tissue biopsy. This surveillance normally follows a set schedule during the first one to two
      years following the transplant procedure. Surveillance is routinely performed at weeks 2, 8,
      12, 24, 36, and 52 during the first year following the transplant procedure. Additional
      surveillance may be performed at any time when clinically indicated for the optimal
      management of the recipient. Information and specimens collected from each of these
      encounters will be entered in the data registry and specimen repository.

      The collection of disposable lung allograft (transplant tissue samples), blood samples and
      information from medical records for storage, future analysis and research. Stored samples
      will be available to other researchers who have obtained separate review and approval from an
      ethics committee called an Institutional Review Board.

      Immediately prior to the transplant surgery, the surgeon or pulmonologist will routinely
      examine the lungs via bronchoscopy during which subjects will be medicated for pain.

      The samples that are obtained during this and post-surgery (clinically scheduled)
      bronchoscopies, including bronchial lavage, are either sent to pathology or are discarded if
      they do not qualify to go to pathology. For this research, the researchers are asking that
      the samples that do not qualify for pathology be placed into the repository instead of being
      thrown away.
