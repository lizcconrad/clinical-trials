  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is an epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human
      suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term
      microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions
      that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. However, none of the recent
      intervention studies has demonstrated a benefit of intensive glycemic control on their
      primary CVD outcomes.

      The investigators report the findings of a long-term randomized and comparator-controlled
      clinical trial conducted in patients with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The investigators
      compared the effect of pioglitazone with that of metformin on circulating endothelial
      cell-derived submicroscopic membranous vesicles, termed microparticles: because of their
      putative role in inflammatory processes and their ability to directly affect endothelial
      functions, they are gaining increasing popularity as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular
      outlook. Metformin was chosen as a comparator because the American Diabetes Association
      recommendations suggest to start therapy in newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetic subjects
      combining a drug (metformin) with lifestyle changes. Moreover, the mechanism of action of
      pioglitazone is distinct from that of metformin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 30-75 years, with newly-diagnosed type 2 diabetes (according to the
             ADA criteria) and never treated with antihyperglycemic drugs, were selected for the
             study. Inclusion criteria also included a body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2, and HbA1c
             level &lt;10%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Any investigational drug within the previous 3 months

          -  Use of agents affecting glycemic control (systemic glucocorticoids, and weight-loss
             drugs)

          -  Presence of any clinically relevant somatic or mental diseases that anticipated poor
             adherence to diet regimens

          -  To minimize the likelihood of including subjects with late-onset type 1 diabetes,
             candidates with a positive test for anti-GAD antibody or with fasting plasma C-peptide
             less than 0.76 ng/L (&lt;0.25 pmol/L) were excluded

          -  Also excluded were patients with abnormal laboratory tests, including liver enzymes
             (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) greater
             than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and serum creatinine greater than 123.8 Î¼mol/L
             (1.4 mg/dL).
