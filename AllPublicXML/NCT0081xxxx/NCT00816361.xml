        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor for which no curative or standard
             therapies exist.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60.

          -  Adequate hematological function.

          -  Adequate organ function.

          -  Women of non-child-bearing potential (defined as being &gt;1 year post-menopausal) or
             using effective contraception, e.g., use of oral contraceptives with an additional
             barrier method (since the investigational product may impair the effectiveness of oral
             contraceptives), double barrier methods (diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms
             with contraceptive foam), Depo-Provera, partner vasectomy, or total abstinence, from
             the time the informed consent is signed through 30 days after the last dose of
             MEDI-573. Male subjects with partners of child-bearing potential must be surgically
             sterile or use contraceptive method as described above from the time of the initiation
             of MEDI-573 through 30 days after the last dose of MEDI-573.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior treatment within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          -  No concurrent therapy for treatment of cancer.

          -  No uncontrolled diabetes.

          -  New York Heart Association Grade ≥ 2 congestive heart failure.

          -  History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, transient ischemic attack or stroke
             within the previous 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Documented brain metastasis.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation or plans to become pregnant while on study.

          -  Clinically significant abnormality on ECG.
