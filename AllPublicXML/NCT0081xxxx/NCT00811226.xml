      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficiency of Olmesartan medoxomile (OLMETEC®)
      alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (OLMETEC PLUS®) in the reduction of arterial
      blood pressure in patients with light to moderate hypertension, and to evaluate the
      percentage of patients that reach treatment goals using this antihypertensive regimen.

      α= 0.05. α's Z=1.96 β= 80%. β's Z=0.84 Estimated proportion of subjects to achieve optimal
      control of arterial hypertension= 83.2%

      450 subjects are expected to be enrolled in the study of which 40 subjects will be enrolled
      in Venezuela.
