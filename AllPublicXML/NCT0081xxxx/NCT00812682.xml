      This study will evaluate the perception of the physicians and the patients about the approved
      adjustable dosing of SymbicortÂ® 160/4,5. Symbicort maintenance dose will be adjusted up and
      down within the approved dose range of 1x2 - 4x2 inhalations per day, to the level of asthma
      symptoms. Patients and physicians perception of this new dosing schedule will be evaluated by
      means of questionnaires completion and direct questioning.
