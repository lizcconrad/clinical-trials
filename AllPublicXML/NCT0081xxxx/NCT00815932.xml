  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled trial designed to determine short- and long-term effects of repeated
      tDCS on the P300 component of event-related evoked potentials in patients with chronic
      neuropathic pain due to Complex regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) or diabetic neuropathy as
      compared with healthy subjects.

    <description>The latency and amplitude of P300, subjective pain intensity, and pain thresholds for tactile and thermal stimuli will be determined at before and 15 min and 120 min after the 1st and 5th tDCS/sham procedure, To receive tDCS/sham treatment, two electrodes will be placed on the patient´s skull (for details see section Methods) and the patient will rest for 5 min. After that, the patient will receive 20 minutes of 2 mA tDCS/sham. Subjective pain intensity, and pain thresholds for tactile and thermal stimuli will be determined before-, 15 min after and 120 min after each tDCS/Sham procedure. At the 1st and 5th tDCS/Sham session, the latency and amplitude of P300 will be determined before-, 15 min after and 120 min after the tDCS/sham procedure.</description>
