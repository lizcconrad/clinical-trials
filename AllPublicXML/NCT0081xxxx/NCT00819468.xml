  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of teduglutide in healthy subjects
      with normal hepatic function with subjects who have moderate hepatic impairment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 subjects (equally divided between subjects with normal hepatic function and those with
      moderate hepatic impairment (defined by the protocol as a Child-Pugh classification of grade
      B score of 7-9)will be given a single injection of teduglutide (20mg) through subcutaneous
      injection into the abdomen. Blood samples would be taken within 30 minutes of dose through 24
      hours post-dose. Subjects in both groups are matched up by sex, age, BMI, and renal function.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male or female between 18 and 85 years of age

          -  BMI of 18 to 40, inclusive

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Willing and able to be confined at the study site for approximately 2.5 days

          -  Female subjects who are postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or women of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) using an effective form of birth control during the
             study

          -  WOCBP must have a negative urine Î²-hCG result at screening (Days -28 to -2) and
             check-in (Day -1)

          -  Negative urine test for selected drugs of abuse and alcohol at screening and check-in
             (

        Inclusion for Subjects with Impaired Hepatic Function (in addition to above criteria):

          -  Documented moderately impaired hepatic function defined by a total score of 7 to 9 on
             the Child-Pugh Classification at screening and check-in

          -  No clinically significant change in disease status within the 3 months prior to study
             entry

          -  Abnormal laboratory results that are related to the subject's underlying condition
             clinically stable as deemed by the investigator

          -  Abstained from alcohol use within 90 days prior to study entry when hepatic impairment
             is known to be secondary to alcohol abuse

          -  On medication and/or treatment regimen if, in the opinion of the investigator, the
             underlying disease is under control

          -  Subjects with normal hepatic function will be matched collectively as a group by
             gender, age, and BMI with the subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function.
             Subjects with normal hepatic function will also be matched on an individually with the
             subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function with regard to renal function In
             addition to inclusion criteria # 1 to 8, subjects with normal hepatic function must
             also meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this
             study:

             subject with moderately impaired hepatic function

          -  Medically healthy with normal or clinically insignificant clinical results at

          -  Acceptable Child-Pugh score (Grade B, score of 7 to 9), which is associated with
             conditions such as metastatic cancer rather than impaired hepatic function

          -  Subjects with Normal Hepatic Function (in addition to exclusion criteria 1-4

          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic,
