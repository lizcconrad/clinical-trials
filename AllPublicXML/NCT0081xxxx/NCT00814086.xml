  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of cisplatin given together
      with paclitaxel in treating patients with stage IIB, stage IIC, stage III, or stage IV
      ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and giving them in different ways may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the feasibility of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin and intravenous (IV)
      paclitaxel followed by IP paclitaxel in patients with stage IIB, IIC, III, or IV ovarian
      epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the types of surgical
      and catheter complications that may occur after surgery or during the course of treatment in
      these patients.

      III. Estimate the response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin intraperitoneally (IP) on day 1 and
      paclitaxel IP on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.
