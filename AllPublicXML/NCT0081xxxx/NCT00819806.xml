  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive immunizations every other week for 8 immunizations prior to clinical
      and immunological evaluations. Patients will then receive immunizations every month up to one
      year. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously 3 days prior to the first
      immunization, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and subsequent monthly immunizations. Women and men &gt;= 18
      years of age with refractory metastatic malignancies that express NY-ESO-1 by RT-PCR or
      immunohistochemistry. Alternatively, patients may be elected on the basis of serum
      anti-NY-ESO-!-antibodies as detected by ELISA.

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the toxicity profile of the regimens described in Section 1.6.

      Secondary Objective: To detect and quantitate immune responses induced by the proposed
      peptide vaccine or protein vaccine in association with CpG 7909 and cyclophosphamide. This
      endpoint will be assessed by an IFN-y ELISPOT assay of NY-ESO-1-specific tumor-reactive CD8 +
      T cells. We also will look for NY-ESO-1 tetramer CD8+ T cells, Delayed-type Hypersensitivity
      (DTH), and NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ T cell responses with ELISPOT assays and
      cytokine-release-assays.

      Tertiary Objectives: To evaluate tumor response in terms of clinical tumor regression and
      progression-free interval. To evaluate the survival of patients treated with the regimens
      described in Section 1.6.

      The first 3 patients will be assigned treatment A. All three patients will be treated and
      observed for one month. If no DLTs are observed in the first 3 patients, accrual to arm A
      will be put on hold and accrual will continue with Arm B. However, if 1 DLT is observed in
      Arm A, up to 3 additional patients will be treated on Arm A, until either 2 DLTs have been
      observed, or 6 patients have been treated with just 1 DLT among them. If 2 DLTs are observed
      in Arm A, the study will terminate and all treatments will be deemed intolerable. The same
      principles apply to the cohorts treated on B-E: if the number of DLTs (after one month of
      treatment) is zero, accrual proceeds to the next treatment group; if it is 1, accrual
      continues with the same treatment for up to 3 additional patients; if it is 2, no patients
      will be treated on the remaining treatment arms.

             chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or biological therapy within the
             preceding 4 weeks.

         19. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

         20. WHO Performance Status of 0 or 1.

         21. Normal titers for ANA (&lt;= 1/80) and anti-ds DNA (&lt;= 1/10). Patients with elevated
             titers of ANAs (&gt; 1/80) or anti-ds DNA (&gt;1/10) will be excluded from protocol only if
             they have symptoms of active auto-immune disease as assessed by specialized
             consultation (rheumatologist).

         22. Subjects need to have recovered from any effects of previous treatments (recovery must
             have been documented for at least 1 week prior to treatment on this study).

         23. Subjects must be free of brain metastasis by contrast-enhanced CT/MRI scans or have
             brain metastasis and: the total number of brain metastasis is &lt;=3; each brain
             metastasis must have been either completely removed by surgery of treated with
             stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife); the subject must be asymptomatic for more
             than 1 month.

         24. Female subjects of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test, and
             must not be breast feeding.

         25. Subjects must agree to use effective contraception (both males and females). We have
             decided to include patients with NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors of different histological
             types and not only melanoma as we have previously done in the ongoing trial UPCI
             00-079. The reasons are several-fold. First, we do not expect that the type of disease
             will have an impact on the main objectives (i.e. safety, toxicity and immunological).
             Second, we feel it is important to be able to include all eligible cancer patients
             with no available therapeutic option and who are willing to be included in a novel
             investigative trial. Finally, our experience with the ongoing trial UPCI 00-079 leads
             us to think that the large majority of patients will be melanoma patients (17 patients
             included to date, including 16 melanoma patients and one sarcoma patient).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with prostate cancer who demonstrate an anti-androgen withdrawal response,
             defined as a &gt;= 25% drop in PSA within 4 weeks (flutamide) or six week (nilutamide,
             bicalutamide) of stopping a non-steroidal anti-androgen are not eligible until the PSA
             rises above the nadir observed after anti-androgen withdrawal.

          2. Serious illnesses, such as: cardiovascular disease (uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure, hypertension, cardiac ischemia, myocardial infarction, severe cardia
             arrhythmia), bleeding disorders, autoimmune diseases, severe obstructive or
             restrictive pulmonary diseases, active systemic infections, inflammatory bowel
             disorders, severe renal disease.

          3. Any significant psychiatric disease, medical intervention, or other condition, which
             in the opinion of the principal investigator, could prevent adequate informed consent
             or compromise participation in the clinical trial.

          4. Active infection or antibiotics within one-week prior to study, including unexplained
             fever (temp &gt; 38.1 degree C).

          5. Treatment with nitrosources within 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

          6. Systemic steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy &gt; 10 days within 4 weeks of
             enrollment.

          7. A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy &gt; 5 days developing during the
             trial will result in the subject being removed from the study.

          8. Treatment with any investigational immunization with CpG 7909 and NY-ESO-1 peptides of
             NY-ESO-1 protein within two years of registration or treatment with any other
             investigational product within 28 days of registration.
