    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study drug administration through 30 days after last dose of MEDI-575, up to 112 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, for the period extending to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Participants were counted only once for each event and by the highest event severity, regardless of how many events the participant experienced. The AEs were summarized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 14.1.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study drug administration through 30 days after last dose of MEDI-575, up to 112 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that results in death, is immediately life threatening, require (or prolong) inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent SAEs that emerged after start of study drug were reported. Participants were counted only once for each event and by the highest event severity, regardless of how many events the participant experienced. The SAEs were summarized using MedDRA version 14.1.</description>

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start of study drug administration through 30 days after last dose of MEDI-575, up to 112 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the dose escalation phase, a minimum of 21 evaluable participants (3 participants each in Dose Cohorts 1 through 7) were required for this study if Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) do not occur. If a DLT does occur among the first 3 participants in a cohort, 3 additional participants were to be added to the cohort; 3 more participants were to be added to a cohort to determine the MTD if only 3 participants have been previously treated at that dose. The MTD is the maximum dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 participants experienced a DLT. A DLT is defined as any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity or any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity except grade 3 fever (in the absence of neutropenia) or grade 3 rigors/chills.</description>

    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. The PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined according to RECIST guidelines (ie, at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions). The duration of response was censored on the date of last tumor assessment documenting absence of disease progression for participants who have no documented progression prior to data cutoff, dropout, or the initiation of alternate anticancer treatment. Duration of response was calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective response.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, for the period extending to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Participants were counted only once for each event and by the highest event severity, regardless of how many events the participant experienced. The AEs were summarized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 14.1.</description>

        <description>All 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) performed during the study were obtained in triplicate (ie, 3 ECGs were obtained within a 5-minute time interval) and analyzed. ECG parameters included heart rate (high and low), QT interval, QTcB (corrected QT interval per Bazett's formula), and QTcF (corrected QT interval per Fridericia's formula). Number of participants with TEAEs related to ECG after the start of study drug were reported.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</title>
        <description>For the dose escalation phase, a minimum of 21 evaluable participants (3 participants each in Dose Cohorts 1 through 7) were required for this study if Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) do not occur. If a DLT does occur among the first 3 participants in a cohort, 3 additional participants were to be added to the cohort; 3 more participants were to be added to a cohort to determine the MTD if only 3 participants have been previously treated at that dose. The MTD is the maximum dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 participants experienced a DLT. A DLT is defined as any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity or any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity except grade 3 fever (in the absence of neutropenia) or grade 3 rigors/chills.</description>
        <time_frame>From the start of study drug administration through 30 days after last dose of MEDI-575, up to 112 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>MTD evaluable population includes all participants in the dose escalation phase who have received at least 1 full cycle of MEDI-575 and have completed the safety follow-up through the DLT-evaluation period, or who experienced a DLT. The MTD dose was not evaluated as there were no DLTs reported in this study.</population>

          <description>For the dose escalation phase, a minimum of 21 evaluable participants (3 participants each in Dose Cohorts 1 through 7) were required for this study if Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) do not occur. If a DLT does occur among the first 3 participants in a cohort, 3 additional participants were to be added to the cohort; 3 more participants were to be added to a cohort to determine the MTD if only 3 participants have been previously treated at that dose. The MTD is the maximum dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 participants experienced a DLT. A DLT is defined as any grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity or any grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity except grade 3 fever (in the absence of neutropenia) or grade 3 rigors/chills.</description>
          <population>MTD evaluable population includes all participants in the dose escalation phase who have received at least 1 full cycle of MEDI-575 and have completed the safety follow-up through the DLT-evaluation period, or who experienced a DLT. The MTD dose was not evaluated as there were no DLTs reported in this study.</population>

        <description>Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after the initial documentation of response. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, and normalization of tumor marker level. The PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response</title>
        <description>Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined according to RECIST guidelines (ie, at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions). The duration of response was censored on the date of last tumor assessment documenting absence of disease progression for participants who have no documented progression prior to data cutoff, dropout, or the initiation of alternate anticancer treatment. Duration of response was calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective response.</description>

          <title>Duration of Response</title>
          <description>Duration of response is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression. Disease progression is defined according to RECIST guidelines (ie, at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions). The duration of response was censored on the date of last tumor assessment documenting absence of disease progression for participants who have no documented progression prior to data cutoff, dropout, or the initiation of alternate anticancer treatment. Duration of response was calculated for the subgroup of participants with an objective response.</description>
