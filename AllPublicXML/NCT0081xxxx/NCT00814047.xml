  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow autoregulation is defined as the ability of a tissue to maintain a relatively
      constant flow, despite moderate alterations in perfusion pressure. Similar to the cerebral,
      renal, coronary and skeletal muscle circulations, the ocular vascular bed shows the property
      of flow autoregulation. This homeostatic mechanism allows blood supply to the eye to match
      metabolic demand during daily activities, such as changes in posture, or in more critical
      conditions.

      Autoregulation has been found to be a complex phenomenon, showing heterogeneity in its site
      and time course of action. Since metabolic, myogenic, neurogenic and possibly
      endothelium-related mechanisms may be involved, several factors may vary depending on the
      challenging stimulus, the vessel tone, or the degree of impairment of autoregulation.

      To study the dynamics of ocular autoregulation, it is necessary to introduce a step
      disturbance (stimulus) in ocular perfusion pressure and to record the responses of ocular
      blood flow continuously before and after this step disturbance. The investigators have
      employed a mechanical noninvasive technique to induce an ocular perfusion pressure step
      disturbance without drugs or changes in the concentration of vasoactive substances in the
      blood by using the thigh cuff technique inducing a small step decrease in ocular perfusion
      pressure.

      With this technique the investigators could show significant differences in the time response
      of blood velocities in the ophthalmic and middle cerebral artery. This clearly indicates
      different mechanisms to be responsible for autoregulatory mechanisms distal to the vessels.

      Interestingly our results indicate that in the ophthalmic artery a late vasoconstriction
      occurs. Many previous investigations have demonstrated that sympathetic nerve stimulation
      causes vasoconstriction in the ocular circulation. Accordingly, the present study tests the
      hypothesis that α2-adrenoceptors are involved in the dynamic regulation of blood flow in the
      ophthalmic and middle cerebral artery after a step decrease in perfusion pressure.
