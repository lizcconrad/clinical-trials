      Primary objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Bi-Profenid 100 mg x 2 day versus Bi-Profenid 150 mg x
      2 day in patients presenting with pain related to closed, benign, acute post-traumatic
      conditions of the motor system or acute, non-infectious rheumatologic conditions, by
      comparing, on the one hand, changes in resting pain intensity over the entire day, measured
      at the end of the day using a numeric scale (NS), over 5 days and, on the other hand, total
      intake over 5 days of concomitant analgesics.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe concomitant analgesic treatments

        -  To describe the time between baseline and use of a step I, II or III analgesic

        -  To evaluate patients pain relief using a Likert 4-class scale (complete or substantial
           relief, moderate relief slight relief and absence of relief) at D5

        -  To evaluate changes in intensity of pain when moving, over the entire day, measured at
           the end of the day using a numeric scale, over 5 days

        -  To evaluate the patients overall satisfaction at the end of treatment using a 4-point
           Simple Verbal Scale (SVS) (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied,
           very unsatisfied)

        -  To evaluate the patients overall satisfaction at the end of the study using a 4-point
           Simple Verbal Scale (EVS) (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat unsatisfied,
           very unsatisfied)

        -  To compare the safety of the two treatments
