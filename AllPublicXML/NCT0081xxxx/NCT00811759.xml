      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with
      temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving sorafenib
      together with temozolomide in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib tosylate and
           temozolomide in patients with stage III-IV melanoma. (Phase I)

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival at 12 weeks. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate tumor response according to RECIST criteria.

        -  Evaluate overall and progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate the effect of treatment on tumor vascularization.

        -  Compare the pharmacokinetic profile of temozolomide with and without sorafenib tosylate.

        -  Evaluate the number and the role of lymphocytes.

        -  Correlate tumor response rate with BRAF mutation status.

        -  Correlate response rate with MGMT activity.

        -  Compare the efficacy of genomics and proteomics as a means of discovery of serum
           biomarkers.

        -  Study the prognostic and predictive value of circulating endothelial cells and
           circulating endothelial progenitors.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of course 1) and
      oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with accessible tumors (cutaneous or sub-cutaneous) undergo biopsies at baseline and
      day 28 for analysis of BRAF mutations and MGMT expression.
