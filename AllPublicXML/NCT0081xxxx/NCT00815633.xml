      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the biologic medication alefacept (Amevive)
      is effective and safe in the treatment of Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris (PRP) is a therapeutic challenge, and many different medication
      regimens exist to treat the condition. Clinical response is variable, and no single treatment
      has emerged as a leading therapy. Biologic agents have emerged as effective treatments for
      many skin diseases, including psoriasis. Given the clinical overlap between PRP and
      psoriasis, it is logical to attempt to use these agents for PRP. Since the majority of
      patients with PRP are unresponsive to current therapies, new treatment modalities must be
      evaluated. This study will evaluate the treatment of adult 30 years or older with a diagnosis
      of PRP, either subtypes 1 or 2. In this study, the safety and efficacy of alefacept will be
      evaluated in adult patients with PRP refractory to current treatments. Alefacept is a dimeric
      fusion protein containing the CD2 extracellular binding region of human leukocyte function
      antigen-3 (LFA-3) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The drug binds to the T-lymphocyte
      antigen CD2 and blocks its interaction with LFA-3 on antigen presenting cells in the body.
      The CD2/LFA-3 interaction is a key co-stimulatory signal in the activation of T-lymphocytes
      central to the pathophysiology of psoriasis. It is theorized this interaction plays a role in
      the pathophysiology of PRP. Alefacept is currently approved for the treatment of adults with
      moderate to severe, chronic, plaque-type psoriasis. The medication is administered as weekly
      intramuscular injections for 12 week courses. In this study, a dose of 15mg alefacept will be
      administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for 12 weeks. This is the dosing regimen
      currently approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Patients will be followed for a total of
      24 weeks.
