    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is:

        -  To determine whether it is feasible in locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal
           cancer to administer 3 cycles of Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin and S-1 as a chemotherapy scheme
           and also to determine what toxicities are involved.

      The secondary objective of this trial are to describe:

        -  The disease free survival at one and two years in that subgroup of patients that has
           undergone a R0 resection.

        -  The downstaging after 3 cycles of chemotherapy, pCR in that subgroup of patients that
           have undergone an R0 resection and progression-free survival and overall survival at one
           and two years.
