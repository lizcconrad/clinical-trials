  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose-finding study. Approximately 8 healthy subjects will be
      participating in this study.

      Within one week after the screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria will enter a one day treatment period. During this period, 4 anal
      manometric studies will take place. Study medication (Coated Nifedipine suppositories at
      various doses) will be administered at pre-determined intervals. During the study, blood
      samples will be obtained for plasma Nifedipine analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After detrminig baseline resting anal pressure with a manometric test, coated Suppositories
      will be administered intra rectally. Subjects will take rectally a total of 3 Coated
      Suppositories per study. 90 minutes after each coated suppository insertion this suppository
      will be removed and a amnometric study will be performed:

      The first dose will contain 4 mg of Nifedipine and the manomentric measurement performed
      afterwards will be used to determine baseline anal pressures.

      The second dose will contain 12 mg of Nifedipine. The third dose will contain 24 mg of
      Nifedipine. The primary efficacy parameter is change in Resting Anal Pressure from baseline.

      The secondary efficacy parameters include the following:

        -  The ratio of change in anal pressure to plasma Nifedipine level.

        -  The ratio of change in anal pressure to change in blood pressure.

        -  The ratio of change in anal pressure to change in heart rate.
