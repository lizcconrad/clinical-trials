  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stenosis of the coronary arteries may be treated by balloon dilatation followed by the
      implantation of a metal stent. However, restenosis occurs in 10-20% of patients treated with
      bare metal stents (BMS). Restenosis and treatment of restenosis is associated with risk of
      myocardial infarction (MI) and death. Drug eluting stents (DES)release drugs to the vessel
      wall that delay or inhibit the process of restenosis. Some reports have found that DES are
      associated with risk of acute stent thrombosis, MI and death. The precise magnitude of this
      risk is not known. Current evidence is therefore insufficient to balance the long-term risk
      and benefit of BMS vs DES.

      The purpose of this trial is to compare the long-term effects on MI and total mortality of
      BMS vs DES. The trial will recruit 8000 patients from 8 Norwegian hospitals. The patients
      will be randomized to treatment with BMS or DES. Clinical events will be registered for 5
      years after treatment. The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in the risk of
      death or myocardial infarction after treatment with BMS vs DES. The trial is initiated and
      run by university researchers and is sponsored by not-for-profit organizations.

      Background:

      The balance of the long-term risks and benefits of coronary drug-eluting stents versus bare
      metal stents is not known.

      Study objective:

      The primary objective of the trial is to compare in a real-world setting the long-term
      effects on the incidence of death and myocardial infarction (composite primary end-point)
      after implantation of drug-eluting stents versus bare-metal stents. The secondary objective
      is to compare the long-term effects on the incidence of total death, cardiovascular deaths,
      major cardiovascular events, angina pectoris, revascularization procedures, and on
      health-related quality of life after implantation of drug-eluting stents versus bare-metal
      stents. The main tertiary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy in patient subgroups
      with specific demographic, clinical, and vessel- or lesion characteristics, and to conduct a
      cost-effectiveness analysis.

      Study design:

      This is a randomized, five-year prospective, multicenter, open-label clinical trial with
      blinded end point-evaluation.

      Setting:

      Investigator initiated trial conducted at 8 Norwegian interventional centres. The trial is
      sponsored by the Norwegian Research Council, the Regional Health Authorities and other
      not-for-profit organizations.

      Randomization:

      Patients will be randomized to receive either drug-eluting stent(s) or a bare-metal stent(s)
      in a 1:1 ratio.

      Patients:

      The trial will include 9000 patients with de novo lesions in native coronary arteries or
      by-pass grafts who meet the eligibility criteria. Men and women with stable angina pectoris
      or acute coronary syndrome will be included.

      End-point:

      The primary composite end point is total death and nonfatal myocardial infarction.Secondary
      end-points include total death and subcategories of death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial
      infarction, fatal and nonfatal stroke, angina pectoris, revascularization, major bleeding,
      health-related quality of life.

      Length of follow-up:

      Five years.

      End-points collected by electronic linkage to national registries:

      The trial will use the unique Norwegian 11-digit person number to search the National Patient
      Registry and the National Death Registry for nonfatal and fatal end-points during follow-up,
      thereby minimizing loss to follow-up. Information on angina pectoris and health-related
      quality of life will be collected by questionnaires.

      Statistical power:

      The trial has a statistical power of 93 percent to detect a three percent (RR 1.176) absolute
      difference in incidence between the study groups, and a power of 64 percent to detect a two
      percent (RR 1.118) absolute difference, given a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.

      Statistical analysis:

      Statistical analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, and
      will be performed by using widely accepted statistical and/or graphical software.

      Data collection:

      Electronic Case Record Form (e-CRF)

      Clinical Event Committee:

      Adjudication of all end-points according to pre-specified and standardized criteria by
      Clinical Event Committee blinded to study assignment.

      Expected Timelines:

      First patient enrollment: September 2008 Last patient enrollment: February 2011 Completion of
      Follow-up: December 2014.
