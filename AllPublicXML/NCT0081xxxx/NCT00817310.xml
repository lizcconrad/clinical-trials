  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, when premature infants develop severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a type of
      intracerebral bleed, there are no proven therapeutic interventions to prevent the devastating
      consequences of this event. These children will be likely to develop cerebral palsy or severe
      cognitive delays.

      The purpose of our study is to characterize differences in brain physiology, imaging, and
      function between premature infants with severe IVH and controls. The goals for gathering this
      information are to generate baseline data, which could facilitate early screening for
      complications of IVH in premature infants. These baseline data would also allow the design
      and implementation of early therapeutic interventions to help rehabilitate premature infants
      with severe IVH.
