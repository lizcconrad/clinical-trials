  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if sorafenib improves the effectiveness of
      a procedure called radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer. During
      radiofrequency ablation (RF ablation) a needle is inserted into the tumor tissue and heat is
      used to kill the tumor cells.

      Sorafenib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer that cannot
      be treated with surgery. Radiofrequency ablation has been used to treat many types of tumors,
      including hepatocellular cancers. Pre-clinical data suggests that sorafenib may improve the
      efficacy of RFA. The use of sorafenib prior to RF ablation in this study is &quot;investigational&quot;
      and has not been approved by the FDA. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that this combination is still
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. In this study,
      the study doctors hope to better understand the extent to which the combination of sorafenib
      and RFA may be done practically and successfully. Correlative imaging and tumor studies will
      evaluate mechanisms of action as well as novel predictors of RFA efficacy.

      Participants will be randomized to receive either sorafenib or placebo (pills with no
      medication). Participants will take sorafenib or placebo on Days 1-9. Radiofrequency ablation
      will be performed by an interventional radiologists on Day 10.

      On Days 1 and 9 of the study participants will have a physical exam and blood tests
      performed. A study MRI will be performed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC)
      prior to starting study medication and on Day 9. A tumor biopsy will be obtained at the time
      of RFA. A CT scan will be performed after RFA.
