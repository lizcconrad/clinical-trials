    <description>8 weeks period of escalating doses of fluvastatin to a goal dose of 80mg daily, then patients will start treatment of HCV at week 9 with the usual standard of care protocol for medication dose, office visits and laboratories. Peginterferon alfa2a 180 mcg/ml SQ injection once a week for 48 weeks and ribavirin 1000-1200 mg daily orally in two divided doses for 48 weeks. Patients weighing &lt; 75 kg will receive 1000mg per day (400mg in the morning and 600mg in the evening). Patients weighing ≥ 75 kg will receive 1200 mg per day (600mg in the morning and 600 mg in the evening).</description>
