  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  This study is in the area of Type 2 diabetes and genetics

        -  Healthy Volunteers and those with mild type 2 diabetes may be eligible to participate

        -  This study is searching for genes that may affect the body's processing/digestion of
           glucose/sugar

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at the genetic influences of type 2 diabetes. It also is investigating
      the various gastric hormones including but not limited to: insulin, C-peptide, GIP, GLP, &amp;
      Xenin.
