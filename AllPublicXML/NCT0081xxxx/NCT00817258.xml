  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall survival in patients with
      stage II (T1-2N1M0) NPC treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the disease free survival, and distant
      metastases free survival of patients with stage II NPC treated with this regimen

      Radiotherapy alone is the standard treatment for early stage NPC. In retrospective study of
      early stage NPC patients treated with radiotherapy alone. Patients who had Stage II disease
      had a worse outcome compared with patients with stage I disease. Chemotherapy, delivered
      concurrently with radiation therapy, has been adopted as standard treatment for locally
      advanced NPC. However, concurrent chemoradiation for stage II NPC patients has never been
      prospectively studied. In the present trial, we hope to assess the value of concurrent
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with stage II (T1-2N1) NPC.
