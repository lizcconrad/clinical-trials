  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a proof-of-concept clinical study designed to test the hypothesis that oral
      administration of galactose can lower the level of a circulating factor that increases
      glomerular permeability to albumin in patients with resistant FSGS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with resistant FSGS have persistent proteinuria and a high risk of progression to
      end stage kidney disease (ESKD). A circulating factor that increases glomerular permeability
      to albumin (Palb) has been detected in over 50% of these patients. While the molecular
      identity of the factor has not been fully established, in vitro studies and limited clinical
      experience suggest that galactose can reduce the level of the FSGS permeability factor.

      This study is a pilot study to determine if oral administration of galactose can lower the
      circulating level of the FSGS permeability factor.

      Five patients with biopsy proven primary FSGS - native or transplant kidney, receiving
      plasmapheresis - who are resistant to steroids and one other immunosuppressive agents will be
      studied.

      The only eligibility factor is presence of the FSGS permeability factor.

      The experimental intervention is administration of galactose, orally, 0.2 g/kg body
      weight/dose twice daily. the duration of treatment will be 28 days,.

      Patients will be seen on days 0, 14, and 28 of treatment. They will be seen at week 8, 16 and
      24 after discontinuation of the galactose.

      Physical examination and routine laboratory tests (SMAC, CBC, urine protein:creatinine ratio
      in an early morning sample) will be done at each visit. The FSGS permeability factor will be
      assayed at days 0 and 28 of treatment and 6 months after discontinuation of the galactose.
      The permeability factor will be tested in the laboratory of Virginia Savin MD (Medical
      college of Wisconsin) using previously described methods.

      All other treatments will be unchanged during the 28 day oral galactose Treatment Period.

      The study will be analyzed based on the number of patients in whom the FSGS permeability
      factor is lowered to normal levels.
