  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whether isolated distal DVT (IDDVT), DVT confined to the calf, should be looked for and
      diagnosed to allow them to be treated with anticoagulants remains one of the still unsolved
      issues in vascular medicine, especially because of the insufficient data on clinical risks of
      untreated distal DVT. Management studies have shown that it is safe to withhold
      anticoagulation in outpatients with suspected DVT if compression ultrasonography (CUS)
      limited to the proximal deep veins yields normal results on presentation and on repeated
      examination after 5 to 7 days. This strategy is based on the premise that IDDVT do not need
      to be diagnosed and treated, what is necessary when they extend involving the proximal veins.
      There is no general agreement, however, on the assumption that the non-extending IDDVT do not
      need to be diagnosed and treated, and many authors recommend to perform a single CUS
      examination extended to the distal deep veins. All the available studies have treated with
      anticoagulants the diagnosed IDDVT and no adequate information is available on the risk of
      IDDVT left untreated.

      The present study, performed in outpatients with suspected leg DVT, aims at assessing the
      clinical consequences of IDDVT diagnosed (by a complete US investigation) but not treated
      because the results of this investigation remain blind to both the patient and the treating
      doctor, whereas the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure remains the usual one, based on CUS
      investigation limited to diagnose proximal DVT, to be repeated after 5-7 days (or earlier) to
      exclude an extension to proximal veins of an IDDVT potentially present.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients symptomatic for suspected DVT of a leg are examined by a vascular doctor
      according to standard procedure based on pre-test clinical probability (PTCP) assessment,
      D-dimer assay and a CUS limited to the proximal deep veins. Those in whom a proximal DVT is
      excluded and have intermediate/high PTCP or altered D-dimer level are eligible for the study.
      The included patients are immediately submitted to an extensive echo-color-Doppler
      examination of calf deep veins by a different vascular doctor and results are closed in an
      envelope that will be open after three months (or before if necessary). In the meantime,
      patients will follow the standard diagnostic procedure: they receive an appointment to come
      back in 5-7 days for a further CUS examination, or even before in case of worsening of
      symptoms/signs. All the included patients receive a telephone call after three months to
      exclude possible complications.

        outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of a leg in whom a proximal DVT is
        excluded.

        The study is not funded. As a result, it will not be possible to enroll all consecutive
        eligible patients; rather patients will be included based on the availability of expert
        medical staff in the day of their presentation (in general the first patient of the day).
