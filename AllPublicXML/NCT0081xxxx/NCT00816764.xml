  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first in human study of AGS-8M4 given every 2 weeks to subjects with advanced
      ovarian cancer. AGS-8M4 will be administered as an IV infusion until the disease worsens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All Subjects will receive AGS-8M4 treatment. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of
      the 4 planned dose cohorts according to a standard dose escalation study design. A disease
      assessment will be performed at study week 9 (+/- 3 days). The assessment will be based on
      clinical signs and symptoms, changes in radiographic images, and changes in CA-125 levels.
      Subjects without evidence of disease progression may continue to receive AGS-8M4 during the
      extended treatment period at the dose and schedule of their assigned cohort until disease
      progression intolerability of AGS-8M4 or consent withdrawal. For subjects that continue
      dosing, disease assessments will be performed every 8 weeks during the extended treatment
      period. A safety follow-up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last infusion of AGS-8M4.
