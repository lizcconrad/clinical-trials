      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug (antimalarial medication) is safe
      when given to healthy subjects as a single dose or as repeated doses, to understand the
      effect of food on single doses of study drug and to determine if the study drug has an effect
      on other approved medications such as rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a type of parasitic infection, common in tropical and subtropical regions of the
      world, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. In recent years there has been a
      rapid spread of drug resistant malaria which makes it necessary to develop new antimalarial
      treatments. In animal studies, GSK932121 is shown to be able to kill the malaria parasite and
      is fully active against drug resistant malaria parasites. It is hoped that information
      collected on this study will lead to an improved treatment for malaria.

      This is a first time in human fusion study which has 3 parts:

      Part A - single dose escalation/ food effect: a study where the study drug is given once
      only- first at the lowest dose of in a group of participants and the dose increased only if
      the previous dose is found to be safe. It also looks at the effect of food on the study drug
      in the body Part B - repeat dose escalation: a study where the study drug will be given daily
      for up to 7 days - first at a lower dose in a group of participants and the dose increased
      for the next group only if the previous dose is found to be safe and Part B - drug-drug
      interaction: a study where the study drug will be given daily for up to 7 days at a dose
      determined to be safe in previous groups of participants and looking at the effect of the
      study drug on other specific approved medications (such as rosiglitazone--a diabetic
      medication and rosuvastatin--a cholesterol lowering medication) in the body.

      Safety will be assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, spirometry,
      collection of adverse event assessments, renal biomarkers and laboratory safety tests.

    <description>GSK932121 or placebo will be administered as a single dose with or without food in a dose escalation manner. Once the results from the single dose is obtained and reviewed, GSK932121 or placebo will be administered as a repeat dose. The results from each repeat dose level will be reviewed prior to determining the next repeat dose level.
To better understand the effect of GSK932121 on rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin, a drug-drug interaction arm will also be investigated in this study. Rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin will be administered alone, then GSK932121 will be given as a repeat dose. Rosiglitazone and rosuvastatin will then be administered in combination with GSK932121.</description>
