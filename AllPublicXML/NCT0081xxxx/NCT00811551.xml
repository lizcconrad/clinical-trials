      zWedge is a clinical feasibility IDE study. The objective is to characterize the relationship
      between intra-thoracic impedance measurements obtained from a CRT-D device and pulmonary
      capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) measured via a right heart catheterization (RHC) acutely and
      over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intra-thoracic impedance will be obtained at programmed intervals by using an investigational
      monitoring feature in the CRT-D device. To obtain impedance values, the device delivers a
      sub-threshold impulse that measures the resistance between 2 electrodes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a SJM PROMOTE CRT-D (Model 3207 or other model with similar functioning) system
             that was implanted at least 4 months prior to enrollment for an approved indication
             per ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines.

          -  Have the ability to provide written informed consent for study participation and be
             willing and able to comply with the prescribed follow-up tests and schedule of
             evaluation.

          -  Have legally marketed bipolar right atrial and true bipolar right ventricular pacing
             defibrillation leads, and a legally marketed endocardial bipolar LV lead.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Be less than 18 years of age.

          -  Have any medical condition that would interfere with intra-thoracic measurements such
             as end-stage pulmonary disease, advanced interstitial pulmonary disease, or frequent
             episodes of pneumonia.

          -  Have a contraindication for right heart catheterization.

          -  Have a contraindication for the delivery of IV Nitroglycerin.

          -  Be pregnant or planning a pregnancy for the duration of their study participation.

          -  Be currently participating in a clinical investigation that includes an active
             treatment arm.

          -  Have a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to any condition.

          -  Be unable to perform the Valsalva maneuver with airway pressure &gt; 40 mm Hg for â‰¥10
             seconds.

          -  Are pacemaker dependent, where cessation of pacemaker function consistently results in
             syncope or ventricular asystole.
