  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are two forms of copper deficiency that must be
      diagnosed and treated very early in life to prevent serious developmental problems. However,
      these and other forms of copper deficiency are not very well understood, and further research
      is needed to determine whether certain treatments are useful in treating copper deficiency.
      One such treatment is copper histidine, a copper replacement that can be injected directly
      into the body to avoid absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. This study will
      investigate the effectiveness, side effects, and dosage of copper histidine treatment for
      patients with copper deficiency. It will also collect medical history information from
      patients to allow researchers to study possible genetic and nongenetic origins of copper
      deficiency.

      This study will include 100 subjects, all of whom will be children and adults who have been
      diagnosed with Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, or other unexplained copper
      deficiency.

      Patients will receive a prescribed dose of copper histidine, which will be administered daily
      as an injection.

      During the study, patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center on an outpatient basis
      to evaluate their response to the copper histidine treatment. These evaluations will take
      place every 8 months, with a final evaluation performed after 3 years of treatment. During
      the outpatient visits, patients will be required to give blood and urine samples for testing
      and undergo ultrasound testing. They will also undergo brain MRI scans at the initial visit
      and at the 16-month and 36-month visits. Patients who agree will give additional blood
      samples for genetic research purposes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menkes is a fatal genetic form of copper deficiency caused by mutations in a
      copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7A). Pre-symptomatic diagnosis and therapy with copper
      injections is associated with improved overall survival and, based on their molecular
      defects, with vastly better neurological outcomes in some patients compared to the usual
      natural history. One purpose of this study is to further evaluate the relationship between
      specific molecular defects and clinical responses to early copper treatment in Menkes
      disease. In addition, we seek to study the influence of parenteral copper treatment in
      related genetic disorders, and in unexplained copper deficiency conditions, often associated
      with non-specific neurological abnormalities.
