  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will compare 2 treatment strategies based on tocilizumab in combination with
      methotrexate or placebo in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Patients
      receiving methotrexate treatment will be randomized to receive either a) tocilizumab 8 mg
      intravenous (iv) every 4 weeks + methotrexate orally (po) weekly or b) tocilizumab 8 mg iv
      every 4 weeks + placebo po weekly. After the first 24 weeks of blinded treatment, treatment
      adjustments (increase or decrease of treatment intensity) may be introduced at intervals,
      based on response. The anticipated time on study treatment is up to 3 years, and the target
      sample size is approximately 470 patients.

    <description>Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) intravenous (IV) once every 4 weeks + weekly oral methotrexate continuing at the patient's pre-study dose for 24 weeks. Patients taking oral corticosteroids remained on their pre-study dose (up to 10 mg/day). Week 24 to Week 52 the dose of tocilizumab and methotrexate remained the same. Based on DAS28 assessments, corticosteroid dose was adjusted and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) added. Week 52 to Week 104, based on the DAS28 assessment, treatment was adjusted to one of four protocol specified treatment regimens: Treatment tapering, Continued treatment, Treatment intensification or Maintenance treatment. After Week 100, patients who discontinued tocilizumab because of remission were retreated with the last effective dose of tocilizumab or blinded methotrexate if a flare occurred.</description>

Patients taking oral corticosteroids remained on their pre-study dose (up to 10 mg/day). Week 24 to Week 52 the dose of tocilizumab and methotrexate remained the same. Based on DAS28 assessments, corticosteroid dose was adjusted and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARDS) added. Week 52 to Week 104, based on the DAS28 assessment, treatment was adjusted to one of four protocol specified treatment regimens: Treatment tapering, Continued treatment, Treatment intensification or Maintenance treatment. After Week 100, patients who discontinued tocilizumab because of remission were retreated with the last effective dose of tocilizumab or blinded methotrexate if a flare occurred.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>

ACR50 response is defined as a ≥ 50% improvement (reduction) compared with baseline for both total joint count-68 joints (TJC68) and swollen joint count-66 joints (SJC66), as well as for three of the additional five ACR core set variables: Patient's Assessment of Pain over the previous 24 hours: using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) left end of the line 0=no pain to right end of the line 100=unbearable pain; Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity over the previous 24 hours using a VAS where left end of the line 0=no disease activity to right end of the line 100=maximum disease activity; Health Assessment Questionnaire: 20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and acute-phase reactant [either C-reactive protein or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate).</description>
        <time_frame>104 Weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Intent-to treat population included all randomized participants who received study drug. Censoring occurred at the last assessment for those completing the study or withdrawing early, if a response was not observed. In calculating ACR response, a last observation carried forward approach is used for missing joint count data.</population>

Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. AUC DAS28 was averaged over study days. Analysis of Covariance was adjusted for Baseline DAS28 as a covariate and treatment group and region as fixed factors.

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt; 2.6.</description>

Patients taking oral corticosteroids remained on their pre-study dose (up to 10 mg/day). Week 24 to Week 52 the dose of tocilizumab and methotrexate remained the same. Based on DAS28 assessments, corticosteroid dose was adjusted and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARDS) added. Week 52 to Week 104, based on the DAS28 assessment, treatment was adjusted to one of four protocol specified treatment regimens: Treatment tapering, Continued treatment, Treatment intensification or Maintenance treatment. After Week 100, patients who discontinued tocilizumab because of remission were retreated with the last effective dose of tocilizumab or blinded methotrexate if a flare occurred.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Good or Moderate European League (EULAR) DAS28 Responses</title>
          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.
European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Good response: DAS28 ≤ 3.2 or a change from Baseline &lt; -1.2.
EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a change from Baseline &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2.</description>

        <description>The physician global assessment of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 mm horizontal visual analogue scale (VAS) by the physician. The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 mm, and is described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equals 100 mm, as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity).

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index</title>
        <description>The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a patient completed questionnaire specific for rheumatoid arthritis, consisting of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. There are 4 possible responses for each question: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do. The score for each of the domains is the highest (worst) score in each domain. A patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains to calculate a valid HAQ-DI score which is the sum of domain scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>Radiographs were taken of each hand and foot at Baseline, Weeks 24, 52 and104 and were evaluated using the Genant modified method according to Sharp. Erosion Score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. Joint Narrowing Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum total erosion score in the hands is 98 and in the feet 42. The maximum scores for joint space narrowing (JSN) in the hands was104 and in the feet 48. The total score was the sum of scores for erosions and JSN. The maximum total modified GSS was 292. A lower number change from Baseline was better.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Joint Space Narrowing Score</title>
        <description>A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum scores for joint space narrowing (JSN) in the hands was 104 and in the feet 48 for a total possible score of 0 to 152. A lower change from Baseline indicated a better score. Analysis of covariance model included baseline x-ray and DAS28 as covariates and treatment group and region as fixed effects.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Academic Medical Center (AMC) Linear Disability Scale (ALDS)</title>
        <description>The Academic Medical Center (AMC) Linear Disability Score (ALDS) evaluates the participant’s ability to perform activities of daily life consisting of 77 questions answered yes or no . The question difficulty and the patient’s ability are arranged on a single hierarchical linear scale. ALDS scores range from 10 to 90 with a higher score representing higher functional status. A positive change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>ACR response was defined as an improvement (reduction) compared with baseline for both total joint count-68 joints and swollen joint count-66 joints, and for three of five variables: Patient's Assessment of Pain over the previous 24 hours: using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) where 0=no pain to 100=unbearable pain; Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity over the previous 24 hours using a VAS where: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity; Health Assessment Questionnaire: 20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and acute-phase reactant [either C-reactive protein or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate]. Area under the curve for ACR response to Week 24 was averaged over study days.
