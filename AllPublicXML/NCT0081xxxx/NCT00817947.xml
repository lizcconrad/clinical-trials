  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) has been shown to increase tracheal mucous
      clearance compared with control. These observations led to the development of 'The Vest'
      which is a non-stretchable jacket connected to an air-pulse generator and worn by the patient
      over the chest wall. The generator rapidly inflates and deflates 'The Vest' which gently
      compresses and releases the chest wall between 5 and 20 times per second. This generates
      mini-coughs which are said to dislodge mucus from the bronchial walls and to facilitate its
      movement up the airways. In addition 'The Vest' has been shown to reduce the viscosity of
      mucus and this should further enhance mucous clearance. The technique has, for many years,
      been widely used in the United States of America as an alternative to the European airway
      clearance regimens of the active cycle of breathing techniques, autogenic drainage, positive
      expiratory pressure and oscillating positive expiratory pressure, but 'The Vest' has only
      recently been registered for use in Europe. It is important that the airway clearance regimen
      of 'The Vest' be compared with the alternative airway clearance regimens widely used in
      Europe.

      Hypothesis: In people with cystic fibrosis 'The Vest' will lead to the expectoration of an
      increased weight of sputum during treatment sessions compared with alternative airway
      clearance regimens.
