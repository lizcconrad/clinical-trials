  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that dopamine is a functional neuromodulator at several levels of the visual
      system. Dopamine seems to be involved in the organization of the ganglion cell and the
      bipolar cell receptive fields and modulation of physiological activity of photoreceptors.
      There is evidence for the functional significance of dopaminergic modulation of visual
      sensitivity in humans which confirms the hypothesis that dopamine plays an important role in
      retinal light adaptation as well as in motion and contrast sensitivity function. The
      electrophysiological effects of dopamine, various dopamine antagonist and levodopa in animals
      and humans have been investigated by means of visual evoked potentials and
      electroretinograms. The multifocal ERG technique, developed by Sutter et al. allows a rapid,
      simultaneous recording of focal ERGs from multiple retinal locations. Although this technique
      is relatively new, it has already provided insights into the mechanisms of retinal diseases
      (e.g. involvement of visual system in Parkinson disease), but until now there is no data on
      influence of dopaminergic substances on mERG.
