      The investigators investigated the effects of a supervised maternal exercise training program
      (performed during the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy) on maternal-newborn unit health
      outcomes in a group of previously sedentary healthy women. A matched control group was
      assessed over the same time period. Given the fact that most studies in the field have used
      aerobic exercises, here the investigators largely focused on very light resistance, toning
      exercises.

    <description>Women in the intervention group were enrolled in three sessions/week of individually supervised, resistance exercise training performed over the second and third trimester of pregnancy (in total 26 weeks, ~80 training sessions). Heart rate (HR) was carefully and individually controlled (≤80% of age-predicted maximum HR value, 220-age) through a heart rate monitor during the training sessions. In brief, each session consisted of 35-40 minutes of exercise divided in a light intensity (≤60% maximal heart rate) warm-up period (~8 minutes), followed by toning and very light resistance exercises (~20 minutes) and a light intensity cool-down (~8 minutes) period. Resistance exercises were performed with barbells (≤3kg per exercise) or low-to-medium resistance bands (Therabands).</description>
