    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Written informed consent (IC) obtained.

          -  Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examinations.

          -  Finnish speaking males between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2 (inclusive, BMI = weight/height2).

          -  Weight of 55-100 kg (inclusive).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  A predictable poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the investigator.

          -  Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological, urogenital or
             psychiatric disease as judged by the investigator.

          -  Any condition requiring regular concomitant medication including herbal products or
             likely to need any concomitant treatment during the study.

          -  Susceptibility to severe allergic reactions.

          -  Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study, within 2 weeks
             prior to the first study treatment administration or less than 5 times a half-live of
             the medication. Possible enzyme inducing drugs will be discussed case-by-case with the
             sponsor.

          -  Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits,
             about 13 g of alcohol).

          -  Current use of nicotine-containing products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day.

          -  Inability to refrain from using nicotine-containing products during the stay at the
             study centre.

          -  Inability to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing beverages during the stay at
             the study centre e.g. propensity in getting headache when refraining from
             caffeine-containing beverages.

          -  Blood donation or loss of significant amount of blood within 2 months prior to the
             screening visit.

          -  Abnormal 12-lead ECG finding of clinical relevance after 10-minute rest in supine
             position at the screening visit, for example:

          -  QTc (calculated through the Bazett's formula) &gt; 450msec,

          -  PR &lt; 120 msec or &gt; 210 msec,

          -  QRS &lt; 70 msec or &gt; 120 msec.

          -  HR &lt; 45 beats/minute or &gt; 100 beats/minute after 10-minute rest in supine position at
             the screening visit.

          -  At the screening visit systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg after 10
             minutes in supine position, diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg after 10 minutes in
             supine position.

          -  Any abnormal value of laboratory, vital signs, physical examination, which may in the
             opinion of the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the test results or
             cause a health risk for the subject if he takes part into the study.

          -  History of drug abuse or positive result in drug abuse test.

          -  Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (HIVAgAb), hepatitis C
             virus antibodies (HCVAb) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             evaluation of the results or constitute a health risk for the study subject.

          -  Participation in a clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the first study
             treatment administration of this study or earlier participation in a clinical study
             with ORM-12741.
