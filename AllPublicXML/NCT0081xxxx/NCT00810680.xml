    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Valproic acid, as a single agent is
      effective in the treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia which has relapsed or is
      refractory to therapy with standard drugs.

    <textblock>
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease characterized by a prolonged clinical course.
      Though various drugs such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites such as fludarabine and
      targeted antibodies such as rituximab are effective against this condition, relapses are
      frequent and cure is rare. There exists a subset of CLL patients who are refractory to many
      of these first line agents. Though one or the other of the above mentioned class of drugs can
      be substituted for patients who have relapsed or have refractory disease, no therapy has been
      conclusively proven to have survival advantage in this condition. The costs and toxicities
      add to the burden of these therapies. Valproic acid is a well studied drug used for the
      treatment of epilepsy for over 30 years. It has a well documented side effect profile, is
      generally well tolerated and is inexpensive. Recently, it has been shown to be an inhibitor
      of the enzyme, Histone de-acetylase(HDAC). Inhibition of HDAC promotes apoptosis, and could
      lead to the death of CLL cells which harbor defective apoptotic mechanisms. In vitro studies
      have proven the ability of therapeutic concentrations of Valproic acid to achieve cell kill
      in cultures of CLL cells. This study aims to identify whether valproic acid, used in standard
      doses has single agent activity against CLL and to assess its tolerance in these patients.

    <description>Tab. Valproic acid will be started at a dose of 10 mg per kg per day in two or three divided doses. If well tolerated the dose will be increased to a maximum of 20 mg per kg per day and continued for a period of 3 months. The drug will be continued for another 3 months for a maximum of 6 months in responding patients. The drug will be stopped in all those who develop intolerable side effects or develop disease progression during therapy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Active CLL (as defined by the National Cancer Institute Working Group)

          -  Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for CLL and have been treated
             with a nucleoside analogue.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Good general condition as defined by an Eastern cooperative oncology group-
             performance status (ECOG-PS) &lt;/=2.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count&gt;1500/cmm and platelet count &gt;30,000/cmm unless the low
             counts are due to the disease.

          -  Adequate liver function (bilirubin&lt;2 mg/dL,ASTorALT &lt;3Xthe upper limit of normal) and
             renal function (serum creatinine&lt;2 mg/dL or creatinine clearance&gt;30 mL/min) unless
             abnormalities are as a result of disease involvement.

          -  Full recovery from previous treatments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any therapy for CLL within 4 weeks before initiating treatment on this study.

          -  Pregnancy.
