      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop
      the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Removing the T cells from the donor cells
      before transplant and giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop
      this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving a donor stem cell
      transplant after pentostatin and total-body irradiation and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with hematological cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety of pentostatin and low-dose total body irradiation followed by
           T-cell-reduced unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, in terms of
           regimen-related toxicity, in patients with hematological malignancies.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, measured as engraftment rate and establishment
           of donor hematopoietic chimerism, in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Reduced-intensity preparative regimen: Patients receive pentostatin IV over 30 minutes
           once daily on days -10 to -8 and undergo low-dose total-body irradiation on day -1.

        -  Unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT): Patients undergo
           T-cell-reduced donor PBSCT on day 0.

        -  Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2
           hours twice daily on days -1, 0, and 1 and then orally twice daily on days 2-70 followed
           by a taper in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive oral mycophenolate mofetil
           twice daily on days 0-27 followed by a taper.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspirate and biopsies and blood sample collection periodically
      for laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed for cytokines (i.e., IL-6, TNF-γ, IL-1β, and
      IL-10) by ELISA; phenotypic, molecular, and functional analysis of immunologic reconstitution
      markers (i.e., PHA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, Fas, FasL, TNF, TGF-β, and IFN-γ) by flow
      cytometry; and cytogenetics by FISH.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
