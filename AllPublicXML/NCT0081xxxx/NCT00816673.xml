      The aim of this placebo controlled study is to investigate the effect of 2 mg melatonin Slow
      Release (Circadin®) on the sleep/wake cycle in elderly insomniac out-subjects, aged 55 years
      or more.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Circadin® is a newly developed slow release galenic formulation of melatonin, producing
      overall levels of melatonin comparable to those observed in a control population, when
      administered to patients with deficiency in melatonin; thus it deserves more clinical and
      paraclinical investigations for establishing efficacy in inducing and maintaining sleep and
      for safety. Since, on the one hand, the endogenous substance melatonin has beneficial effects
      on sleep in man and, on the other hand, there is a decrease in melatonin secretion in elderly
      people, substitution therapy in elderly insomniacs would be a desirable therapy.

      The aim of this placebo controlled study was to investigate the effect of 2 mg Melatonin Slow
      Release (Circadin®) on the sleep/wake cycle in elderly insomniac out-subjects, aged 55 years
      or more. Sleep was assessed by means of polysomnography (hypnographic results), all-night
      sleep EEG spectral analysis (functional and quantitative results of sleep EEG), actimetry
      (SomnitorTM), wake EEG and sleep/wake quality questionnaires. Vigilance and cognitive skills
      were assessed by means of psychomotor and neurocognitive tests derived from the Leeds
      psychomotor test battery (vigilance and arousal) and TEA battery (attention).
