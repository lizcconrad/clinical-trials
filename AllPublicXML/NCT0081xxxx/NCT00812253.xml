    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure often have high blood sugar. High glucose contributes to severe
      hospital complications and even death. Studies suggest that heart failure patients who have
      high glucose or diabetes do not live as long as patients with normal glucose. In this study,
      we will determine whether normalizing blood sugars using intravenous insulin short-term will
      improve outcomes in patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure. We enrolled patients
      with severe heart failure and randomly assigned them into 2 groups. We used intravenous
      (given through the vein) insulin to lower blood sugar levels in group 1, and insulin
      injections in group 2. We determined whether intravenous insulin improved hospital length of
      stay, rates of readmission, inflammatory markers, and cardiovascular tests that predict
      mortality in patients with heart failure.

    <description>High frequency (HF) Heart rate variability (HRV). HRV was assessed with a Bionex system (Mindware, Gahanna, OH). The electrocardiogram was performed in the standard lead II configuration and impedance cardiography was performed using a standard tetrapolar arrangement. Measures were performed at baseline and each morning (0800-1000 hour) during and following the intervention for 7 minutes each. Software (Mindware, Gahanna, OH) was used to derive HF HRV. The middle five minutes of the recordings were scored minute by minute and the first suitable1 minute period was used for calculation. Five minute epochs were not feasible due to an unexpectedly high frequency of ectopy. One minute intervals allow calculation of HF (parasympathetic tone) but not low frequency (combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone).</description>

    <description>Change in Quality of Life questionnaire measured from baseline (enrollment) to 30 days following discharge. The questionnaire is a self-administered disease-specific questionnaire for patients with HF, comprising 21 items rated on six-point Likert scales, representing different degrees of impact of HF on health related quality of life, from 0 (none) to 5 (very much). It provides a total score (range 0-105, from best to worst HRQoL),</description>

          <description>Intravenous insulin: In patients assigned to intravenous (IV) insulin, SQ basal insulin was discontinued and IV insulin was started at 21:00 on the day of enrollment. Patients continued to receive subcutaneous prandial insulin. All patients receiving IV insulin were managed using our hospital’s universal nursing run guideline, which has a target glucose of 6.1-8.3 mmol/l. Patients were transitioned from the infusion after 48 hours using approximately 70% of the estimated basal insulin infusion requirement with 4 hours of overlap.</description>

In subjects who were not insulin naive, the total insulin dose was calculated as 100% or 120% of the total daily insulin dose at admission in subjects with an enrollment glucose of &lt;11.1 mmol/l or &gt;11.1 mmol/l respectively. Basal and prandial insulin were administered in approximately equal total daily doses with correction dosing and adjustments based upon a published algorithm.

        <description>High frequency (HF) Heart rate variability (HRV). HRV was assessed with a Bionex system (Mindware, Gahanna, OH). The electrocardiogram was performed in the standard lead II configuration and impedance cardiography was performed using a standard tetrapolar arrangement. Measures were performed at baseline and each morning (0800-1000 hour) during and following the intervention for 7 minutes each. Software (Mindware, Gahanna, OH) was used to derive HF HRV. The middle five minutes of the recordings were scored minute by minute and the first suitable1 minute period was used for calculation. Five minute epochs were not feasible due to an unexpectedly high frequency of ectopy. One minute intervals allow calculation of HF (parasympathetic tone) but not low frequency (combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone).</description>

            <description>Basal bolus insulin (4 injections per day) In subjects who were insulin naïve, the total daily dose of insulin was calculated as 0.4 or 0.5 unit/kg if the enrollment glucose was &lt;11.1 mmol/l or &gt;11.1 mmol/l respectively. In subjects who were not insulin naive, the total insulin dose was calculated as 100% or 120% of the total daily insulin dose at admission in subjects with an enrollment glucose of &lt;11.1 mmol/l or &gt;11.1 mmol/l respectively. Basal and prandial insulin were administered in approximately equal total daily doses with correction dosing and adjustments based upon a published algorithm. The target glucose range was 5.6-8.3 mmol/l.</description>

          <description>Intravenous (IV) insulin: In patients assigned to IV insulin, SQ basal insulin was discontinued and IV insulin was started at 21:00 on the day of enrollment. Patients continued to receive subcutaneous prandial insulin. All patients receiving IV insulin were managed using our hospital’s universal nursing run guideline, which has a target glucose of 6.1-8.3 mmol/l. Patients were transitioned from the infusion after 48 hours using approximately 70% of the estimated basal insulin infusion requirement with 4 hours of overlap.</description>
