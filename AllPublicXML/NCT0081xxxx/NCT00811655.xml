      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and
      cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery before surgery may make
      the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well stereotactic radiosurgery works in treating
      patients with brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To estimate the rate of recurrence at the surgical site in patients with brain
           metastases treated with neoadjuvant stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with
           historical data documenting recurrence at the surgical site after surgical resection and
           whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).

      Secondary

        -  To estimate the rate of salvage WBRT, SRS, or surgery in patients treated with
           neoadjuvant SRS alone.

        -  To determine the volume of adjacent normal brain parenchyma irradiated in these
           patients.

        -  To estimate the rate of new brain metastases outside of the neoadjuvant SRS site in
           these patients.

        -  To estimate the quality of life of these patients after neoadjuvant SRS alone.

        -  To assess the effect of SRS and surgical intervention on the preservation of
           neurocognitive functioning in these patients.

        -  To determine the clinical significance (mass effect, cognitive functioning, and other
           symptoms) of locally recurrent brain metastases at the time of their occurrence in these
           patients.

        -  To estimate the rate of death due to neurologic causes, defined as death attributable to
           the progression of neurological disease, in these patients.

        -  To estimate the overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery over 30 to 90 minutes. Approximately 2-4
      weeks later, patients undergo surgical resection of brain metastasis.

      Quality of life and neurocognitive function are assessed periodically using the FACT-Br
      subscales and Mini-Mental State Exam.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.

    <time_frame>Administered at baseline and every 3 months post-SRS</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life as measured by the change in FACT-Br scores from baseline. The FACT-Br (version 4) is comprised of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), a 27-item core questionnaire evaluating the domains of physical, family/social, emotional and functional well-being, with the addition of 23 brain cancer specific questions. The FACT-G total score is the sum of the four FACT-G domain scores. The Brain Cancer Subscale (BrCS) is the sum of 19 brain cancer specific questions. The FACT-Br Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is the sum of the BrCS score and the physical and family/social domain scores. The FACT-Br total score is the sum of the FACT-G total score and the BrCS score. Change score = score post-SRS minus the score at baseline. Positive change scores indicate improved quality of life.</description>

The MMSE is an 11-item measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language. The maximum score is 30. Change score = score post-SRS minus the score at baseline. Positive change scores indicate improved cognition.</description>

        <description>Quality of life as measured by the change in FACT-Br scores from baseline. The FACT-Br (version 4) is comprised of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G), a 27-item core questionnaire evaluating the domains of physical, family/social, emotional and functional well-being, with the addition of 23 brain cancer specific questions. The FACT-G total score is the sum of the four FACT-G domain scores. The Brain Cancer Subscale (BrCS) is the sum of 19 brain cancer specific questions. The FACT-Br Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is the sum of the BrCS score and the physical and family/social domain scores. The FACT-Br total score is the sum of the FACT-G total score and the BrCS score. Change score = score post-SRS minus the score at baseline. Positive change scores indicate improved quality of life.</description>
