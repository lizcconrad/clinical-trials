      This study will compare Drager Smart Care (SC), a commercially available automated ventilator
      controlled weaning mode to the current daily spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) weaning
      protocol. The study is designed to determine if automated ventilator controlled weaning can
      reduce total duration of intubation following mechanical ventilation in ICU patients
      requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt;72 hours).

          -  Requiring mechanical ventilation for &gt; 72 hours

          -  Meets weaning criteria: Improvement or resolution of the underlying process that
             precipitated need for mechanical ventilation, PaO2 ≥ 60 mm Hg on PEEP and FiO2
             Requirements of ≤ 8 cm H2O and FiO2 ≤ 0.50, Stable oxygenation: PEEP and FiO2
             requirements not increased in the past 24 hrs, Ability to initiate an inspiratory
             effort and trigger the ventilator, Subject enrollment approved by the primary service
             attending physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Patients with tracheostomy or planned tracheostomy prior to attempt to extubate

          -  Patients with known airway patency issues that are anticipated to delay extubation.

          -  Patients with cervical spinal cord injury.

          -  Prospective subject or surrogate consenter does not fully understand the implications
             of the study because of a language barrier.
