  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a less invasive procedure such as liposuction
      can be used to effectively reduce arm lymphedema (swelling of the arm) resulting from breast
      cancer treatment. The standard surgery involves the removal of large portions of skin and
      tissue leaving a large scar. This less invasive procedure (liposuction) uses 3 to 4 tiny
      puncture sites and a vacuum tube leaving minimal scars.

    <description>Investigators plan to show the efficacy of liposuction as a treatment for lymphedema. Investigators will contrast the arm volume at 3 months with the baseline value using a paired t-test. Because the change in volume is likely to be proportional to the baseline value, the logarithm of the volumes will be used. With α = .05 and n = 34, we will have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.5 (that is, a change of 0.5 standard deviations between the baseline and 3-month mean volumes). However since this is a pilot study with limited funding the study will initially open for 7 patients to assess safety and feasibility.</description>

    <description>Durability will be tested for equivalence, by comparing the 3-month and 12-month arm volumes. Five year follow-up is necessary to demonstrate the lasting effect of liposuction in reducing arm lymphedema.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient selection involves identifying women who have undergone breast cancer surgery
             in the past and who demonstrate lymphedema (stage 2 or 3) based on arm measurement at
             a minimum of 4 different points along the affected arm. Those women with mild to
             severe lymphedema with no signs of active infection are candidates for the procedure.
             History of previous non-surgical treatment for lymphedema will not preclude entry into
             this trial. All patients must be free of active disease recurrence at study entry. If
             the lymphedema is of recent onset, then the womans medical oncologist or primary care
             physician must rule out an underlying cancer recurrence or blood clot.

          -  Prior therapy including Manuel Lymph Drainage (MLD) or similar massage method, use of
             compression sleeves, and pneumatic pumps is allowable and may be on-going at study
             entry. Prior surgical procedures to treat lymphedema such a joining the lymph channels
             to the blood vessels at any prior time are not eligible for this study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than one year

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               1. leukocytes ≥3,000/MicroL

               2. absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/MicroL

               3. platelets ≥100,000/MicroL

               4. total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               5. aspartic transaminase(AST)/alanine transaminase(ALT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper
                  limit of normal

               6. creatinine within normal institutional limits - OR - creatinine clearance ≥60
                  mL/min/1.73 m² for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          -  Able to tolerate general anesthesia and have no recent cardiac history such as
             myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or angina

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of
             their poor prognosis.

          -  History of allergic reactions to compression sleeves, lymphedema bandages, general
             anesthetics, and all antibiotics

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because: General Anesthesia and/or
             invasive surgical procedures may increase the risk of miscarriage. Secondly, increased
             weight during pregnancy may exacerbate lymphedema and thereby make interpretation of
             the study endpoints difficult.

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with invasive surgical procedures. Secondly, since this is an elective
             procedure, the risk to the surgical team of a needle stick would be too high.
