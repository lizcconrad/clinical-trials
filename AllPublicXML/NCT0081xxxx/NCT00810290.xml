      The Lawrence Latino Diabetes Prevention Project (LLDPP) is a community-based translational
      research study which aims to reduce the risk of diabetes among Latinos who have a &gt;30%
      probability of developing diabetes in the next 7.5 years per a predictive equation. The
      project was conducted in Lawrence, Massachusetts; a predominantly Caribbean-origin urban
      Latino community. Individuals were identified primarily from a community health center's
      patient panel, screened for study eligibility, randomized to either a usual care or a
      lifestyle intervention condition, and followed for one year.

      The group format of the intervention included 13 group sessions complemented by 3 individual
      home contacts over one year and was implemented by individuals from the community with
      training and supervision by a clinical research nutritionist and a behavioral psychologist.
      Study measures included demographics, Stern predictive equation components (age, gender,
      ethnicity, fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol, body mass index, and
      family history of diabetes), glycosylated hemoglobin, dietary intake, physical activity,
      depressive symptoms, social support, and quality of life. Body weight was measured at
      baseline, 6-months, and one-year; all other measures were assessed at baseline and one-year.
      All surveys were orally administered in Spanish.

    <description>A group-based intervention including 13 group sessions complemented by three individual home visits was developed using principles of social learning theory and patient-centered counseling. The intervention was intended to increase awareness of diabetes prevention strategies, foster positive diabetes prevention attitudes (i.e., self-efficacy) and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in the target Latino population using literacy-sensitive and culturally-tailored strategies and materials.</description>
