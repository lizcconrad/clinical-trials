  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have higher blood pressures than the general
      population. They also tend to have protein leaking into the urine (proteinuria). CKD, high
      blood pressure and proteinuria independently and together increase the risk of developing
      atherosclerosis (hardening) of the arteries that leads to diseases such as heart attack and
      stroke. Although there are a number of drugs available that lower blood pressure, these are
      not always fully effective. Furthermore, there are even fewer drugs that simultaneously lower
      blood pressure, reduce proteinuria, and slow down kidney damage in CKD.

      Recent research has shown that drugs like sitaxsentan not only lower blood pressure but also
      reduce proteinuria and potentially slow down the progression of CKD [1,2]. Before sitaxsentan
      can become freely available to individuals with CKD it is important to look at the effects
      this drug could have on proteinuria and blood pressure.

             Quality Initiative (using the Cockcroft and Gault equation for calculation of
             glomerular filtration rate) with proteinuria, including any of the following
             aetiologies: immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease (PCKD),
             congenital abnormalities, reflux nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Requires peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis.

          2. Has kidney disease due to diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
