      This study will look at the impact that meals have on blood glucose (sugar) levels. Subjects
      will be asked to use a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGM), which monitors glucose
      levels continuously. Breakfast and lunch meals will be provided and must be consumed at the
      International Diabetes Center.
