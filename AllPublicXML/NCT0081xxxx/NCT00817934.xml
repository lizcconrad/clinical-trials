      The purpose of this study is determine if the AB Prep (a 16 tablets colon cleansing prep), is
      an effective, and safe colon cleansing prep in preparation for colonoscopy, and severe
      constipation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The available colon cleansing preps have issues with patient's tolerance( Abdominal pain,
      nausea, vomiting), and as recently noted by the FDA safety issues such a change in EKG, blood
      electrolytes requiring 72 hours to correct, and most recently PO4 nephropathy.

      The AB Prep is a 16 tablets prep that has excellent patient's tolerance efficacy, with no
      change in blood electrolytes or EKG. ( PhaseI (20 patients) and Phase II (200 patients)

      The protocol that was used is as follows:

      (IND application # 75,704)

      Protocol design for testing the safety and efficacy of the AB Prep:

      The AB Prep is a combination of 2 Reglan tablets (10mg each), 6 Dulcolax tablets, and 8
      K-Phos Neutral tablets. The combination is given in two steps, four hours apart; the day
      before the colonoscopy.

      As before, the objective of this clinical trial is to examine the AB Prep first and foremost
      for safety, and second for efficacy of colon cleansing.

      The proposed trial is for One-Arm Study of subjects undergoing elective and therapeutic
      colonoscopy.

      Phase III: 400 patients, The selection will be random, the age probably ranging from 12 to 75
      years old.

      The patients will have a Pre, and post procedural EKG, comprehensive (Sodium, Potassium,
      Creatinine, BUN, Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphate, Glucose), and vital signs.

      The patients with severe constipation (One bowel movement per week or more) will not be
      included in the study. (In our experience, those people required two days prep to achieve
      colon cleansing).

      The SRSS statistical program will be used for data collection and analysis:

      The end point of the study is colon cleansing, adequate enough to perform colonoscopy. The
      colon cleansing will be graded as follow:

        1. Poor colon prep, unable to proceed with colonoscopy.

        2. Able to do colonoscopy with, the colon cleansing labeled as:

      A- Excellent, Totally cleansed B- Good, adequately cleansed, with need for irrigation.

      In addition to efficacy, we would like to check for patient's satisfaction and compliance,
      (Most common complaints that the patients tend to voice with the present approved colon
      preps).

      Patient's satisfaction data will be collected before the procedure and will be graded as
      follow:

        1. Totally satisfied with the Prep, without any complaints

        2. Satisfied, with the following complaints (Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain/cramping)

        3. Unsatisfied with the Prep (Reasons!!!)

      Patient's compliance will be graded as follow:

        1. Compliant

        2. Non compliant(Reasons).

      The prep instruction will be as follows REPARATION FOR COLONOSCOPY

      FIVE DAYS before your procedure:

        1. If you take COUMADIN or PLAVIX, we recommend that you stop these medications. You must
           contact your primary care physician or cardiologist for specific instructions. You may
           restart these medications again after the procedure unless otherwise instructed.

        2. If you have DIABETES and take medication to control your blood sugar, contact your

        4. Avoid the use of aspirin and aspirin-like medications such as ibuprofen, Advil and
           Aleve. These medicines may increase your risk of bleeding after polyp removal.
