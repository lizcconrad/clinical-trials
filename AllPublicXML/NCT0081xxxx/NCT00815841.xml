      Background: There is a paucity of data as to the effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on young
      adults who do not have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The existing data is
      equivocal and focuses on neuropsychological functions that are not always relevant to the
      clinical aspects of attention. Objective: To determine the effect of MPH on a diagnostic
      continuous performance task that assesses attention per se (TOVA) and on a decision making
      test (Modified Gamble Decision Test) in young, healthy adults. Methods: Fifty young adults,
      men and women ages 20-30, without ADHD, learning disabilities, history of past or present use
      of MPH or other psychotropic drugs, will be eligible to participate. Design: The experiment
      will be conducted in 2 sessions, the first lasting 3.5 hours and the second 2.5 hours in a
      randomized, double-blind prospective design. In the first session, the subjects will be
      screened for ADHD past and present, major psychiatric diagnosis (depression, anxiety, etc),
      use of MPH in the past, psychotropic medications or recreational drugs and any other chronic
      illness; urine will be tested for beta-hCG to rule out pregnancy. Blood pressure and heart
      rate will be measured. The participants will then be given either placebo or MPH (15-20 mg)
      and after 90 minutes will proceed to complete the TOVA (that lasts 22 minutes) and Modified
      Gamble-Decision Test (15 minutes). Before taking the pill and prior to the testing, the
      subjects will complete the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which quantifies their subjective
      feelings regarding present mental and emotional state. In the second session, 2 weeks later,
      blood pressure and heart will be measured and the VAS completed prior to and 90 minutes after
      taking the tablet. The subjects then undergo the TOVA and Modified Gamble-Decision Test. Data
      Analysis: will be performed using the paired t-tests for parametric variables and one way
      ANOVA with repeated measurements. Significance: Results of this study are important since MPH
      is used and abused by healthy students as a &quot;study aid&quot; although its objective effects in
      normal young adults are not well delineated
