      The primary objective of the study was to measure the change in bladder function as measured
      by Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI)-6 compared to baseline over 6 months of Tysabri
      treatment. Secondary objectives were to (i) measure change from baseline over 6 months of
      Tysabri treatment in the number of urinary incontinence episodes per participant per week,
      (ii) measure change from baseline over 6 months of Tysabri treatment in the number of
      micturitions per participant per day, (iii) measure change in The North American Research
      Committee on Multiple Sclerosis (NARCOMS) bladder/bowel subscale (PSB) scores from baseline
      over 6 months of Tysabri treatment and (iv) measure change in Incontinence Impact
      Questionnaire (IIQ)-7 scores from baseline over 6 months of Tysabri treatment.

             program.

          -  If utilizing medications for symptoms of bladder dysfunction (such as incontinence,
             urgency etc), subjects will need to remain on a stable dose of medication(s) for at
             least one month prior to and for duration of study.

          -  If utilizing medications that affect urinary output (e.g. anticholinergics, diuretics,
             etc.), subjects will need to remain on a stable dose of medication(s) for at least one
             month prior to study entry and for the duration of the study.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Patient must be willing to maintain current hydration habits and caffeine intake for
             the duration of the study.

        Participants will be selected for enrollment if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  Screening Visit urinary incontinence defined as:

             - Greater than or equal to 3 incontinence episodes per week or greater than or equal
             to 8 micturitions per day (both mean numbers).

          -  Screening Visit score on the UDI-6 of more than or equal to 6.

          -  Screening Visit EDSS 0 - 6.5
