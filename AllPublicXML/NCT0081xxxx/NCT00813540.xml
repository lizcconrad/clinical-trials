  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have suggested that individuals diagnosed with colon cancer who are inactive
      and/or overweight, may have poorer survival outcomes. Exercise training has been shown to
      improve fitness and body composition in other cancer survivor groups. The investigators
      hypothesize that an exercise training program will be a safe, feasible, and effective
      intervention to improve the fitness and body composition of a group of colon cancer
      survivors.

    <description>The exercise group will perform supervised stationary cycle ergometer exercise 3 times per week for 12 weeks and be progressed from 15 to 45 minutes and 60% to 110% of the power output obtained at V02peak. Resistance training will be completed twice per week and will include exercises for all major muscle groups. The training will progress from 60% to 80% of 1RM over the course of the intervention.</description>
