      A double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician know the name of the study drug),
      6-month, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the combination of galantamine
      with nimodipine in patients with mixed dementia on cognition and quality of life. The target
      dose of galantamine is 24 mg/day and nimodipine will be taken in fixed doses of 90 mg/day.
      Primary outcomes will be measured by a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests and
      Quality of Life (QoL) scores. Secondary outcomes will be measured by ADAS-cog, Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Mixed dementia (Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD) associated with cerebrovascular disease) is one of the most common causes of
      dementia, which remain largely underdiagnosed. Little is known about specific treatments for
      this condition. Ischemic lesions by themselves seem to play an important role in cognitive
      impairment, even in the presence of AD pathology. Hypotheses: - Galantamine 16-24 mg/day in
      combination with nimodipine 90 mg/day is superior to galantamine monotherapy (16-24 mg/day)
      in improving or stabilizing cognition in patients with AD associated with cerebrovascular
      disease (mixed dementia), as measured by the CNTB at 6 months. - Galantamine 16-24 mg/day in
      combination with nimodipine 90 mg/day is superior to galantamine monotherapy (16-24 mg/day)
      on QoL measures in this population as measured by QoL - AD at 6 months. Group 1: galantamine
      oral 8mg/day for a month, 16mg/day for 4 weeks and after 24mg/day until end of study plus
      nimodipine oral 30mg tid during all study. Group 2: Group 1: galantamine oral 8mg/day for a
      month, 16mg/day for 4 weeks and after 24mg/day until end of study plus placebo oral 30mg tid
      during all study.

    <measure>Reaction Time for Simple Reaction Time Test at Baseline, Week 8, and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Simple Reaction Time is a computerized attention test that evaluates the patient's reaction time. The number one was presented in the center of the computer screen and the patient had to press this number in the response box as quickly as possible. The reaction time, assessed 100 times per patient, was averaged at each time point for each patient e.g., at baseline, Week 8 and Week 24. The patient's finger was put over button one before the test begun. This test is part of the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB).</description>

    <measure>Reaction Time for Face Recognition Test at Baseline, Week 8, and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The face recognition test is a computerized attention test in which ten unfamiliar faces were presented simultaneously on the computer screen for ten seconds to be remembered. After that, a single face was shown and the patient had to press the button one if he/she remembered or, otherwise, button five. It consisted of a random presentation of ten pre-exposed faces and ten new faces as distracters. The reaction time, assessed per patient, was averaged at each time point for each patient e.g., at baseline, Weeks 8 and 24. This test is part of the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reaction Time for Word Recognition and Learning Test at Baseline, Week 8, and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The reaction time for word recognition and learning test is a computerized attention test that evaluates the patient's reaction time. This test is similar to the Face Recognition test procedure using Words. The recognition procedure was repeated three times to evaluate a learning effect. The reaction time, assessed per patient, was averaged at each time point for each patient e.g., at baseline, Week 8 and Week 24. This test is part of the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB).</description>

        <title>Reaction Time for Simple Reaction Time Test at Baseline, Week 8, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The Simple Reaction Time is a computerized attention test that evaluates the patient’s reaction time. The number one was presented in the center of the computer screen and the patient had to press this number in the response box as quickly as possible. The reaction time, assessed 100 times per patient, was averaged at each time point for each patient e.g., at baseline, Week 8 and Week 24. The patient’s finger was put over button one before the test begun. This test is part of the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB).</description>

The reaction time, assessed per patient, was averaged at each time point for each patient e.g., at baseline, Week 8 and Week 24. This test is part of the Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB).</description>

          <title>The Quality of Life Assessment for Patients With Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL- AD) Total Scores, Based on the Caregiver's Opinion, at Baseline, Week 8, Week 24</title>
          <description>The Quality of Life assessment scale for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (QoL-AD), according to the opinion of the caregiver is a 13-item scale with four possible scores for each question (score 1: poor and score 4: excellent). It evaluates the opinion of the caregiver about the patient's quality of life. Total score ranges from 13 to 52. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) is a scale to assess treatment response in patients with mental disorders. The Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale (CGI-I) requires the clinician to rate how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state. A patient's illness is compared to change over time and rated as: very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse.</description>

        <title>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) at Baseline, Week 8, and Week 24</title>
        <description>The NPI evaluates 12 neuropsychiatric domains: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, anxiety, aggression, euphoria, dis-inhibition, irritability/lability, apathy, aberrant motor activity, eating disorders, and night-time behavior disturbances. For present domains, the severity and frequency of the behavior are determined. Frequency is rated 1 (rarely) to 4 (very often) and Severity is scored 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The product scores vary from 1 (mild and rarely) to 12 (very often and severe). Total scores vary from 0 (no present domain) to 144 (all domains are present, are often and severe).</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days from the time submitted to the sponsor for review. The sponsor can require changes to the communication and can extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The major limitation of this study was the small sample size. This was probably due to the short enrollment period and to the rigorous inclusion criteria that were adopted.</limitations_and_caveats>
