  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Citrulline is an amino acid produced in the intestine and in the liver, but the liver does
      not contribute significantly to circulating citrulline concentrations. The intestine is thus
      the only organ that normally releases significant amounts of citrulline into the blood
      stream. The investigators have designed a study looking at the value of measuring plasma
      citrulline concentration in patients with tropical enteropathy of mixed HIV status. The focus
      will be on the ability of the intestine to sustain the individual concerned from a
      nutritional standpoint. The investigators hypothesise that plasma citrulline concentration is
      a marker of small bowel absorptive integrity and an appropriate surrogate for HIV related
      enteropathy.

      Preliminary studies reported that plasma citrulline concentrations may be a reliable
      biochemical marker for intestinal dysfunction and absorptive enterocyte mass. The
      relationship between citrulline concentration and intestinal function has been supported in
      other studies including those examining rejection in small bowel allografts. Concentrations
      of citrulline are dramatically reduced in cases of mucosal damage (e.g. moderate graft
      rejection or viral enteritis)and strongly correlate (inversely) with severity on biopsy.
      Plasma citrulline concentration is lower also in patients with villous atrophy
      (24±13µmol/L)than in healthy subjects (40±10µmol/L)and patients with anorexia nervosa
      (39±9µmol/L).Experimental studies have been carried out also in assessing the value of
      citrulline as a marker for severity of small bowel epithelial damage from radiation and viral
      infections. The plasma citrulline was shown to be a simple, non invasive and sensitive essay
      to monitor and quantify radiation and/or chemotherapy induced small bowel damage in mice and
      humans. Otherwise, the literature on citrulline as a potential marker of intestinal and
      nutritional integrity is young and consistent data for specific conditions as for HIV
      enteropathy are missing.We hypothesise that plasma citrulline concentration is a marker of
      small bowel absorptive integrity and an appropriate surrogate for HIV related enteropathy.
