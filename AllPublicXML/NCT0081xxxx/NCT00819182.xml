  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Paced respiration has been internationally recommended for vasomotor symptom
      management despite limited empirical evidence.

      Objective: To evaluate efficacy of a paced respiration intervention against a sham comparator
      breathing control and usual care control for vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms.

      Design: A 16-week, 3-group, partially blinded, controlled trial with 2:2:1 randomization and
      stratification by group (breast cancer, no cancer), Midwestern city and surrounding area.

      Participants: 218 randomized women (96 breast cancer survivors, 122 menopausal women without
      cancer) recruited through community mailings and registries.

      Interventions: Training, home practice support, and instructions to use the breathing at the
      time of each hot flash were delivered via compact disc with printed booklet (paced
      respiration intervention) or digital videodisc with printed booklet (fast shallow breathing
      control). Usual care control received a letter regarding group assignment.

      Main Measures: Hot flash frequency, severity, and bother (primary), hot flash interference in
      daily life, perceived control over hot flashes, and mood and sleep disturbances (secondary).
      Intervention performance, adherence, and adverse events were assessed.

    <description>The paced respiration intervention group received a compact disc with paper booklet. The booklet reinforced instructions on the first audio track for how to accomplish a target breath rate of 6-8 breaths per minute, practice twice per day for 15 minutes, and apply the breathing at the onset of each hot flash. Women were instructed to do slow, deep, abdominal breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth as per international recommendations (4). They were also instructed to practice twice per day for 15 minutes as per the small, laboratory-based studies (5, 6). The second and third tracks contained specially composed, digitally recorded music to help entrain the breath rate and structure the length of practice.</description>

            <description>The paced respiration intervention group received a compact disc with paper booklet. The booklet reinforced instructions on the first audio track for how to accomplish a target breath rate of 6-8 breaths per minute, practice twice per day for 15 minutes, and apply the breathing at the onset of each hot flash. Women were instructed to do slow, deep, abdominal breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth as per international recommendations. They were also instructed to practice twice per day for 15 minutes as per the small, laboratory-based studies. The second and third tracks contained specially composed, digitally recorded music to help entrain the breath rate and structure the length of practice.</description>

            <description>The paced respiration intervention group received a compact disc with paper booklet. The booklet reinforced instructions on the first audio track for how to accomplish a target breath rate of 6-8 breaths per minute, practice twice per day for 15 minutes, and apply the breathing at the onset of each hot flash. Women were instructed to do slow, deep, abdominal breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth as per international recommendations. They were also instructed to practice twice per day for 15 minutes as per the small, laboratory-based studies. The second and third tracks contained specially composed, digitally recorded music to help entrain the breath rate and structure the length of practice.</description>
