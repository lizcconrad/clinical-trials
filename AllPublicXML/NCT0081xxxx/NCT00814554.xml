  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of three public health intervention
      strategies to reduce weight excess and obesity prevalence among teenagers within the frame of
      a public health program aiming at promoting healthy eating and physical activity behaviors.

    <textblock>
      A cluster randomised trial implemented in 24 high and technical schools including 20 000
      fifth-former aims, on a three-year period, at evaluating the effectiveness of three
      strategies, combined or not, according a 2*2*2 factorial plan, concerning the promotion of
      healthy dietary and physical activity behaviours: to develop individual skills by individual
      and collective education, to propose favourable environment, to screen and care for subjects
      at risk of weight excess. Main outcomes are improvement of knowledge, attitudes and
      behaviours, mean body mass index (BMI) change, proportion of obese children according to
      international standards after two years of follow-up, and finally psychological and
      sociological factors which are facilitators or barriers to such actions. The evidence of the
      effectiveness of one or the other of the strategies will help to define interventions
      framework for medical, educative and economic sector actors.

    <description>1.Educational strategy. The strategy is to implement health promotion actions aiming at developing personal skills to adopt healthy behaviors in the field of nutrition and physical activity in conformity with up-to-date recommendations and references. Each adolescent will be provided with about 50 education hours distributed in individual and collective activities in school (15 hours), interventions during courses (20 hours), and outdoors activities (15 hours).</description>

    <description>2. Screening strategy. Screening includes measurement of BMI and plotting the growing chart with adolescents, measurement of eating troubles. Screening will be performed by the school medical and nurse team. At risk subjects will be defined according to precise criteria and will be referred to the GP and to obesity networks developed by Health Insurance system where they are provided with specific activities with dieticians, physical activity teachers and psychologists. Subjects with psychological difficulties will be referred for psychological care.</description>

    <description>3. Environmental strategy. The strategy is to develop in schools favorable and supportive environments for healthy behaviors targeting the collective catering and physical activity offer and the establishment policy. Especially actions aim at increase fruits and vegetables availability, water consumption, physical activity inside the schools.</description>
