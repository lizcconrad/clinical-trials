  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with ALS experience cramps during the course of the disease. Frequently, cramps
      occur as the first symptom of the disease, months before the patients notice weakness and
      wasting. Cramp severity varies from mild, without affecting daily activities and sleep, to
      disabling, where almost any voluntary muscle activity induces long standing, severely painful
      cramping. ALS patients who smoke herbal cannabis (marijuana) or drink hemp tea report
      lessening of cramps and fasciculations. Although, various medications, such as magnesium,
      quinine sulfate, lioresal, dantrolene, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin and gabapentin are used
      for the treatment of cramps in ALS so far, no medication has been of proven benefit. However,
      a recent pilot study with THC in ALS showed symptomatic effects in &quot;spasms&quot;, fasciculations,
      insomnia and appetite. The aim of the proposed study is to determine the tolerability, safety
      and efficacy of THC in the treatment of cramps in ALS. The hypothesis is that THC will lessen
      cramps in ALS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and have full legal capacity

          -  Patients must voluntarily give written informed consent

             ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria (Brooks 2000)

          -  Patients must score severity of cramps on the VAS 5 or more

          -  Patients must be able to communicate and report adverse events by phone

          -  Patients must have laboratory parameters within the following limits: Creatinine,

          -  Patients may take any medication for the treatment of ALS (ALS -specific and

          -  Patients must not have cannabis or cannabinoids for at least one month prior to the
             study and agree not to use it at all during the study. They have to have a negative
             urinary test for cannabinoids at baseline

          -  Pre-menopausal females must provide negative pregnancy test within fourteen days
             before beginning of study participation and have to apply adequate (barrier)
             birth-control methods

             effects from or hypersensitivity to THC or any cannabinoid

          -  Patients who have significant concomitant illness(-es), or acute, uncontrolled
             infections, which might make evaluation of treatment and side effects difficult

             schizophrenia

          -  Patients who are current drug abusers, including alcohol abusers
