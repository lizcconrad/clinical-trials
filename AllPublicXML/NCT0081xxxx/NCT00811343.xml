    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a current infection during anti TNF therapy. After infectious contact, some
      patients will develop tuberculosis and some will only be infected without symptoms, they have
      Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) wich can reactivate later. In order to prevent this
      tuberculosis reactivation, LTBI diagnosis screening is preconised in patients who need anti
      TNF therapy. This diagnosis is made till now by the tuberculin skin test (TST) but this test
      is not specific of TB. New blood tests (QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB) specific to MTB infection are
      now available.

      The primary endpoint of this study is the evaluation of the theoric therapeutic impact of the
      use of new tests for diagnosis of LTBI in patients before anti TBF therapy

      Detailed description :

      Principal outcome: Therapeutic impact of the use of new tests for diagnosis of LTBI in
      patients before anti TBF therapy

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  medico-economic impact of replacement of TST by QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests in LTBI
           screening in patients before anti TNF therapy.

        -  concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results with TST

        -  Concordance between QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests and evaluation of indetermined tests.

        -  concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results with patient disease.

        -  concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results with TST in patients with LTBI
           determinated by clinical or radiological observation

        -  Impact of geographical, disease and treatment in patients with LTBI determinated by
           clinical or radiological observation

        -  Identify the original characteristic and maximal impact therapeutic of QFTB-G and
           T-SPOT.TB test

      Analysed criteria :

        -  therapeutic impact

        -  Patients percentage with different therapeutic outcome based on usual recommendations
           medico-economic

        -  Medico-economic impact :impact of both tests as early and late cost - efficacy

      Statistic :

        -  Primary criteria : Percentage of patients for whom therapeutic would have been changed
           by QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results compared to usual diagnosis strategy.

        -  Secondary criteria : Concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests with TST Concordance
           between both QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests .
