  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the combination of fulvestrant and ZACTIMA,
      versus fulvestrant plus placebo, results in a significant decrease in the bone marker,
      urinary N-Telopeptide (NTx) in postmenopausal women with bone only, or bone predominant,
      hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. A significant decrease will be defined as
      a &gt; 30% reduction in urinary NTx level from baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor angiogenesis is associated with invasiveness and the metastatic potential of various
      cancers. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most potent and specific angiogenic
      factor, regulates normal and pathologic angiogenesis. The increased expression of VEGF has
      been correlated with metastases, recurrence and poor prognosis in many cancers. It has been
      shown the VEGF is involved in osteolysis in women with bone metastases. ZACTIMA is an agent
      which targets VEGF. ZACTIMA is a new agent with novel method of action - it is a VEGF
      inhibitor, epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitor, tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as well as a
      potential RET kinase activity inhibitor.

      In summary, women with bone only, or bone predominant, metastatic breast cancer is an ideal
      group to study anti-angiogenic therapies where angiogenesis could be a major factor in tumor
      progression and where anti-angiogenic treatment with agents like ZACTIMA could be more
      effective.

             patient has QTc &gt; 480msec on screening ECG, the screen ECG may be repeated twice (at
             least 24 hours apart). The average QTc from the three screening ECGs must be &lt; 480msec
             in order for the patient to be eligible for the study). Patients who are receiving a
             drug that has a risk of QTc prolongation (see Appendix III, Table 2) are excluded if
             QTc is &gt; 460msec.

         25. Hypertension not controlled by medical therapy (systolic blood pressure &gt; 160
             millimeter of mercury (mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100mmHg).

         26. Concomitant medications that are potent inducers (rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, phenobarbital and St. John's Wort) of CYP3A4 function.

         27. Not accessible for treatment and follow up.
