  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the blood
      sugar lowering effect of repaglinide plus metformin as initial treatment compared to
      repaglinide alone in Chinese subjects with type 2 diabetes having an HbA1c (glycosylated
      haemoglobin A1c) over 8.5 % and who never have taken oral sugar-lowering drugs before. The
      associated unfavourable events including low blood sugar episodes between the two treatments
      are also compared.
