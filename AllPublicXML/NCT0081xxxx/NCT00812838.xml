  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peyronie's disease is a condition in which a plaque, or hard lump, forms on the penis. It
      causes hardened tissue, pain, and an abnormal bending in the penis. These symptoms are more
      severe during an erection. Significant bending of the penis can result in pain, poor
      erections, and an inability to engage in sexual intercourse.

      This disease affects about 3% of the male population. The average age of onset of this
      disease is 57 years old. The cause of the disease is unknown. However, many believe that it
      may be due to trauma to the penis (such as injury or extremely vigorous sexual activity).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments for this disease have been limited and often unsuccessful. The goal of treatment
      is to reduce pain and maintain sexual function. Oral medicines that prevent plaque formation
      and promote plaque breakdown have not been effective. Many patients with the disease will
      require injections of medicines directly into the plaque. These injections have been used for
      over 50 years in the treatment of major Peyronie's disease. The disease often resolves on its
      own without treatment. Surgery may be performed to remove hardened tissue in the penis.
      However, surgery is not done during the first 12 months of the disease.

      There are 2 phases of the disease: the active phase and the inactive phase. The active phase
      usually occurs during the first 12 months of the disease. The stabilization of the plaque is
      known as the inactive phase. We are inviting men with stable disease to take part in this
      study which will test BOTOX® versus a placebo (a placebo contains no medicine).

      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, single-center trial. Study drug is
      Botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX®). Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will
      be randomized to either the treatment or placebo arm.

        -  Treatment: Injection solution will consist of 100 units of BOTOX® in 10 cc of
           preservative free normal saline, or

        -  Placebo: Injection solution will consist of 10 cc preservative free normal saline.
