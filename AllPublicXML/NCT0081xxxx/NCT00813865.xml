    <textblock>
      This study will measure the long-term safety of AT2101 and its effects on hemoglobin,
      platelets, liver and spleen volume, and bone density. This study will also look at the
      effects of AT2101 on beta-glucocerebrosidase levels, glucosylceramide levels, and other blood
      markers of Gaucher disease.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, long-term extension study designed to assess the long-term safety,
      efficacy and pharmacodynamics of AT2101 in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who
      successfully complete Study GAU-CL-202. Participants may enter this study immediately upon
      completion of Study GAU-CL-202, or at any later time point. Each participant will continue to
      receive AT2101 at the same dose level and regimen as in the previous study.

      Study visits will occur every 3 months. At every visit, safety evaluations will be performed
      and blood samples will be collected for pharmacodynamic tests. At the completion of every
      year of treatment in this study, or at the early termination visit, participants will undergo
      a comprehensive physical examination, MRIs of liver, spleen and femoral bones, DEXA scans of
      femoral bones and lumbar spine, and complete the SF-36 questionnaire. Duration of treatment
      will depend on the time of each participant's enrollment in the study. Participants will be
      contacted approximately 1 month after study completion for assessment of adverse events.
