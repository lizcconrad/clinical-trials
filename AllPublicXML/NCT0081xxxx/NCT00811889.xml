  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bardoxolone methyl (RTA 402) is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator (AIM) that is
      undergoing clinical testing in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cancer. Bardoxolone methyl
      and other AIMs inhibit immune-mediated inflammation by restoring redox homeostasis in
      inflamed tissues by inducing the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. In the diabetic
      population, adipocytes produce cytokines and mobilize free fatty acids which induce insulin
      resistance. Resultant hyperglycemia and increased cytokine production induces reactive oxygen
      and nitrogen species which in turn induce vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.
      This process causes further activation of NF-kB, creating a vicious cycle of inflammation,
      vasoconstriction, and ischemia, the end result of which is sclerosis in the kidney and
      coronary arteries. By inducing Nrf2 and suppressing redox-driven inflammation, we hypothesize
      that this cycle of inflammation and sclerosis can be abrogated.

      Based on Phase IIa data, we hypothesize that bardoxolone methyl will improve renal function
      through suppression of renal oxidative stress, inflammation and improvement of glomerular
      filtration.
