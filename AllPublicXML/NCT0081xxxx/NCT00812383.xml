      Single center randomized clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid
      artery stenting using the RX ACCULINK™ Carotid Stent System with RX ACCUNET™ Embolic
      Protection System or PercuSurge GuardWire® 3-6 Temporary Occlusion and Aspiration System
      using Angiomax (bivalirudin)versus heparin as the anticoagulant for treatment of occlusive
      carotid artery disease in low and high risk patient cohorts.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  The patient must have a significant diameter reduction of the extracranial or
             intracranial internal or common carotid artery, defined as ≥50% stenosis for
             symptomatic patients or ≥80% stenosis for asymptomatic patients determined by carotid
             duplex ultrasound scan and/or carotid angiography.

          -  Female patients with child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test.

          -  The patient and the patient's physician must agree to have the patient return for a
             30-day and one-year clinical and ultrasound imaging follow-up evaluations as indicated
             in the protocol.

          -  Reference vessel diameter ≥ 3.5 mm - ≤ 9.0 mm diameter.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had a recent (&lt;4 weeks) disabling stroke or dementia with major
             neurologic deficit (stroke scales: Barthel &lt;60, NIH &gt;15, or Rankin &gt;3) at
             pre-procedure neuro exam.

          -  The patient has had within four weeks of the treatment procedure an intracranial
             hemorrhage, hemorrhage stroke, major stroke, or any stroke with mass effect
             demonstrated on MRI or CT.

          -  The patient has a known allergy to heparin, bivalirudin, aspirin or to anti-platelet
             agents that prevents taking aspirin plus ticlopidine or aspirin plus clopidogrel.

          -  The patient has received fractionated or unfractionated heparin within 8 hours prior
             to the procedure.

          -  The patient has a history of prior life-threatening radiocontrast reaction that cannot
             be pre-treated.

          -  The patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy within 3 months.

          -  The patient is currently participating in another study protocol that may influence
             either procedure results or follow-up evaluations.

          -  Plasma/serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dl at time of intervention.

          -  Hemodynamic instability at the time of intervention.

          -  Previous stent placement in the ipsilateral carotid distribution.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          -  The patient has an intracranial tumor, or cerebral arterio-venous malformation(s) &gt;
             5mm, aneurysms or severe intracranial stenosis distal to target lesion.

          -  The patient has inaccessible intracranial arterial stenosis greater in severity than
             the extracranial internal carotid artery lesion.

          -  There is angiographic evidence of significant intra-luminal thrombus burden with
             presumed increased risk of plaque fragmentation and consequent distal embolization.

          -  There is total occlusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery treatment site with TIMI 0
             flow characteristics.

          -  The reference segment diameter (internal carotid artery segment cephalad to the
             lesion) is less than 3 millimeters by operator visual estimate.

          -  The patient has peripheral vascular, supra-aortic or internal carotid artery
             tortuosity precluding use of catheter-based techniques required for successful CSSA
