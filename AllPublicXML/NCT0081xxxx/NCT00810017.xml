    <textblock>
      This study is for women and men who have previously treated metastatic (has spread to other
      parts in the body), Her2- positive breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out
      what effects (good and bad) the FDA-approved drugs etoposide and trastuzumab have on this
      type of breast cancer and to determine if these drugs are safe to use together. This research
      is being done to find more effective treatment for this type of condition.

      In this study, trastuzumab and etoposide will be given by intravenous infusion (IV; through a
      vein) on the first 3 days of every 3-week cycle. This is repeated for 6 cycles. After 6
      cycles, only trastuzumab will be given until worsening of disease. In this study, a small
      amount of your tissue that was collected when you had surgery will be evaluated in the lab to
      look at genetic differences among people and how those differences may affect a response to a
      specific drug or medicine. This testing will look for a gene called Top2A. Previous studies
      suggest that people who have both the Top2A and Her2 genes respond to certain chemotherapies
      (anti-cancer drugs) differently from those who only have the Her2 gene.

             metastatic breast adenocarcinoma

          -  Confirmed HER2 amplification by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) 3+ or FISH
             amplified (either primary or metastatic).
