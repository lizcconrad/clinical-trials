  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research reveals genetic and symptomatic overlap among children with speech sound
      disorders (i.e., those who (misarticulate more sounds than would be expected for their age)
      and children with dyslexia (i.e., those who struggle to learn to read). Children who have
      speech sound disorders as preschoolers are at risk for the later emergence of dyslexia, a
      risk that often reveals itself in the form of poor phonological awareness skills during the
      preschool period. Traditional speech therapy methods focus on articulation accuracy and do
      not focus on the child's more abstract knowledge of the sound system of the language. The
      ultimate objective of this research program is to prevent reading disability in children who
      present with speech sounds disorders. The relative effectiveness of different interventions
      to help these children achieve age-appropriate phonological processing skills prior to school
      entry will be investigated. It is expected that a combination of treatment approaches that
      focus on speech perception skills and vocabulary knowledge will have a superior impact on
      phonological awareness in comparison with a treatment approach that focuses solely on
      articulation accuracy.

      The 72 children participating in the study will be randomly assigned (with concealment of the
      randomization sequence from study staff) to one of two Child Speech Interventions: Speech
      Perception or Speech Production. These interventions will be provided in individualized
      one-hour treatment sessions once per week for six consecutive weeks during the first
      treatment block. During the second 6 week treatment block all children will receive a group
      phonological awareness intervention. Concurrently their parents will be randomly assigned to
      receive instruction in the provision of a home program, either Articulation Therapy or
      Dialogic Reading. This will result in 4 groups of 18 children with each group receiving one
      of four combinations of intervention: Speech Production Intervention + Articulation Parent
      Group; Speech Production Intervention + Dialogic Reading Parent Group; Speech Perception
      Intervention + Articulation Parent Group; and Speech Perception Intervention + Dialogic
      Reading Parent Group. Assessments will occur pretreatment, after the first treatment block,
      after the second treatment block, and 9 months after the end of the second treatment block.

    <description>Individualized intervention in which the Speech Assessment and Interactive Learning System is used to teach the child to identify recordings of words as either correct or incorrect pronunciations of the target word. In the event that the child is completely unable to pronounce the target speech sounds or word shapes focused stimulation activities are used to provide the child with further auditory exposure to the target forms. If the child stimulable for the target forms, the child is given opportunities the produce the target speech sounds or word shapes in the context of minimal pair games in which the child receives feedback about the communicative effectiveness of his or her attempts to produce the target words.</description>
