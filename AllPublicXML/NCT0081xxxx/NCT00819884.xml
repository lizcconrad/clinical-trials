        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  type II diabetes patients, female with non child-bearing potential

          -  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) diagnosis confirmed by C-peptide &gt;0.3nmol/L and no
             Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies at enrolment (screening)

          -  Treatment with metformin as single therapy for T2DM for at least 30 days prior to
             enrolment and the metformin dose must have been unchanged during this period

          -  History of ischemic heart disease, symptomatic heart failure, stroke, transitory
             ischemic attack or symptomatic peripheral vascular disease

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality identified on physical examination, laboratory
             test or ECG, which in the judgement of investigator would compromise the subject's
             safety or successful participation in the clinical study
