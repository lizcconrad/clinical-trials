      This study focuses on pre-pandemic priming of man against H5 influenza with the goal of
      mounting a robust antibody response to small quantities of vaccine either before or during an
      H5 pandemic.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Immunogenicity objectives

        1. To evaluate the magnitude of the antibody responses to one or two 'priming' 0.5mL
           intramuscular (IM) doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1)
           influenza vaccine, each dose containing 7.5μg of H5N1 haemagglutinin, in immunologically
           naïve subjects;

        2. To examine the kinetics of the antibody responses to one 0.5mL 'booster' intramuscular
           dose of antigenically drifted MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, or non-adjuvanted antigenically
           drifted vaccine, given at doses of 3.75 or 7.5μg, in subjects primed with one or two
           doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1) influenza vaccine;

        3. To evaluate the magnitude of the antibody responses to one 0.5mL 'booster' intramuscular
           dose of antigenically drifted MF59-adjuvanted vaccine, or non-adjuvanted antigenically
           drifted vaccine, given at doses of 3.75μg or 7.5μg, in subjects primed with one or two
           doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1) influenza vaccine;

        4. To evaluate the breadth of the antibody responses induced by 'priming' (see 1., above),
           and 'booster' vaccination regimens (see 2., and 3., above), with respect to a
           representative range of antigenically distinct H5N1 viruses (wild-type and attenuated);
           and

        5. To evaluate the persistence of the antibody responses induced by 'priming' (see 1.,
           above), and 'booster' vaccination regimens (see 2., and 3., above).

      Safety objective

      1. To evaluate the safety of the administration of one or two 'priming' 0.5mL intramuscular
      (IM) doses of an MF59-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1 Clade 1) influenza vaccine (each
      dose containing 7.5μg of H5N1 haemagglutinin), in immunologically naïve subjects, followed by
      one 3.75μg or 7.5μg 'booster' dose of antigenically drifted MF59-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine, or
      non-adjuvanted antigenically drifted H5N1 vaccine.

             viral protein, neomycin or kanamycin, or any other component of the study vaccine;

         11. Subjects with a history of any neurological symptoms and signs, or anaphylactic shock
             following administration of any vaccine;

         12. Subjects with known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, for
             example, resulting from:

               1. receipt of oral immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroid therapy or cancer
                  chemotherapy) (long-term, inhaled steroids for asthma management is acceptable),

               2. receipt of immunostimulants or interferon,

               3. receipt of parenteral immunoglobulin preparation, blood products, and/or plasma
                  derivatives within 3 months prior to Visits 1 (Day 1), 2 (Day 22), or 5 (Day
                  382), or planned during the full length of the study,

               4. high risk from developing an immunocompromising disease;

         13. Actual or planned receipt of another vaccine during the period 3 weeks before to 3
             weeks after vaccination on Days 1, 22, and 382;

         14. Subjects with a history of (or current) drug or alcohol abuse (20g/day for females;
             30g/day for males) that in the investigator's opinion would interfere with safety of
             the subject or the evaluation of the study objectives;

         15. Subjects who are unable to lead an independent life either physically or mentally;

         16. Have participated in a previous study of H5 avian influenza vaccine;

         17. Have been previously vaccinated with a vaccine containing MF59 or similar adjuvant;

         18. Subjects with any condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might
             interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.
