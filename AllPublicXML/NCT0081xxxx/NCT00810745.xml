    <textblock>
      This randomized study was designed to compare the 2 year clinical and functional results with
      the STARR procedure using a new curved cutter stapler or the same operation done with 2
      traditional circular staplers.

    <textblock>
      From January to November 2006, 80 women were selected, with clinical examination,
      constipation score, colonoscopy, anorectal manometry, and perineography and randomly assigned
      to 2 groups: 40 patients underwent stapled transanal rectal resection with two staplers
      PPH-01 (Ethicon Endosurgery Inc, Pomezia, Italy) (STARR group) and 40 had the same operation
      with new, curved multi-fire stapler Contour R Transtar TM (TRANSTAR group). Patients were
      followed up with clinical examination, constipation score, and perineography.
