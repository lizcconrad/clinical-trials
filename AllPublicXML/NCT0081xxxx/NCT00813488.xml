    <description>The BTP preference questionnaire is a questionnaire used to measure patients' preference for FBT or immediate-release oxycodone for management of BTP. The question is used to determine a patient's preference between the study drugs given in the 2 double-blind treatment periods. The patient was asked to select 1 of the following: 1, a preference for study drug used in the 1st double-blind treatment period; 2, a preference for study drug used in the 2nd double-blind treatment period; or 3, no preference.</description>

          -  The patient has received a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 14 days before
             the first treatment with study drug.

          -  The patient has any other medical condition or is receiving concomitant
             medication/therapy (e.g., regional nerve block) that could, in the opinion of the
             investigator, compromise the patient's safety or compliance with the study protocol,
             or compromise collected data.

          -  The patient is involved in active litigation in regard to the chronic pain currently
             being treated.

          -  The patient has a positive UDS for an illicit drug or a medication not prescribed for

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Subjects with chronic pain who had been receiving opioid therapy for the previous 7 days and reported on average 1 to 5 breakthrough pain episodes per day were recruited from 50 different study sites throughout the United States beginning December 2008 and completing in November 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to the double-blind treatment period, subjects participated in two titration periods to identify a &quot;successful&quot; and tolerated dose of FBT and immediate-release oxycodone. Subjects who did not titrate to a successful and tolerated dose were excluded from further participation in the study.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>FBT First Immediate Release Oxycodone Second</title>
          <description>Subjects in this treatment group were assigned 200 mcg FBT during the first titration period and then 15 mg oxycodone during the second titration period. Standard rescue medication could be taken if pain relief was unsuccessful. If more than one dose was required for at least 1 of 3 breakthrough pain episodes in one day, the next day the dose was increased (in 200 mcg increments for FBT and 15 mg increments for oxycodone). The maximum allowable dose was 800 mcg for FBT (4 tablets) and 60 mg (4 capsules) for oxycodone. If a dose was not tolerated the dose was lowered to the previous tolerated dose. Titration completed when successful analgesia was achieved with a tolerated dose or maximum dose was reached. If unsuccessful at maximum dose subject was discontinued from proceeding further in the study. Subjects who successfully titrated were randomized.</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Difference (PID) at 15 Minutes Post-treatment (PID15)</title>
        <description>Pain intensity (PI) scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine after each episode of breakthrough pain during the double-blind treatment period. The PID15 is the difference between the PI scores from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration)and 15 minutes after the administration of the study drug. Least squared mean was from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as randomized, phase, and sequence as fixed factors and patient as a random factor using compound symmetry.</description>

An episode was evaluable if it had a valid pain intensity measurement immediately prior to drug administration.

The PID30 is the difference between the PI score from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration) and 30 minutes after the administration of the study drug. Least squared mean was from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as randomized, phase, and sequence as fixed factors and patient as a random factor using compound symmetry.</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately pre-dose and 30 minutes after dosing</time_frame>
        <population>Full Analysis Set defined as having at least one evaluable episode of breakthrough pain treated with FBT and at least one with oxycodone. An episode was evaluable if it had a valid pain intensity measurement immediately prior to drug administration. No imputation for missing breakthrough pain episodes, but LOCF was applied for missing PI scores.</population>

          <title>Percentage Change in Pain Intensity Difference (% PID) at 60 Minutes Post-treatment</title>
          <description>Pain intensity (PI) scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine after each episode of breakthrough pain during the double-blind treatment period. The PID60 is the difference between the PI scores from the episode baseline (immediately prior to study drug administration)and 60 minutes after the administration of the study drug. The difference is calculated and assessed as a percentage of the baseline pain intensity score.</description>

        <description>The mean TOTPAR at 60 minutes will be calculated for each episode as the weighted sum of Pain Relief (PR) scores (5-point Likert scale, 0 = none to 4 = complete) at each assessment of PR (during the double-blind treatment period) until 60 minutes after study drug administration, as follows:
TOTPAR60 =(⅓ x PR5)+ (⅓ x PR10) +(⅓ x PR15)+ PR30 + PR45 + PR60. Least squared mean was from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as randomized, phase, and sequence as fixed factors and patient as a random factor using compound symmetry.</description>

        <title>Breakthrough Pain Preference Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The BTP preference questionnaire is a questionnaire used to measure patients’ preference for FBT or immediate-release oxycodone for management of BTP. The question is used to determine a patient’s preference between the study drugs given in the 2 double-blind treatment periods. The patient was asked to select 1 of the following: 1, a preference for study drug used in the 1st double-blind treatment period; 2, a preference for study drug used in the 2nd double-blind treatment period; or 3, no preference.</description>
