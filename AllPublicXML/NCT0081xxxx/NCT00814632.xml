  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia is characterized by persistent vulvar pain, which often occurs upon touch or
      pressure. The cause of vulvodynia is unknown but is presumed to involve many factors. Some of
      these factors may include altered immune response, infections, altered vaginal acid-base
      balance, allergic reactions and psychosexual disorders. Women are generally treated with
      medications such as anti-histamines, anti-depressants and anti-inflammatories, or with
      physical therapy to minimize symptoms. Other therapies for vulvodynia include topical agents
      (lidocaine, or compounded medications such as baclofen, gabapentin and amitriptyline), oral
      medications (gabapentin, pregabalin, calcium citrate), complementary therapies (yoga, guided
      imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy) or a low-oxalate diet, but these are often
      ineffective. Surgery for vulvodynia may be helpful in the hard to manage cases, but is
      utilized as a last resort.

      CC-10004 is a well-tolerated, selective PDE4 inhibitor with a demonstrated inhibitory effect
      on inflammatory mediators and is under development for the treatment of inflammatory and
      immune mediated conditions.

      This is an open-label, one arm, phase II study at William Beaumont Hospital. Twenty female
      subjects aged 18 or older meeting criteria for diagnosis of vulvodynia or vulvar vestibulitis
      (vestibulodynia) will be treated with CC-10004 at 20mg orally twice a day for 12 weeks.The
      patient will be seen for a total of ten visits by the study coordinator.

    <description>The primary efficacy measure was a Global Response Assessment (GRA), a subject completed questionnaire that measures improvement in overall symptoms. The GRA is a 7-point scale the allows the subject to respond to the question: &quot;As compared to when you started the study, overall how do you feel? The responses are: Markedly Improved - 7, Moderately Improved - 6, Mildly Improved - 5, Same - 4, Mildly Worse - 3, Moderately Worse - 2, Markedly Worse - 1.
The primary outcome showing response to treatment was the number of subjects that were moderately or markedly improved on the GRA scale.</description>
