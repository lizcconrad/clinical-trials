             spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml
             (&lt;140 pmol/L) or 6 weeks postsurgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 5 terminal half-lives post-last dose.

          -  Documented history of bronchial asthma, first diagnosed at least 6 months prior to the
             screening visit and currently being treated only with intermittent short-acting beta
             -agonist therapy by inhalation.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt;70% of predicted at screening.

          -  Subjects who are current non-smokers who have not used any tobacco products in the
             6-month period preceding the screening visit and have a pack history of &lt;= 10 pack
             years.

        [number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked]

          -  Demonstration of a positive wheal and flare reaction (&gt;= 3 mm relative to negative
             control) to at least one allergen from a battery of allergens (including house dust
             mite, grass pollen and cat hair) on skin prick testing at screening, or within 12
             months of study start.

          -  Methacholine challenge PC20 &lt; 8 mg/mL at screening or previous (in last 6 months) AMP,
             histamine or methacholine challenge that confirms the diagnosis of asthma

          -  Screening allergen challenge demonstrates that the subject experiences an early
             asthmatic response. The early asthmatic response must include a fall in FEV1 of &gt;= 20%
             from the post saline value, on at least one occasion, between 5 and 30 minutes after
             the final concentration of allergen. Data obtained from screening for LPA111834 may be
             used for this criteria.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject

          -  The subject is able to understand and comply with the protocol requirements,
             instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator or medical monitor, may
             affect the outcome of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to,
             cardiovascular disease, malignancy, gastrointestinal disease, hepatic disease, renal
             disease, haematological disease, neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary
             disease

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in safety laboratory analysis at screening.

          -  Subject has known history of hypertension or is hypertensive at screening.
             Hypertension at screening is defined as persistent systolic BP &gt;150 mmHg or diastolic
             BP &gt; 90mmHg.

          -  Respiratory tract infection and/or exacerbation of asthma within 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of study medication

          -  History of life-threatening asthma, defined as an asthma episode that required
             intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnoea, respiratory arrest and/or hypoxic
             seizures

          -  Symptomatic with hay fever at screening or predicted to have symptomatic hay fever
             during the time of study

          -  Administration of oral or injectable steroids within 5 weeks of screening or
             intranasal and/or inhaled steroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit.

          -  Unable to abstain from short acting beta agonists within 8 hours prior to an allergen
             challenge, dosing with study drug or any lung function assessment.

          -  If, after 2 concurrent administrations of saline during the allergen challenge at
             screening the subjects still have a fall in FEV1 of greater than 10%.

          -  The subject has participated in a study with a new molecular entity during the
             previous 3 months or has participated in 4 or more clinical studies in the previous 12

          -  The subject has a screening QTc value of &gt;450msec, PR interval outside the range 120
             to 220msec or an ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements (e.g. poorly defined
             termination of the T-wave).

          -  The subject has tested positive for hepatitis C antibody or hepatitis B surface
             antigen.

          -  The subject has tested positive for HIV antibodies.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study urine cotinine/ breath carbon monoxide test or
             urine drug or urine or breath alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
