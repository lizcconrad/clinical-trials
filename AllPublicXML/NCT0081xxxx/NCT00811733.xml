  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the tolerability and efficacy of ofatumumab in follicular lymphoma and Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia, and the need to improve therapy for patients with WM utilizing a
      non-myelosuppressive agent this phase II trial of ofatumumab is being initiated in patients
      with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM).

        <title>Duration of Response for All Responders (CR, PR, MR), as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the initial response to relapse/disease progression (DP) or death. DP for CR is defined as the reappearance of the IgM protein, new signs/symptoms attributable to WM, evidence of active disease or recurrence of bone marrow involvement by lymphoplasmacytic cells, or the appearance of any new lymph node &gt;=1.5 centimeters on any axis. Progression for PR/MR is either a &gt;=25% increase in IgM from the lowest attained response value or progression of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, or other clinically significant signs/symptoms caused by WM.</description>

          <title>Duration of Response for All Responders (CR, PR, MR), as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
          <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the initial response to relapse/disease progression (DP) or death. DP for CR is defined as the reappearance of the IgM protein, new signs/symptoms attributable to WM, evidence of active disease or recurrence of bone marrow involvement by lymphoplasmacytic cells, or the appearance of any new lymph node &gt;=1.5 centimeters on any axis. Progression for PR/MR is either a &gt;=25% increase in IgM from the lowest attained response value or progression of lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, cytopenias, or other clinically significant signs/symptoms caused by WM.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Only those participants classified as responders were included in the analysis. Participants who had disease progression or death were counted as events, and other participants were censored at the date of the last adequate assessment in the study.</population>

        <time_frame>From the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1) up to 6 months after the end of the last cycle of treatment; blood collected on each dosing day, weekly up to Week 8, and every 4 weeks up to Week 24/Month 7</time_frame>

          <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated SAEs Related to Study Drug</title>
          <description>An SAE is any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (ADE; at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious ADEs when based upon appropriate medical judgment. Relatedness was based on the Investigator's medical judgement.</description>
