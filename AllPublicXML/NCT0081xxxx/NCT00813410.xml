      The study seeks to use microdialysis and microperfusion techniques to assess the feasibility
      of performing insulin delivery and glucose sensing at a single subcutaneous tissue site.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucose management in type 1 diabetic patients comprises the measurement of glucose in
      capillary blood obtained by fingersticking and administration of exogenous insulin in the
      form of a subcutaneous bolus injection or continuous subcutaneous infusion.

      The present study seeks to test an alternative treatment approach that combines glucose
      measurement and insulin delivery at a single subcutaneous tissue site, thereby circumventing
      the need for fingerstick blood glucose monitoring. Microperfusion and microdialysis probes
      are applied in type 1 diabetic subjects to perform insulin delivery and glucose sampling at
      the same adipose tissue site. The feasibility of estimating blood glucose concentrations from
      the glucose levels measured at the subcutaneous insulin delivery site is then assessed during
      an overnight fast and an oral glucose tolerance test.
