    <textblock>
      The aim of the present dose ranging study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      immunogenicity of two doses of twelve different formulations of a Cell Culture-Derived H5N1
      Subunit Influenza Virus Vaccine, adjuvanted with MF59 or non-adjuvanted, given three weeks
      apart and followed by a booster dose after 12 months in healthy adults 18 to 40 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of another investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to enrollment or before
             completion of the safety follow-up period in this or in another study; unwilling to

             before Visit 5, or within 3 weeks prior to Visit 7 or before Visit 9;

          -  Influenza vaccination for the current season within 2 months prior to enrollment
             (seasonal influenza vaccination is allowed after Visit 5, but no later than 2 months
             before the booster dose);

          -  Experience of any acute disease or infection requiring systemic antibiotic or
             antiviral therapy (chronic antibiotic therapy for urinary tract prophylaxis is
             acceptable) within 7 days prior to enrollment and prior to the booster dose or fever
             within 3 days prior to Visit 1 and Visit 7;

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or females of childbearing potential who refuse to use an
             acceptable method of birth control during the study period for at least 6 weeks
             following the booster dose; and, if sexually active, who have not used a reliable
             birth control method for at least two months prior to study entry;

          -  Any serious disease, such as: cancer; autoimmune disease; diabetes mellitus type I;
             diabetes mellitus type II; diabetes relating to genetic defects/syndromes, diseases of

          -  History of (or current) drug or alcohol abuse, surgery planned during the study period
             or any other condition that in the investigator's opinion would interfere with safety
             of the subject or the evaluation of study objectives or the visit schedule;

          -  Hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccine;
