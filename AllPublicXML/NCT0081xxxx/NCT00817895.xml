  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatectomy is still the most important treatment for HCC.High recurrence rate mostly
      influence it's prognosis, especially for the patient with tumor &gt;5cm, multiple tumor and who
      cannot accept R0 resection.Our retrospective study showed sustained released 5-FU implanted
      into the liver incisal margin after tumor was resected could reduce the recurrence rate of
      HCC after liver resection.According to this, we proceed this RCT to prospectively observe the
      effect of sustained released 5-FU,and we also want to know whether combined with sustained
      released cisplatin will get better effect in preventing the tumor recurrence,especially in
      short time after liver resection.

      150 HCC patients with tumor &gt;5cm, multiple tumor and who cannot accept R0 resection will be
      randomized divided into 3 groups. Group A (50 cases) will be implanted 600mg sustained
      released 5-FU into liver incisal margin after tumor is resected. Group B (50 cases) will be
      implanted 600mg sustained released 5-FU and 60mg sustained released cisplatin. Group C (50
      cases) will be the controlled one which will not be implanted any chemotherapeutic drugs. All
      patients will accepted TACE 30 days after liver resection. We will follow up all patients
      until they are dead or missed connected. Related adverse reaction will be recorded. Total
      survival time (TST) and disease free survival time (DFST) will be calculated too. At the end
      of the study we will compare the difference of adverse reaction, complication, TST and DFST
      between the 3 groups. According to the result we will estimate these drugs' antitumor effect
      and safety.
