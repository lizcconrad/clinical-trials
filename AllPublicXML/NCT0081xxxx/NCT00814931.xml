  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of CXB722 on neuroendocrine stress
      response and subjective reports related to mood and stress during and after experimentally
      induced stress among healthy young males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute stress produces a cascade of physiological and psychological effects, including
      increased cardiovascular function, increases in circulating levels of stress hormones and
      neurotransmitter levels, and changes in mood and subjective state. The Trier Social Stress
      Test (TSST) is a standardized, well-validated procedure that was developed in order to
      provide a controlled method for exposing subjects to a stressor. The TSST consists of a
      public speaking and a mental arithmetic test performed in the context of a mock job
      interview.

      A drug that could safely block or mitigate the stress response would have multiple
      applications in medicine, beyond treating anxiety, because stress is associated with many
      disease states, including cardiovascular disease. The drug being studied, CXB722, is thought
      to show promise in diminishing the physiologic and psychological effects of stress.
