      Experimental design overview The proposed project is a prospective experimental study design.
      independent old adults(age 65 years old and older) who do not suffer from balance problems
      willing to participate in the study will be tested with well-established measuring techniques
      of Balance control before and 2 hours after taking of Methylphenidate (Ritalin) in the
      movement and Rehabilitation Laboratory at BGU. An automated algorithm will be used to extract
      standardized stabilogram-diffusion parameters from each of the COP data sets collected during
      quiet standing. These parameters include diffusion coefficients, critical displacement,
      critical time and scaling exponents for both lateral and anterior-posterior sway directions
      (Collins &amp; De Luca, 1993). For each of the conditions (before and 1 hour after the use of
      Ritalin) in three task conditions single task; dual task (concentrating and identifying
      specific music); and just Listening to a relaxing music. Participants will be required to
      stand on the platform 10 times for 30 s. For each trial, they will be instructed to sway as
      little as possible.
