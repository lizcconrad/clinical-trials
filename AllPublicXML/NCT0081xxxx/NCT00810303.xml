  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a chronic co-medication of efavirenz
      on pharmacokinetics and sterol-lowering effects of ezetimibe at steady-state in healthy
      subjects genotyped for ABCB1, ABCC2, CYP2B6 and UGT1A1.

          <description>The maximum concentration (Cmax) were obtained directly from the measured concentration-time curves. The concentration-time curve is the result of time points of blood sampling and its measured concentration of ezetimibe glucuronide in the blood samplings.</description>
