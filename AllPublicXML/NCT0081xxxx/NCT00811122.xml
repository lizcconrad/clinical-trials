    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and
      neuronal cell loss. Amyloid plaques are believed to play an integral role in AD. Elevated
      levels of Aβ in the brain are correlated with cognitive decline.

      There are no approved ways to measure amyloid load in humans. Several compounds are under
      investigation. All of these compounds use radioactive chemical tags for positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging. The most promising compound is 11C-PIB, or Pittsburgh Compound-B.
      This compound can be injected and a PET scan performed. This allows doctors to see the
      amyloid plaques in the brain, and to use this information to look at other types of dementia
      to see if there are differences and/or similarities in the plaques.

      We will recruit a total of 30 subjects, 10 from each of the following three diagnostic
      categories: frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease, and normal volunteers. All
      subjects will be given an [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG-PET scan (if they haven't had one in
      the past) and a PIB-PET scan.

      The overall objective of this project is to study the biodistribution of 11C-PIB using PET
      imaging in normal elderly volunteers and relevant patient groups.

    <textblock>
      Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently become extremely important for a number
      of reasons: to improve diagnosis, to measure severity of disease, to measure progression of
      disease, to measure effects of novel disease-modifying drugs and to speed development of
      these novel experimental drugs by reducing time needed to follow patients, number of patients
      to be followed per study, and cost of research. (Thal, 2006, Nichols, 2006)

      The neuropathology of AD is characterized by neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and
      neuronal cell loss (Braak and Braak, 1997). Amyloid plaques are believed to play an integral
      role in AD (Selkoe, 1993). Plaques are neurotoxic (Yankner, 1989). Elevated levels of Aβ in
      the brain are correlated with cognitive decline (Naslund, 2000). Removal of plaques in animal
      models of AD results in behavioral improvements (Arendash, 2001).

      There are no approved in vivo markers of amyloid load in humans. Several compounds with
      affinity for binding amyloid in vivo are under investigation. All of these compounds use
      radioactive chemical tags for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Attempts at finding
      non-radioactive amyloid tracers are underway, but still poorly developed. The most promising
      compound is 11C-PIB. Pittsburgh Compound-B has statistically significant increased retention
      in AD cortical areas, relative to controls (P&lt;0.05). (Price, 2005) To our knowledge, 11C-PIB
      imaging has not been compared against frontotemporal dementia (FTD) controls.

      We will recruit (from our clinic population), a total of 30 subjects, 10 from each of the
      following 3 diagnostic categories: frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and normal
      volunteers. All subjects will be given an FDG-PET scan (if they haven't had one in the past)
      and a PIB-PET scan.

      Objective and Hypothesis:

      The overall objective of this project is to study the biodistribution of 11C-PIB using PET
      imaging in normal elderly volunteers and relevant patient groups. Comparison with FDG-PET is
      essential to confirm group membership and for anatomic co-registration of 11C-PIB images.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the biodistribution of 11C-PIB in AD, FTD, and cognitively normal
      elderly individuals and determine whether it reflects the distribution of amyloid plaques in
      the brain expected from postmortem studies.

      Hypothesis 1: The agent 11C-PIB has similar biodistribution outside the brain in AD, FTD, and
      cognitively normal elderly individuals.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients with AD scanned with 11C-PIB will have higher standardized uptake
      values (SUVs) than cognitively normal elderly in brain regions where beta amyloid are
      expected to be over-expressed.

      Hypothesis 3: Patients with FTD scanned with 11C-PIB will have similar standardized uptake
      values (SUVs) as cognitively normal elderly subjects and lower values than in AD subjects in
      brain regions where beta amyloid are expected in AD to be overexpressed.

      Specific Aim 2: Correlate glucose metabolism with 11C-PIB PET results.

      Hypothesis 4: Patients with a pattern of glucose hypometabolism suggestive of FTD with
      FDG-PET have 11C-PIB uptake and brain biodistribution similar to cognitively normal elderly,
      while those with a pattern of glucose hypometabolism suggestive of AD have abnormal PIB
      uptake and brain biodistribution of 11C-PIB

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All participants will be between 30-90 years old, inclusive, clinically characterized
             as having AD, having FTD, or being cognitively normal controls (NC).

          2. All subjects must be willing and able to undergo testing procedures.

          3. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine - symptomatic drugs approved for AD - will be
             allowed since these drugs are not expected to significantly affect amyloid load.

        General inclusion criteria are shown below:

          1. Normal subjects: Healthy individuals aged to match AD and FTD groups, who are
             non-depressed, non-demented, and without a complaint of memory loss. A brief
             neuropsychological test, the 3MS-R or Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, Revised
             (Tschanz et al., 2002), will be given to confirm that the subject is not cognitively
             impaired.

          2. FTD subjects: Patients seen in the University of Utah (UU) Cognitive Disorders Clinic
             (CDC) who have been clinically characterized and meet Neary criteria for
             frontotemporal dementia (Neary et al., 1998).

          3. AD subjects: Patients seen in the UU CDC who have been clinically characterized to
             meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD (McKhann et al., 1984). These criteria were
             established in 1984 for diagnosis of AD by the National Institute of Neurological and
             Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and Alzheimer's Disease and Related
             Disorders Association (ADRDA).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with medical conditions that have a high risk of associated cognitive
             symptoms such as transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, seizures, or head injury
             with loss of consciousness within five years

          2. Subjects with Axis I psychiatric diagnoses other than treated depression

          3. Subjects who are not medically stable will be excluded from the study. Examples of
             medically unstable patients include uncontrolled hypertension, heart/liver/renal
             failure, and other conditions requiring acute medical attention

          4. Subjects cannot have a serum glucose level greater than 180 mg/dl for FDG-PET imaging

          5. Subjects who are too claustrophobic to undergo FDG-PET or 11C PIB-PET imaging

          6. Subjects who require conscious sedation or anesthesia to undergo FDG-PET or 11C
             PIB-PET imaging

          7. Subjects who are unable to follow instructions to urinate after completing scanning
             procedures
