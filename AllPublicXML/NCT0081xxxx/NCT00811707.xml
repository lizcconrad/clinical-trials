  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The failure in indwelling epidural catheter for a parturient might cause an anesthetic
      difficulty. Furthermore, no one can predict the accuracy of needle placement prior to skin
      puncture with any of landmark-based technique. This may result in multiple trying attempts at
      needle puncture, pain and discomforts of patients and poor patient satisfaction. The aim of
      this study was to explore the difference of epidural space between parturient and
      non-pregnant women by assessing ultrasound image.

      We will enroll 30 non-pregnant female volunteers and 30 parturients(ASA I-III) underwent
      epidural blocks. A low frequency ultrasound (2-5 MHz) with a curved array transducer is used
      to obtain spinal sonography for each subject. The paramedian axis was used to obtain optimal
      ultrasound image for spinal sonography. Outcome was evaluated by the diameter and depth of
      epidural space at three lumbar interspaces. Paired T-test was carried out to evaluate the
      statistical significance of epidual diameter and depth.
