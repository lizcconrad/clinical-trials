  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part safety and efficacy study of SKI-606 in subjects who have Philadelphia
      chromosome positive leukemias (CML). Part 1 will be a dose-escalation study, in which an
      escalating dose of SKI-606 (Bosutinib), up to 600 mg, will be studied in subjects with
      imatinib resistant/refractory or imatinib intolerant chronic phase CML. Part 2 will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SKI-606 (Bosutinib)identified
      in Part 1 of the study.

        <description>Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on the prevalence of Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells. Major cytogenetic response was categorized as either complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) or partial cytogenetic response (PCyR).

            <description>Bosutinib 500 mg was administered orally once-daily in participants with chronic or accelerated or blast phase third-line imatinib resistant/refractory/intolerant followed by dasatinib or nilotinib resistant/refractory/intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Intra-subject dose escalation up to 600 mg was allowed for lack of efficacy.</description>

          <title>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) Rate - Part 2</title>
          <description>TTF was the interval from the date of first dose of bosutinib until the earlier date of progression or death (any cause), withdrawal from treatment owing to an AE, subject refusal, or loss to follow-up (censored at the last contact date), or further anti-tumor therapy before documented progression (whichever occurred first). TTF rate indicates the probability of no treatment failure. Percent of participants with no treatment failure were estimated.</description>

Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from death case report forms (CRFs). Percent of participants with PFS were estimated.</description>
