      Anti-TNF therapy induces intestinal wall remodeling that correlates with clinical response
      and can be detected in patients undergoing serial computed tomography enterography (CTE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will retrospectively identify Crohn's disease patients who underwent serial CTE imaging
      between 2004 and 2008. Approximately 4500 CTEs were performed over this period. We estimate a
      sample size of 50 Crohn's disease patients who have had CTE performed before and after
      infliximab therapy was initiated. We will analyze each CTE for the presence of penetrating
      disease, number of inflammatory lesion, length of each lesion, and severity of each lesion
      (degree of enhancement, wall thickness, stratification, vascular engorgement, fatty
      proliferation, and symmetry). Degree of enhancement and thickness will be graded on a 5-point
      scale. Stratification, vascular engorgement, fatty proliferation, and symmetry will be
      treated as dichotomous variables (yes/no). Only small bowel lesions will be described. A GI
      radiologist (JGF), blinded to the clinical information and previous imaging results, will
      provide the readings. Comparisons between CTEs will be performed to determine responders (all
      lesions improved), mixed responders (not all lesions improved), and refractory (no lesion
      improved). A descriptive pattern of healing will also be recorded for each lesion. Clinical
      data to be recorded include indication for CTE, time between CTE, dates of each CTE, date on
      first infliximab infusion, dose of infliximab, interval between infusions, history of
      penetrating disease, history of surgery, clinical status at imaging (remission, flare, or
      uncertain), medication usage, age, and disease duration. Clinical status at time of imaging
      will be based on the ordering clinician's global assessment at the time of repeat CTE. This
      will be determined by a review of the medical record by a gastroenterologist (DHB).
