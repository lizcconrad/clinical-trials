        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma
             that is unresectable or metastatic. At least one uni-dimensionally measurable lesion
             (on spiral CT scan)

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Serum aspartate transaminase (AST) serum alanine transaminase (ALT) £ 2.5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN), or AST and ALT £ 5 x ULN if liver function abnormalities are
             due to underlying malignancy

          -  Total serum bilirubin £ 2 x ULN

          -  lipase within normal limits (1.5x ULN)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/uL (1.5 x 109/L)

          -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/uL

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

          -  Serum creatinine £ 1.5 x ULN or calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min

          -  CA19-9 level ≥ 37 U/ml

          -  Normal ECG

          -  Signed and dated informed consent document indicating that the subject (or legally
             acceptable representative) has been informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial
             prior to enrolment

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory
             tests, and other trial procedures

          -  Life expectancy, in the opinion of the investigator, &gt; 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BP &lt; 100 (systolic)

          -  History of uncontrolled renal disease, pancreatitis, or diabetes mellitus

          -  Peripheral sensory neuropathy (&gt; Grade 1, as per NCI CTCAE version 3.0)

          -  Concomitant therapy with other investigational agents or participation in another
             clinical trial within the previous 3 months.

          -  Any of the following conditions: Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE grade ≥ 2;
             atrial fibrillation of any grade; QTc interval &gt;450 msec for males or &gt;470 msec for
             females or uncontrolled intercurrent illness, e.g., unstable angina; severe coronary
             disease, ventricular arrhythmias, bradycardia &lt;50 bpm

          -  Active uncontrolled bacterial infection

          -  Concurrent use of drugs that could prolong QT interval

          -  Concurrent use of nephrotoxic drugs, including aminoglycosides, ampho B, foscarnet,
             cidofovir

          -  Concurrent use of drugs that may be associated with pancreatitis

          -  Concurrent active cancer originating from a primary site other than pancreas or
             history of cancer &lt; 3 years except for skin superficial bladder, uterus etc

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to pentamidine

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding. All female patients with reproductive potential must have
             a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to first dose of study medication.

          -  Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality
             that would impart, in the judgement of the investigator, excess risk associated with
             trial participation of study drug administration, or which in the judgement of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  On oral anticoagulants (LMWH is acceptable)
