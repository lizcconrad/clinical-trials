      Studies show that depression is a risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease
      (CAD). Furthermore there is an increased occurrence of depression in patients with CAD. Among
      other mechanisms atherosclerosis is believed to play a central role regarding these notable
      associations between depression and CAD. Moreover, patients with late onset major depression
      have an increased number of small lesions found in the white matter of the brain, the
      so-called white matter lesions. The main goal of this project is to examine if CAD is
      associated with depression and/or white matter lesions. CAD is evaluated using coronary CT
      angiography. Depression is evaluated using a semi-structured diagnostic interview. White
      matter lesions are quantified using cerebral magnetic resonance.
