  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of Neofusetm in
      subjects with a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease (DDD) in 1 or 2 adjacent vertebral
      levels between L1 and S1 and undergoing posterolateral lumbar fusion.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label controlled Phase 1b/2a study
      designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MPCs combined with MasterGraft
      Granules when compared to use of autologous bone graft in the posterolateral fusion site in
      subjects requiring interbody fusion in combination with instrumented 1 or 2 level PLF
      procedure. All subjects in this study will undergo a 1 or 2-level (2 or 3 vertebrae)
      interbody fusion without the use of the investigational product.

      In addition to the interbody fusion procedure, subjects will undergo an instrumented
      posterolateral fusion. NeoFuse plus MasterGraft Granules at one of three doses or autograft
      will be implanted in the posterolateral lumbar fusion site(s) only.

      After the screening and surgical visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically and
      radiographically within 3 days and 30 days after surgery, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after
      surgery.

      Subjects will be evaluated at 24 and 36 months after surgery for safety.
