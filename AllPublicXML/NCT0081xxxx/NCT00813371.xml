  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early initiation of Airway Pressure Release Ventilation in multi-system trauma patients
      decreases the incidence and severity of acute lung injury and Acute Respiratory Distress
      Syndrome and allows faster recovery of lung function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Trauma patients age 16 or older

          -  Trauma patients requiring ventilatory support within 48 hours of injury

          -  Those with anticipated ventilatory support ≥ 24 hours

          -  Subject or authorized representative (AR) has signed an informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Subjects age 16 or 17 who have signed an assent document and/or AR has signed an ICF

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant chronic lung disease defined as lung pathology requiring home O2 use

          -  Chronic heart disease defined as NYHC III or higher

          -  Persistent bronchopulmonary air leak

          -  Contraindications to permissive hypercapnia (ex. Intracerebral bleeding, brain tumor,
             fulminant hepatic failure, and hemodynamic instability)

          -  Pulmonary artery occlusion pressures ≥ 18 mmHg

          -  Severe neurologic injury that may prevent the patient from having a reasonable
             opportunity for weaning as determined by the clinical study team

          -  Immuno-compromised patients secondary to drugs or disease

          -  Neuromuscular disease that impairs ability to ventilate spontaneously (ex. Spinal
             injury at or above C5, ALS, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis)

          -  History of pneumonectomy

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Burns with TBSA ≥ 20%

          -  Acute MI as the cause of ALI/ARDS

          -  All other contraindications to APRV

          -  Patients who cannot be randomized within 12 hours of intubation
