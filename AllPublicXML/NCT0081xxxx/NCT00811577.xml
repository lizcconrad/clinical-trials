    <measure>Differences Among the 3 Dosage Groups in the Patient (PSAS) and Observer (OSAS) Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy was based on the difference between mean POSAS scores of placebo and 3 mg AZX100, and placebo and 10 mg AZX100 12 months after shoulder surgery. Three trocar sites were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg or AZX100 10 mg or placebo at 9 days and 21 days after shoulder surgery. PSAS results included patients' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin or no complaints and 10 was the worst imaginable scar or the worst difference) for the following: Is the scar painful? Is the scar itching? Is the color of the scar different? Is the scar more stiff? Is the thickness of the scar different? Is the scar irregular? The possible minimum score was 6 and the maximum (worst) score was 60. OSAS results included observers' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin and 10 was the worst scar imaginable) for vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability. The possible minimum score was 5 and the possible maximum (worst) score was 50.</description>

    <measure>Between-group Mean Differences in Visual Analog Scale Scores Rated by Independent Blinded Raters Using 3D Photography</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three trocar sites were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm or AZX100 10 mg/cm or saline placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days after surgery. Twelve months after surgery, images of the trocar sites were longitudinally evaluated and rated using a standard 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) by two blinded independent dermatologists, with 0 being normal skin and 100 being the worst scar imaginable. Efficacy was based on the difference between VAS scores of placebo and 3 mg AZX100 and placebo and 10 mg AZX100 for each of the two raters separately. Data from both raters was not combined.</description>

    <measure>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Via 3D Photography (Elevation, Length, Width)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three trocar sites designated as anterior, lateral and posterior were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm or AZX100 10 mg/cm or placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days following shoulder surgery. 3D digital photography of each trocar scar was used to calculate scar length, width, minimum elevation, and maximum elevation in millimeters (mm) at 12 months. The minimum elevation value was calculated as the lowest point of the scar below the interpolated smooth skin surface. This was always a negative number. Negative values (closer to zero) were more desirable. The maximum elevation value was the highest point of the scar above the interpolated smooth skin surface. A smaller value was preferred.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Via 3D Photography (Volume)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three trocar sites designated as anterior, lateral and posterior were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm, or AZX100 10 mg/cm, or placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days following shoulder surgery. 3D digital photography of each trocar scar was used to calculate positive volume, negative volume, and total volume in millimeters cubed (mm^3) at 12 months. Positive volume included the scar volume that was calculated to be above the interpolated smooth skin surface. A smaller value was preferred. Negative volume included the volume of the scar calculated to be below the interpolated smooth skin surface. It was always a negative number; negative values (closer to zero) were more desirable. Total volume was calculated as the sum of positive volume and the absolute value of negative volume. Smaller values were more desirable.</description>

    <measure>Histological Evaluation of Collagen</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three trocar sites designated as anterior, lateral and posterior were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm or AZX100 10 mg/cm or placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days following shoulder surgery. A skin punch biopsy was taken of each trocar site at 12 months. The specimens were blindly scored in duplicate by a dermal pathologist for dermal collagen fiber density, maturity and orientation, where 0% was completely normal and 100% was completely abnormal.</description>

    <measure>Histological Evaluation of Number of Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin Cells</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three trocar sites designated as anterior, lateral and posterior were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm or AZX100 10 mg/cm or placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days following shoulder surgery. A skin punch biopsy was taken of each trocar site at 12 months. For exploratory purposes, the specimens were blindly scored in duplicate by a dermal pathologist for the estimated number of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive cells per high powered field. Values ranged from 0 to several hundred. The number of α-SMA cells was assessed for exploratory purposes; therefore, at the time of this report, it was not known whether it was better to have a low or high α-SMA score.</description>

        <title>Differences Among the 3 Dosage Groups in the Patient (PSAS) and Observer (OSAS) Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) Scores</title>
        <description>Efficacy was based on the difference between mean POSAS scores of placebo and 3 mg AZX100, and placebo and 10 mg AZX100 12 months after shoulder surgery. Three trocar sites were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg or AZX100 10 mg or placebo at 9 days and 21 days after shoulder surgery. PSAS results included patients' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin or no complaints and 10 was the worst imaginable scar or the worst difference) for the following: Is the scar painful? Is the scar itching? Is the color of the scar different? Is the scar more stiff? Is the thickness of the scar different? Is the scar irregular? The possible minimum score was 6 and the maximum (worst) score was 60. OSAS results included observers' ratings on a scale of 1-10 (1 was normal skin and 10 was the worst scar imaginable) for vascularization, pigmentation, thickness, relief, and pliability. The possible minimum score was 5 and the possible maximum (worst) score was 50.</description>
        <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
        <population>The efficacy analysis was based on patient data from the AZX100/Placebo cohort (i.e., not including the patients receiving placebo-only). In the ITT sample for the POSAS outcomes, available sample sizes were 122 at Day 42 and 113 at Month 12 (including 4 subjects who withdrew from the study but were still followed for safety until Month 12).</population>

        <description>Three trocar sites were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm or AZX100 10 mg/cm or saline placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days after surgery. Twelve months after surgery, images of the trocar sites were longitudinally evaluated and rated using a standard 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) by two blinded independent dermatologists, with 0 being normal skin and 100 being the worst scar imaginable. Efficacy was based on the difference between VAS scores of placebo and 3 mg AZX100 and placebo and 10 mg AZX100 for each of the two raters separately. Data from both raters was not combined.</description>

The minimum elevation value was calculated as the lowest point of the scar below the interpolated smooth skin surface. This was always a negative number.

          <title>Between-group Mean Differences in Objective Measures Via 3D Photography (Volume)</title>
          <description>Three trocar sites designated as anterior, lateral and posterior were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm, or AZX100 10 mg/cm, or placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days following shoulder surgery. 3D digital photography of each trocar scar was used to calculate positive volume, negative volume, and total volume in millimeters cubed (mm^3) at 12 months. Positive volume included the scar volume that was calculated to be above the interpolated smooth skin surface. A smaller value was preferred. Negative volume included the volume of the scar calculated to be below the interpolated smooth skin surface. It was always a negative number; negative values (closer to zero) were more desirable. Total volume was calculated as the sum of positive volume and the absolute value of negative volume. Smaller values were more desirable.</description>
          <population>Efficacy analysis was based on patient data from the AZX100/Placebo cohort (i.e., not including patients receiving placebo-only). In the ITT sample for the scar objective measures, available sample sizes were 122 at Day 42 and 113 at Month 12 (including four subjects who withdrew from the study but were still followed for safety until Month 12).</population>

        <title>Histological Evaluation of Number of Alpha Smooth Muscle Actin Cells</title>
        <description>Three trocar sites designated as anterior, lateral and posterior were randomized on each patient to receive AZX100 3 mg/cm or AZX100 10 mg/cm or placebo/cm at 9 days and 21 days following shoulder surgery. A skin punch biopsy was taken of each trocar site at 12 months. For exploratory purposes, the specimens were blindly scored in duplicate by a dermal pathologist for the estimated number of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) positive cells per high powered field. Values ranged from 0 to several hundred. The number of α-SMA cells was assessed for exploratory purposes; therefore, at the time of this report, it was not known whether it was better to have a low or high α-SMA score.</description>
