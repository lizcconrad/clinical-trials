      Hypothesis To investigate whether telephone counselling by nurse educator between clinic
      visits with particular emphasis on adherence to medications and lifestyle modification in
      patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes will reduce mortality and hospitalisation
      rates due to cardiovascular events compared to usual clinic-based care.

      Study-design A 2-year multicentre, randomised controlled open study involving 5 HA hospitals
      in Hong Kong.

      Subjects and method One thousand two hundred and sixteen patients admitted to hospital with
      principle diagnosis of coronary heart disease and known or newly confirmed diabetes on oral
      glucose tolerance test will be enrolled. Patients in the intervention arm (n=608) will
      receive telephone intervention between clinic visits by diabetes nurse educator using
      structured counselling tools with particular emphasis on adherence to lifestyle modification
      and medications as well as self-monitoring of blood glucose, blood pressure and body weight.
      Patients in control group (n=608) will not receive telephone intervention. Both groups will
      be followed up by their usual medical teams in their hospitals upon discharge.

      Clinical endpoints Primary endpoint is the composite of death and/or cardiovascular related
      hospitalisations. Secondary endpoints include hospitalisations due to cardiovascular events,
      number of hospital admissions, total number of days of hospital stay and attendance at the
      Accident and Emergency Department.
