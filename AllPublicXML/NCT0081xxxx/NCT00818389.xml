  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of lithium combined with riluzole
      to riluzole combined with placebo in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder that results in
      progressive wasting and paralysis of voluntary muscles.

      In this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, researchers will
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug lithium given in combination with riluzole,
      a drug commonly used to treat ALS, compared to a placebo given in combination with riluzole.

      Approximately 250 participants will be recruited from multiple centers, in the US and Canada,
      that belong to the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and the Canadian ALS Clinical Trials and
      Research Network (CALS). Enrollment will occur in stages. Initially 84 participants will be
      enrolled in the trial. An interim analysis using available data will occur after the 84th
      participant is enrolled. During this time, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
      appointed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) may decide to stop the trial for
      efficacy or futility reasons or to stop enrollment and request that follow-up continue with
      the 84 participants already enrolled in the trial, or the DSMB may decide to continue
      enrollment.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two arms of the study. Arm one will receive lithium
      and riluzole. Arm two will receive riluzole and placebo (an inactive substance). All
      participants will be receiving riluzole. After screening and randomization, participants will
      be followed every 4 weeks for the first 12 weeks. Subsequent in-person visits will occur
      every 8 weeks with a final visit at week 52. Between in-person visits, telephone interviews
      will take place every 4 weeks to administer the Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis Functional
      Rating Scale—Revised (ALSFRS-R) questionnaire. A follow-up telephone interview will occur at
      week 56 (off study medication) to review adverse events. The primary outcome measure is
      disease progression as measured by the ALSFRS-R questionnaire. Participants randomized to
      placebo whose disease progresses will be crossed over to lithium for the remaining period of
      the study (up to 52 weeks total).

      Duration of the study for participants is 56 weeks which includes 52 weeks of treatment and a
      followup telephone interview at week 56.

    <description>ALSFRS-R is a self-administered ordinal rating scale questionnaire (rating 0-4 for each question,4 is most functional,0-48 total)of 12 functional activities. The most functional total score is 48. ALSFRS-R done at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 &amp; 52, dependent on enrollment duration. Number of subjects who failed by treatment group was evaluated. Failure was defined as 6-point drop in ALSFRS-R or death from baseline.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between January 2009 to June 2009, 97 patients were screened and 84 subjects were randomized at 21 clinical sites; 11 in the United States and 10 in Canada. All sites were members of the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and/or the Canadian ALS Consortium (CALS).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients were required to be on a stable dose of riluzole for at least 30 days prior to screening. 13 subjects failed screening: 3 due to low lung function test results, 3 due to prohibited medications,3 due to study closure, 2 due to abnormal lab test results and 1 due to death unrelated to the study.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Lithium + Riluzole</title>
          <description>Subjects randomized to lithium + riluzole were required to be taking riluzole 50 milligrams (mg) twice per day at least 30 days prior to the screening visit and during the trial. Lithium carbonate and matching placebo were supplied in 150 mg capsules. Dosing started at 450 mg/day (1 capsule taken in the a.m. and 2 capsules taken in the p.m.), titrated to maintain plasma lithium levels of 0.4 - 0.8 milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L). The number of capsules taken per day was titrated individually for each patient based on blood testing to maintain plasma levels of lithium = 04. - 0.8 milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L).</description>

Matching placebo was supplied in 150 mg capsules. Dosing started at 450 mg/day (1 capsule in the a.m. and 2 capsules in the p.m). Paired sham dosage modifications were made for placebo subjects, i.e. all subjects randomized to placebo were 'paired' with a lithium subject and underwent identical dosage changes to maintain blinding.</description>

          <description>ALSFRS-R is an ordinal rating scale questionnaire (rating 0-4) used to determine subject's assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities (i.e. this is a patient-reported questionnaire scale of disability). Each question has a rating of 0-4 with 4 being the most functional and 0 being the least functional. The most functional total score is 48.</description>

          <description>Participants randomized to placebo + riluzole were required to be taking riluzole 50 milligrams (mg) twice per day at least 30 days prior to the screening visit and during the trial. Matching placebo was supplied in 150 mg capsules. Dosing started at 450 mg/day (1 capsule in the a.m. and 2 capsules in the p.m). Paired sham dosage modifications were made for placebo subjects, i.e. all subjects randomized to placebo were 'paired' with a lithium subject and underwent identical dosage changes to maintain blinding.</description>
