  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data on preventive therapy in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy
      (BMD) affected individuals without cardiac involvement are very limited and currently lacking
      regard both ACE-inhibitors and Beta-Blockers in Becker Muscular Dystrophy and for the latter
      even in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients. Thus, the study aim is to compare the efficacy
      of carvedilol vs ramipril on myocardial tissue properties and heart function, performing CMR
      and myocardial Ultrasound Tissue Characterisation analysis.

      This protocol represent an open randomized and prospective trial, designed to answer the
      specific question regarding the role of the cardioprotective therapy in Duchenne Muscular
      Dystrophy and Becker Muscular Dystrophy patients. In this light, CMR could provide relevant
      data, reinforcing the scientific background, to start early (particularly in BMD patients in
      whom this is still a debated question) a cardioprotective treatment with carvedilol or
      ramipril.Finally,this clinical trial will clarify whether a preventive therapy may be helpful
      on the clinical outcome, both in reducing myocardial fibrosis and preventing the progression
      towards the cardiomyopathy.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Immunohystochemical and molecular diagnosis of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.

          2. Not evidence of clinical cardiomyopathy,normal 2D-echocardiography with normal
             systolic,WMSI = 1) and diastolic function.

          3. DMD patients treated with steroid therapy.

          4. All DMD and BMD patients are not treated with cardiological therapy (ACE-inhibitors,
             ARBs or Beta-Blockers).

          5. Written informed consent to study participation (with serial visit, CMR and
             echocardiographic study) is required from all patients themselves, as well as their
             parent or guardian and healthy-control subjects.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Failure to obtain informed consent from patients, parents or guardians.

          2. Any controindications to carvedilol or ramipril treatment (bronchial asthma, diabetes,
             any degree of renal failure (all patients are required to have a normal creatinine
             level and clearance).

          3. in BMD patients ECG changes suggestive of ischemic heart disease, left bundle-branch
             block, atrial flutter/fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, any degree of
             atrioventricular block and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Aspecific ST changes
             will be not considered as electrocardiographic exclusion criteria both in DMD and BMD
             patients.

          4. In BMD patients exclusion criteria will be also hypertension and valvular heart
             disease other than trivial.

          5. DMD and BMD patients requiring ventilatory (non-invasive or invasive) assistance.

          6. Presence of systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction detected by 2D-Echocardiography.

          7. Presence of any contraindications to CMR (including any history of claustrophobia).

          8. Patients under the age of 2 years.

          9. Renal failure, even mild.

         10. Patient unable or unwilling to attend the follow-up and tests, in the opinion of local
             study principal investigator, (children not willing to perform CMR will not be
             enrolled).
