      The purpose of this study is to see if IPI-504 in combination with trastuzamab is an
      effective treatment in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical data has demonstrated that even in heavily pretreated patients with
      trastuzumab-refractory HER-2 positive breast cancer, targeting HER2 is efficacious.

      IPI-504 is an HSP90 inhibitor and is chemically related to 17-AAG and it has been studied in
      a clinical trial in combination with trastuzamab and a response rate of 26% (7/27) was
      demonstrated in patients with pretreated, HER2-positive breast cancer. These data provide a
      strong scientific rationale for clinical testing of IPI-504 plus trastuzumab in patients with
      pretreated, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer

    <description>IPI-504 IV infusion 300 mg/m2 once weekly in combination with trastuzumab infusion every 3 weeks. (Continuous schedule)
Three week cycle with IPI-504 twice per week for 2 weeks and trastuzumab once per cycle followed by one week without treatment.
Trastuzumab IV infusion 8 mg/kg as the first dose of trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Subjects whose last dose of trastuzumab was &lt;4 weeks prior to study entry will receive 6 mg/kg as the first dose of trastuzumab. For all additional cycles in Stage 1, trastuzumab will be administered with the first dose of IPI-504.
IPI-504 and trastuzumab will be administered for all cycles. Until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops.</description>
