    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female subjects between the ages of 21 and 55 years, inclusive
             (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination, including blood pressure (BP) and pulse
             rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests);

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of approximately 18 to 32 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg
             (110 lbs). A BMI lower limit of 17.5kg/m2 may be rounded up to 18.0 kg/m2, a BMI upper
             limit of 32.5 kg/m2 may be rounded down to 32.0 kg/m2 and will be acceptable for
             inclusion;

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the trial;

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other trial procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing);

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen;

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor), within 6 months of screening;

          -  Use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products in excess of the equivalent of 5
             cigarettes per day;

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives preceding the
             first dose of study medication;

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility;

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use an acceptable method of non-hormonal contraception, as outlined in this
             protocol, from at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication until
             completion of follow-up procedures;

          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal
             supplements and hormonal methods of contraception (including oral and transdermal
             contraceptives, injectable progesterone, progestin subdermal implants,
             progesterone-releasing IUDs, postcoital contraceptive methods) and hormone replacement
             therapy must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.
             Depo-ProveraÂ® must be discontinued at least 6 months prior to the first dose of study
             medication. As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of less
             than or equal to 1 g/day. Limited use of non-prescription medications that are not
             believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted
             on a case-by-case basis following approval by the sponsor;

          -  Use of grapefruit containing products within at least 7 days prior to the
             administration of study medication;

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing;

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia;

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol;

          -  Subjects who have pre-existing asthma, a known hypersensitivity to celecoxib, or have
             experienced asthma, urticaria or allergic-type reactions after taking sulfonamides,
             aspirin, selective COX-2 inhibitors, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs);

          -  Subjects with a prior history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding;

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
