  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence rate to screening colonoscopy (TC) in the average-risk general population is still
      unclear. Aim of this study was to compare the uptake of TC screening with that of fecal
      occult blood (FOBT) in the general population of different Italian areas.

    <textblock>
      A nationwide, population-based, multicenter, randomized trial comparing attendance to TC with
      that to FOBT was performed. Sixty-four general practitioners (GPs), overall including in
      their lists 9,889 average-risk subjects aged 55-64 years, were randomized between TC and FOBT
      screening programs. Eligible subjects were mailed a personal invitation letter co-signed by
      their GP and the coordinator of the area-reference GI centre. Attendance rate and detection
      rate for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer, adenoma &gt;10 mm or with villous histology or
      high-grade dysplasia) for each arm of the study were assessed.
