      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as lymphokine-activated killer cells, may stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as Gliadel wafer, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known
      whether lymphokine-activated killer cells are more effective than Gliadel wafer in treating
      patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well
      lymphokine-activated killer cells work compared with Gliadel wafer in treating patients with
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To compare the side effects, including infections and/or abnormal healing at the surgery
           site, associated with intralesional lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells vs
           polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implant (Gliadel® wafer) as consolidation therapy for
           patients with newly diagnosed resectable glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  To compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (&lt; 50 vs ≥ 50 years of age), Karnofsky
      performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%), use of corticosteroids &gt; 4 mg/day (yes vs no), and
      progressive disease during first-line therapy (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo intracranial placement of polifeprosan 20 with carmustine
           implant (Gliadel® wafer) at the time of therapeutic craniotomy.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo leukapheresis to obtain autologous lymphokine-activated killer
           (LAK) cells, followed 3-7 days later by therapeutic craniotomy. The autologous LAK cells
           are then instilled into the tumor bed cavity at the time of therapeutic craniotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.
