  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is based on the hypothesis that access to smoking cessation treatment (SCT)
      reimbursement may significantly increase the number of successful quitters in a population of
      smokers motivated to quit by: 1) increasing the use of SCTs in quit attempts, and 2) by
      improving subject adherence to treatment.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 7-Day Point Prevalence (PP) of Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who self-reported tobacco abstinence for the previous 7 days (7-day PP) with a negative response to the following questions: &quot;Have you smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days?&quot; and &quot;Have you used any nicotine-containing product (such as chew, snuff, pipe, cigar) other than a Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) (smoking cessation treatment [SCT]) in the last 7 days?&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Biochemically Confirmed 7-Day PP Abstinence From Tobacco</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>PP tobacco abstinence was adjudicated if the following conditions were met:(a) self-reported tobacco abstinence for the previous 7 days with a negative response to the questions &quot;Have you smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days?&quot; and &quot;Have you used any nicotine-containing product (such as chew, snuff, pipe, cigar) other than an NRT (SCT) in the last 7 days?&quot; confirmed by negative urine cotinine test results (defined as cotinine levels less than [&lt;]200 nanograms per milliliter [ng/mL]).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Continuous Abstinence (CA) at Weeks 26, 39, and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26, Week 39, and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>CA from smoking was adjudicated if the following conditions were met:(a) self-reported continuous tobacco abstinence during the defined time point with a negative response to the questions &quot;Have you smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) since the last contact/visit?&quot; at every visit from Week 26 through Week 52 (Weeks 26, 39, and 52) and &quot;Have you used any nicotine-containing product (such as chew, snuff, pipe, cigar) other than an NRT (SCT) since the last contact/visit?&quot; and (b) urine cotinine test results were neither positive (greater than or equal to [≥]200 ng/mL) nor missing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With 7-Day PP of Abstinence at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>PP tobacco abstinence was adjudicated if the participant self-reported tobacco abstinence for the previous 7 days with a negative response to the following questions: &quot;Have you smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days?&quot; and &quot;Have you used any nicotine-containing product (such as chew, snuff, pipe, cigar) other than a NRT (SCT) in the last 7 days?&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Long Term Quit Rate (LTQR) Through Weeks 26 to 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26 to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>LTQR was adjudicated if the following conditions were met: the participant self-reported tobacco abstinence for the previous 7 days with a negative response to the following questions: &quot;Have you smoked any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days?&quot; and &quot;Have you used any nicotine-containing product (such as chew, snuff, pipe, cigar) other than a NRT (SCT) in the last 7 days?&quot; and had no more than 6 cumulative days of using nicotine containing products from Weeks 26 to 52</description>

    <description>This is a pragmatic study in which the intervention is a health policy (SCT reimbursement). Champix (varenicline), Zyban (bupropion) and NRTs (nicotine replacement therapies; patches, gums) are SCT eligible for reimbursement. Prescriptions will be issued as per the most recent version of the Product Monograph of the prescribed SCT or equivalent.</description>

    <description>None of the subjects recruited in the study have access to SCT reimbursement in real-life. As such, subjects randomized to the control group represent lack of SCT coverage in real-life and are considered to receive standard of care for smoking cessation.</description>
