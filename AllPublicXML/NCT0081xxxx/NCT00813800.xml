  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with bipolar disorder have one of the highest rates of nicotine dependence and one
      of the lowest quit rates. Varenicline has been shown in previous trials to be effective for
      smoking cessation, but has not been studied in subjects with bipolar disorder. This 12-week
      open label trial will be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of
      varenicline in bipolar depressed smokers, given in addition to the subject's primary
      treatment for bipolar disorder. The primary study hypothesis was that the abstinence rate for
      bipolar depressed patients will be 50%.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Varenicline, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, has been shown in two
      placebo-controlled trials to be efficacious for smoking cessation. Given the high prevalence
      of nicotine dependence in bipolar disorder and the high prevalence of sub-syndromal and
      syndromal depressive symptoms in bipolar disorder, this 12-week adjunctive varenicline open
      label trial will be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of
      varenicline in bipolar depressed smokers. All subjects will receive individual behavioral
      counseling.

      Primary hypothesis: the abstinence rate for bipolar depressed patients will be 50%. Secondary
      hypothesis: At final visit, bipolar depressed patients who have achieved remission, defined
      as a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) &lt;8, will have a higher rate of tobacco
      abstinence than depressed patients who did not achieve remission (MADRS &gt;/= 8).

    <description>MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item on the MADRS is scaled 0 through 6. Lowest score = 0, would indicate no depressive symptoms. Highest score = 60, indicating extreme depression. MADRS score &gt; 20 is syndromal depression.

    <description>YMRS is an eleven-item, multiple choice diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of manic episodes in patients already diagnosed with mania. Lowest score = 0, normal subject; Highest score = 60, highly manic subject. For this scale the following scores are associated with these grades of severity: mania (YMRS = 20), hypomania (YMRS = 12), under 5 is classified as non-manic.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 -65 years

          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder type I or II and nicotine dependence

          -  DSM-IV confirmed current major depressive episode OR current depressive symptoms
             defined as MADRS &gt; 4 &amp; &lt;20

          -  Smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day

          -  Fagerström Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score of 5 or higher

          -  Agree to identify collateral individuals for contact purposes to facilitate follow-up
             appointments

          -  Currently on mood stabilization treatment. A minimum daily therapeutic dosage of at
             least one mood stabilizer, and on the same dose for at least 2 weeks:

               -  Lithium (0.6-1.2 mEq/L or 900 mg), Valproate (50-125 mg/mL or 1000 mg),
                  Carbamazepine (4-12 mg/mL or 800 mg), Oxcarbazepine 1200 mg, Lamotrigine 100 mg,
                  Olanzapine 10mg, Risperidone 2mg, Quetiapine 300mg, Ziprasidone 40mg,
                  Aripiprazole 7.5 mg

               -  Antidepressants are not exclusionary.

               -  Topiramate is an acceptable mood stabilization treatment. There is an evidence
                  base (Delbello et al. 2005) highlighting efficacy of topiramate monotherapy for
                  acute mania in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder type 1.

        [Mood stabilizers are a standard American Psychiatric Association (APA) treatment
        guidelines for Bipolar I disorder (history of mania). While the guidelines for Bipolar II
        disorder are unclear (history of hypomania), we feel mood stabilization provides
        standardization of treatment and maximizes safety (ie: preventing switch from depression to
        mania or hypomania).]

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  DSM-IV dependence for a substance other than nicotine or caffeine within past 3
             months.

          -  DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia or other non-affective psychotic disorder

          -  Psychotic symptoms within the past month

          -  Active suicidality as measured by screening questions from the Columbia-Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS

          -  History of medically serious suicide attempt as reviewed by doctor.

          -  Current use (past 30 days) of other smoking cessation treatments

          -  Pregnant or nursing women, or women who refuse to use adequate birth control

          -  Serious, active or unstable medical condition

          -  Individuals, in the investigators opinion, unable to comply with study procedures

          -  Inability to provide written informed consent in English

          -  Allergic reaction to varenicline

          -  Individuals who are on dialysis or have a history of kidney disease (varenicline is
             excreted 96% unchanged through the kidneys) or Creatine supplementation or current
             anticipated daily NSAID use

          -  Presence of a personality disorder, that upon review of the medical record, appears to
             be the primary reason for psychiatric care.

          <title>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</title>
          <description>MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item on the MADRS is scaled 0 through 6. Lowest score = 0, would indicate no depressive symptoms. Highest score = 60, indicating extreme depression. MADRS score &gt; 20 is syndromal depression.
