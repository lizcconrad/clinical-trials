  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The embolisation of fat and bone marrow during long bone instrumentation is a well-known
      complication of major joint replacement surgery. Clinically significant venous thromboembolic
      disease, cardiopulmonary dysfunction,cerebral emboli, and death have all been described.
      Because the intravasation of medullary contents is caused by increased pressure during canal
      instrumentation, the use of the Synthes RIA (Reamer-Irrigator-Aspirator), a negative
      pressure-irrigated high-speed reamer, may result in a lower incidence of embolism.

      This controlled clinical trial will evaluate the utility of the RIA in reducing the frequency
      and severity of embolic events as detected by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography
      (TEE) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery.

      Patients scheduled to undergo total knee replacement surgery will be randomized to receive
      reaming with either the Synthes RIA (intervention group) or standard reamer (control group).
      All subjects will undergo intraoperative monitoring with transesophageal echocardiography and
      transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Both intraoperative and postoperative oxygen saturation
      levels will be monitored and recorded for evidence of hypoxemia. Subjects will be evaluated
      for evidence of thrombogenesis and systemic inflammation both preoperatively and at selected
      postoperative intervals.

    <description>During knee replacement surgery, the study anesthesiologist will place probes for the transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and the transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD). In patients randomized to the RIA group (Arm A), surgery performed by the investigating orthopaedic surgeon will be done according to standard of care guidelines up until femoral reaming. These patients will receive reaming with RIA. The remainder of the surgery will also be done according to the standard of care. TEE and TCD data will be recorded throughout the surgery.</description>
