  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether we can predict which patients with depression
      will get better when we treat them with psychodynamic psychotherapy. We will use neuroimaging
      (a method of looking at brain activity) in this study. We want to see whether there are
      changes in the brains of patients receiving this type of therapy. We hypothesize that these
      changes may predict how well certain parts of the psychotherapy treatment process works.

      In this study, we will treat patients with brief psychodynamic psychotherapy. Psychodynamic
      psychotherapy is a type of treatment that may be as helpful as medications in treating
      depression. It focuses on thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as both current and past
      relationships. Psychotherapy explores better ways of coping with feelings, expressing needs,
      and interacting with others in order to cope with depression and other life problems.
      Subjects will go to 16 weekly, 45-minute, individual sessions of psychodynamic psychotherapy
      over the course of the study. At five times throughout the study, subjects will come in for
      extra visits, which last approximately 1.5 hours and which include: speaking with a study
      doctor about depressive symptoms, filling out extra questionnaires, and performing positron
      emission tomography (PET)and a Quantitative Electroencephalogram (QEEG). The QEEG is a
      machine that measures the electrical activity of the brain. This task will take approximately
      15 minutes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be adults, ages 18 to 60 years;

             for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV);

          -  QIDS-SR score of &gt;= 12 at screen;

          -  Current major depressive episode (MDE) length of &lt; 5 year;

          -  Treated with an SSRI, SNRI, or bupropion at adequate doses (defined as 20 mg/day or
             more of fluoxetine, citalopram, or paroxetine; 10 mg/day or more of escitalopram; 50
             mg/day or more of sertraline; 75 mg/day or more of venlafaxine; 15 mg/day of
             mirtazapine; or 40 mg/day of duloxetine; or 100mg/day of bupropion(wellbutrin)) during
             the current episode for at least 8 weeks; and,

          -  At the time of screen visit, patients must be on a stable dose of SSRI, SNRI, or
             bupropion for the past 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or women of child bearing potential who are not using a medically
             accepted means of contraception (to include oral contraceptive or implant, condom,
             diaphragm, spermicide, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, or a partner with
             vasectomy). Women of childbearing age who wish to enter the study will be required to
             undergo a pregnancy test (beta-HCG) prior to initiating treatment; an additional blood
             pregnancy test (beta HCG) will be completed if subject wants to do PET scan

          -  Patients who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a current, serious suicidal or
             homicidal risk. These patients will be immediately referred to appropriate clinical
             treatment;

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the therapist, are not depressed at the time of their
             first psychotherapy visit;

          -  Patients who are currently being treated by a psychotherapist individually or who have
             received individual psychotherapy during the past 6 months. Couples therapy and family
             therapy will not be considered exclusionary criteria;

          -  Patients with neurological illnesses, including a history of seizure or head trauma
             with loss of consciousness;

             disorder (current or past), or any panic disorder (current, past allowed). Generalized
             anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder are not exclusionary;

          -  Patients currently requiring other psychotropic medications, including
             anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, stimulants, or sedative hypnotics
             (other than diphenhydramine);however, patients will be permitted to take trazodone in
             addition to their primary antidepressant if it is taken as a sleep aid, rather than a
             primary antidepressant;

          -  Psychotic features in the current episode, or a history of psychotic features, as
             assessed by SCID;
