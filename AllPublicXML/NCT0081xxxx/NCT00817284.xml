  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant activity (radiographic response rates of approximately 60%) has recently been
      demonstrated in phase II studies in patients with relapsed GBM from the combined use of
      Irinotecan (CPT-11) and bevacizumab. The 6-month progression-free survival rate is 30% and
      median survival duration is 9 months. The current first line therapy of GBM patients
      following initial surgical resection/debulking is the concomitant use of cerebral
      radiotherapy and the orally available alkylating agent temozolomide, followed by temozolomide
      for 6 months post-radiotherapy.

      Considering the significant activity of the combination of Bevacizumab + irinotecan in
      patients with recurrent GBM, and considering the activity of temozolomide in GBM, it is
      proposed that the combination of Bevacizumab + Temozolomide may also be an active regimen.
      Bevacizumab + Temozolomide display non-overlapping toxicity clinically and thus their
      combined use without significant dose-reductions seems rational.

      The toxicity from the combined use of the two drugs prior to radiotherapy, as well as the
      toxicity when administered together with radiotherapy, is evaluated.

      This study will try to identity whether Bevacizumab and Irinitecan or Bevacizumab and
      Temozolomide should be the experimental arm in future phase III comparison with standard care
      with concomitant Temozolomide and radiotherapy.

    <description>Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg is administered on days 1 and 15.
Irinotecan:
Irinotecan 125 mg/m2 is administered on days 1 and 15 to patients NOT receiving enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAED).
Irinotecan 340 mg/m2 is administered on days 1 and 15 to patients receiving EIAEDs.
During concomitant chemoradiotherapy, bevacizumab and irinotecan are given in the same doses and schedules as before and after chemoradiotherapy.
Radiotherapy is delivered during 3rd and 4th cycle of chemotherapy and consists of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily five days per week (Monday to Friday) over a period of six weeks for a total dose of 60 Gy.</description>

    <description>Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg is administered on days 1 and 15. Temozolomide dosing before start concomitant chemoradiotherapy: 150 mg/m2/day on days 1-5 during the first 28 days treatment cycle, then 200 mg/m2/day on the subsequent cycles until radiotherapy.
Temozolomide administered concomitantly with the radiotherapy: Temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days per week is administered on each day of radiotherapy.
After completed chemoradiotherapy, temozolomide is dosed and administered as it was prior to start chemoradiotherapy, i.e. temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day on days 1-5 out of a 28 days schedule, taking into consideration any previous dose-reductions already made.
Radiotherapy is delivered during 3rd and 4th cycle of chemotherapy and consists of fractionated focal irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy per fraction given once daily five days per week (Monday to Friday) over a period of six weeks for a total dose of 60 Gy.</description>
