  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this clinical study conducted in confinement under well-defined
      conditions is to obtain initial data on the levels of human body exposure to selected smoked
      constituents of the SMAR cigarette.

      The main objective of this study is to compare the biomarkers of exposure to cigarette smoke
      constituents in smokers switching to SMAR and to biomarkers in smokers of conventional
      cigarettes (CC). The biomarkers of exposure will be measured in blood and urine samples
      collected from the subjects. Moreover, the biomarkers in subjects smoking conventional or
      SMAR cigarettes will be compared with those biomarkers in smokers who stop smoking for 5
      days. The short term safety of this new product will also be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a controlled, randomised, open-label, 3-arm parallel single centre confinement study
      to investigate exposure to selected smoke constituents in smokers switching from CC to SMAR
      for 5 days.

      112 eligible subjects will be randomised to the 3 study arms: SMAR, conventional cigarettes
      (CC) and smoking cessation (SC) in a 2:1:1 ratio.

      Following the screening visit (within 4 weeks prior to the day of admission), the study will
      be run over an 8-day period in a confined environment, consisting of the admission day (D-2),
      a 2-day baseline period (D-1 and D0), and a 5-day exposure period (D1 to D5). Subjects will
      be discharged in the morning of D6. From the discharge of the subject, a 7-day safety
      follow-up period will be carried out (until D13).
