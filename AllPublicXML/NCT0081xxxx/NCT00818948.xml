  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose
      escalation study, enrolling approximately 48 subjects. Part A of the study will enroll
      subjects with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) without Glomerulonephritis (GN) into 3
      cohorts. Part B of the study will enroll SLE subjects with GN into 3 cohorts. The purpose of
      the study is to evaluate the multiple dose of AMG 811 on safety. Tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will enroll SLE without GN (non-renal) subjects into 3 cohorts (6 AMG
      811: 2 placebo). All subjects will receive a dose of AMG 811 or placebo every 4 weeks
      beginning with Day 1 (D1) for a total of 3 injections. Subjects will be followed through to
      study day 197, 5 months from the last dose of study medication.

      Part B of the study will enroll SLE subjects with GN into Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 (6 AMG 811: 2
      placebo). Similar to Part A, subjects in Cohorts 4, 5, and 6 will be dosed every 4 weeks with
      AMG 811 or placebo for a total of 3 injections followed by a 5 month follow-up period. For
      Cohort 6, subjects will be followed by a 6 month follow-up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women, between the ages of 18 and 70 years of age;

          -  Body mass index from 18 to 40 kg/m2 [Body Weight (kg)/Height2 (m2)] at screening;

          -  Diagnosis of SLE at least 6 months before randomization, including a positive
             antinuclear antibodies (ANA) during screening; if screening ANA is negative,
             documented historical ANA with a titer of at least 1:80 will be acceptable;

          -  Any concurrent SLE pharmacologic regimen (including mycophenolate mofetil,
             azathioprine, leflunomide, methotrexate, and anti-malarials) must be stable for at
             least 30 days before randomization;

          -  Prednisone ≤ 20 mg/day (or equivalent) is permitted; one increase or one decrease of ≤

          -  Administration of an investigational biologic agent that primarily targets the immune
             system

          -  Administration of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, IV immunoglobulin, and/or
             plasmapheresis within 3 months of randomization;

          -  Administration of oral or IV cyclophosphamide (or any other alkylating agent) within
             12 months (Part A) or 3 months (Part B) of randomization;

          -  History of ethanol or drug abuse within the last one year prior to randomization;

        Additional exclusion criteria for Part B:

          -  Rapidly progressive GN (defined as a doubling of serum creatinine within the past 3
             months);

          -  Evidence of significant chronicity, defined as:

        &gt; 50% glomeruli with sclerosis or &gt; 50% interstitial fibrosis on renal biopsy; or
