    <measure>Change in Resting vs. Peak Heart Rate Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) From Baseline to Week 8 After a Missed Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 + 2 days (48-hours after the last dose; 24 hours after a missed dose). Blood Pressure measurements were taken at rest and at peak heart rate at both timepoints.</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in resting vs. peak (85% of maximal predicted) heart rate (HR) SBP was calculated by measuring SBP before and during exercise on a standardized treadmill test, conducted according to the Bruce Protocol. Treadmill speed and incline were increased every 3 minutes until the patient was exhausted or peak HR was reached. The SBP at rest vs peak HR was recorded at Baseline and at Week 8 + 2 days (24-hrs after a missed dose); the change in rest vs. peak SBP between these timepoints is reported. The analysis included the rest to peak increase in SBP at baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <description>For the first week of the 8 week treatment period, patients received aliskiren 150 mg, placebo to aliskiren, and 2 capsules of placebo to valsartan. For the remaining 7 weeks of the study, patients received aliskiren 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) and 2 capsules of placebo to valsartan. The tablets and capsules (2 of each) were taken orally once daily each morning. To evaluate a missed dose, the last dose of medication was administered at the clinic, and the patient was scheduled to return 2 days later for exercise testing (8 weeks + 2 days).</description>

        <title>Change in Resting vs. Peak Heart Rate Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) From Baseline to Week 8 After a Missed Dose</title>
        <description>The difference in resting vs. peak (85% of maximal predicted) heart rate (HR) SBP was calculated by measuring SBP before and during exercise on a standardized treadmill test, conducted according to the Bruce Protocol. Treadmill speed and incline were increased every 3 minutes until the patient was exhausted or peak HR was reached. The SBP at rest vs peak HR was recorded at Baseline and at Week 8 + 2 days (24-hrs after a missed dose); the change in rest vs. peak SBP between these timepoints is reported. The analysis included the rest to peak increase in SBP at baseline as a covariate.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 + 2 days (48-hours after the last dose; 24 hours after a missed dose). Blood Pressure measurements were taken at rest and at peak heart rate at both timepoints.</time_frame>
        <population>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients who were randomized and took at least one dose of study drug. The Exercise Evaluable Set (EES) included all patients included in the FAS for whom the treadmill test values for SBP at peak were available at baseline and after a missed dose.</population>

          <description>The difference in resting vs. peak (85% of maximal predicted) heart rate (HR) SBP was calculated by measuring SBP before and during exercise on a standardized treadmill test, conducted according to the Bruce Protocol. Treadmill speed and incline were increased every 3 minutes until the patient was exhausted or peak HR was reached. The SBP at rest vs peak HR was recorded at Baseline and at Week 8 + 2 days (24-hrs after a missed dose); the change in rest vs. peak SBP between these timepoints is reported. The analysis included the rest to peak increase in SBP at baseline as a covariate.</description>
