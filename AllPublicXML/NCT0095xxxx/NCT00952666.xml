  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurovascular bundle (NVB) contains capsular vessels to the prostate and cavernous nerves
      that provides the macroscopic landmark used during nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy. The
      preservation of NVB during radical prostatectomy improves postoperative recovery of potency
      and continence. However, the visualization of the NVB during radical prostatectomy can be
      challenging.

      Recently, an attempt has been made to use a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging to
      delineate the anatomy of the prostate gland and NVB during laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy. However, it is difficult to obtain a steady image of TRUS with an operator.
      The investigators plan to perform a feasibility study to obtain TRUS imaging of the prostate
      and NVB during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP). The investigators
      plan to use a robot-assisted TRUS probe holder to gently manipulate the probe to obtain
      steady TRUS images that may aid in visualization and dissection of the NVB during RALRP.

      During surgery for prostate cancer, precise resection of the tumor-containing prostate gland
      and preservation of the neurovascular bundle (NVB) are critical in preventing tumor
      recurrence and potency preservation following surgery. However, due to the periprostatic
      connective tissues and bleeding, it is difficult to visualize NVB during surgery, even with
      surgical loupes or laparoscopic magnification.

      Ultrasound (US) is commonly used in imaging the prostate during diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedures such as diagnostic biopsy. US image in addition to the classic laparoscopic
      imaging can potentially provide decreased surgical margins and improve the dissection of the
      NVB during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) according to the study by the Cleveland
      Clinic group. In their study, an assistant manipulated the TRUS probe under the direction of
      the surgeon and held it in place as requested. At critical points of the surgery, the surgeon
      visualized the NVB on the Doppler-capable ultrasound monitor. The images, however, were
      difficult to interpret because the surgeon was not in direct control of the TRUS probe. In
      addition, it was challenging for surgeon to communicate with the assistant to obtain steady
      and useful image. Moreover, their study was performed exclusively in LRP without the daVinci®
      robot (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.), more commonly performed surgical approach for radical
      prostatectomy.

      To overcome these obstacles in the study by Ukimura and al., we propose to use a mechanical
      support arm for holding and manipulating the TRUS probe during the daVinci® robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (robotic LRP)..

      This application is for a feasibility study involving six patients. We will obtain TRUS
      images of the prostate and NVB during a robotic LRP procedure. These images will be acquired
      in the first part of the operation and performed with minimal interference to the operation.
      We will record and analyze the TRUS images to investigate the feasibility of using mechanical
      support arm for the TRUS probe. The proposed study is a proof of concept for a following
      protocol.

    <description>During surgery, and part of this research study, the ultrasound probe (TRUS) will be placed in the rectum. Then, using the mechanical support arm to hold and adjust the probe we will take ultrasound images during a portion of the robotic LRP surgery. The ultrasound probe will then be removed, and we will complete the LRP surgery as we usually do. We expect this to add approximately 20 minutes to the regular surgery time; the maximum added time will be 30 minutes.</description>
