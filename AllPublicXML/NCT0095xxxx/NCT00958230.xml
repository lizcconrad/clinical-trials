  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to produce early safety and performance data in a small group of
      patients requiring repair of a peripheral vascular endarterectomy (incision into an artery
      feeding the limbs which requires a patch to repair the incision after removal of an
      atherosclerotic plaque that was stopping usual blood flow to the limbs).

      Data is being collected to show the procedure is safe and allows for normal blood flow to be
      resumed.

      Data will be used to facilitate CE Mark submission.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients scheduled for a remote or open peripheral vascular endarterectomy

          2. Lack of suitable autologous material to function as closure patch for the arteriotomy

          3. Uncomplicated standard elective endarterectomy procedure (per-operative inclusion
             criteria)

          4. Use of dCell™ Vascular Patch as arteriotomy closure material (per-operative inclusion
             criteria)

          5. Patients between 18 and 80 years old, inclusive

          6. Haemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL and platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3 prior to Day 1

          7. Other haematological and biochemical parameters within a range acceptable for the
             administration of general anesthesia prior to Day 1

          8. Ability to communicate meaningfully with investigative staff, competence to give
             written informed consent, and ability to comply with entire study procedures

          9. Duly executed, written, informed consent obtained from patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known serious allergy to contrast agent used for angiography

          2. Treatment with any investigational drug or device within 60 days prior to study entry
             (Day 1)

          3. If female and of child-bearing potential: evidence of a positive pregnancy test or a
             stated intention to become pregnant in the next 6-12 months

          4. Patients receiving a revision of an existing graft

          5. Patients demonstrating an active local or systemic infection (WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3)

          6. Any condition which in the judgment of the Investigator would preclude adequate
             evaluation of dCell™ Vascular Patch's safety and performance

          7. Patients on vitamin K antagonists
