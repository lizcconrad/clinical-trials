  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to test the ergonomics of an investigational imaging system
      that can take pictures of blood vessels under the skin. In plastic and reconstructive
      surgery, blood flow to tissue determines whether the tissue can be transplanted from one
      location to another. This new imaging device uses invisible near-infrared fluorescent light
      to see blood vessels that otherwise could not be seen by eye. This study will test the
      system's basic operation and ergonomics in the operating room.

      To perform a pilot study of the FLAREâ„¢ NIR fluorescence imaging system in conjunction with
      indocyanine green (ICG) during breast reconstructive surgery utilizing deep inferior
      epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps.

      Due to patient-to-patient anatomic variation, the vascular perfusion to the cutaneous
      elements in flaps is unpredictable and of great concern to the surgeon planning the design of
      the flap. We propose a method of imaging the flap based on the use of invisible near-infrared
      fluorescent light that has significant advantages for both patient and surgeon.

      Specific Aims:

      A pilot optimization study of the imaging system in combination with ICG to determine optimal
      dose, light excitation fluence rate, and camera exposure time.
