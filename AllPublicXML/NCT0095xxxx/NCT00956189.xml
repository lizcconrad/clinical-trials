  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed an easy identification model to identify metabolic syndrome in
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who received treatment of clozapine,
      olanzapine, or risperidone. The accuracy of the investigators' models showed well. In the
      study, the investigators aim to (1) to examine whether the developed identification models
      can be generalized to patients taking other antipsychotics or patients with other diagnoses;
      (2) to develop an easy risk score and validate it; (3) to switch antipsychotics to
      amisulpride or aripiprazole for those with metabolic syndrome, and compare the changes of
      metabolic parameters including adiponectin, and analyze their association with genetic
      variants, demography, and clinical variables; (4) to establish models using artificial neural
      network and statistic method to predict metabolic response after a switch to amisulpride or
      aripiprazole; (5) to investigate the effect of antipsychotics on adiponectin gene expression
      and secretion during the differentiation process of 3T3L1 adipocytes.

        Stage I for identification of metabolic syndrome:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, mood
             disorders, or anxiety disorders based on DSM-IV-TR criteria.

          -  Age at least 20 years old.

          -  The current antipsychotic drugs have been used for at least 3 months before
             evaluation.

             greater than 5

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe uncontrolled medical illnesses, including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and
