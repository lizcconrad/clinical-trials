    <textblock>
      This is a comparison, at this VA Hospital,of routine multi-visit and multi-testing for solid
      tumor recurrence in four tumor groups to a limited scheduled 5 visit history/physical with
      PET/CT only, over a five year period. The purpose is to show through utilization of the
      single most sensitive and specific test currently available-PET/CT-that survival for patients
      in follow-up can be improved.(Plus lowering medical costs and increasing patient confidence
      and compliance with follow-up appointments).
