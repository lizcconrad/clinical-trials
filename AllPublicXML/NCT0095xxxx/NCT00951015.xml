  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIb study in HIV-infected antiretroviral naive adult subjects will include a
      dose-ranging evaluation of GSK1349572 10mg, 25mg and 50mg once daily blinded doses and a
      control arm of open label efavirenz 600mg once daily. Background ART for all study subjects
      will be chosen by the investigators and will be either Truvada or Epzicom/Kivexa. Data from
      the three doses of GSK1349572 will be compared on the basis of antiviral activity,
      safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics over 16-24 weeks.

      Several planned interim analyses will evaluate data in real time; any doses considered
      inferior will be dropped and subjects on those doses of GSK1349572 will have the option to
      switch to either the highest dose still under investigation or the selected dose. Subjects
      will be able to remain in the study, unless they reach a stopping criterion, for at least 96
      weeks.

      ViiV Healthcare is the new sponsor of this study, and GlaxoSmithKline is in the process of
      updating systems to reflect the change in sponsorship.

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Week 16. The analysis was performed using the time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) dataset. In the TLOVR dataset, participant responses at a specified threshold of HIV-1 RNA (&lt;50 copies/mL) are determined by using the Food and Drug Administration's TLOVR algorithm. Using the TLOVR algorithm, participants are considered to have failed on therapy if they never achieved confirmed RNA levels below the threshold, if they had confirmed rebound of RNA above the threshold, if they made a non-permitted change in background regimen, or if they permanently discontinued investigational product for any reason. Data are reported per the Week 16 report. In later cuts of the data, the Week 16 values may have changed (because of the nature of the TLOVR algorithm).ITT-E Population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication</description>

    <description>Blood samples for the determination of plasma DTG concentration were collected from the participants randomized to receive DTG, at the following time points: pre-dose and 2-4 hours post-dose at Weeks 2, Week 12, and Week 24. Because PK was assessed for DTG, no participants in the EFV treatment group were analyzed. The Pharmacokinetic (PK) Summary Population is comprised of all participants who received DTG and underwent intensive PK sampling or limited PK sampling during the study and provided evaluable DTG PK parameters. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X in the category titles).Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the PK Summary Population.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Relationships between log-transformed plasma DTG PK parameters (AUC[0-tau], Cmax, C0, C0avg, Ctau, and Cmin) and safety parameters (AE occurrence, maximum AE intensity, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], change from Baseline [CFB] in ALT, total bilirubin, CFB in total bilirubin, creatine kinase, CFB in creatine kinase, triglycerides, CFB in triglycerides, lipase, CFB in lipase, total cholesterol [TC], CFB in TC) was assessed using Pearson's correlation analyses. The Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the correlation between safety parameters and plasma DTG PK parameters and ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no statistical association; a value close to -1 or 1 indicates a higher association. The presence of &gt;=1 AE was used for AE occurrence. The most severe AE grade/intensity was used for maximum AE intensity. Maximum laboratory values per participant were used for safety parameters. CFB was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <description>Logistic regressions were performed to examine the correlation between plasma DTG PK parameters (AUC[0-tau] [area under the time concentration curve over the dosing interval], Cmax [maximal concentration], Ctau [concentration at the end of the dosing interval], and C0avg [average pre-dose concentration]) on log scales and the presence of gastrointestinal system organ class AEs (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) at Week 96. Data are presented as estimates from logistic regression, which is a measure of the association between AEs of special interest and plasma DTG PK parameters. A value of 0 indicates no statistical association; a large absolute value of the estimate indicates higher association. Because PK was assessed for DTG, no participants in the EFV treatment group were analyzed. Results are presented for participants in any DTG group (overall DTG).Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=X in the category titles</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 16</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Week 16. The analysis was performed using the time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) dataset. In the TLOVR dataset, participant responses at a specified threshold of HIV-1 RNA (&lt;50 copies/mL) are determined by using the Food and Drug Administration's TLOVR algorithm. Using the TLOVR algorithm, participants are considered to have failed on therapy if they never achieved confirmed RNA levels below the threshold, if they had confirmed rebound of RNA above the threshold, if they made a non-permitted change in background regimen, or if they permanently discontinued investigational product for any reason. Data are reported per the Week 16 report. In later cuts of the data, the Week 16 values may have changed (because of the nature of the TLOVR algorithm).ITT-E Population included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study medication</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cluster of Differentiation 4+ (CD4+) Cell Counts at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected for lymphocyte subset assessment by flow cytometry at Baseline (Day 1), Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 32, Week 40, Week 48, Week 60, Week 72, Week 84, and Week 96. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the ITT-E Population.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of HIV-1 Disease Progression (AIDS or Death)</title>
        <description>Clinical disease progression (CDP) was assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV-1 classification system. Category (CAT) A: one or more of the following conditions (CON), without any CON listed in Categories B and C: asymptomatic HIV infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV infection. CAT B: symptomatic CON that are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or that are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection; and not included among CON listed in clinical CAT C. CAT C: the clinical CON listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition. Indicators of CDP were defined as: CAT A at Baseline (BS) to CAT B event (EV), CAT A at BS to a CAT C EV; CAT B at BS to a CAT C EV; CAT C at BS to a new CAT C EV; or CAT A, B, or C at BS to death.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Baseline (Day 1), Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 32, Week 40, Week 48, Week 60, Week 72, Week 84, and Week 96. The analysis was performed using the time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) dataset. In the TLOVR dataset, participant responses at a specified threshold of HIV-1 RNA (&lt;50 copies/mL) are determined by using the Food and Drug Administration's TLOVR algorithm. Using the TLOVR algorithm, participants are considered to have failed on therapy if they never achieved confirmed RNA levels below the threshold, if they had confirmed rebound of RNA above the threshold, if they made a non-permitted change in background regimen, or if they permanently discontinued investigational product for any reason.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 c/mL</title>
        <description>Plasma samples were collected for quantitative HIV-1 RNA analysis at Baseline (Day 1), Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 32, Week 40, Week 48, Week 60, Week 72, Week 84, and Week 96. The analysis was performed using the time to loss of virological response (TLOVR) dataset. In the TLOVR dataset, participant responses at a specified threshold of HIV-1 RNA (&lt;400 c/mL) are determined by using the Food and Drug Administration's TLOVR algorithm. Using the TLOVR algorithm, participants are considered to have failed on therapy if they never achieved confirmed RNA levels below the threshold, if they had confirmed rebound of RNA above the threshold, if they made a non-permitted change in background regimen, or if they permanently discontinued investigational product for any reason.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) and Any Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. All clinically suspected cases of hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir in participants receiving abacavir/lamivudine were reported as SAEs. Medical or scientific judgment was to have been exercised in other situations. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs (occuring at a frequency threshold &gt;=3%) and SAEs.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Treatment-emergent Integrase (IN) Mutations Detected at the Time of Protocol-defined Virologic Failure (PDVF), as a Measure of Genotypic Resistance</title>
        <description>For participants meeting one of the criteria for PDVF, plasma samples collected at the time point of virologic failure were tested to evaluate any potential genotypic and/or phenotypic evolution of resistance. PDVF was defined as (A) Virologic Non-response: a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of &lt;1 log10 copies/mL by Week 4, with subsequent confirmation, unless plasma HIV-1 RNA is &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;=400 copies/mL on or after Week 24 without evidence of prior suppression to &lt;400copies/mL or (B) Virologic Rebound: confirmed rebound in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to &gt;=400 copies/mL after prior confirmed suppression to &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;0.5 log10 copies/mL above the nadir value, where nadir is the lowest HIV-1 value &gt;=400 copies/mL.On-treatment Genotypic Resistance Population: all participants in the ITT-E Population with available on-treatment genotypic data, excluding participants who were not protocol-defined virologic failures.</description>

          <description>For participants meeting one of the criteria for PDVF, plasma samples collected at the time point of virologic failure were tested to evaluate any potential genotypic and/or phenotypic evolution of resistance. PDVF was defined as (A) Virologic Non-response: a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of &lt;1 log10 copies/mL by Week 4, with subsequent confirmation, unless plasma HIV-1 RNA is &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;=400 copies/mL on or after Week 24 without evidence of prior suppression to &lt;400copies/mL or (B) Virologic Rebound: confirmed rebound in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to &gt;=400 copies/mL after prior confirmed suppression to &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;0.5 log10 copies/mL above the nadir value, where nadir is the lowest HIV-1 value &gt;=400 copies/mL.</description>

Because PK was assessed for DTG, no participants in the EFV treatment group were analyzed. The Pharmacokinetic (PK) Summary Population is comprised of all participants who received DTG and underwent intensive PK sampling or limited PK sampling during the study and provided evaluable DTG PK parameters. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X in the category titles).Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the PK Summary Population.</description>

        <title>Relationship Between the Change From Baseline in Plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 2 and the Indicated Plasma DTG PK Parameters</title>
        <description>Relationships between Week 2 plasma DTG PK parameters (AUC[0-tau] [area under the time concentration curve over the dosing interval], Cmax [maximal concentration], and Ctau [concentration at the end of the dosing interval]) and the change from Baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA at Week 2 (calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline) was assessed using Pearson’s correlation analyses. The Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the correlation between plasma HIV-1 RNA and plasma DTG PK parameters and ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no statistical association; a value close to -1 or 1 indicates a higher association. Because PK was assessed for DTG, no participants in the EFV treatment group were analyzed.

        <title>Relationship Between the Indicated Safety Parameters at Week 96 and the Indicated Plasma DTG PK Parameters</title>
        <description>Relationships between log-transformed plasma DTG PK parameters (AUC[0-tau], Cmax, C0, C0avg, Ctau, and Cmin) and safety parameters (AE occurrence, maximum AE intensity, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], change from Baseline [CFB] in ALT, total bilirubin, CFB in total bilirubin, creatine kinase, CFB in creatine kinase, triglycerides, CFB in triglycerides, lipase, CFB in lipase, total cholesterol [TC], CFB in TC) was assessed using Pearson’s correlation analyses. The Pearson's correlation coefficient is a measure of the correlation between safety parameters and plasma DTG PK parameters and ranges from -1 to 1. A value of 0 indicates no statistical association; a value close to -1 or 1 indicates a higher association. The presence of &gt;=1 AE was used for AE occurrence. The most severe AE grade/intensity was used for maximum AE intensity. Maximum laboratory values per participant were used for safety parameters. CFB was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Relationship Between Gastrointestinal System Organ Class AEs of Special Interest at Week 96 and the Indicated Plasma DTG PK Parameters</title>
        <description>Logistic regressions were performed to examine the correlation between plasma DTG PK parameters (AUC[0-tau] [area under the time concentration curve over the dosing interval], Cmax [maximal concentration], Ctau [concentration at the end of the dosing interval], and C0avg [average pre-dose concentration]) on log scales and the presence of gastrointestinal system organ class AEs (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting) at Week 96. Data are presented as estimates from logistic regression, which is a measure of the association between AEs of special interest and plasma DTG PK parameters. A value of 0 indicates no statistical association; a large absolute value of the estimate indicates higher association. Because PK was assessed for DTG, no participants in the EFV treatment group were analyzed. Results are presented for participants in any DTG group (overall DTG).Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed represented by n=X in the category titles</description>
