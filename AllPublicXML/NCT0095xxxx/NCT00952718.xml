      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inspiratory muscle training could improve
      and/or prevent the deterioration of inspiratory muscle strength, clinical cardiopulmonary
      outcome, systemic immunologic responses and quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle training is reportedly beneficial in patients with diverse chronic
      cardio-pulmonary diseases. It can increase inspiratory muscle strength and endurance,
      improves exercise capacity and quality of life (QOL), and decreases the perception of dyspnea
      (POD) for adults with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Though the
      pathophysiology in COPD and bronchiectasis are different, there are some similarities in
      clinical presentation. In COPD patients, lung hyperinflation induces functional weakness of
      the inspiratory muscle and increases elastic load to breathing and intrinsic positive end
      expiratory pressure. Patients with bronchiectasis shows reduced ratio of FEV1/FVC, reduced
      FEV1, and normal or slightly reduced FVC, which indicate that airways are blocked by mucus.
      However, there has been no study that used IMT as a training modality to determine its effect
      in bronchiectasis. The clinical relevance of increased respiratory muscle strength per se by
      IMT alone is unknown. This study tried to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of
      home-based threshold training and examined if the effects of IMT extends to clinical outcomes
      such as activities of daily living and QOL in bronchiectasis patients.

    <description>A pressure threshold device (ThresholdÂ® IMT HS730, RESPIRONICS Inc, Cedar Grove, NJ, USA) was used for the inspiratory muscle training program. The individualized training program was started at an intensity of 30% MIP, which was increased by 2 cmH2O each week, but the maximal intensity did not exceed 50% of MIP. Patients were encouraged to perform IMT for 30 minutes per day, at least 5 days a week for 8 weeks.</description>
