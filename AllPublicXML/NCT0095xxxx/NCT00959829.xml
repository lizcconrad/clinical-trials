      Objectives: (1) To check music and voice message influence on vital signs and facial
      expressions of patients in physiological or induced comas; (2) To connect the existence of
      patient's responsiveness with the Glasgow Coma Scale or with the Ramsay Sedation Scale.

      Method: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial with 30 patients, from two Intensive
      Care Units, being divided in 2 groups (control and experimental). Their relatives recorded a
      voice message and chose a song according to the patient's preference. The patients were
      submitted to 3 sessions for 3 consecutive days.

      The relatives elaborated a voice recorded message and choose a music according to the patient
      preference, which were recorded in the same Compact Disc. Two identical CD's were made at the
      same recorded time; one with and another one without stimulus in order to make the random
      division of the groups. The patients were evaluated according to one of the Scales; they used
      earphones. During the sessions, the data relating to the vital signs and the face expression
      were recorded in a data collection instrument.
