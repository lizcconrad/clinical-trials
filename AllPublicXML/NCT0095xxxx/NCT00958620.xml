    <textblock>
      Chronic Achilles tendinopathy is a painful condition with frequently unsatisfactory results
      of conservative treatment. Extracorporal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) has been introduced in the
      management of various soft tissue conditions. The objective of the study was to investigate
      the effect of supplementary ESWT versus placebo to conservative treatment of chronic Achilles
      tendinopathy.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Achilles tendinopathy is a common disability of the foot during walking and running.
      Avoiding of painful activities, correction of malalignment by arch support, stretching
      exercise and eccentric training combined with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain killers
      are the standard treatment regimen (Wilson 2005). However, evidence to support these
      modalities is sparse (McLauchlan 2001).

      Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) originally used for treatment of renal stones became
      popular in the last decade for treatment of different soft tissue disorders including
      calcifying tendinopathy in the rotator cuff, humeral epicondylitis and plantar fasciitis
      (Haake 2001, Ogden 2001, Chung 2002, Gerdesmeyer 2003, Speed 2004). It is now worldwide
      employed and FDA-approved for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. However regarding both
      calcifying tendinopathy in the rotator cuff, humeral epicondylitis and plantar fasciitis the
      results are conflicting (Rompe 1996, Boddeker 2001, Hammer 2002, Schmitt 2002, Gross 2003,
      Haake 2003, Pleiner 2004, Chung 2005). A series of randomized studies on ESWT for soft tissue
      disorders have been reported (Rompe 1997, Krishek 1998, Loew 1999, Rompe 2001, Haake 2001,
      Hammer 2002, Schmitt 2002, Gerdesmeyer 2003, Gross 2003, Haake 2003, Pleiner 2004, Chung
      2005, Costa 2005) only four reporting significant effect of ESWT (Rompe 1997, Krishek 1998,
      Loew 1999, Gerdesmeyer 2003), and only one randomised studies for chronic achilles
      tendinopathy (Costa 2005). Two uncontrolled (Perlick 2002, Lakshmanan 2003) and one
      controlled (Furia 2005) series introduce ESWT for chronic Achilles tendinopathy. The results
      of these papers are seriously conflicting. Some authors include training and others not.
      Since eccentric training has documented effect (Alfredson 2000) other conservative treatments
      should be introduced as a supplement.

      We investigated in a double blind randomized trial the supplementary effect of ESWT to
      enhance recovery of Achilles tendinopathy. We investigated, firstly, the effect on AOFAS
      score and secondly the effect on pain.
