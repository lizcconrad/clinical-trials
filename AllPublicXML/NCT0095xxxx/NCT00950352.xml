      The purpose of the study is to determine if citicoline (a nutritional supplement) is
      effective in helping people reduce their dependence on methamphetamine. The investigators
      will use neuroimaging to look at the structure and chemical make up of the brain at the start
      of the study and after 8-9 weeks of treatment of citicoline or placebo.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which we will
      systematically evaluate the therapeutic effects of citicoline, which may both increase
      dopamine and normalize cognitive and structural deficits in the brains of methamphetamine
      dependent subjects. Methamphetamine dependent subjects will undergo baseline and repeat
      cognitive assessments after 8-9 weeks of placebo or oral citicoline as a nutritional
      supplement. We will also evaluate the chemical and structural changes in brain regions
      identified by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tension imaging (DTI) and
      cortical thickness, which in turn are expected to recover after 8-9 weeks of citicoline
      treatment. Specific brain regions of interest include the prefrontal cortices, temporal
      cortex, and the caudate/putamen all of which are known to be involved in the pathophysiology
      of methamphetamine dependence.
