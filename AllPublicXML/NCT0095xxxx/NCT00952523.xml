      each applied to half of the face of healthy volunteers.

      At the Baseline Visit, following satisfaction of entry criteria and screening procedures, all
      subjects will be applying two products to their faces, each on one side only. The side of the
      face receiving each product is randomly assigned. One group will use Retin-A MICRO Gel,
      (tretinoin) 0.04% Pump on the left side of the face and Epiduo Gel (adapalene .1% and benzoyl
      peroxide 2.5%), on the right side of the face daily for 3 consecutive weeks after washing
      with study-supplied facial wash. The other group will use the same products, but on opposite
      sides of the face for three consecutive weeks after washing with the same study-supplied
      facial wash.

      Subjects will return to the study center every weekday morning for evaluation and application
      of both study products. Applications done on the weekends, will be done at home by the
      subject. At each visit the subject will be scored for cutaneous treatment effects by a
      blinded evaluator. At baseline and at the end of each week, subjects will be photographed and
      have chromometer readings.
