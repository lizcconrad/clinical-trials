  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the effect of
      early limited formula supplementation on breastfeeding-related outcomes for infants with high
      early weight loss. The investigators will enroll 40 exclusively breastfeeding infants at
      24-48 hours of age and will randomly assign them to early limited formula supplementation
      following nursing (intervention group) or to no formula feeding (control group). Both groups
      will receive intensive lactation support. Outcome variables will include breastfeeding status
      on day-of-life 8, weight nadir, breastfeeding self-efficacy, maternal satisfaction, and
      exclusive and partial breastfeeding at 1-3 months. The hypothesis for this study is that
      early limited formula supplementation might help infants with early weight loss avoid
      eventual weight loss â‰¥ 10% and associated breastfeeding problems.
