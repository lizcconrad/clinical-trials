  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who have been treated for breast cancer may be at risk for lymphedema or arm swelling.
      Currently, there are no clear treatment guidelines for lymphedema. One treatment method used
      to treat lymphedema is the use of compression sleeves to encourage the flow of lymph fluid
      out of the arms and prevent arm swelling in the future. Another treatment method is more
      intensive and involves wearing compression sleeves as well as special compression bandages
      overnight. It is unclear whether the use of compression with both sleeves and bandaging is
      more effective in treating lymphedema than the use of compression sleeves alone. The purpose
      of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of compression garments in
      preventing or slowing the progression of lymphedema in breast cancer patients.

      -  Because no one knows which of the study options is best, participant's will be
           randomized into one of the study groups. Participants with mild lymphedema will be
           randomized into either Group 1A or Group 1B. Participants with moderate lymphedema will
           be randomized into either Group 2A or Group 2B.

        -  All study participants will meet with a lymphedema physical therapist to review daily
           shoulder range of motion exercises to help minimize their arm swelling. They will be
           asked to record their range of motion exercises and activities in a study treatment
           journal. Participants will bring their journal to each study visit (every 4 weeks).

        -  Group 1A will only be required to meet with the lymphedema physical therapist as
           described above.

        -  Group 1B and Group 2A will be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema
           physical therapy visit. They will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day.

        -  Group 2B will also be fitted with a compression sleeve at their first lymphedema
           physical therapy visit and will wear the sleeve for a minimum of 12 hours per day. They
           will also be instructed to wear a short-stretch compression bandage that goes from the
           top of the hand to the armpit. They will be asked to wear this compression bandage
           during the night. The overnight compression bandage should be worn for at least 5 nights
           out of the week.

        -  Participants will come to the clinic every 4 weeks. The following tests and procedures
           will be performed: height and weight measurements; review of any side effects; arm
           volume measurements for both arms; questionnaire.

    <description>Participants who are randomized to receive compression treatment will have their arm volume measured at regular intervals throughout the study period. Participants' arm volume, as measured by the validated Relative Volume Change (RVC) equation, at the end of the intervention period will be assessed to determine the efficacy of the compression garment intervention and whether or not it was successful in reducing the participants' arm edema to RVC&lt;10%.Data was collected in study participants enrolled in Group 1A and Group 1B only (15 patients total), and the percentage of participants who experienced reduction in edema is reported below.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This trial was terminated due to slow accrual and small number of subjects for whom data was collected (23 out of expected 334). Study did not reach statistical power to conduct detailed analysis, results should be interpreted with this in mind</limitations_and_caveats>
