    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different types of psychotherapy for Veterans with depression,
      addiction, and a past traumatic experience. Everyone in the study will receive 12 weeks of
      group cognitive behavioral therapy focused on depression and addiction, followed by 12 weeks
      of individual psychotherapy sessions. For the second 12 weeks, half of the people will
      receive a review of the initial therapy, and half will receive a cognitive behavioral therapy
      focused on trauma. Everyone will complete research interviews every 3 months for a total of
      18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether a second disorder-specific intervention
      improves longer term (up to 18 months) treatment outcomes for male and female Veterans with
      co-occurring depression and alcohol/substance disorders and trauma history (with or without
      PTSD diagnosis). This 4 years randomized two-group design uses repeated assessments at
      baseline and every 3 months for a total of 12 months. The investigators are providing their
      recently developed integrated intervention for comorbid depression and substance disorders
      for the initial 12 weeks in group format (Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Phase I).
      After the 12 week group intervention, participants will be randomized to receive either a
      review of the initial intervention in individual sessions, or a trauma-specific intervention,
      Cognitive Processing Therapy, with integrated addiction treatment components. Length,
      duration, and setting of both interventions will be the same, and all participants will meet
      with the program psychiatrist for medication appointments. No medications are under study and
      no placebo is used; medications will be prescribed using standard VA protocol. Research
      assessments will document diagnosis, recent substance use, depression and PTSD symptoms,
      medication adherence, and life stress.

    <measure>Depression Symptoms Were Assessed With the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed quarterly; trajectories analyzed total scores from randomization through end of study (6 timepoints covering approximately 15 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression symptoms were assessed using a structured clinical interview assessment consisting of 21 items. Depression symptoms experienced in the past week are rated on a 0 (none) to 4 (most severe) scale. The total score is summed from the item scores and range from 0 (none) to 84 (most severe). We tested whether treatment group interacted with time in order to examine whether trajectories of symptom scores differed across treatment conditions. Linear mixed effects models were used to ascertain trajectories of total scores from randomization through end of study (6 timepoints across approximately 15 months). This analytic approach was advantageous in that it provided examination of change in depression across all quarterly assessments. Models were estimated with maximum likelihood methods. Total score at the time of randomization is reported in Data Table and coefficient estimates for trajectories are reported in Statistical Analysis.</description>

    <measure>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed quarterly; trajectories analyzed total scores from randomization through end of study (6 timepoints covering approximately 15 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian version (PCL-C) is a 17 item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms experienced in the past month rated on a 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) scale; total score is summed from the item scores and range from 17 (none) to 85 (most severe). . Civilian version was selected as it allows for a variety of trauma types. Scores above 50 are considered clinical levels. We tested whether treatment group interacted with time to examine whether trajectories of symptom scores differed across treatment conditions. Linear mixed effects models were used to ascertain trajectories of total scores. This analytic approach was advantageous in that it provided examination of change in PTSD across all quarterly assessments. Models were estimated with maximum likelihood methods. Total score at the time of randomization is reported in Data Table and coefficient estimates for trajectories are reported in Statistical Analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timeline Followback</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed quarterly; trajectories analyzed from randomization through end of study (covering approximately 15 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Timeline Followback is a calendar-assisted structured interview that assesses the frequency of alcohol and drug use on a daily basis and the quantity of alcohol use. Summary proportion of days abstinent were calculated at each time point. Trajectory analyses examine two substance use outcomes: probability of any alcohol or drug use on a given day and probability of heavy drinking (5 or more drinks consumed in a day) on a given day. Trajectories of substance use (any alcohol or drug use on a particular day) and heavy drinking (&gt;5 drinks on a particular day) were modeled as dichotomous outcomes, using logit links to predict the probability of substance use or heavy drinking on a particular day. Data Table reports starting proportion of days abstinent at time of randomization.</description>

        <title>Depression Symptoms Were Assessed With the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.</title>
        <description>Depression symptoms were assessed using a structured clinical interview assessment consisting of 21 items. Depression symptoms experienced in the past week are rated on a 0 (none) to 4 (most severe) scale. The total score is summed from the item scores and range from 0 (none) to 84 (most severe). We tested whether treatment group interacted with time in order to examine whether trajectories of symptom scores differed across treatment conditions. Linear mixed effects models were used to ascertain trajectories of total scores from randomization through end of study (6 timepoints across approximately 15 months). This analytic approach was advantageous in that it provided examination of change in depression across all quarterly assessments. Models were estimated with maximum likelihood methods. Total score at the time of randomization is reported in Data Table and coefficient estimates for trajectories are reported in Statistical Analysis.</description>

        <description>The Timeline Followback is a calendar-assisted structured interview that assesses the frequency of alcohol and drug use on a daily basis and the quantity of alcohol use. Summary proportion of days abstinent were calculated at each time point. Trajectory analyses examine two substance use outcomes: probability of any alcohol or drug use on a given day and probability of heavy drinking (5 or more drinks consumed in a day) on a given day. Trajectories of substance use (any alcohol or drug use on a particular day) and heavy drinking (&gt;5 drinks on a particular day) were modeled as dichotomous outcomes, using logit links to predict the probability of substance use or heavy drinking on a particular day. Data Table reports starting proportion of days abstinent at time of randomization.</description>
