    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see how biomarkers (abnormalities in molecules of cells ) present
      in their Barrett's esophagus agree with results from surveillance biopsies; and to compare
      three different brush devices used to collect cells to see which of these 3 brush devices
      obtains a higher number of cells.

      During an endoscopy done for clinical surveillance of your Barrett's Esophagus participants
      are randomized to one of three brush devices by random chance like a flip of a coin. This is
      being done to see if one collects more cells than the others. A soft brush will be used to
      collect cells from the lining of the esophagus, this is known as brush cytology. With the
      endoscope positioned in your esophagus, samples (biopsies) of lining of the esophagus will
      then be taken to determine the nature of the Barrett's mucosa in the same manner as for any
      patient undergoing routine surveillance endoscopy for Barrett's esophagus. A part of the
      specimen will be used to store tissue samples that can later be used.
