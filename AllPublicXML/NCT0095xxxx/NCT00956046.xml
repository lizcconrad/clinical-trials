    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate data on immunogenicity and safety of the monovalent
      H1N1 vaccine in support of the development and registration.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response to vaccines 21 days after each vaccination in all
           participants.

        -  To describe the antibody persistence eight months after the first vaccine administration
           using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) method in a subset of participants who received
           two half-doses of either formulation 1 or 2.

        -  To describe the immune response against the A/H1N1 strain using the HAI method 21 days
           after last vaccination with the 2010-2011 NH seasonal Trivalent Influenza Vaccine (TIV)
           administered 13 months after the first vaccination in a subset of subjects who received
           two half-doses of either t either formulation 1 or 2 of the A/H1N1 influenza vaccines as
           primary series.

        -  To describe the safety profile of each vaccine in all participants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive two injections of their randomized vaccine on Day 0 and Day 21,
      respectively.

      A subset of the participants eligible who received two half-doses of either formulation 1 or
      2 will also be proposed to receive the 2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere (NH) seasonal Trivalent
      Influenza Vaccine (TIV) 13 months after the first vaccination as Follows:

        -  Subjects less than 36 months at the time of TIV injection will receive two half-doses
           and additional sampling for immunogenicity assessment (one before the first TIV
           vaccination and one 21 days after last TIV vaccination).

        -  Subjects aged more than 36 months at the time of TIV injection will receive a full TIV
           dose and additional sampling for immunogenicity assessment (one before TIV vaccination
           and one 21 days after TIV vaccination).
