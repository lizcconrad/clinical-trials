      This study is being done to see if the addition of mangosteen juice to standard medical care
      will reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence following direct current (DC)
      cardioversion. The study will also look at the effects the mangosteen juice may have on
      biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction (the tissue lining the arteries
      does not function properly).

      Mangosteen Effects on Inflammatory Markers in Atrial Fibrillation Trial is a study designed
      to test the primary hypothesis that a dietary supplement (Mangosteen) containing
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties may effect the measured levels of inflammatory
      biomarkers. Secondarily, this study will compare the attenuation of markers of endothelial
      cell dysfunction including endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), clinical levels of
      anticoagulation (INR), digoxin, lipids, and glycosylated hemoglobin (Hgb A1c), quality of
      life measurements, AF recurrences, and associated levels of inflammatory markers with those
      experiencing recurrent AF between the mangosteen group and the placebo group.

      This trial will randomize 250 patients presenting to the Mayo Clinic Cardioversion Unit over
      one year to two groups including a mangosteen supplemented group versus a control group with
      placebo juice. Patients will be enrolled who have a history of paroxysmal, persistent, or
      longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation and excluded if they have a history of recent
      surgery, myocardial infarction, infection, collagen vascular disease with active
      inflammation, or thyroid disease. Furthermore, patients already on corticosteroids will be
      excluded. Patients will be evaluated at enrollment and followed at 3 months and 6 months with
      repeat ECG, laboratory testing of inflammatory biomarkers and endothelial function, as well
      as quality of life questions.

      The trial will track the effect of natural juices containing anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant properties on inflammatory markers, endothelial progenitor cells, and quality of
      life. This trial will attempt to determine if any dietary supplement effects to inflammatory
      markers correlate with the rate of recurrent AF in each of the two groups.
