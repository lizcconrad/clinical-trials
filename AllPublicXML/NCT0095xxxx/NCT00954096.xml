      This study will address the hypothesis that nicotine, like cigarette smoking acting as a
      pro-oxidant may have adverse effects on arterial function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes &gt;400,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) per year. The molecular
      basis of smoking induced tissue injury remains unclear but considerable evidence supports a
      role for oxidant stress (OS).

      Arterial function has been shown to be impaired in smokers even before the onset of
      angiographically demonstrable atherosclerosis. Defects in endothelium dependant flow mediated
      vasodilatation (FMD) are seen in those at risk of or with overt vascular disease.

      Cigarette smoking is highly addictive. Spontaneous quit rates approximate 3%. Even those
      using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) have high relapse rates (67-75%) on completion of
      the 8-12 week course of NRT. Thus there is interest in the use of extended NRT as a &quot;safer&quot;
      alternative to cigarette smoking. However such assumptions may be premature. Nicotine
      demonstrates proxidant effects in vitro and in small studies has been associated with
      endothelial dysfunction. Studies simultaneously assessing the effects of nicotine on
      oxidative stress and arterial function in humans have not been performed.

      The current proposal will address the hypothesis that nicotine, like cigarette smoking acting
      as a pro-oxidant may have adverse effects on arterial function.

    <description>A single blood specimen (85ml) will be drawn. They will be asked to empty their bladder. The patch will be applied. Following application of the patch, heart rate and blood pressure will be measured every 15 minutes for the 1st hour, every 30 minutes for the next 3 hours and hourly after that until the end of the study. Urine will be collected in two 4-hour aliquots. FMD will be measured after approximately 6 hours of nicotine exposure. After 8 hours exposure, following the end of the 2nd urine collection, the patch will be removed and the subject discharged. Following a minimum of 2 weeks (maximum 8 weeks) washout, the subject will repeat the study, receiving the other patch.</description>
