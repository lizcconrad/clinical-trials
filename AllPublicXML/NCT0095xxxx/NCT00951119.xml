    <textblock>
      Rationale: Hypertension is an important risk factor of cardiovascular disease, especially in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A relatively recent development for the
      treatment of hypertension is the use of breathing exercises. The investigators' previous
      studies with a breathing device did not show any positive results. However, these studies and
      other trials investigating the effects of breathing devices had not a double-blind design.
      Therefore, the investigators want to perform a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial in
      a population of T2DM patients.

      Objective: To determine the effect of a device slowing breathing (Resperate©) on office
      systolic blood pressure (SBP) in diabetic patients with treated hypertension with moderate BP
      control.

      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial.

      Study population: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, over 18 years old and a baseline
      systolic blood pressure between 140-160 mm Hg.

      Intervention: One group receives treatment with a breathing device (Resperate©) and the other
      group receives treatment with a &quot;control&quot; breathing device. The latter device does not try to
      alter the breathing pattern.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The effect of the breathing device on SBP is the main study
      parameter. Secondary endpoints include diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and quality of life.

    <description>Resperate© is a device that helps to slow down breathing. This device can measure the breathing patterns through a breathing sensor mounted on the upper abdomen or chest. Furthermore, music-like sound patterns can be composed similar to this breathing pattern, which the patient can hear through the headphones of the Resperate©. By prolonging the expiration, which can be voluntarily used by the user, the frequency of respiration can be slowed down and become more stable (aim&quot;&lt;10 breathings per minute).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  known T2DM,

          -  over 18 years old,

          -  known hypertension with a systolic BP (SBP) between 130-170 mm Hg at the previous
             visit to the internal outpatient department and at the last visit to the internist
             (which is the same day as baseline measurement) and treated with one or more
             anti-hypertensive drugs, which have not been changed for the preceding three months.
             At baseline the SBP should be between 140-160 mm Hg, measured by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with orthostatic hypotension,

          -  known heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and/or patients with pulmonary disease (for example
             asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary fibrosis),

          -  patients with insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language to understand the
             requirements of the study,

          -  additional criteria were hospitalization in the past 3 months, deafness, blindness and
             cognitive abilities deemed insufficient for operation of a study device.
