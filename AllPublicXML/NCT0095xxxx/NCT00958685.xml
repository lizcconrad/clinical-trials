      An enteral diet supplemented with ginger extract in acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS) patients may be beneficial for gas exchange and could decrease duration of mechanical
      ventilation and length of stay in intensive care unit (ICU).

      Rationale: Clinical ARDS occurs primarily as the result of inflammatory injury to the alveoli
      producing diffuse alveolar damage.

      Objective: To evaluate the effects of an enteral diet enriched with ginger extract on
      inflammatory factors, respiratory profile and outcome of patients with ARDS.

      Methods: In this single center, randomized, controlled double blind study, 32 patients with
      ARDS were randomized to receive a high protein enteral diet enriched with ginger extract or
      placebo.

      Measurements and Main Results: Serum levels of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and LTB-4, oxygenation,
      measured as PaO2/FiO2, static compliance measured on days 0, 5 and 10.

      Patients fed enteral diet enriched with ginger extract had significantly lower serum levels
      of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α and LTB-4 on days 5 and 10 compared to control group (P&lt;0.05).
      Significant improvement in oxygenation was observed on day 5 (P=0.02) and 10 (P=0.003) in
      ginger extract group compared to control group. Static compliance was also increased
      significantly on day 5 (P=0.01) in ginger extract group compared to control group. A
      significant difference was found in duration of mechanical ventilation (P0.02) and length of
      ICU stay (P=0.04) in favor of ginger extract group. We did not find any difference in
      barotraumas, organ failure and mortality between the study groups.

      Conclusions: An enteral diet supplemented with ginger extract in ARDS patients may be
      beneficial for gas exchange and could decrease duration of mechanical ventilation and length
      of stay in ICU.
