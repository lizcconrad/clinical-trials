    <textblock>
      The heart rate variability assessment of the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance is a strong
      analytical tool in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) physiology, at each end of life.

      In neonatology, it represents an important marker for understanding the breath and cardiac
      dysfunction, incriminated in the pathophysiology of unexplained death syndrome and
      apnea-bradycardia of prematurity.

      If recent clinical studies conducted by our team highlight a close link between the
      maturation degree of the ANS and gestational or postnatal age, with a substantial autonomic
      dysfunction in preterm infants, no study to date has focused profile autonomic maturation in
      the first two years of life, as that period for the infant is a vulnerability &quot;window&quot;
      especially cardiopulmonary and neurological.

      Psychomotor prognosis of newborns is more serious if prematurity is important and if
      periventricular leukomalacia or cortical anatomical brain lesions are obvious. However, the
      conventional imaging (Trans fontanel ultrasound, CT, MRI) is not sufficient in the neonatal
      period to thoroughly evaluate the neurological risk situations. During the neonatal period,
      the assessment of autonomic control, in practice easily quantifiable from time and
      frequency-domain analysis of cardiac RR variability, could be a strong marker, at a given
      time, from a neurological disorder undetectable by imaging, including sympathetic and
      parasympathetic nerve conduction dysfunction in some brainstem nuclei and cortical areas.

      The postnatal profile of the autonomic balance, as a marker of well ANS regulation could
      become an additional support to correlate transient or permanent autonomic deficit with a
      psychomotor development disorder at 2 years of age or later. This tool could be a help to
      target the children with a neurological risk and to schedule early therapeutic interventions
      and psychological or educational support.

      To meet this objective, we propose to describe for the first time in a cohort of newborns,
      the cardiac autonomic maturation profile in the first two years of life and the neurological
      evolution at 2 years.

      Main objective.

        -  Describe the pattern, i.e. the cardiac autonomic maturation during the first two years
           of life in a cohort of newborns.

      Secondary objectives.

        -  Correlate in this cohort, the autonomous status at birth to the neurological psychomotor
           status at 2 years.

        -  Describe the autonomic pattern (evolution profile) during the first two years of life.

        -  According to specific criteria of pregnancy (maternal smoking, maternal hypertension and
           gestational age)

        -  According to data of morphometry (stature and weight development) at birth.

        -  According to the neonatal morbidity criteria: - bronchopulmonary dysplasia i.e. oxygen
           dependence at 36 weeks postnatal age, persistent ductus arterious, intra ventricular
           haemorrhage according to the Papille classification, periventricular leukomalacia,
           enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis.

        -  According to the incidence of serious faintness and rhythmic disorders the two first
           years of life.
