    <textblock>
      The Implantable Systems Performance Registry (ISPR) was developed to evaluate the long-term
      reliability and performance of market-released Medtronic Neuromodulation infusion and
      stimulation products.

      Completion Notice: The ISPR was created by Medtronic to monitor the performance of
      commercially available products. This registry was initially designed to track performance of
      Medtronic's implantable infusion and spinal cord stimulation systems beginning in August 2003
      and June 2004, respectively. Medtronic DBS Systems were added to the ISPR in June 2009, and
      Sacral Neuromodulation Systems in April 2010. Medtronic retired the ISPR in April 2016 and
      merged the data collected from this registry into the Product Surveillance Registry (PSR).
      Please refer to that record, Clinical Trials identifier: NCT01524276, for further
      information.
