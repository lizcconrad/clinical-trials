      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying tumor samples in patients undergoing surgery or
      radiation therapy for primary melanoma of the eye.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the feasibility of using fine needle aspiration (FNA) and FISH to determine
           tumor genotype in patients with primary uveal melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize ophthalmic complication rate of FNA for FISH analysis in patients
           undergoing plaque radiotherapy.

        -  To estimate disease-free survival in patients with and without tumor monosomy 3 and/or
           8q amplification.

        -  To explore the relationship between tumor monosomy 3 and 8q amplification and plasma
           levels of tumor immune escape and invasion biomarkers (e.g., circulating granulysin,
           beta2-microglobulin, autotoxin, lysophosphatidic acid, matrix metalloproteinase-7,
           tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, and soluble E- cadherin).

        -  To explore the psychological impact of prognostication in uveal melanoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo plaque radiotherapy, enucleation, or tumor resection based upon
      standard of care guidelines.

      Trans-scleral fine needle aspiration (FNA) is performed at the time of plaque radiotherapy
      and ex vivo FNA is performed on enucleation and tumor resection specimens. Tissue samples are
      analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Blood samples are also collected for
      further analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
