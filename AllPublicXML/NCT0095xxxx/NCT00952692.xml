  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II study to determine the safety and gain insight into the immune response
      of the immunologic agent dHER2+AS15 ASCI when administered in combination with lapatinib.
      This study is for patients with metastatic breast cancer (invasive breast cancer with stage
      IV disease) that overexpresses HER2 and is resistant to trastuzumab (Herceptin).

      The dHER2 + AS15 candidate Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) contains a
      recombinant protein termed dHER2, which is a truncated version of the HER2 protein. HER2 is a
      protein that is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer. This protein is combined with the
      immunological adjuvant AS15 Adjuvant System from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), which is a liposomal
      formulation containing three immunostimulatory components.

      Lapatinib is FDA approved for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of
      subjects with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2.

    <description>Patients will receive dHER2 ASCI injections IM every 2 weeks for 2 cycles . In between cycles there is 4 weeks without vaccine.
For each dose of 500Âµg of dHER2 + AS15 ASCI, two sterile glass vials will be supplied:
One vial with the lyophilized preparation containing 500 ug of recombinant dHER2 antigen combined with the immunostimulant.
One vial with liquid adjuvant diluent. The final dHER2 + AS15 ASCI for administration is obtained by reconstitution of the lyophilized preparation with the adjuvant diluents. A dHER2 + AS15 ASCI dose consists of 0.5 ml.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria are to be checked at the time of study entry. The patients may only
        be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:

          1. The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the
             informed consent form.

          2. Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance
             of any protocol-specific procedure.

          3. The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.

             Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic
             nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.

          4. The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior
             standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).

             Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,

               -  The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for
                  at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.

               -  The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy,
                  but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks
                  before the first ASCI administration.

               -  The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.

          5. For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should
             be met:

               -  Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with
                  liver or lung metastases).

               -  Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the
                  investigator.

               -  Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this
                  therapy.

          6. A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:

               -  Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC,
                  with result IHC 3+) or

               -  Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at
                  least 8 copies).

             Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic
             lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however
             such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary
             tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.

             Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification
             has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively
             carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity
             and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).

          7. The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.

          8. The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.

          9. The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:

               -  White blood cell count &gt;/= 3,000/mm3.

               -  Neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,500/mm3.

               -  Platelet count &gt;/= 100,000/mm3.

               -  Hemoglobin levels &gt;/= 10.0 g/dl.

         10. The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within
             the normal range).

         11. The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:

               -  Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.

               -  Both AST and ALT levels &lt;1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with
                  liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level &lt;1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT
                  levels &lt;3 times the ULN will be accepted.

         12. The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA
             scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.

         13. If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a
             current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is
             of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior
             to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two
             months after completion of the study treatment.

             Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less
             than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned
             in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral
             contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic
             vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or
             intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male
             partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).

             For azoospermia, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's
             medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for
             study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the
             subject's medical records.

             Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual
             cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A
             practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate
             clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. &gt; 45 years.

         14. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

         15. In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements
             of the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the
