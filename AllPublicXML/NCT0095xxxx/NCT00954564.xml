      RATIONALE: Gathering information over time about joint pain and stiffness from postmenopausal
      women with early-stage breast cancer who are receiving aromatase inhibitors may help doctors
      plan treatment and help patients live more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: This observational epidemiologic cohort is designed to study arthralgia,
      patient-reported outcomes, and medication adherence in postmenopausal women with early-stage
      breast cancer who are receiving aromatase inhibitors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate the incidence, time to onset, prevalence, and clinical and demographic
           predictors of arthralgia in post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer
           receiving aromatase inhibitors (AI).

        -  Chart the trajectory of arthralgia symptom severity over the course of AI treatment in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Measure the impact of arthralgia on sleep quality, depression, and physical function in
           these patients.

        -  Develop a roster of current physician-advised or prescribed treatments, including
           self-management techniques being used for AI-induced arthralgia, for intervention
           development.

      OUTLINE: Patients complete questionnaires about joint pain and stiffness, sleep, depression,
      physical function, medications and treatment, exercise and social support, demographics,
      comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), and performance status at baseline and then
      periodically for approximately 1 year after beginning aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy.

      Patient medical records are reviewed for comorbidities, BMI, use of prior hormone replacement
      therapy, vitamin D levels and deficiency, performance status, histological stage, prior
      treatment, and medications at baseline and then periodically for approximately 1 year after
      beginning AI therapy.
