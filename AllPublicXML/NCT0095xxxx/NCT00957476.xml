      pregnancy.

      In addition to the increase in obesity in adult and children, there has been a significant
      increase in birth weights over the last 2 decades. Based on our preliminary data, maternal
      pre-gravid obesity is the strongest risk factor for neonatal as well as adolescent obesity.
      The long-term goals of our research are to examine therapeutic strategies to decrease fetal
      adiposity. Obesity and pregnancy are both insulin resistant conditions associated with
      chronic low-grade inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that n-3 PUFA dietary supplements
      during pregnancy will act as insulin sensitizers decreasing peripheral insulin resistance and
      inflammation. If correct this mechanism should decrease availability of maternal nutrients to
      the fetus and subsequently reduce adiposity at birth. We plan a prospective randomized double
      blind control trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation and placebo in overweight/obese women, with a
      previous cesarean delivery, initiated in early pregnancy and maintained throughout pregnancy.
      This proposal has two specific aims. Specific aim 1 is to evaluate the effect of n-3 PUFA
      supplementation on maternal insulin sensitivity. Measures of maternal insulin sensitivity and
      lipid metabolism will be made using the ISogtt, indirect calorimetry body composition
      (BODPOD) and plasma lipid profile at baseline and after dietary intervention.

      Specific aim 2 will assess the effect of n-3 PUFA on the inflammatory status in
      overweight/obese pregnant women. We hypothesize that n-3 PUFA supplementation decreases
      chronic inflammation during pregnancy by preventing monocyte activation and accumulation of
      macrophages in WAT thus lowering systemic concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We
      plan to characterize the longitudinal changes in circulating monocytes and plasma adipokines
      in order to define the inflammatory patterns in both groups over time. We will also determine
      the abundance and phenotype of macrophages infiltrating WAT using flow cytometry,
      immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling. Furthermore, the role of PPARγ as a
      central target of n-3 PUFA action to regulate insulin sensitivity will be examined by
      characterizing the expression of PPARγ in WAT of both supplemented and control groups.
      Additionally, we will investigate the direct affect of n-3 PUFA on the expression of
      adiponectin and PPARγ regulated genes in primary cultured adipocytes.

      In summary, this proposal combines both clinical and molecular methodologies in an
      overweight/obese subject population in order to assess the effect of n-3 PUFA on inflammation
      and insulin resistance. Preliminary data will also be obtained on fetal body composition in
      order to later address the prevention of the long term adverse effects (developmental
      programming) of maternal obesity in the developing fetus.

          -  Gestational age at randomization between 8-16 weeks

          -  No medical problems such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or pregestational diabetes

          -  Between the ages of 18 and 40 years old

          -  Daily use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents

          -  Allergy to fish or fish products, gluten intolerant (because the placebo contains
             wheat germ oil, which is not gluten free).

          -  Women who are vegetarians and do not eat any fish.

          -  Infants born preterm (less than 36 weeks gestation) or less than 2kg.

          -  Heparin use or known thrombophilia (thrombophilias include homozygous for Factor V
             Leiden).

          -  Moderate or high titer IgG anticardiolipin antibodies or prolonged activated PTT or
             other indication of presence of lupus anticoagulant, homozygous for prothrombin gene
             (G20210A) mutation, antithrombin III deficiency.

          -  Protein S (low levels outside of pregnancy) or Protein C deficiency.

          -  Hyperhomocysteinemia (due to safety concerns because n-3 may affect bleeding time).

          -  Current hypertension or current use of antihypertensive medication (including
             diuretics), due to increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.

          -  Pregestational diabetes due to increased risks of affecting fetal growth. We will not
             exclude women who develop GDM during pregnancy but consider a sub-analyses of these
             women depending on the number of subjects. Known maternal medical complications:
             cancer (including melanoma but excluding other skin cancers).

          -  Current hyperthyroidism if not adequately controlled.

          -  Platelet or red blood cell disorder (including idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, a
             history of alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a previous offspring, significant anemia due
             to hemoglobinopathy but not sickle cell trait. Iron deficiency anemia will NOT be an
             exclusion as long as the hemoglobin is &gt; 8 gm/dl).

          -  Chronic pulmonary disease (asthma of any degree of severity is NOT an exclusion).

          -  Structural, functional or ischemic heart disease. Neither mitral valve prolapse nor
             paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia are considered exclusions.

          -  Known HIV positive with viral load greater than 1,000 copies/ml or CD4 count less than
             350/mm3.

          -  Current or planned cerclage due to interference with the natural cause of delivery.

          -  Illicit drug or alcohol abuse during current pregnancy.

          -  At the time of birth, all infants will be evaluated by a pediatrician to make sure
             that they are healthy. Infants will be excluded from further study if they have any
             medical problems such as respiratory distress syndrome.

          -  Infants will also be excluded if they have any problems that exclude them from having
             estimation of body composition, for e.g. birth weight less than 2 kg.
