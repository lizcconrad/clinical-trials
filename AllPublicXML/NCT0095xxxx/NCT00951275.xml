  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the effect of tocilizumab + DMARDs (Disease Modifying
      Anti-Rheumatic Drugs)on improvement of anemia and fatigue in patients with moderate to severe
      active rheumatoid arthritis. Eligible patients who have had an inadequate response to DMARDs
      will receive tocilizumab 8mg/kg iv every 4 weeks in combination with standard DMARDs, for 6
      months. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is
      100-500 individuals.

    <measure>Improvement in Fatigue at Week 4 Assessed as Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a greater than or equal to (≥)5-point change from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>SF-HLQ Hindrance Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked if their health problems hindered their paid work on a scale of 1 to 3 (1=no, 2=yes, slightly, 3=yes, very much) and their unpaid work including household work, going shopping, odd jobs, specific activities sharing the household on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=performed without being bothered by healthy problems; 1=performed although bothered by health problems; 2=not performed because of health problems; 3=not performed for reasons other than health problems). The total hindrance score for unpaid work was derived by adding up the item scores. This hindrance score is a measure of the hindrance experienced as a result of health problems during the performance of unpaid work. The minimum score per item for hindrance score was 0, maximum score was 2 (Score of 3 was not considered since the reasons were &quot;other than health problems&quot;). Total score was calculated by adding all 4 items together and ranged from 0 (best possible score) to 8 (worst possible score).</description>

        <title>FACIT-F Scores</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a ≥5-point change from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Improvement in Fatigue at Week 4 Assessed as Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scores</title>
        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a greater than or equal to (≥)5-point change from Baseline.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity</title>
          <description>The physician’s assessment of the participant's current disease activity was displayed on a 100-mm horizontal VAS. The left-hand extreme of the line was described as “no disease activity” (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme was considered “maximum disease activity”. The physician’s global assessment of disease activity was completed by the Efficacy Assessor who could or could not be a physician. The assessor was asked to mark the line corresponding to their assessment of the participant's present level of disease activity; the distance from the left edge was recorded.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant’s activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Overall score was computed as the sum of the domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 where 0 (equals)=without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3=unable to perform these actions at all.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked if their health problems hindered their paid work on a scale of 1 to 3 (1=no, 2=yes, slightly, 3=yes, very much) and their unpaid work including household work, going shopping, odd jobs, specific activities sharing the household on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=performed without being bothered by healthy problems; 1=performed although bothered by health problems; 2=not performed because of health problems; 3=not performed for reasons other than health problems). The total hindrance score for unpaid work was derived by adding up the item scores. This hindrance score is a measure of the hindrance experienced as a result of health problems during the performance of unpaid work. The minimum score per item for hindrance score was 0, maximum score was 2 (Score of 3 was not considered since the reasons were &quot;other than health problems&quot;). Total score was calculated by adding all 4 items together and ranged from 0 (best possible score) to 8 (worst possible score).</description>

        <title>Efficiency as Assessed by SF-HLQ</title>
        <description>Participants were ask to rate their efficiency in working on a scale of of 0 to 10 (0=very worse, 10=as usual). Overall efficiency score was based on the first 6 items of Question 6, which is a descriptive instrument comprised of 7 items designed to evaluate the specific problems affecting production. These 7 items relate to the effect of health problems on concentration, work pace, the need to be alone, making decisions, postponing and transferring work to others. The participant can choose from 4 possible answers: (almost) never, sometimes, often and (nearly) always. Efficiency score range=6 to 24; higher scores indicate higher impairment.</description>

          <title>Efficiency as Assessed by SF-HLQ</title>
          <description>Participants were ask to rate their efficiency in working on a scale of of 0 to 10 (0=very worse, 10=as usual). Overall efficiency score was based on the first 6 items of Question 6, which is a descriptive instrument comprised of 7 items designed to evaluate the specific problems affecting production. These 7 items relate to the effect of health problems on concentration, work pace, the need to be alone, making decisions, postponing and transferring work to others. The participant can choose from 4 possible answers: (almost) never, sometimes, often and (nearly) always. Efficiency score range=6 to 24; higher scores indicate higher impairment.</description>
