    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS- Excited Component (EC) subscale score will be calculated by adding together the following item scores: excitement (positive subscale item 4); hostility (positive subscale item 7); tension (general subscale item 4); uncooperativeness (general subscale item 8); poor impulse control (general subscale item 14). This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 'absent' to 'extremely severe' (score range 5 to 35 points; mean scores = 20 points clinically corresponds to severe agitation). Lower value gives the better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Final Visit at Day 21 in PANSS Positive, General Psychopathological Scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Positive scale includes 7 Items (Delusions, Conceptual disorganization, Hallucinations, Hyperactivity, Grandiosity, Suspiciousness/persecution, Hostility)and is calculated by adding the positive subscale item scores. Minimum score is 7, maximum score is 49. General Psychopathology scale:16 items (Somatic concern, Anxiety, Guilt feelings, Tension, Mannerisms and posturing, Depression, Motor retardation, Uncooperativeness, Unusual thought content, Disorientation, Poor attention, Lack of judgment and insight, Disturbance of volition, Poor impulse control, Preoccupation, Active social avoidance). Minimum score is 16, maximum score is 112. The higher score- the worse outcome. The biggest reduction of score from baseline- a better efficacy.
Measure includes PANSS-Positive (range 8-30), PANSS-General Psychopathological (PANSS-G)(range 17-70), total PANSS score (range 37-143), PANSS aggression, hostility and depression cluster scores (range 4-19).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. It is calculated by adding together PANSS-Positive (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49, PANSS-Negative (minimum score = 7, maximum score = 49), PANSS-General Psychopathological (PANSS-G) subscale scores (minimum score = 16, maximum score = 112), supplementary subscale item scores. The minimum is 30, maximum is 210. Total PANSS score classification: Mildly ill 58- 74, Moderately ill 75-94, Markly ill 95- 115, Severely ill &gt;116.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression, Severity (CGI-S) is a single-item (7-point) scale that evaluates the overall severity of the subject's mental illness. A reduction in score indicates an improvement in the subject's condition. The CGI-S assessment should be based upon the subject's symptoms during the previous week.
Change from baseline in CGI-S score is calculated by subtracting the CGI-S score at baseline from the CGI-S score at the relevant time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Absolute Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression, Improvement (CGI-I) is a single-item (7-point) scale that evaluates the overall improvement in the subject's mental. A reduction in score indicates an improvement in the subject's condition. This assessment is based on the improvement since initiation of the study treatment.
Change in CGI-I score is analyzed by comparing CSI-score at the relevant time point to the baseline CGI-I score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) Score Compared From Baseline to Day 21.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Excited Component was used to evaluate the control of agitation and aggression in patients with schizophrenia.
Difference in mean score at baseline and day 21 is used to assess the improvement. It is shown by reduction in mean score and confirmed by p value lower than 0,05.
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) is a subscale score which is calculated by adding together the following item scores: excitement (positive subscale item 4); hostility (positive subscale item 7); tension (general subscale item 4); uncooperativeness (general subscale item 8); poor impulse control (general subscale item 14).
This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 'absent' to 'extremely severe' (score range 5 to 35 points; mean scores = 20 points clinically corresponds to severe agitation).</description>

        <description>PANSS- Excited Component (EC) subscale score will be calculated by adding together the following item scores: excitement (positive subscale item 4); hostility (positive subscale item 7); tension (general subscale item 4); uncooperativeness (general subscale item 8); poor impulse control (general subscale item 14). This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from âabsentâ to âextremely severeâ (score range 5 to 35 points; mean scores = 20 points clinically corresponds to severe agitation). Lower value gives the better outcome.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) Score</title>
          <description>PANSS- Excited Component (EC) subscale score will be calculated by adding together the following item scores: excitement (positive subscale item 4); hostility (positive subscale item 7); tension (general subscale item 4); uncooperativeness (general subscale item 8); poor impulse control (general subscale item 14). This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from âabsentâ to âextremely severeâ (score range 5 to 35 points; mean scores = 20 points clinically corresponds to severe agitation). Lower value gives the better outcome.</description>

Difference in mean score at baseline and day 21 is used to assess the improvement. It is shown by reduction in mean score and confirmed by p value lower than 0,05.
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Excited Component (PANSS-EC) is a subscale score which is calculated by adding together the following item scores: excitement (positive subscale item 4); hostility (positive subscale item 7); tension (general subscale item 4); uncooperativeness (general subscale item 8); poor impulse control (general subscale item 14).
This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 'absent' to 'extremely severe' (score range 5 to 35 points; mean scores = 20 points clinically corresponds to severe agitation).</description>

This is rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 'absent' to 'extremely severe' (score range 5 to 35 points; mean scores = 20 points clinically corresponds to severe agitation).</description>
