  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent in patients with schizophrenia and is a
      major risk factor of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and early death. Genetic
      factors, antipsychotic medication, sleeping disturbances and unhealthy lifestyle are possible
      causes of developing metabolic syndrome. Several studies have investigated the metabolic
      side-effects of antipsychotic medication. However it is still unanswered how unhealthy
      lifestyle, comprising physical inactivity, smoking, unhealthy dieting, and sleeping
      disturbances adds to the metabolic risk of patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study
      is to investigate the prevalence and development of MetS in first-episode patients with
      schizophrenia and 1 year after onset of treatment. The study's main hypothesis is that
      physical inactivity, regardless of medication, is an independent risk factor for metabolic
      syndrome in patients with schizophrenia. In comparison inpatients with major depression and
      healthy controls, both matched on gender, age and level of education will be included in the
      study. It is anticipated that the study's results will provide new knowledge about the risk
      of developing metabolic syndrome in first-episode schizophrenia and how different risk
      factors contribute to this.
