    <textblock>
      Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has become a major life-saving treatment for
      many haematological conditions, mostly malignancies.

      However, there are lots of potential complications that hinder the long-term success of HSCT,
      in which bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is one of such serious complications.
      Basically, BOS represents a form of graft-versus-host immunological damage of small airways
      (bronchioles), leading to progressive narrowing of small airways and thus obstructive lung
      function abnormalities. With progressive loss of lung function in BOS, patients after HSCT
      can be complicated by intractable respiratory failure that results in mortality. Up until
      now, there is still no reliable way to accurately predict or detect BOS early to allow
      pharmacological interventions.

      Therefore there is intense interest in the search for biomarkers that can help to predict the
      occurrence of BOS after HSCT. Apart from biomarkers (e.g., cytokines) in blood, there has
      been recent development in the sampling of airway lining fluid by a non-invasive method,
      i.e., collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC). In airway diseases such as asthma or
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, EBC has been found to have various cytokines which can
      serve as potential biomarkers of disease activity. Since BOS is largely a small airway
      disease, it becomes logical to investigate the profile of biomarkers in EBC as predictors for
      BOS after HSCT.

      Therefore this study has been designed to look into the role of biomarkers in blood and EBC
      in early detection of BOS after HSCT.

      Haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has revolutionized the treatment of both
      haematological and perhaps some solid malignancies. However, despite recent technological
      advancements, HSCT is still associated with significant mortality and morbidities.

      Apart from various infective complications in early stage post-HSCT, bronchiolitis obliterans
      syndrome (BOS) has been a well-known late complication that can result in high mortality. It
      has been mostly associated with those who develop chronic graft-versus-host disease after
      allogeneic HSCT. Clinically, the diagnosis of BOS is largely based on demonstration of
      obstructive lung function abnormalities and air-trapping in computed tomography scan of
      thorax. Pathologically, bronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by both inflammatory and
      fibrotic reactions in the small bronchioles leading to subsequent obliteration. Upon
      diagnosis of BOS post-HSCT, inhaled corticosteroid (with or without bronchodilators) is
      commonly prescribed as anti-inflammatory agent, though with undocumented clinical efficacy.
      Unfortunately, there is still a lack of reliable biomarkers that can predict or allow early
      detection of BOS, preferably in the early and potentially reversible stage of development of
      BOS.

      Apart from measuring circulating biomarkers in blood, exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has
      recently emerged as a non-invasive sampling method for real-time analysis and evaluation of
      oxidative stress biomarkers in the lower respiratory tract airways, especially in various
      lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. As
      bronchiolitis obliterans is predominantly a disease of the small bronchioles, it is highly
      likely to be associated with changes in various inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers
      in EBC. However, the role of measuring EBC biomarkers in predicting the occurrence of BOS
      after HSCT has not been studied. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the temporal
      changes of various oxidative stress biomarkers and cytokines in EBC and blood in patients
      with haematological conditions who undergo allogeneic HSCT, with regard to the subsequent
      development of BOS.
