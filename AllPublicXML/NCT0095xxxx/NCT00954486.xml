  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of epoetin alfa to raise
      hemoglobin (Hb) levels in elderly outpatients with unexplained anemia. The secondary
      objectives of this study are to assess the ability of epoetin alfa to improve physical
      function; cognitive function; and quality of life, and to assess the safety of epoetin alfa
      in the study population.

      Eligible subjects will be recruited out of the companion study &quot;Anemia in the Elderly&quot;
      (NCT00640172), after active participation in that study is complete. Subjects will have had a
      full hematologic evaluation, and unexplained anemia will have been previously defined.

      Subjects will provide baseline physical function testing, including exercise testing on a
      treadmill and testing how far patients can walk in 6 minutes (walk test), as well as quality
      of life; activity level; and mental functioning.

      Study visits will be weekly, and the dose level may be adjusted to achieve the target
      hemoglobin level within 16 weeks. Once at target, the drug will be taken for a total of 12
      additional weeks. The maximum time on the study drug could be 28 weeks, and the minimum time
      be on the 14 weeks.

      The walk tests and questionnaires will be repeated when the target hemoglobin level is
      reached, and when treatment is completed. The tests about quality of life, activity level,
      and mental functioning will be repeated at the end of treatment. Follow-up visits will be
      every 4 weeks for 12 weeks to check for side effects.
