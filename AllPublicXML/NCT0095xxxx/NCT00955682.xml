      Subjects were previously vaccinated at 12 to 23 months of age. This extension study starts 24
      months after vaccination and the subjects who were vaccinated in the primary study will be
      enrolled in this extension phase. No new subjects will be enrolled.

      This study will assess the long-term protection offered by the new meningococcal vaccine
      134612 compared to Meningitec™ up to 4 years after vaccination of toddlers. Subjects were
      previously vaccinated at 12 to 23 months of age with GSK Biologicals' meningococcal vaccine
      134612 or Meningitec™. All subjects received at least one dose of Priorix-Tetra™. This
      extension phase starts 24 months after vaccination and the subjects who were vaccinated in
      the primary study will be enrolled in this extension study. No new subjects will be enrolled.
      The subjects will have a blood sample taken at 24, 36 and 48 months after primary
      vaccination.

      At Year 4 subjects will be boosted with the same meningococcal vaccine as given in the
      primary study, i.e. either the new meningococcal vaccine GSK 134612 or Meningitec™. Blood
      samples will be taken 1 and 12 months after the booster vaccination.

             toxin protein and/or tetanus toxoid.

          -  History of hypersensitivity after previous administration of Meningitec or the
             investigational vaccines in study 109670.

          -  Hypersensitivity to latex.

          -  Planned administration/ administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the protocol
             within one month before and 30 days after the booster dose.

          -  Previous vaccination with any component of the vaccines within the last month.
