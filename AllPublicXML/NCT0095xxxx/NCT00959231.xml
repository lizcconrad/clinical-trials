      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor
      umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining abnormal cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and mycophenolate
      mofetil before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of donor umbilical cord blood
      transplant after cyclophosphamide, fludarabine phosphate, and total-body irradiation in
      treating patients with hematologic disease.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the safety and efficacy of unrelated-donor umbilical cord blood
           transplantation (UCBT) using a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen in patients with
           hematological disease, in a multi-institution UK setting.

        -  To confirm that unrelated-donor UCBT following nonmyeloablative conditioning is
           associated with consistent and durable engraftment in these patients.

        -  To assess transplant-related mortality at day 100 associated with nonmyeloablative UCBT
           in these patients.

        -  To assess the incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in
           these patients.

        -  To assess the risk of relapse and progressive disease in these patients at 1 year post
           transplant after nonmyeloablative UCBT.

        -  To assess overall and progression-free survival of these patients at 1 year after
           nonmyeloablative UCBT.

        -  To assess immune reconstitution at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after transplant as
           measured by quantitative recovery of B, T, and NK cells (flow cytometry), qualitative
           recovery of T cells (TREC and spectratyping), in vivo functional T-cell responses (EBV
           and CMV tetramers), and quantitative immunoglobulins.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2
           hours on day -6 and fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -2. Patients
           undergo a single fraction of total-body irradiation on day -1.

        -  Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation: Patients undergo umbilical cord blood
           transplantation on day 0.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV or orally on days -3
           to 100 followed by taper and mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally on days -3 to 35
           followed by taper.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months in year 1, every
      4 months in year 2, every 6 months until 5 years, and then annually thereafter.
