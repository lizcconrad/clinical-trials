  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous platelet rich fibrin matrix will release growth factors which could increase the
      production of dermal proteins or affect the vascularity and status of neighboring tissues.
      This study is designed to evaluate the histologic and biochemical effect of injection of
      platelet rich fibrin matrix into the skin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be treated with platelet rich fibrin matrix into the skin of the inner aspect
      of the upper arm. Injected areas will be monitored clinically and will also undergo biopsies
      between 30 minutes and 12 weeks after treatment. Specimen of treated areas will undergo
      histologic and biochemical analysis and comparison to standard laboratory control specimen of
      untreated skin.

        <description>Biopsy specimen will be obtained from PRFM treated skin, sectioned and stained with H&amp;E. Qualitative differences from standard laboratory control specimen of normal untreated skin (not obtained from study participants) in dermal and sub dermal vascularity (as determined by the the number of specimen with greater than 5 immature capillaries per high powered field) after treatment with platelet rich fibrin matrix will be reported. Individual treated specimen were evaluated at 1 week after treatment, and the results used to determine the general qualitative changes and time frame for the effects of treatment.</description>
