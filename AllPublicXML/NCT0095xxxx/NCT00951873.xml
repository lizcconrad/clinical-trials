  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the
      safety, local tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile (the determination of the
      concentration of the administered medication in blood over time) of long acting activated
      recombinant human factor VII when injected subcutaneously (under the skin).
