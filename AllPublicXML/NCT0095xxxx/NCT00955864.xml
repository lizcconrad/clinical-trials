      Background:

        -  The uterine cervix is composed of muscle and collagen, which change as women age and
           under hormonal influences like puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Yet even though
           knowledge of structure of the cervix (especially the collagen network) is important to
           detect problems that may affect pregnancy and other women s health issues, no
           noninvasive techniques are available to evaluate such changes.

        -  A specially designed polarized camera attached to a conventional colposcope can be used
           to take cervical images. Analyzing these images may enable researchers to better
           visualize the collagen network in the cervix.

      Objectives:

        -  To explore and gain experience with the use of a polarized imaging system to study
           cervical structure.

        -  To evaluate the usefulness of a polarized imaging system in studying the cervical
           structure of healthy nonpregnant women.

      Eligibility:

      - Adult females (at least 18 years of age) who are having regular menstrual cycles and are
      not on hormonal medications.

      Design:

        -  Images will be takes from the cervix in two different phases of menstruation cycle time,
           one in the follicular phase (before ovulation) and another one in the luteal phase
           (after ovulation).

        -  The images of the cervix will be taken with a vaginal speculum in place with the camera
           attached to a colposcope. The colposcope will illuminate the cervix using polarized
           light. Three random cervical locations will be photographed

    <textblock>
      The uterine cervix is composed of muscle and collagen which changes as women age and under
      hormonal influences like after puberty, during pregnancy, and with menopause. It has been
      determined that during pregnancy, prior to cervical ripening, cross linked collagen fibrils
      are organized in tight bundles which provide tensile strength, rigidity and stiffness. As the
      cervix ripens in preparation for labor, cervical collagen concentration is decreases and
      solubility increases. However, there are no noninvasive techniques available to evaluate such
      structural changes especially of the collagen of cervix. Developing a non-invasive way to
      evaluate the characteristics of cervical structure and collagen may aid in identifying women
      who are at risk of early cervical dilation. A specially designed polarized camera attached to
      a conventional colposcope can be used to take cervical images. Analyzing these images may
      enable us to visualize the collagen network in cervix. The purpose of this study is to
      explore the usefulness of polarized camera images in evaluating the cervical structure of
      healthy women at different ages. After evaluating and validating this approach in healthy,
      nonpregnant women, we plan to assess the cervical structure of pregnant women, some of whom
      may be at risk of early cervical dilation.
