  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of capecitabine and cetuximab as first-line therapy will result in improved
      progression free survival compared to single agent capecitabine in patients with KRAS wild
      type colorectal cancer. Patients who are not able or willing to take Oxaliplatin/Irinotecan
      combination therapy are eligible for this study.
