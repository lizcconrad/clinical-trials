      RATIONALE: Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients
      with small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the therapeutic activity of sunitinib malate in patients with either
           chemonaïve extensive stage or sensitive relapsed small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the safety of sunitinib malate in these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To determine the potential of FDG-PET-scan to serve as a surrogate marker of response
           for the antiangiogenic activity of the compound.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease stage
      (chemonaïve extensive stage vs sensitive relapse at least 3 months after stopping
      chemotherapy).

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily for up to 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography of the chest at week 4.
      Blood samples and bronchial washings and brushings may be collected at baseline and at 4 and
      8 weeks after start of therapy for further analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
