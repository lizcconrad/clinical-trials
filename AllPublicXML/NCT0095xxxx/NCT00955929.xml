  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (RP) is performed, recovery of erectile
      function (rigid erections) is reported for up to 80% of patients, who are less than 60 years
      old. Erectile function recovery is also impacted by patient age, erectile function before
      surgery, and the length of time after surgery.

      Current evidence from studies suggests that developing erections is important, however, these
      studies have been small, and the evidence is not definite. Animal studies suggest that
      erection medication (Viagra, Levitra, Cialis) may protect erection tissue, even in the
      absence of erections. However, the correct treatment plan is unknown. For example, how often
      does a man need to take sildenafil (Viagra®) to protect his erectile function or to maximize
      his erectile function recovery? Is only using erection medication enough for erectile
      function recovery? Would penile injections, which almost ensure production of an erection, be
      better than using sildenafil (Viagra®), or might a combination be even better at helping
      recovery of erections? These are types of questions this study might answer.

    <description>Pts will be offered sildenafil 100 mg to be used before intercourse on an as-required basis. They will be given six 100 mg doses, per month, for a 12-month duration. Each patient in this group will use a placebo pill (blinded) each night, except on a nights that 100mg is taken for the purpose of sexual relations. Patients will be evaluated in the clinic and will complete the questionnaires at baseline (pre-treatment evaluation), 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after the operation. At 12 months postoperatively, all patients will stop treatment. Visits 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months will have ±2 week window.</description>
