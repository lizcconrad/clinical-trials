  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      GS-9411 in healthy male volunteers. GS-9411 is a sodium channel inhibitor, that may restore
      airway hydration and mucociliary clearance in the lung.

      GS-9411 is being evaluated as a potential therapy to improve airway hydration and mucociliary
      clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. This study is evaluating the safety and
      tolerability of 4 dose levels of GS-9411 as an inhaled product, compared to a matched
      placebo.
