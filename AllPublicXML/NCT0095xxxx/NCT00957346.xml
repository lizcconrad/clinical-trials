    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine the clinical advantage of pre-treatment with
      mifepristone in second trimester misoprostol induction abortion. This will be a randomized
      controlled double-blinded trial of 20 women comparing misoprostol alone to mifepristone plus
      misoprostol for second trimester (14-21 weeks' LMP) medical abortion.
