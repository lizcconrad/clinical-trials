  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective and pilot study to determine through confocal
      endomicroscopy diagnostic microscopic features detectable at the gastroesophageal junction of
      patients with non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease.

      The hypothesis is that minimal mucosal changes occur in non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux
      disease. Although these minimal changes are not always visible on white-light endoscopy, it
      is detectable using high-resolution confocal endomicroscopy and these confocal features are
      diagnostic of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Asia, up to 70% of patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux symptoms could have
      non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), in which case, no detectable mucosal break may be observed
      on conventional white-light endoscopy. However, minimal change lesions are often visible upon
      high-resolution endoscopy and on microscopic examination of biopsied specimens. The most
      commonly seen microscopic features are dilated intercellular space, infiltration of
      inflammatory cells into squamous epithelia, hyperplasia of the epithelial basal cell and
      elongation of the papillae. So far, the most consistent histologic change found in NERD has
      been the dilated intercellular space in esophageal epithelium. But until now, determinations
      of intercellular space dilatations could only be done ex-vivo on biopsy specimens using
      transmission electron microscopy or light microscopy. With the advent of high-resolution
      confocal laser endomicroscopy, in-vivo determination of intercellular space dilatations and
      other diagnostic microscopic features could be a reality. This study is aimed at exploring
      such a clinical possibility and feasibility, with the intention of comparing the microscopic
      findings based on confocal endomicroscopy with that of symptoms, and esophageal pH.
