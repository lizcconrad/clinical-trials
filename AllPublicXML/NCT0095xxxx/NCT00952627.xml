  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Pycnogenol, a natural pine bark extract, is
      effective in modifying the age-dependent process of cardiac fibrosis and diastolic function
      in aged hypertensive subjects.

    <textblock>
      Diastolic heart failure without left ventricular systolic dysfunction comprises 30% to 50% of
      heart failure in clinical practice, and hypertensive heart disease is a major cause of this
      type of heart failure. The complication of myocardial fibrosis should be avoided in
      hypertensive heart disease, because increasing ventricular stiffness caused by myocardial
      fibrosis leads to the development of diastolic dysfunction of the heart. Diastolic
      dysfunction in patients with prolonged hypertension is often associated with myocardial
      fibrosis in addition to muscular hypertrophy as a final feature of hypertensive heart
      disease. The high risk of developing maladaptive cardiac remodeling during hypertension, and
      failure of pharmacological treatments to limit or even reverse this progressive stiffening of
      the myocardium, has led to the study of effects of Pycnogenol, a bioflavonoid-rich pine bark
      extract, with pleiotropic actions on cardiovascular system. Pycnogenol prevents adverse
      hypertension-induced myocardial remodeling in mice, through modulation of gene expression and
      activity of enzyme matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, affecting
      myocardial collagen degradation rate. Despite the mounting evidence suggesting the
      anti-remodeling effect of Pycnogenol in animal models, the clinical efficacy of Pycnogenol in
      hypertension-induced diastolic dysfunction is unreported. This leads to our central
      hypothesis that Pycnogenol reverses the hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis and diastolic
      dysfunction in hypertensive patients. Therefore in this clinical investigation, we will
      investigate the effects of Pycnogenol in modifying hypertension-induced cardiac fibrosis (by
      measuring the serum markers of myocardial fibrosis and collagen turnover) and diastolic
      dysfunction (by transthoracic echocardiogram). We expect to improve diastolic function and
      ameliorate myocardial fibrosis with the nutritional supplement Pycnogenol, by modulation of
      MMPs and TIMPs enzyme activities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subjects will consist of ambulatory males and females, 50-75 years of age, of any
             race, diagnosed with hypertension (diagnosis made over 6 months), and
             echocardiographic evidence of grade I or II diastolic dysfunction.

          -  There is no need for standardization of hypertension treatment, as we select only
             patients who have diastolic dysfunction during treatment.
