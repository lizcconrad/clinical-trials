    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study is to compare gait kinematics and the return to
      normalization of gait in patients that have undergone a Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) via the
      direct anterior approach versus the posterior approach. Gait kinematics will be measured
      using the IDEEA LifeGait device from Minisun (Fresno, CA).

      This is a prospective study of two different surgical approaches to THA, direct anterior vs
      posterior approach in approximately 64 patients that meet the standard criteria for the
      implantation of primary total hip replacement utilizing the Medacta implants and have elected
      to undergo THA.
