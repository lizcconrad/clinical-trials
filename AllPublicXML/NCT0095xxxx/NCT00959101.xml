    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the
      bioequivalence of repaglinide and metformin combination tablet versus repaglinide and
      metformin as coadministered tablets after meal.

      The trial is designed as a three-period, six-sequence, single-dose, crossover pharmacokinetic
      trial where the trial participant is randomised to one of six possible treatment periods
      (Williams design). The trial participant will receive one single dose of each trial product
      in varying order.
