      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin 0.4mg (Harnal®
      D. 0.2mg, 2T) in patients with LUTS/BPH refractory to tamsulosin 0.2mg (Harnal® D 0.2mg, 1T).

    <textblock>
      Alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists have become the primary medical treatment for lower urinary
      tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The next treatment
      method is trans-urethral resection of prostate (TURP). TURP is the most efficient BPH
      treatment for relieving symptoms and improving uroflow, but it is also the invasive and
      morbid.

      Tamsulosin has higher selectivity for the pharmacological a1-adrenoceptor subtype and the
      cloned a1a subtype than for the a1b subtype. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg improved Qmax to a slightly
      greater extent than alfuzosin 10 mg.(26% and 16% versus baseline, respectively)(http://www.
      fda.gov/cder/approval/ index.htm;accessed October 27, 2003.) and Tamsulosin 0.4 mg o.d. has
      been reported to be well tolerated irrespective of age and/or cardiovascular
      comorbidity/co-medication (Michel et al 1998) and no interaction with several
      antihypertensive agents has been reported. (Lowe et al. 1997) Our study is to explore the
      efficacy and safety of tamsulosin 0.4mg (Harnal® D. 0.2mg, 2T) in patients with LUTS/BPH
      refractory to tamsulosin 0.2mg (Harnal® D 0.2mg, 1T).
