    <description>Survey contains information about when the drug was approved by the FDA (2009)and a directive warning (i.e., stating the issue and why it matters) for new drugs.
This directive warning mentions that serious drug side effects may emerge only after the drug is already on the market, and the reader should ask their doctor there is an available drug with a longer track record.</description>
