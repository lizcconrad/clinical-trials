  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if the administration of a cholesterol lowering
      drug like ezetimibe will reduce circulating omega-3 fatty acid (ALA) levels in patients with
      heart disease and hypercholesterolemia.

      The investigators hypothesize that their data will discover that patients receiving ezetimibe
      require additional dietary supplementation with omega-3 supplements to insure that these
      beneficial fatty acids are available to these patients.

      All patients will undergo drug therapy as required to treat their clinical symptoms including
      the use of other classes of cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins (that will not interfere
      with intestinal cholesterol levels). One group of patients will be those who in addition to
      there existing drug therapy are prescribed ezetimibe to lower circulating cholesterol
      concentrations. A second group of patients will be those who are not prescribed ezetimibe as
      part of their normal course of therapy. Blood samples will be taken from all patients at the
      study baseline. All patients will be fasted for 12 hours prior to the blood sample being
      taken. After 6 weeks a second blood sample will be taken. This will determine if the drug
      intervention (ezetimibe) influenced the circulating omega-3 fatty acid concentration.

      It will also be of interest to determine if drug administration (ezetimibe) will influence
      this process when higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids are given to the patients by dietary
      supplements of ALA. Two additional groups of patients will consume a flaxseed oil supplement
      containing 1g of ALA in the form of two capsules daily
