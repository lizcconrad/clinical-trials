  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid sequence intubation is used, when there is an elevated risk of aspiration to the lungs
      of stomach content. It is typically used in acute settings that require acute surgery or in
      prehospital settings, but also in specific risk patients requiring elective surgery. The
      reason for conducting rapid sequence intubation is to minimize the risk of pulmonary
      aspiration and at the same time achieve a fast induction of anaesthesia and intubation. Rapid
      sequence intubation is a procedure with a high risk of complications in itself. The time
      period from induction of anaesthesia to intubation is particularly risky, because the patient
      is apneic. This study addresses this problem by investigating, how quickly spontaneous
      respiration can be reestablished after a rapid sequence intubation when using
      Rocuronium-Sugammadex compared to Succinylcholine. This is a pilot protocol that is intended
      to establish a sample size for the full protocol.

      Study hypothesis: The time from correct tube placement to spontaneous respiration is shorter
      when using Rocuronium/Sugammadex compared to Succinylcholine.
