    <textblock>
      Carbon Monoxide (CO) exposure kills and injures thousands of children and families each year.
      Although there is growing concern about the need to increase carbon monoxide detector use,
      little is known about how best to do so, especially for low-income families. The objective of
      this research is to determine whether a brief intervention, Project Carbon Monoxide Detector
      Education (Project CODE), will increase CO detector use. For this study, parents of children,
      18 years or younger, will be randomly assigned to receive Project CODE (an educational tool
      and a CO detector) or usual care (a flyer on CO poisoning); both of which will be delivered
      in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) examination rooms. The use of a CO detector and
      the participant's current stage in the theory of stage-based behavior change—the Precaution
      Adoption Process Model (PAPM), will be assessed at enrollment and then again at the home
      visits which will occur two-weeks and six-months following the PED visit. The investigators
      hypothesize that parents receiving Project CODE will have working CO detectors and will be
      further along in the PAPM than parents in the control group at the two-week and six-month
      home visits. The long term goal of this research is to reduce the number of injuries and
      deaths from CO poisoning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poisoning from Carbon Monoxide (CO) is among the leading causes of non-fatal injuries treated
      in US hospital emergency departments and accounts for approximately 500 unintentional deaths
      each year. Known effective countermeasures to detect CO and reduce CO poisoning exist, yet
      are not routinely utilized. Although there is increasing concern about the need to increase
      CO detector use, little is known about how best to do so, especially for low income families.
      This research aims to address this gap, by applying a theory of stage-based behavior
      change—the Precaution Adoption Process Model PAPM)—to a brief intervention feasible for a
      busy emergency department setting. A randomized trial will be conducted involving 300
      families with children 18 years or younger. In the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED),
      eligible parents will randomly be assigned to receive the Project CODE intervention (an
      educational tool and a CO detector) or usual care (a flyer on CO poisoning). The use of a CO
      detector and participant's PAPM stage will be assessed at enrollment and again at follow-up
      home visits occurring two-weeks and six-months following the PED visit. We hypothesize that
      parents receiving Project CODE will have working CO detectors and will be further along in
      the PAPM than parents in the control group at a two-week and six-month follow-up home visits.
      By examining the extent to which the intervention increases CO detector use, these findings
      will also demonstrate how innovative health communications (brief interventions delivered in
      the PED) can reduce the risk of injuries among vulnerable children. This research builds on
      and extends the investigators' previous work on behavioral theory, injury prevention
      interventions delivered in the PED, and development and evaluation of interactive educational
      tools for safety practices. The specific aims of this project are as follows: Aim 1—Determine
      whether a brief intervention will increase CO detector use and PAPM stage among parents whose
      children are being seen in a PED compared to parents of children receiving routine care CO
      flyer; and Aim 2—Determine whether and to what extent socioeconomic status moderates the
      effect of the intervention. Findings from this research study will have both theoretical and
      practical applications for improving injury prevention services in PEDs. This single-site
      efficacy trial is the first step in determining whether a brief intervention in the PED will
      successfully increase CO detector use.

    <description>Parents will be randomly assigned into a control and intervention group. Both groups will complete a computer based survey at enrollment and at their home visits occuring two weeks and approximately six months following enrollment. Participants will be given the following materials at enrollment.
Intervention:
Fast Facts about Carbon Monoxide Educational Tool
Kidde Nighthawk Carbon Monoxide Alarm
Control:
- Central Ohio Poison Control Center Flyer</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Educational Tool &amp; Carbon Monoxide Alarm</intervention_name>
    <description>Based on the recommendations from the expert panel and focus group meetings, Fast Facts about Carbon Monoxide was developed to be an educational tool aimed at helping parents understand the dangers of CO and the need CO alarms in every home. In addition, this tool will help parents select and purchase the correct CO alarm, as well as properly install and maintain the alarm in their home. Each parent assigned to the intervention group will be given a Fast Facts about Carbon Monoxide educational tool and a Kidde Nighthawk Carbon Monoxide Alarm at enrollment.</description>

             are written in English to be eligible for Project CODE.

          -  Parent/Guardian: The parent/guardian is the actual study participant, not the child,
             even if the child is eighteen years-old. The child treated in the PED must be
             accompanied by an English-speaking adult and that adult must be the person responsible
