      The aim of the study is to measure the effectiveness of treatment over 7 days with commonly
      used anti-inflammatory medications namely etoricoxib and diclofenac (Voltaren) on reducing
      the severity of pain, swelling and loss of function (range of movement, proprioception)
      arising from a mild to moderate sprain (partial tear) of the lateral (outer) ligaments of the
      ankle joint. This injury is commonly known as an ankle sprain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 45 years (Rationale: Most injuries occur in this age group, older subjects
             are more likely to have concomitant pathology e.g. osteoarthrosis)

          -  Acute lateral ankle ligament sprain less than 48 hours ago (Rationale: It is important
             to standardize the phase of the injury and enter at the time of the maximum
             inflammatory response, but this has to be balanced with enough time to allow injured
             subjects to access the treatment facility, and that all measurements can be completed)

          -  Grade II ankle sprain injury according to the following: (Rationale: Standard clinical
             criteria are used to ensure that the severity of injury is similar in all subjects)

               -  Mild to moderate pain (&gt; 40mm on the VAS)

               -  Mild to moderate lateral ankle swelling (Greater than 5% increase in ankle volume
                  compared with the uninjured side according to volumetric assessment)

               -  Tenderness over the anterior talofibular ligament

          -  Negative urine and serum pregnancy test (females only) with signed undertaking on use
             of adequate contraception for the duration of the trial (Rationale: This is to make
             sure that no pregnant female subjects are entered or can become pregnant during the
             trial as a safety precaution against drug use in pregnancy)

          -  No use of analgesics or oral or intramuscular anti-inflammatory drugs in the last 24
             hours (Rationale: This is to ensure that at the time of the first assessment, no
             subject has taken oral or intramuscular medication that may influence the initial
             assessments of pain and swelling)

          -  No use of topical anti-inflammatory agents, ice application or compression in the last
             12 hours (Rationale: This is to ensure that at the time of the first assessment, no
             subject has taken topical medication, or used ice or compression that may influence
             the initial assessments of pain and swelling)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of an ankle sprain in the previous 12 months (Rationale: A
             recent previous injury in the ligaments may affect the healing of a new injury)

          -  The presence of an ankle fracture as diagnosed on normal radiographs - using the
             Ottowa ankle rules. (Rationale: This is to ensure that subjects only suffer from a
             soft tissue injury, so that the study group is homogeneous)

          -  Patients who have experienced bronchospasm, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps,
             angioneurotic oedema, urticaria, or allergic-type reactions after taking
             acetylsalicylic acid, NSAID's,(including COXIBS) , antipyretics or any of their
             excipients. (Rationale: This is to ensure that no subject who has a history of
             hypersensitivity to drugs is given drugs that may cause an allergic reaction)

          -  Patients who have a sulphonamide allergy. (Rationale: This is to ensure that no
             subject who has a history of hypersensitivity to certain drugs is given drugs that may
             cause an allergic reaction)

          -  Active peptic ulcer within the previous six months (Rationale: It is well established
             that NSAID's have gastric irritation, gastritis, and ulceration with haemorrhage as
             possible side effects. This is to ensure that subjects with a history of these
             syndromes are not included as a safety issue)

          -  History of recurrent peptic (gastric or duodenal) ulcer (Rationale: It is well
             established that NSAID's have gastric irritation, gastritis, and ulceration with
             haemorrhage as possible side effects. This is to ensure that subjects with a history
             of these syndromes are not included as a safety issue)

          -  History of any bleeding disorders, including gastrointestinal bleeding or
             cerebrovascular bleeding (Rationale: It is well established that non-selective NSAID's
             can decrease clotting. This is to ensure that subjects with a history of these
             syndromes are not included as a safety issue)

          -  Patients with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA 3 - 4) (Rationale: The
             administration of etoricoxib is contra-indicated in these patients)

          -  Patients with a medical history of ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease.
             (Rationale: There is a potential risk of cardiovascular events with COX-2 selective
             inhibitor use, although this is only documented after long-term use (&gt;18 months).

          -  History of cardiac failure, left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or pre-existing
             oedema. (Rationale: Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, as caused by these drugs,
             may cause fluid retention, oedema and hypertension.

          -  Patients with peripheral arterial disease (Rationale: Peripheral aerial disease will
             alter the response to healing in the ankle ligaments)

          -  Patients with a history or current symptoms and clinical signs of severe impairment of
             renal function (CrCl &lt;30 ml/min) or moderate to severe impairment of hepatic or
             function (Rationale: The administration of etoricoxib 120 mg is contra-indicated in
             these patients)

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease. (Rationale: The administration of etoricoxib
             is contra-indicated in these patients).

          -  Patients consuming more than three alcoholic drinks per day, or patients with a
             history of alcohol abuse (Rationale: Excessive alcohol intake could negatively affect
             liver function, interfere with drug metabolism and reduce compliance to the protocol)

          -  Patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactose deficiency or
             glucose-galactose malabsorption. (Rationale; etoricoxib tablets contain lactose and is
             therefore contraindicated in these patients)

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (Rationale: The administration of etoricoxib is
             contra-indicated in these patients)

          -  Woman attempting to conceive. (Rationale: Any drug known to inhibit COX-2 is
             contra-indicated)

          -  Concomitant treatment with anti-coagulants (including heparin, warfarin, and
             ticlopidine) (Rationale: It is well established that NSAID's can decrease clotting.
             This is to ensure that subjects with a history of established bleeding disorders or
             those on anti-clotting therapy are not included as a safety issue).

          -  Concomitant treatment with lithium, methotrexate, angiotensin converting enzyme
             inhibitors, beta-blockers and diuretics) (Rationale: NSAID's have significant drug
             interactions with some medications, can potentiate or impair the effects of others and
             therefore patients on these medications are excluded for safety reasons).

          -  Concomitant administration of other NSAID's (including aspirin doses &gt; 150 mg) or
             analgesic agents (Rationale: The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of
             specific NSAID's on pain and swelling. Concomitant use of other NSAID's will interfere
             with outcome measures and these patients have to be excluded from the study)

          -  Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. (Rationale:
             Co-administration of these medications with any NSAID's may increase their nephrotoxic
             effects)

          -  Concomitant treatment of etoricoxib with rifampicin. (Rationale: Rifampicin is a
             potent inducer of CYP enzymes and produces a 65% decrease in etoricoxib plasma
             concentration.)

          -  Current treatment or treatment within the last two months with corticosteroids
             (systemic, intra-articular) (Rationale: Long acting corticosteroids can interfere with
             outcome measures and patients who received these medications have to be excluded from
             the study)

          -  Participation in another clinical trial during this study or during the previous month
             (Rationale: This is to ensure that patients who may still have effects from treatment
             administered during another trial are not included)

          -  Inability to comply with the protocol (Rationale: This is to exclude subjects who will
             not be able to complete the study)
