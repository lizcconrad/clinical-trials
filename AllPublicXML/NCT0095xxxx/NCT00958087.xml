  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a multi-systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown cause characterized by the
      formation of non-caseating granulomas in involved organs. Its cardiac involvement may be
      potentially fatal. Although endomyocardial biopsy is required for deﬁnitive diagnosis of
      cardiac sarcoidosis, it is invasive and lacks sensitivity. The specific diagnostic tool for
      cardiac sarcoidosis is far from satisfactory. Recent studies have revealed that FDG-PET with
      under fasting conditions is a useful method for identiﬁcation of cardiac sarcoidosis
      patients. However, to our knowledge, no investigations have been published with regard to FDG
      quantification for the diagnosis and management of cardiac sarcoidosis by PET.

      Fasting FDG-PET will be performed in all subjects. Serum calcium, C-reactive protein (CRP),
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), lysozyme, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels
      will be measured in all patients. All patients will undergo chest X-ray, resting 12-lead ECG,
      transthoracic echocardiography, and 3 types of radionucleotide imaging using Tc-99m sestamibi
      for myocardial perfusion, Ga and FDG for whole-body evaluation. All assessments will be
      conducted within 2 weeks and no sign indicated any change in disease activity of sarcoidosis.
      The patients with cardiac involvement will be treated with 30 mg/day of prednisolone orally
      for the first 4 weeks, then will decrease to a dose of 20 mg/day for the next 4 weeks, and
      will maintain to a dose of 10 mg/day afterwards.

        Fasting FDG-PET will be performed in patients with sarcoidosis and age-matched DCM
        patients. Among them, systemic sarcoidosis will be diagnosed clinically and/or
        histologically, and referred for cardiac sarcoidosis. Patients with sarcoidosis will reveal
        cardiac involvement based on guidelines established in 2006 by the Japanese Ministry of
        Health and Welfare. Healthy control subjects will undergo FDG-PET.
