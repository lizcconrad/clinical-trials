  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has mixed growth factors such as TGF-ß1 and TGF-ß2, vascular
      epithelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF). These growth factors appear to play an important role in wound healing
      and are assumed as promoters of tissue regeneration. Moreover, PRP was used as injectable
      scaffold seeded with chondrocytes to regenerate cartilage. In their previous study, the
      investigators concluded that growth factors in PRP can effectively react as a growth factor
      cocktail to induce human nucleus pulposus proliferation and differentiation, and also promote
      tissue-engineered nucleus pulposus formation. The investigators also have a hypothesis that
      PRP can promote tissue-engineered microtia auricular cartilage formation. TGF- ß1 exists in
      the highest concentration and is more important among all of the growth factors released from
      PRP. So TGF- ß1 can be used as the core ingredient and the indicator for applying PRP in
      these studies. The aim of this study was to compare the histological and biochemical
      character of microtia chondrocytes treated with and without PRP.
