    <textblock>
      Intraventricular hemorrhage and its resultant post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus are significant
      risk factors for the development of neurodevelopmental delays in preterm infants. The purpose
      of this study is to determine 1) the incidence of progressive post-hemorrhagic ventricular
      dilatation (PHVD) in infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), 2) the effect of
      ventricular dilatation on brain status (cerebral oxygenation, electrical activity, and
      biomarkers of cerebral damage and repair), and 3) if using ventricular measurements, derived
      from cranial ultrasound to guide removal of cerebral-spinal fluid through an Omaya reservoir,
      will help resolve ventricular dilatation and decrease the need for ventriculo-peritoneal (VP)
      shunt insertion. The hypothesis of this research project is that, by using ventricular
      measurements to guide the frequency of CSF removal, the rate of VP shunt insertion will be
      decreased in preterm infants with severe IVH and PHVD. The investigators further hypothesize
      that cerebral injury, as measured by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of biomarkers of
      neuronal and glial damage and inflammation, will decrease over time with resolution of PHVD.

      When an infant has severe IVH noted on cranial ultrasound, s(he) will receive weekly
      ultrasounds to evaluate progression of ventricular dilatation (standard of care). After the
      infant is enrolled in this study, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and Amplitude integrated
      Electroencephalogram (aEEG) will be performed 1-2 times per week. After Omaya reservoir
      insertion, ventricular dimensions, based on weekly (standard of care) cranial ultrasounds,
      will determine frequency of CSF removal. NIRS and aEEG will continue 1-2 times per week to
      coincide with CSF removal. In addition, 1-2 times per week aliquots of CSF will be stored for
      evaluation of biomarkers. We will evaluate the impact of IVH and PHVD over time on cerebral
      oxygenation (NIRS) and cortical electrical activity (aEGG) starting at the time of
      identification of IVH and correlate these measurements to ventricular dimensions. If an Omaya
      reservoir is required to control PHVD, we will use ventricular dimensions to guide the
      frequency of CSF removal and continue to evaluate brain status by measuring cerebral
      oxygenation (NIRS) and cortical electrical activity (aEGG).

    <description>These infants have been identified with severe enough post hemorrhagic ventricular dilation (PHVD) that they require a reservoir placed for serial cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) removal. There is no randomization, and infants are compared to a baseline. Observational data will be collected to include NIRS and aEEg which will be done twice weekly, and CSF will be analyzed with each reservoir tap for protein biomarkers.</description>
