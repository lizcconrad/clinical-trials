  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of giving ketoconazole,
      hydrocortisone and dutasteride (KHAD) with lapatinib. The investigators believe that there is
      evidence in castrate resistant prostate cancer that two growth factor receptors (EGFr and Her
      2 /neu )are increased in prostate cancer cells. Both these receptors are turned off by the
      drug lapatinib. By adding lapatinib to this trial, the investigators hope that the
      investigators can turn off the signaling from the receptors and therefore make the
      participant's cancer more responsive to KHAD treatment.

      -  For the initial four weeks of the study, participants will receive the drugs
           ketoconazole, dutasteride and hydrocortisone daily (KHAD treatment). Ketoconazole will
           be taken orally three times a day, hydrocortisone will be taken orally twice a day and
           dutasteride will be taken orally once a day.

        -  During the 3rd or 4th week of KHAD treatment participants will undergo a CT-guided bone
           biopsy.

        -  After completion of 4 weeks on KHAD treatment, participants will start taking lapatinib
           along with KHAD starting from week 5. Lapatinib is taken orally once a day.

        -  During the 3rd or 4th week of KHAD and Lapatinib (KHLAD) treatment, participants will
           undergo a CT-guided bone biopsy.
