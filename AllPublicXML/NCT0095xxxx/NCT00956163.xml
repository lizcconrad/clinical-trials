      This phase 0 trial studies whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan and whole body magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in finding bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures,
      such as whole body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride PET/CT scan and whole body MRI, may help
      find and diagnose bone metastases.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body fluorine F 18 sodium fluoride
      PET/CT scan in detecting bone metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using
      bone scan as the reference standard.

      II. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of whole-body MRI in detecting bone
      metastases in patients with high-risk prostate cancer using bone scan as the reference
      standard.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo technetium Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scan, fluorine F 18 sodium
      fluoride PET/CT scan, and whole-body MRI for the detection of bone metastases. Patients with
      discordant imaging results (negative bone scan and positive PET/CT scan and/or MRI) undergo
      additional imaging at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written combined Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and informed consent document

          -  Patients Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance is =&lt; 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not receive any other investigational therapeutic agents from within 7
             days prior to study drug administration through 7 days following study drug
             administration

          -  Patients with known contraindications to MR imaging such as presence of MRI
             incompatible devices such as pacemakers and certain aneurysm clips, severe
             claustrophobia, or any other condition which would preclude proximity to a strong
             magnetic field; this exclusion is a standard of practice

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements; patients in this category are excluded to reduce medical risk to
             their safety and to avoid confounding variables in regard to the possibility of
             adverse events
