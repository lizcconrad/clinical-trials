  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase (GCB). Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside
      accumulates within macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ
      system dysfunction. The purpose of this treatment protocol is to observe the safety of
      velaglucerase alfa in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who are either treatment naive
      (newly diagnosed) or who are currently being treated with the Enzyme Replacement Therapy
      (ERT) imiglucerase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form, accounts for more than 90% of all cases of
      Gaucher disease and does not involve the CNS. Typical manifestations of type 1 Gaucher
      disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia,
      hypermetabolism, skeletal pathology, growth retardation, pulmonary disease, and decreased
      quality of life. Velaglucerase alfa (Gene-Activated™ human glucocerebrosidase;GA-GCB) is
      produced in a continuous human cell line using proprietary gene-activation technology and has
      an identical amino acid sequence to the naturally occurring human enzyme. Velaglucerase alfa
      contains terminal mannose residues that target the enzyme to the macrophages-the primary
      target cells in Gaucher disease. This treatment protocol will observe the safety of
      velaglucerase alfa in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who are either treatment naive
      (newly diagnosed) or who are currently being treated with the Enzyme Replacement Therapy
      (ERT) imiglucerase. Patients currently being treated with ERT for their Gaucher disease will
      receive the same number of units of velaglucerase alfa per month as their imiglucerase dose
      for doses between 30-120 U/kg/month. For patients who experienced dose reductions in their
      imiglucerase treatment due to supply constraints the pre-reduction monthly dose may be used
      to determine the monthly dose of velaglucerase alfa.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a documented diagnosis of type 1 Gaucher disease

          2. The patient is &gt; 2 years of age

          3. The patient has NOT previously experienced an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction
             to another ERT including imiglucerase

          4. Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception at all times during the study; and must have a negative result to a
             pregnancy test as required throughout their participation in the study. Male patients
             must use a medically acceptable method of birth control throughout their participation
             in the study and must report their partner's pregnancy.

          5. The patient is sufficiently cooperative to participate in this treatment plan as
             judged by the Investigator

          6. If the patient is naïve or new to treatment, the patient has one or more of the
             following (in absence of the following criteria, please call the sponsor for treatment
             justification):

               -  Gaucher disease-related anemia

               -  Moderate splenomegaly (2 to 3 cm below the left costal margin), by palpation

               -  Gaucher disease-related thrombocytopenia

               -  Gaucher disease-related palpable enlarged liver
