    <textblock>
      Acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis is common in general practice. Cystitis is at the
      second raw of antibiotic treatment indications. It has been now recommended not to perform
      any urine culture for more than 20 years; hence, the bacterial epidemiology of acute
      uncomplicated cystitis is surprisingly relatively unknown. The available bacteriological data
      mainly describe the epidemiology of complicated urinary tract infections or upper urinary
      tract infections, but the causative bacteria and the resistance rates might differ from those
      of uncomplicated cystitis. As an example, it is unknown to what extent Staphylococcus
      saprophyticus is the causative agent of uncomplicated cystitis.

      Moreover, the urine dipstick test have been evaluated in laboratories. But their
      interpretation in current practice might not be so easy: in particular, the nitrite detection
      depends on the bacterial concentration. The nitrite detection, produced in enterobacteriaceae
      related infections might have therapeutical consequences: trom√©tamol-fosfomycine is almost
      constantly active on enterobacteriaceae, but ineffective on staphylococci. Knowing the
      increasing prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacteriaceae, the use of fosfomycin
      in nitrite positive uncomplicated cystitis might preserve the susceptibility of
      fluoroquinolones during pyelonephritis.

      This study will describe:

        -  the bacterial epidemiology of acute uncomplicated cystitis in general practice,

        -  the correlation in between urine dipstick and urine culture in general practice,

        -  the prediction of enterobacterial infection by the nitrite detection, AND

        -  the antibiotics prescribed by the practitioners for uncomplicated acute cystitis.
