  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle loss is a common consequence of aging and in some individuals reaches a level
      that compromises health and quality of life. Age-associated increases in cytokine and
      inflammatory signaling may be important contributors to this process.

      The investigators will assess the practical question of whether testosterone injection and
      gel application elicit similar responses. Resistance exercise will be used as a means of
      stimulating both inflammatory and anabolic responses in skeletal muscle. In order to assess
      the effects of testosterone on these responses, subjects will perform resistance exercise on
      two occasions separated by 7 days. The first session will be performed prior to the
      initiation of testosterone and/or medrol therapy and the second session will be performed
      after receiving therapy for 7 days.

      4 groups of healthy men aged 60 - 85 years were studied over 15 days, in 2 distinct time
      periods, pre-treatment and treatment.

      Pre treatment week from study day -7 to study day -1. Treatment week from study day 1 to
      study day 8.

      Groups:

        1. Testosterone by injection (100mg testosterone enanthate) administered on study day 1.

        2. Testosterone by gel application (10g/day Androgel 1%) administered daily beginning on
           study day 1 through study day 7.

        3. Methylpredisone (Medrol) dose pack beginning on study day 1 (24mg) and decreasing by 4mg
           each day, with an additional 4mg taken on study day 7. Study day 1 (24mg), study day 2
           (20mg), study day 3 (16mg), study day 4 (12mg), study day 5 (8mg), study day 6 (4mg),
           study day 7 (4mg).

        4. Testosterone by injection (100mg testosterone enanthate) administered on study day 1 and
           Methylpredisone (Medrol) dose pack beginning on study day 1 (24mg) and decreasing by 4mg
           each day, with an additional 4mg taken on study day 7. Study day 1 (24mg), study day 2
           (20mg), study day 3 (16mg), study day 4 (12mg), study day 5 (8mg), study day 6 (4mg),
           study day 7 (4mg).

      Subjects were asked to fill out the Brief Fatigue Inventory daily for all 15 days.

      Subjects were studied at the clinical research center before treatment (study day 1) and
      after treatment (study day 8). Resistance exercise was performed on study days 1 and 8. Blood
      was drawn before and after exercise for measurement of serum cortisol. Subjects were asked to
      return to the clinical research center each day during the treatment week (study days 1-8)
      for blood draws for measurement of total testosterone, estradiol and C-reactive protein
      (CRP). Labs were drawn on study days 1 and 8 for complete blood count, comprehensive
      metabolic panel and lipid panel.

      Part 1:

      In this part of the project we will study the acute response to testosterone treatment
      between two groups of subjects, comparing two methods of administration (injection vs.
      topical gel) in order to obtain pilot information for a subsequent, randomized, blinded
      long-term investigation.

      Part 2:

      In this part of the project we will study the acute response to Medrol (methylprednisolone)
      taken over 7 days with or without testosterone (given as 100mg IM) in order to obtain pilot
      information for a subsequent, randomized, blinded long-term investigation.

             (ALT), aspartate amino-transferase (AST) above normal on screening will be excluded
             from the study.

          -  Any subject with a blood pressure on three consecutive measurements taken at one week
             intervals that has a systolic pressure ³ 140 or a diastolic blood pressure ³ 90 will
             be excluded.

          -  Allergy to iodine, a component of Betadine which is used to prepare the subject's skin
             for invasive procedures, will be cause for exclusion from this study.

             bleeding disorder (easy bruising, &quot;free bleeders&quot;) will not be enrolled in this study
             due to potential problems that could arise from muscle biopsy procedures.

        <title>Global Fatigue Score as Measured by Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) in the Pre-treatment Week</title>
        <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory is a 9 item questionnaire that assesses perceptual fatigue as well as fatigue interferences (e.g. interference with enjoyment of life), with &quot;0&quot; being no fatigue and &quot;10&quot; being as bad as you can imagine. The Global Fatigue score is calculated by averaging the answers of all the questions.
This data is presented as the pre-treatment week average of study days -7 to -1.</description>
