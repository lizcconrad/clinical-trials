  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of functional dyspepsia (FD) is estimated to be 15% of the adult population.
      FD is commonly described as a condition of chronic abdominal discomfort localized to the
      upper abdomen. Postprandial bloating, pain, nausea, vomiting, belching, and early satiety are
      common symptoms of the FD patient. FD is defined by &gt;12 weeks of symptoms, which need not be
      consecutive, within the preceding year consisting of a) persistent or recurrent dyspepsia and
      b) an absence of organic disease after a gastrointestinal endoscopy or x-ray series. FD is
      therefore considered a disorder of function because no mucosal pathology is seen in these
      patients, as in patients with other functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) and fibromyalgia (FM). There is a remarkable degree of overlap among these three
      disorders. These 3 disorders share the finding of hypersensitivity and the symptom of
      postprandial bloating to suggest the possibility of a common origin.
