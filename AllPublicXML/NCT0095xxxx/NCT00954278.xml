    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the number of patients with advanced, relapsed
      non-small cell lung cancer who can tolerate dose escalation sorafenib from 400 mg twice daily
      to either 600 mg twice daily or 800 mg twice daily. Safety and tolerability of sorafenib will
      also be examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the
      U.S. Time to progression in advanced disease remains poor and further study of newer agents
      with novel mechanisms of action is needed to improve duration and quality of life for NSCLC
      patients.

      Sorafenib is an oral-multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation and tumor
      angiogenesis. Sorafenib has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of NSCLC both in
      combination with chemotherapy and as monotherapy. A recent intra-patient dose escalation
      trial of sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma showed positive response rates and tolerability up
      to 1200mg in 91% of patients.

      This study attempts a similar dose-escalation of sorafenib in NSCLC patients.
