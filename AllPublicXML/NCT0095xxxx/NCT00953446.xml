  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a tool to track
      tumor growth for renal cell carcinoma while participants are on clinical treatment therapy of
      sunitinib and AMG386. An MRI is a type of scan that uses powerful magnets to make clearer
      images or to focus on detailed medical information in the abdomen and pelvis. The imaging
      done for this study will use the arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI technique that allows us to
      see blood flow changes which possibly may indicate changes in tumor growth. Participants will
      be on a clinical trial for the treatment.

      All participants must be enrolled on protocol, &quot;Collection of Specimens and Clinical Data
      from Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma Treatment with Targeted Therapies&quot;, about to start a
      treatment course with sunitinib and AMG386, and willing to come in for successive MRIs at the
      following times: baseline, 2 weeks upon initiation of therapy with sunitinib and AMG386,
      after cycle 2 and/or cycle 4 of therapy, and at the end of your study therapy.

          -  Patients diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and who will initiate therapy
             with the combination of sunitinib and AMG386 as either their first anti-angiogenic
             therapy or after failure of prior cytokine therapy

          -  Enrolled on protocol 06-105, &quot;Collection of specimens and clinical data from patients
             with renal cell carcinoma treated with targeted therapies&quot;
