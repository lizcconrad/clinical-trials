      The hypothesis of this project is that specific genes can be identified that contribute to
      genetic susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in different populations. The
      specific aim of this project is carry out one or more genomewide association studies (GWAS)
      to map and ultimately identify genes that confer susceptibility to AITD. AITD consists
      principally of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) and Graves' Disease (GD), characterized
      clinically generally by hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively. Both HT and GD are
      autoimmune diseases characterized by infiltration of the thyroid by T and B cells that are
      reactive with thyroid antigens and by the production of thyroid autoantibodies (TAB). While
      there is some evidence that there may be genes specific to either GD or HT, other genes
      appear to be common to both, and some genes may furthermore be in common to susceptibility to
      other autoimmune diseases. Genes known to play a role in AITD include HLA, CTLA4,
      thyroglobulin (TG), THSR, and CD40, PTPN2, and PTPN22, several of which are also involved in
      susceptibility to other autoimmune diseases. All of these genes interact in a complex manner
      that has yet to be understood. Furthermore, it seems clear that relatively few of the genes
      involved in susceptibility to AITD have thus far been discovered.
