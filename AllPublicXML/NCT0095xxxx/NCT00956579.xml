  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the most commonly reported symptoms of autism is heightened sensitivity to sensory
      stimuli. Children and adults with autism spectrum disorders often react with aversion to
      various sounds (e.g., by covering their ears and screaming) especially at an early age. The
      investigators believe that this is because autism spectrum disorders affect how sensory input
      is experienced. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate sensory processing
      abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders, or, in other words, to evaluate how and why
      children and adults with autism spectrum disorders experience external sensory information
      (vision, audition, touch) differently than healthy children and adults.

      Because some of the same abnormalities are also reported in children and adults with
      developmental language disorders such as language delay or dyslexia, the investigators are
      also interested in how that population experiences external sensory information.

      To study how sensory information is processed by the brain, we primarily use an instrument
      called MEG (MagnetoEncephaloGraphy), which measures the magnetic brainwaves emitted by our
      brains. The device does not have any output (i.e., there is no magnetic field); it only
      measures the waves produced in the brain.

      We measure those waves as the participants in the study listen to, view, or otherwise
      experience simple, non painful, stimuli. For instance, participants may listen to words while
      sitting in the MEG room, and watching a movie with the sound turned off.

      We then combine this information with pictures of the brain from MRI (Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging - when available), to get an idea about both the anatomy and the function of the
      brain, so that we can study how the brains of populations with autism spectrum disorders or
      language disorders may be different from those of healthy populations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All of the following criteria must be met by all participants:

               -  The participant or the participant's legal guardian is able to understand and is
                  willing to comply with the requirements of the study

               -  The participant meets the age requirements (6-45 years old)

               -  The participant or legal guardian has signed an Informed Consent Form specific to
                  this study, and is able to understand the consent form.

               -  The participant must have English as their first language.

               -  The participant must have a non-verbal IQ &gt; 80

          -  For the ASD/language disorder group only:

               -  Autism Spectrum Disorder: Participants must meet criteria for Autism Spectrum
                  Disorder on BOTH the ADI-R and the ADOS.

               -  Language Disorder: Participants will evidence expressive and receptive language
                  disorders as indicated by a combination of standard scores 1.3 Standard
                  Deviations below the mean for their age on at least 3 of the 4 Core Subtests of
                  the CELF-IV, and on at least one of the following: Test for the Reception of
                  Grammar, Expressive Vocabulary Test, or the Peabody Preschool Vocabulary Test
