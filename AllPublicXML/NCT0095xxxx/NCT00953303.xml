  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence showed that glucocorticoids could induce potent diuretic actions and improve renal
      functions in patients with decompensated congestive heart failure. Thus we design this study
      to determine the efficacy of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular mortality in the 30 days
      following randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newly emerging clinical evidence showed glucocorticoids, when added to best conventional
      therapy, could produce potent diuretic effects, and improve renal functions in patients with
      decompensated congestive heart failure. It holds ture even in the patients who failed to
      respond to high dose of furosemide (&gt;200mg/day). The present study is to confirm the clinical
      efficacy of glucocorticoids on cardiovascular mortality in patients with decompensated
      congestive heart failure who are on best conventional therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with dyspnea at rest due to acutely decompensated CHF requiring
             hospitalization and intravenous therapy. The cardiac etiology for acutely
             decompensated CHF was established by echocardiogram and/or a chest x-ray film and 2 of
             the following:

               1. &gt;2-pillow orthopnea before study entry

               2. Jugular venous distention and/or abdominal discomfort due to mesenteric
                  congestion.

        Patients may have had acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, gradual worsening of
        chronic heart failure, or new onset of acutely decompensated CHF. Patients who were
        receiving intravenous therapy i.e. Inotropic and/or vasodilator but who otherwise met entry
        criteria were also permitted into the study. Patients with signs of cardiac shock were also
        permitted into the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient refusal

          -  Any signs of infection

          -  any condition that would contraindicate a glucocorticoids use

          -  Poor controlled hypertension

          -  Poor controlled diabetes mellitus

          -  Active myocarditis

          -  Malignancy or other terminal illness
