  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate different methods of measuring body composition
      (amount of fat, muscle, bone, and water in your body) and to determine relationships between
      body composition and other medical problems associated with spinal cord injury (SCI).

      A preliminary investigation in our laboratory has demonstrated the advantage of using
      4-compartment modeling to assess body composition in SCI adults. In comparing body
      composition analyses techniques in 20 individuals with SCI, we found Total Error to be 8.0%
      with Dual X-ray Absorptiometry, 8.4% with hydrodensitometry, 11.5% with bioelectrical
      impedance analysis, and 21.8% with standard skinfold equations when compared to 4-compartment
      modeling, the currently accepted gold standard for body composition assessment. To date there
      is no gold standard for the determination of body composition in SCI individuals.
