  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 30 years, induction chemotherapy (IC) has become important for the management
      of patients with locally advanced HNSCC (LAHNSCC), particularly since the introduction of
      taxanes. The results reported in the TAX 323 and TAX 324 trials indicate that the TPF regimen
      (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) improves overall survival comparing with the PF
      regimen (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil), and the TPF regimen is globally the most accepted
      induction regimen for the treatment of LAHNSCC.

      However, the TPF regimen has been associated with high toxicity rates, and patients
      frequently decline cisplatin during concurrent radiotherapy and require the use of infusion
      pumps and a central venous catheter.

      Extensive efforts are ongoing to identify alternative schemes that are less toxic than the
      TPF regimen but are as effective for LAHNSCC and safely allow the use of definitive
      concurrent treatment based on cisplatin and radiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the safety, feasibility and response rates of
      concurrent therapy (cisplatin and radiotherapy) after three cycles of an IC regimen based on
      the combination of cisplatin plus paclitaxel without 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (thereby avoiding
      infusion pumps and a central venous catheter) in LAHNSCC patients with a high tumor burden.

      The patients were stratified by tumor subsite (oropharynx and hypopharynx/larynx) and by
      tumor resectable status (resectable or irresectable advanced squamous cell).

    <description>Tumor response was assessed after induction chemotherapy (just before chemoradiotherapy) and 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.
Evaluation of tumor response was by clinical examination, nasoendoscopy, and CT or MRI imaging of the primary site and the neck (RECIST criteria 1.1).</description>

    <time_frame>After every cycle of IC, after every cycle of concurrent chemetherapy and up to 8 weeks after the end of radiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were graded according to the expanded common toxicity criteria of the Clinical Trials Group of the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCI CTCAE v3.0). Laboratory safety data were assessed before the administration of chemotherapy and after treatment.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated as the date of assignment to recurrence/progression or death resulting from any cause. If the patient had no evidence of the aforementioned events, survival was censored at the time of the last documented evaluation of efficacy/contact or death resulting from another cause.</description>

    <description>Patients were treated with 2-dimensional radiation therapy planning (6MV photon beams). A combination of lateral-opposed portals, anterior and lateral wedged fields was used to treat the primary tumor and the lymph nodes. The primary tumor, macroscopically affected lymph nodes and bilateral cervical plus supraclavicular lymph chains were treated with five fractions of 2Gy per week for 5 weeks (up to a total of 50Gy). Gross tumor volume was defined as the primary gross tumor or involved node, and this measure was based on clinical, radiological and endoscopic examinations. An additional margin of 1.0cm was added to the GTV to create the CTV. A boost of five fractions of 2Gy per week for 2 additional weeks (up to a total dose of 70Gy) was prescribed to the CTV plus a margin of 1.0cm.</description>
