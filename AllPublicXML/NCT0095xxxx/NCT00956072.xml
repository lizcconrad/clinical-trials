      RATIONALE: Surgery may remove residual disease in patients with gastrointestinal stromal
      tumor that is responding to imatinib mesylate. It is not yet known whether surgery is more
      effective than continued imatinib mesylate in treating patients with metastatic
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving imatinib mesylate therapy
      together with surgery to see how well it works compared with imatinib mesylate alone in
      treating patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor that is responding to
      imatinib mesylate.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate whether surgery of residual disease improves the progression-free survival of
           patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor responding to imatinib mesylate.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate the pharmacokinetics of imatinib mesylate and its metabolites before and after
           randomization.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, site of
      tumor origin (stomach vs small bowel vs others), and site of metastases (liver vs abdominal
      cavity vs both). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgery of residual disease. Patients will then resume imatinib
           mesylate therapy according to standard of care as soon as possible after surgery (as
           soon as the patient restarts taking oral feeding).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive imatinib mesylate therapy according to standard of care.

      Patients complete quality of life questionnaires at baseline; immediately after hospital
      discharge (arm I only); and at 5, 11, and 23 months. Blood samples may be collected for
      pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 5 years and
      then every 6 months.
