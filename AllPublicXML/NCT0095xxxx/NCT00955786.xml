      CX-4945 is a first-in-class small-molecule targeted cancer therapeutic derived from the
      validated fluoroquinolone class of drugs. This drug was rationally designed to target a
      G-quadruplex (QPLX) DNA structure and disrupt protein-DNA interactions essential to cancer
      cells. The QPLX targeted by quarfloxin forms within ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the QPLX is
      bound by the nucleolin protein.This Phase 1 study of CX-3543 is designed to test the safety,
      tolerability and highest safe dose level of this drug in patients with advanced solid tumor
      cancers.

             not correctable with therapy.

          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to the first dose
             of test drug.
