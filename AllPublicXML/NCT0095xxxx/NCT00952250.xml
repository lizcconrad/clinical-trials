      This project is designed to examine the impact of tailored feedback on site performance.

      The investigators' objective is to evaluate whether a 'personalized and targeted' feedback,
      education and performance improvement intervention has a greater impact on adherence to
      recommended guidelines than standard feedback.

      The investigators hypothesize that a site-specific report with centrally identified targets
      for improvement paired with target specific interventions will enable sites to quickly
      identify and prioritize salient problem areas, have ready access to an analysis of factors
      that underlie problems, and formulate an effective action plan. The investigators also
      hypothesize that those hospitals randomized to receive intervention will be more likely to
      improve their overall performance, as well as their target specific performance, during the
      period of observation in direct response to activated QI processes.

      Outcomes:

      The primary outcome is improvement in the overall composite of all metrics eligible for
      intervention regardless of their selection as targets.

      The secondary outcome is improvement in the composite of targeted metrics.

      Outcomes will be assessed in all participating sites, and in among relevant performance
      subgroups (low performers, academic centers, full service, and among medication versus
      process metrics).
