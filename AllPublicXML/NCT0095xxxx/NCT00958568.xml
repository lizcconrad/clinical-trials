  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether olanzapine and fluoxetine combination (OFC)
      if used for a long time (47 weeks) makes patients suffering from Treatment Resistant
      Depression stable, determine if OFC is safe when used to treat patients with Treatment
      Resistant Depression for a long time (up to 47 weeks), to determine whether olanzapine and
      fluoxetine combination or fluoxetine alone is better to treat Treatment Resistant Depression
      when treated for a long time (up to 47 weeks) and to assess the quality of life during
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, parallel study
      of participants with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD), comparing the efficacy and safety
      of olanzapine and fluoxetine Combination (OFC) versus fluoxetine in relapse prevention of
      stabilized participants with TRD. The study will consist of 4 phases: a screening phase; a 6-
      to 8-week open-label acute treatment phase; a 10- to 12-week open-label stabilization phase;
      and a 27- to 29-week double-blind relapse prevention treatment phase. Participants who
      demonstrate response to open-label OFC during the acute treatment phase will continue into
      the stabilization phase. Participants who remain stable while receiving open-label OFC during
      this phase will be randomized to receive either OFC or fluoxetine during the double-blind
      relapse prevention phase. Investigators and participants will be blinded to the precise
      duration of the stabilization period, the definition of remission, and the criteria for entry
      into the relapse prevention phase; this information is described in a supplement given to
      Ethical Review Boards (ERBs) and regulatory authorities.

MADRS is a 10-item rating scale for depressive mood symptoms severity, items rated on 0-6 scale, with total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). CGI-S measures severity of illness at time of assessment compared with start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (the most extremely ill). Lack of Efficacy/Worsening of depression was at discretion of investigator based on clinical observation. Suicidality is thoughts or actions of self-harm as determined by the investigator.

    <description>Relapse is defined as meeting any of the following criteria (Relapse-any reason): 50% increase in MADRS score from randomization with concomitant CGI-S of Depression score increase to a score of 4 or more (MADRS score/CGI-S Depression Score); Hospitalization for depression or suicidality; Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy/worsening of depression/suicidality. MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms with 10 items rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). CGI-S measures severity of illness at the time of assessment compared with start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (the most extremely ill). Lack of Efficacy/Worsening of depression was at the discretion of the investigator and based on clinical observation. Suicidality is thoughts or actions of self-harm as determined by the investigator.</description>

        <description>Relapse defined as meeting any of these criteria: 50% increase in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from randomization with a Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) of Depression score increase to a score of 4 or more; Hospitalized for depression or suicidality; Discontinued due to lack of efficacy/worsening of depression/suicidality. MADRS is a 10-item rating scale for depressive mood symptoms severity, items rated on 0-6 scale, with total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). CGI-S measures severity of illness at time of assessment compared with start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (the most extremely ill). Lack of Efficacy/Worsening of depression was at discretion of investigator based on clinical observation. Suicidality is thoughts or actions of self-harm as determined by the investigator. Those who did not relapse were &quot;censored&quot; at their last observation.</description>

            <groups_desc>Power estimate assumes approximately 1230 participants enter SPII. With a 60% drop-out/disqualification rate in SPII, then 492 participants enter SPIII. If 26% of participants drop out during SPIII, then 364 participants enter SPIV. Assuming 20% drop-out rate, 25% relapse rate on OFC and 40% relapse rate for fluoxetine (hazard ratio = 0.56), the log-rank test is 80% powered to detect a difference at a 2-sided 0.05 level. A total of 95 relapse events during SPIV should satisfy these assumptions.</groups_desc>

        <description>Relapse is defined as a 50% increase in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score from randomization with concomitant Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) of Depression score increase to a score of 4 or more. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist with items rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). CGI-S measures severity of illness at the time of assessment compared with start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (the most extremely ill). Those who did not relapse were &quot;censored&quot; at their last observation.</description>

        <description>Simpson-Angus Scale is used to measure Parkinsonian-type symptoms in participants exposed to neuroleptics. The scale consists of 10 items, each rated on a 5-point scale, with 0 meaning complete absence of the condition and 4 meaning the presence of the condition in extreme form. The total score is obtained by adding the items and ranges from 0-40 with higher scores indicating worse conditions. Treatment emergent parkinsonism is defined as total score ≤3 of items 1 through 10 of the Simpson-Angus scale at baseline (Week 20) and a total score &gt;3 of items 1 through 10 post-baseline (Weeks 21-47).</description>

        <description>Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) is a 12-item scale designed to record the occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Items 1 through 10 are rated on a 5-point scale, with 0 being no dyskinetic movements and 4 being severe dyskinetic movements. Items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions regarding the dental condition of the participants. Treatment emergent dyskinesia is defined as a score ≥3 on any one of the AIMS items 1-7 post-baseline (Weeks 21-47) or scores ≥2 on any two of the AIMS items 1-7 post-baseline (Weeks 21-47) among participants without either criteria at baseline (Week 20).</description>

        <description>Relapse is defined as meeting any of the following criteria (Relapse-any reason): 50% increase in MADRS score from randomization with concomitant CGI-S of Depression score increase to a score of 4 or more (MADRS score/CGI-S Depression Score); Hospitalization for depression or suicidality; Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy/worsening of depression/suicidality. MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms with 10 items rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). CGI-S measures severity of illness at the time of assessment compared with start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (the most extremely ill). Lack of Efficacy/Worsening of depression was at the discretion of the investigator and based on clinical observation. Suicidality is thoughts or actions of self-harm as determined by the investigator.</description>
