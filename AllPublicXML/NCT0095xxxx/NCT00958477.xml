  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to test an experimental new drug called, EMD 525797 (Study Drug). This
      drug is not yet approved for sale and has only been tested in a small number of people to
      date (prior to this study starting another research study was carried out involving 37
      healthy volunteers receiving the Study Drug). Until more is known about this Study Drug, it
      can only be used in research studies.

      This research study is planned to answer important questions about how the Study Drug is
      tolerated and how it may work in patients with prostate cancer with bone metastases.

      This is a small study which is expected to include 24 patients, and will be conducted in
      approximately 3 hospitals in Germany and 1 hospital in Brussels, Belgium. The study will last
      until the last patient has had their last study visit which is expected to be about 18 months
      in total.

        <title>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs and Related TEAEs</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.Treatment-related are events which had causal relationship to study drug as assessed by the Investigator and were suspected to be reasonably related to the study drug.</description>

        <title>Total Body Clearance of Drug From Serum (CL) After First Infusion</title>
        <description>Clearance of a drug was a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Total body clearance of drug from serum, calculated as CL = dose/AUC0-inf. Where AUC0-inf is area under the serum concentration time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated as AUC0 t + AUCextra. AUCextra represents an extrapolated value obtained by Clast/λz, where Clast is the calculated serum concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured serum concentration is at or above lower limit of quantification (LLQ) and λz is elimination rate constant.</description>

        <description>Number of subjects with BOR in each category (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD]) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.0) was reported. CR: defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of longest diameter. PD:defined as at least a 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. SD: defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameter while on study.</description>

        <title>Total Pain Score Using Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf)</title>
        <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf has 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question is answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10;‘0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine’.Total score is reported as average of individual questions ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.Data was not available for &quot;EMD 525797 250 mg&quot; arm for FUP Weeks 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75 and &quot;EMD 525797 1000 mg&quot; arm for FUP Weeks 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71 and &quot;EMD 525797 1500 mg arm&quot; for FUP Weeks 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75 respectively as no subjects were evaluable at the specified FUP visits.</description>

          <title>Total Pain Score Using Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf)</title>
          <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf has 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). Each question is answered on a scale ranging from 0 to 10;‘0=No pain and 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine’.Total score is reported as average of individual questions ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores being indicative of less pain or pain interference.Data was not available for &quot;EMD 525797 250 mg&quot; arm for FUP Weeks 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75 and &quot;EMD 525797 1000 mg&quot; arm for FUP Weeks 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71 and &quot;EMD 525797 1500 mg arm&quot; for FUP Weeks 35, 39, 43, 47, 51, 55, 59, 63, 67, 71, 75 respectively as no subjects were evaluable at the specified FUP visits.</description>
          <population>Efficacy analysis set included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Here &quot;n&quot; signifies those subjects who were evaluable for this outciome measure at the specified time points.</population>
