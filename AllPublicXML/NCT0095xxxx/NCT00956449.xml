  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three influenza
      vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine, as measured by
      hemagglutination inhibition (HI) at 21 days post immunization in non−elderly and elderly
      subjects in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union (EU)
      recommendations for the evaluation of the immunogenicity for a new formulation of a licensed
      flu vaccine (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

                    5. Acute or progressive hepatic disease

                    6. Acute or progressive renal disease

                    7. Severe neurological or psychiatric disorder

                    8. Severe Asthma

               -  History of any anaphylactic reaction and/or serious allergic reaction following a
                  vaccination, a proven hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccine
                  (e.g., to eggs, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral protein
                  neomycin or polymyxin).

               -  Known or suspected (or have a high risk of developing) impairment/alteration of
                  immune function (excluding that normally associated with advanced age) resulting
                  for example from:

                    1. receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any parental or oral cortical steroid
                       or cancer chemotherapy/radiotherapy) within the past 60 days and for the
