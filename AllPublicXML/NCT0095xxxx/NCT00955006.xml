      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety of mucosal immune responses to a DNA HIV
      vaccine followed by an adenoviral vector HIV vaccine in HIV uninfected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may only be controlled through development of a safe and
      effective vaccine that will prevent HIV infection. DNA vaccines are inexpensive to construct,
      readily produced in large quantities, and stable for long periods of time. This study will
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an experimental multiclade HIV vaccine,
      VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by a similarly structured adenovirus-vectored vaccine boost,
      VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP, in HIV uninfected adults. The DNA plasmids in both the vaccines code for
      proteins from HIV subtypes A, B, and C, which together represent 90% of new HIV infections in
      the world. The study's primary objective is to investigate the ability of a 6-plasmid DNA
      prime followed by a rAd5 boost to elicit HIV-specific cellular immune responses at mucosal
      surfaces.

      This study will last 12 months and participants will visit the clinic 15 times. Participants
      will receive three injections of the VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP vaccine at Months 0, 1, and 2
      followed by an injection of VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP at Month 6. All injections will be given in
      the upper arm. At study visits participants will have a physical, medical history taken,
      blood collection, and risk reduction counseling. At some visits, rectal biopsies (via
      anoscopy or, optionally, by flexible sigmoidoscopy), saliva, semen, cervical and/or vaginal
      fluid samples will also be collected. Pregnancy testing for women will be done prior to each
      vaccination and study procedure.

      Participants will be contacted by study staff once a year for 5 years after the initial study
      visit for follow-up health and safety monitoring.
