      The objective of this research is to verify the language of children with Down syndrome
      concerning lexical, syntactic and semantic aspects using MLU. The hypothesis is that children
      with Down syndrome will present low performance, regarding not only the quantitative measures
      as MLU-m, MLU-w, GM-1 and GM-2, but also regarding the qualitative aspects of their
      production, when compared to children with typical development.

      One of the alternatives to observe and assess language development and language disorders is
      to analyze spontaneous language samples, which allos the identification of qualitative and
      quantitative aspects. The analysis involves the MLU-morphemes, MLU-words and words classes.
      All words produced are analyzed, including interjections, adverbs and adjectives.Word classes
      with grammatical characteristics present lower averages, as prepositions and conjunctions.
      Reference parameters are the ones of the spoken language. The objective assessment with
      qualitative and quantitative data may help the speech and language pathologist/therapist to
      determine therapeutic guidelines to each patient.
