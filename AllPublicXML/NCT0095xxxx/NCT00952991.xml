  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of the incretin hormone, Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 (GLP-1), has been shown to
      enhance insulin secretion and suppress glucagon secretion in response to meal ingestion. In
      addition, GLP-1 also delays gastric emptying and has been shown to enhance gastric
      accommodation. These characteristics make GLP-1 an ideal therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2D).
      However, because of its rapid breakdown by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV), GLP-1 has to be
      administered by continuous intravenous infusion. This would be a drawback in clinical usage.
      LAF237 is a synthetic inhibitor of DPP IV which has been shown to raise GLP-1 levels and
      potentiate meal-induced insulin secretion and glucagon suppression. However, the effects of
      LAF237 on gastric emptying and satiety are at present unknown. The investigators propose to
      study the effects of LAF237 on gastric emptying, gastric volume and satiety in patients with
      T2D in addition to examining the direct and indirect (mediated via insulin and glucagon) of
      this compound on postprandial glucose metabolism.
