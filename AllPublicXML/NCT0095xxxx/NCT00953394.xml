  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas have low proliferative activity and
      conventional chemotherapy is not recommended. Metronomic chemotherapy, i.e. the frequent
      administration of cytotoxic drugs at low doses, has demonstrated antiangiogenetic properties.
      Since well differentiated NE carcinomas are highly vascular, there is a rationale for testing
      metronomic chemotherapy in this clinical setting.

      A phase II study was designed to test the activity of protracted 5-fluorouracil (5FU)
      infusion plus long-acting release (LAR) octreotide for patients with neuroendocrine
      carcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic or locally advanced well differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma were treated with
      5Fluorouracil protracted intravenous infusion (200 mg/m2 daily) plus Octreotide LAR (20 mg
      monthly).

      Primary Endpoint: the response to treatment, evaluated according to the RECIST criteria.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  toxicity, graded according to the NCI-CTG criteria;

        -  symptomatic response: evaluated according to the changes in both the frequency and
           intensity of symptoms;

        -  biochemical response: evaluated considering the changes in the tumor marker levels
           (circulating Chromogranin A);

        -  time to progression and survival: were measured from the date of treatment start to the
           date of progression and the date of last follow-up or death, respectively.

    <description>long-acting octreotide acetate at a dose of 20 mg was administered intramuscularly every 4 weeks. 5fluorouracil was given as a protracted continuous infusion without interruption at a daily dose of 200 mg/m2 of body-surface area through an elastomeric pump connected to a central venous access.</description>
