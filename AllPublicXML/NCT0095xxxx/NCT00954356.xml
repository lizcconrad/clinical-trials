    <measure>Total Pain Relief at 6 Hours Post Dose (TOTPAR 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable was total pain relief at the 6-hour observation (TOTPAR 6); TOTPAR 6 is an area calculation incorporating time and relief scores over the 6 hours following dosing and was calculated using Simpson's trapezoidal rule.
The higher the LS Means scores, the more pain relief was obtained.
Relief (REL) scores were measured at multiple timepoints after dosing, using a 5 point categorical pain relief rating scale. (None = 0, A Little Relief = 1, Some = 2, A Lot = 3, Complete Relief = 4). The minimum possible TOTPAR 6 score = 0, maximum possible score = 24</description>

The higher the LS Means scores, the more pain relief was obtained.
Relief (REL) scores were measured at multiple timepoints after dosing, using a 5 point categorical pain relief rating scale. (None = 0, A Little Relief = 1, Some = 2, A Lot = 3, Complete Relief = 4). The minimum possible TOTPAR 8 score = 0, maximum possible score = 32</description>

    <description>A secondary efficacy variable was total pain relief at the 12-hour observation (TOTPAR 12); TOTPAR 12 is an area calculation incorporating time and relief scores over the 12 hours following dosing and was calculated using Simpson's trapezoidal rule.
The higher the LS Means scores, the more pain relief was obtained.
Relief (REL) scores were measured at multiple timepoints after dosing, using a 5 point categorical pain relief rating scale. (None = 0, A Little Relief = 1, Some = 2, A Lot = 3, Complete Relief = 4). The minimum possible TOTPAR 12 score = 0, maximum possible score = 48.</description>

    <measure>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) at 4 Hours Post Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was scored on an 11-point scale (PINRS), (0=no pain - 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Scores were measured at baseline (after surgery but before dosing) and at multiple timepoints after dosing. At each timepoint, pain intensity difference (PID) was calculated (ie, baseline score minus timepoint score).
SPID4 is an area calculation encompassing time and the PID scores over the 4 hours following dosing. The minimum possible SPID4 value = -40, the maximum possible = 40.
A positive SPID LS Means score implies reduced pain intensity over the corresponding time period.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Perceptible Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Onset of analgesia was measured using 2 stopwatches. Both stopwatches were started at the time of dose administration. Stopwatch 1 was pressed by the subject when any pain relief was first perceived (Time to First Perceptible Relief) and stopwatch 2 was pressed by the subject when pain relief became meaningful (Time to Meaningful Relief).</description>

    <description>Onset of analgesia was measured using 2 stopwatches. Both stopwatches were started at the time of dose administration. Stopwatch 1 was pressed by the subject when any pain relief was first perceived (Time to First Perceptible Relief) and stopwatch 2 was pressed by the subject when pain relief became meaningful (Time to Meaningful Relief).
'Meaningful Relief' was defined as when the relief became 'meaningful' to each individual subject, and was not necessarily a complete absence of pain. 'Meaningful Relief' could not occur before 'First Perceptible Relief'.</description>

Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) are those which either started or worsened following administration of study drug (XPF-001 or placebo).</description>

Relief (REL) scores were measured at multiple timepoints after dosing, using a 5 point categorical pain relief rating scale. (None = 0, A Little Relief = 1, Some = 2, A Lot = 3, Complete Relief = 4). The minimum possible TOTPAR 6 score = 0, maximum possible score = 24</description>

        <title>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) at 4 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was scored on an 11-point scale (PINRS), (0=no pain - 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Scores were measured at baseline (after surgery but before dosing) and at multiple timepoints after dosing. At each timepoint, pain intensity difference (PID) was calculated (ie, baseline score minus timepoint score).
SPID4 is an area calculation encompassing time and the PID scores over the 4 hours following dosing. The minimum possible SPID4 value = -40, the maximum possible = 40.
A positive SPID LS Means score implies reduced pain intensity over the corresponding time period.</description>

        <title>Summed Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) at 6 Hours Post Dose</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was scored on an 11-point scale (PINRS), (0=no pain - 10=pain as bad as you can imagine). Scores were measured at baseline (after surgery but before dosing) and at multiple timepoints after dosing. At each timepoint, pain intensity difference (PID) was calculated (ie, baseline score minus timepoint score).
SPID6 is an area calculation encompassing time and the PID scores over the 6 hours following dosing. The minimum possible SPID6 value = -60, the maximum possible = 60.
A positive SPID LS Means score implies reduced pain intensity over the corresponding time period.</description>

          <title>Treatment Emergent Adverse Events</title>
          <description>Adverse Events were recorded at the time of occurence. Clinically significant findings (if any) in ECG and vital signs assessments and laboratory samples were recorded as adverse events.
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) are those which either started or worsened following administration of study drug (XPF-001 or placebo).</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This model is best suited for drugs with rapid onset of action (e.g. NSAIDs). XPF-001 does not have a rapid onset.</limitations_and_caveats>
