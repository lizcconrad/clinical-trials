  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will determine whether there is any effect of GSK1014802 on
      ambulatory blood pressure. This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      repeat dose, 2 period cross-over study conducted in healthy male and female subjects.
      Approximately 60 subjects will be randomised to receive GSK1014802 400 mg bid and placebo for
      36 days with at least 1 week between treatment sessions. A follow-up will occur 7-14 days
      after the last dose.
