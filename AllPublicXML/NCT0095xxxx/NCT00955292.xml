    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study of quarfloxin (CX-3543) is designed to test the safety, tolerability, and
      highest safe dose of this drug when administered intravenously weekly for three weeks of a
      four week cycle in patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quarfloxin is a first-in-class small-molecule targeted cancer therapeutic derived from the
      validated fluoroquinolone class of drugs. Quarfloxin was rationally designed to target a
      G-quadruplex (QPLX) DNA structure and disrupt protein-DNA interactions essential to cancer
      cells. The QPLX targeted by quarfloxin forms within ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the QPLX is
      bound by the nucleolin protein.

          -  A negative pregnancy test (if female).

          -  Acceptable liver function as evaluated by laboratory results

          -  Acceptable renal function as evaluated by laboratory results

          -  Acceptable hematologic status as evaluated by laboratory results
