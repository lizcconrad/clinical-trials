  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In former studies of the investigators research group the investigators could also
      demonstrate acute inhibitory effects of the antidepressant mirtazapine on ACTH and cortisol
      release in normal controls (Schüle et al. 2002), most likely mediated via antagonism at
      central 5-HT2- and H1-receptors. In contrast to mirtazapine, serotonin or norepinephrine
      reuptake inhibiting antidepressants acutely stimulate ACTH and cortisol secretion (Schüle
      2007). The investigators also performed a study in depressed patients who were treated either
      with mirtazapine or with reboxetine using serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5)
      as a parameter for HPA axis activity. Mirtazapine, but not the norepinephrine reuptake
      inhibitor reboxetine was able to significantly reduce HPA axis activity already within one
      week (Schüle et al. 2006). Mirtazapine is known to have an earlier onset of antidepressant
      action than do SSRIs such as sertraline (Behnke et al. 2003) or antidepressants with dual
      mechanism of action such as venlafaxine (Benkert et al. 2006), possibly due to its rapid
      inhibition of HPA axis activity in unipolar depressed patients.

      Since mirtazapine and quetiapine have similar effects on the HPA system in healthy male
      volunteers (i.e. inhibition of ACTH and cortisol secretion), a rapid attenuation of HPA axis
      activity is also expected during quetiapine XR treatment in depressed patients.

      Therefore, in the present study the investigators goal is to investigate whether quetiapine
      fumarate XR at a dosage of 300 mg per day has an impact on HPA axis activity in unipolar
      depressed patients, as measured by serial dexamethasone/CRH tests (week 0, 1, and 5) and
      salivary cortisol profiles and whether putative effects of quetiapine XR on the HPA system
      are related to its antidepressant efficacy.
