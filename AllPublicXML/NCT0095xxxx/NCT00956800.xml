      The purpose of this study is to determine if providing some care to diabetic patients
      remotely, using Accuchek 360 yields at least the same clinical results for their diabetes
      care, according to existing guidelines, as providing all care to patients in person.

      This will be a non-inferiority study between two groups: a control group, which will receive
      5 routine office visits in one year; and a study group which will receive 3 routine office
      visits in the same time, and have two visits conducted by computer interaction, using the
      Accuchek 360 software. All will be capable of independent care of their diabetes. All
      patients will be 19-65 years of age. The end-points will include similar changes in
      hemoglobin A1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, lipid fractions, and
      similar levels of patient satisfaction with care.

      There will be 50 patients in each group, matched for age and sex distribution, educational
      level, computer literacy, and type of diabetes.
