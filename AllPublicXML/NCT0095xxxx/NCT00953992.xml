      -  To investigate the etiology, epidemiology and prognostic factors of acute kidney injury.

        -  To find out risk factors that relate with the prognosis of acute kidney injury,focusing
           on inflammation, oxidative stress and nutritional status.

        -  To study on the relationship between gene polymorphism and prognosis of acute kidney
           injury.

      1. to investigate the relationship between preexisting malnutrition and adverse outcomes in
           patients with AKI

           - Several nutritional assessment methods such as anthropometric, clinical and
           biochemical evaluations have been used; however, no single indicator is considered to be
           a &quot;gold standard.&quot;

        2. to evaluate the association of serum nutritional variables and prognosis of acute kidney
           injury

        3. Given the different half-lives of serum nutritional markers, we hypothesized that the
           utility of serum nutritional variables as prognostic predictors may differ in early
           death (&lt;7 days) and late death (&gt;7 days, &lt;28 days) patients.
