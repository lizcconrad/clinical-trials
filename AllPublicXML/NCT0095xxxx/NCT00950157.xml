    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether cautions about the evidence, in this case an
      &quot;open questions&quot; statement, decreases enthusiasm for drugs that are approved on surrogate
      outcomes (compared to patient outcomes) alone.

    <description>Survey describes the surrogate outcome of the drug along with a directive warning (i.e., stating the issue and why it matters) for drugs shown to improve surrogate outcomes.
This directive warning mentions that it is not known whether the drug will help patients feel better, and that readers should ask their doctor if there is an available drug shown to improve patient outcomes.</description>

    <description>Survey describes the surrogate outcome of the drug along with a non-directive warning (i.e., stating the issue only) for drugs shown to improve surrogate outcomes.

Participants are randomized to 1 of 3 caution (e.g. open question&quot;) statements: no open question statement, non-directive open question statement or directive open question statement.</description>
