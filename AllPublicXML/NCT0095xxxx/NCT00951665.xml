      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and feasibility of trastuzumab emtansine
      (T-DM1) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with paclitaxel (and
      pertuzumab, if applicable) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
      (HER2-positive), locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

        <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug. Vss is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state which is estimated by (D/AUC[0-inf]) X (AUMC[0-inf])/AUC[0-inf]) where D is the dose of study drug, AUMC(0-inf) is the area under the first moment curve extrapolated to infinity and AUC(0-inf) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time. The Vss of paclitaxel (65 mg/m2 and 80 mg/m2) is observed in Cycle 1 (in the absence of T-DM1) and Cycle 2 (in the presence of T-DM1).</description>

        <description>Participants with measurable disease (at least one lesion 2 centimeters [cm] or more on computed tomography (CT) scan or 1 cm or more on spiral CT scan) were considered for OR. ORR is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) determined on two consecutive tumor assessments at least 4 weeks apart based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.0 (RECIST). CR defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR defined as at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameters.</description>
