  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the great economic costs and traditionally poor outcomes among chronic temporomandibular
      joint and muscle disorder (TMJMD) patients, it has become important to treat patients in the
      acute state, in order to prevent these more chronic disability problems. This has been the
      goal of two past funded grant projects. Results of the initial project isolated risk factors
      that successfully predicted the development of chronicity with a 91% accuracy rate. A
      statistical algorithm was developed which was used in the second project to screen out
      &quot;high-risk&quot; patients. These patients were then randomly assigned an early intervention or
      non-intervention group. One-year follow-up evaluations documented the treatment efficacy and
      cost effectiveness of early intervention. These results have major implications for effective
      early intervention and significant health care cost savings for this prevalent pain and
      disability problem. For the present proposed project, we plan to implement this treatment
      program in order to evaluate its effectiveness in more community-based dental practices. This
      is in response to NIH's request for the implementation of evidence-based treatment
      approaches, developed in controlled clinical settings, to the &quot;real world&quot; of diverse
      practices in the community. Acute TMJMD patients will be recruited from two community-based
      clinics. Based upon our &quot;risk&quot; screening algorithm, high-risk patients will be randomly
      assigned to one of two groups (n=225/group): an early biobehavioral intervention or an
      attention-control group. It is hypothesized that the attention control &quot;high-risk&quot; patients
      will display more chronic TMJMD problems, relative to the &quot;high-risk&quot; early intervention
      patients, at one- and two-year follow-ups. A number of biopsychosocial measures will be
      evaluated, including chewing performance, the RDC/TMD, self-reported pain and stress, etc.
      Such a multi-level, multi-systems approach has not been applied to better understand the
      biopsychosocial underpinnings of TMJMD. Results from this component of the project will
      greatly aid in stimulating future research leading to the better understanding of TMJMD, as
      well as better tailoring of prescribed treatment regimens.

    <description>This intervention involves the use of non-invasive treatment modalities such as relaxation/biofeedback, stress management, and cognitive coping skills. It is based upon previous clinical research studies demonstrating the efficacy of this intervention in allowing acute TMD patients to better cope with stress and lifestyle issues that produce the TMD pain/discomfort.</description>

    <description>Unlike the other two treatment groups, that involve high-risk acute TMD patients, this group includes low-risk acute TMD patients. Past studies have shown that these low risk patients do not need any early intervention in order to prevent chronicity.</description>
