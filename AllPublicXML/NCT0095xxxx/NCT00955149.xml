    <textblock>
      Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bile ducts of
      unknown etiology. It is characterized by diffuse inflammation and stricturing of the entire
      biliary tree, eventually resulting in cirrhosis of the liver. Patients with PSC are at
      increased risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a cancer arising from bile
      duct epithelium. This risk is estimated to be approximately 1 to 1.5% per year. It is
      postulated that chronic inflammatory changes in the biliary epithelium promote CCA formation.
      The prognosis of CCA is fatal. The only potentially curative therapy is surgical; however,
      only a minority of patients qualify for surgical treatment.

      Several studies have demonstrated overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) in CCA cells. EGFR is a type 1 tyrosine kinase promoting cell proliferation, migration
      and altered cell adhesion - typical characteristics of malignant neoplasias. In CCA cells,
      EGFR-activation is sustained resulting in cancer progression. In human CCA samples,
      EGFR-expression correlates with higher histologic grade, poor prognosis, and risk of
      recurrence. The EGFR gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 7 (7p12). Chromosomal
      abnormalities of the bile duct epithelium, particularly trisomy 7 (i.e. three copies of
      chromosome 7) can be detected in biliary epithelial samples obtained by endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in PSC patients. The finding of cells with trisomy 7 has
      preceded the development of aneuploidy and multiple chromosomal abnormalities in a number of
      patients, the latter chromosomal abnormalities are characteristic of CCA. Trisomy 7 amplifies
      the gene for EGFR thereby presumably promoting overexpression of this growth factor receptor.
      In a cohort of patients with Trisomy 7 and Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis patients followed
      for 1 year, the rate of development of Cholangiocarcinoma was 35% (n=37, Dr. Gores,
      unpublished observation). Patients without cytologic abnormalities were at minimal risk for
      the development of CCA.

      Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a human EGFR type 1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tarceva received FDA
      approval as single agent treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer. In a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of 731 patients,
      receiving 150 mg of Tarceva or placebo once daily, median survival was prolonged to 6.7
      months from 4.7 months (p&lt;0.001). Analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor expression
      (45% of total study patients) demonstrated greater survival benefit in EGFR positive
      patients. Tarceva in combination with Gemcitabine is also FDA approved as first line therapy
      in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      Our central hypothesis is that patients with trisomy 7 will have carcinogenic changes
      including EGFR overexpression. EGFR blockade will inhibit a growth/survival advantage for
      these premalignant clones eliminating them from the biliary epithelium. As an initial step
      towards testing this hypothesis, the tolerability of Tarceva in this patient population needs
      to be established. This study will assist in determining the safety and tolerability of
      Tarceva in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. This study will be followed by a
      Phase 2 randomized controlled trial of Tarceva in patients with Primary Sclerosing
      Cholangitis with Trisomy 7.
