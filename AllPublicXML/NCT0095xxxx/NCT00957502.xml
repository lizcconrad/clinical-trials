    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, limited-use evaluation of the ENTact™ Septal Stapler for tissue
      approximation utilizing staples with extended shelf life. The ENTact™ Septal Stapler will be
      used to approximate the mucoperichondrial flaps in all patients. Each treatment group will be
      implanted with product that has been aged for a specified amount of time.
