  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 50% of stroke survivors have limitations in their activities of daily living on return
      to the community. Family caregivers provide invaluable support to these individuals during
      their recovery and rehabilitation. Unfortunately, there is no standard clinical practice to
      prepare caregivers for this role and, as a result, many experience stress and poor health
      that can compromise stroke survivor recovery and threaten the sustainability of the care
      needed to thrive in their home. To address this gap, the investigators have developed the
      Timing it Right Stroke Family Support Program that aims to meet the evolving needs of
      caregivers. The objective of this multi-province randomized controlled trial is to determine
      if this program delivered across the stroke care continuum improves caregivers' sense of
      being supported and emotional well-being. Ultimately this program could be used by stroke
      care programs from across Canada.

      The objective of this multi-province randomized controlled trial will be to determine if the
      TIR Stroke Family Support Program delivered across the care continuum contributes to positive
      caregiver outcomes. Since this program targets family caregiver support, the primary outcomes
      of the intervention will be caregivers' perception of being supported in their care-giving
      role and improvements in caregiver mental health outcomes (e.g., less depression and more
      psychological well-being). To determine the impact of the intervention on caregiver outcomes,
      we will compare two modes of intervention delivery with standard care: 1) repeated contact in
      person and by telephone with a stroke support person and 2) a self-directed program by the
      caregiver.

      We will perform a multi-site, mixed methods RCT. Caregivers of patients who are receiving
      acute care for their first stroke will be recruited within the first week of hospital
      admission. Members of the stroke team from the participating hospitals' stroke units will
      identify potential participants and ask their permission to be approached by each site's
      research assistant. The research assistant will fully explain the study, answer questions,
      obtain consent, administer the baseline questionnaires, and then contact the project
      coordinator who will then randomize participants to one of three groups: A) TIR Stroke Family
      Support Program delivered by a stroke support person, B) caregiver self-directed TIR Stroke
      Family Support Program, and C) usual care that includes provision of the Heart and Stroke
      educational resource &quot;Let's Talk about Stroke&quot;. The research assistants will give caregivers
      a copy of &quot;Let's Talk about Stroke&quot; (if they have not yet received a copy) and introduce them
      to the stroke support person who will deliver the full intervention and instruct the family
      in the use of the self-directed arm of the intervention. A second part-time research
      assistant blinded to group assignment will complete routine follow-up assessments with
      participants at 3, 6, and 12 months post-stroke. A subset of 36 participants (6 from each
      site) will also participate in a qualitative interview after completion of their 12-month
      follow-up assessment.

      The goals of this multi-site randomized controlled trial are to:

        1. Assess whether the intervention improves caregivers outcomes (via quantitative analysis)

        2. Assess how the intervention improves caregiver outcomes (via qualitative analysis)

        3. Assess how the intervention is delivered (via stroke support person journals)

    <description>Intervention delivered by a stroke support person (SSP) in-person during acute care &amp; by telephone during inpatient rehabilitation and community discharge. SSP provides support, information &amp; guidance and gives caregivers Stroke Family Support guide as a resource. SSP will have 1 contact with the caregiver during acute care and a 2nd contact during the last week of inpatient acute or rehabilitation care. The 1st contact while the caregiver is at home will occur 2-3 weeks after the stroke survivor has been discharged from inpatient care and then every four weeks until the caregiver passes the marker question. SSP will then encourage caregiver to contact them if they have any specific questions. The SSP will make one final contact about 8 weeks later</description>

    <description>Participants in this arm of the trial will have family caregivers self-direct their use of the Timing it Right Stroke Family Support guide. The research assistant will instruct the caregivers how to self-manage their support needs by providing instruction on how to use the guide, which has an additional section regarding self-management. Caregivers will also be instructed that the guide is organized according to the phases of a stroke survivors' recovery. They will be instructed to review the information in each chapter as it becomes relevant to their current situation</description>
