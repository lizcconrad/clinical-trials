  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to establish the long-term tolerability and safety of
      istradefylline treatment in subjects with Parkinson's disease treated with
      levodopa/carbidopa. In addition, treatment response and maintenance of response were
      assessed.
