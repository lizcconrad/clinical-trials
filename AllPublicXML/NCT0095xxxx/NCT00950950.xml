    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of AMG 785 on parameters of bone quality
      of the forearm using peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (pQCT) following multiple
      subcutaneous dose administrations of AMG 785 in postmenopausal women with low bone mass.

             daily

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Osteoporosis, defined as a BMD T-score ≤ -2.5 at the lumbar spine or femoral neck

          -  History of vertebral fracture, or fragility fracture of the wrist, humerus, hip or
             pelvis

          -  Diagnosed with any condition that will affect bone metabolism

          -  Any organic or psychiatric disorder, which, in the opinion of the investigator, poses
             a risk to subject safety and may prevent the subject from completing the study or
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  Unavailable for follow-up assessment or any concerns for subject's compliance with the
             protocol procedures

          -  Any other condition that might reduce the chance of obtaining data required by the
             protocol or that might compromise the ability to give truly informed consent

          -  History or evidence of a clinically significant disorder, condition or disease that,
             in the opinion of the Investigator or Amgen physician would pose a risk to subject

             laboratory evaluation

          -  Participation in another clinical study within 4 weeks of screening or within 5 times
