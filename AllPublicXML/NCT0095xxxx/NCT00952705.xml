  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to show that quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine
      (Q/LAIV-BFS; MEDI8662) was at least as immunogenic as two different forms of the commercial
      vaccine, FluMist, by comparing the strain-specific antibody levels in the blood.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the immunologic noninferiority of
      MEDI8662, a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (Q/LAIV) (delivered intranasally
      using the blow-fill-seal [BFS] delivery system) (Q/LAIV-BFS) to two trivalent formulations of
      licensed FluMist (delivered intranasally using the Becton Dickinson [BD] Accuspray™ device)
      by comparing the strain-specific geometric mean titers (GMTs) post dosing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Post Dose Strain-specific Serum Hemagglutination Inhibition (HAI) Antibody Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) in the Q/LAIV-BFS (MEDI8662) Arm as Compared to Those in the Combined Flumist Arms (All Flumist Group).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 to 35</time_frame>
    <description>Noninferior immune response was assessed by evaluating the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratios of strain-specific HAI GMTs for the specified comparisons. The GMT ratio = GMT in comparator (All FluMist group) divided by the GMT in the Q/LAIV-BFS arm.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were screened for the study within 30 days prior to randomization at investigator clinic sites in the USA. The first and last dates of informed consent were 14Aug2009 and 26Aug2009, respectively.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 1,888 participants who provided written informed consent and were screened for the study, 88 were screened but were not randomized into the study due to one or more of the following reasons: not meeting the eligibility criteria; study was full; withdrawal of consent; lost to follow-up; unable to obtain a blood sample for immunogenicity testing.</pre_assignment_details>
