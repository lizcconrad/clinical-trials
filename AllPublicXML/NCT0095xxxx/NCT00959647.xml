  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, open-label extension study. Patients who received vismodegib
      (GDC-0449) in a Genentech-sponsored study and who had completed the parent study or who
      continued to receive vismodegib at the time the parent study closed were eligible for
      continued treatment in this protocol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        This study only enrolled participants who took part in previous studies of vismodegib
        conducted by Genentech.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completed vismodegib treatment within 2-4 weeks in a Genentech-sponsored parent study
             or continued to receive vismodegib at the time the Genentech-sponsored parent study
             closed.

          -  Expectation by the investigator that the participant may continue to benefit from
             additional vismodegib treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intervening anti-tumor therapy not specified in the parent study (ie,
             non-protocol-specified chemotherapy, other targeted therapy, radiation therapy, or
             photodynamic therapy).
