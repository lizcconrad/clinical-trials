  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To find out if spatial neglect following stroke and brain injury can be reduced using
      guanfacine, a drug that was shown to improve neglect in two stroke patients in a previous
      pilot study (Malhotra et al, 2006). In this trial, the effects of guanfacine will be examined
      in a larger number of patients, and there will also be a systematic assessment of whether the
      drug is only effective in patients with particular patterns of brain damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study has a double-blind crossover design where patients will receive a single
      2mg dose of oral guanfacine and a single dose of placebo. They will receive one of these on
      Day 2 of the study period and the other on Day 4.

      They will be tested daily on Days 1 to 5 so that any test repetition or long-term drug
      effects can be gauged.

      On days 2 and 4 they will be tested twice-once prior to drug/placebo administration and again
      90 minutes after drug/placebo administration.

      Tests will include standard pen-and-paper tasks for neglect as well as computerised tests of
      sustained attention and visual exploration. In our published pilot study (Malhotra et al,
      2006) there was a suggestion that patients without damage to frontal cortex were more likely
      to respond to guanfacine. In the current study we intend to test 10 patients with and 10
      patients without frontal damage in order to test this further.
