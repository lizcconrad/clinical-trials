      The purpose of the study is to find out if administration of danazol with plasma exchange and
      corticosteroids will reduce the number of plasma exchanges required to control Thrombotic
      Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP).

    <textblock>
      Danazol is a synthetic steroid hormone structurally resembling a group of natural hormones
      (androgens)found in the body. Danazol has immune modifying activity and is effective in
      treatment of blood disorders with low platelet counts such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic
      purpura (however FDA has not yet approved danazol for this disorder). A study of danazol in
      conjunction with plasma exchange for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura showed that danazol
      decreased the number of plasma exchanges required by approximately 80% and reduced the time
      needed to control the disease. It's not clear how danazol works in TTP. It is not approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of TTP.
