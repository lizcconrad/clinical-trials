  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Attention Deficit/ Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is a common comorbidity in
      individuals diagnosed with Substance Use Disorder (SUD), little data currently exists on the
      utility of screening tools in large samples of adult patients with SUD in inpatient
      treatment. This was a 10-week, 2-phase, open label trial of atomoxetine for ADHD in adult
      patients being treated for a co-morbid SUD in a residential treatment facility (RTF). The
      primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of atomoxetine in adults with an
      SUD and ADHD. Secondary objects included assessment of the co-morbidity of ADHD and the
      safety and tolerability of atomoxetine in this population.

      Phase 1: Patients with SUD who were either newly admitted (abstinent for &lt;1 week) or in
      treatment in the RTF (abstinent &lt;3 months) were administered the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale
      Symptom Checklist (ASRS) v. 1.1 Screener. Patients who screened positive(&gt;= 4 out 6
      significant items) were then administered the Adult Clinician Diagnostic Scale (ACDS) v.1.2
      to establish a diagnosis of ADHD and the Predictive Value Positive (PVP) in this population.

      Phase II (Treatment): Participants who screened positive for ADHD on the ACDS were given
      informed consent and baseline evaluations for inclusion. Those meeting inclusion/exclusion
      criteria were treated with atomoxetine starting at 25 mg/day. The dose was adjusted based on
      clinical response and tolerability over a 4-week period up to 120 mg/day and held constant
      for the final six weeks of the trial.

    <description>The AISRS (Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale) consists 18-items that directly correspond to the 18 DSM-IV symptoms of ADHD. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe, higher score is more impaired). The total summed score was at minimum 0 and at maximum 54 (the higher the score the more severe the symptomatology).</description>

    <description>The ASRS (Adult ADHD Symptom Rating Scale) v1.1 Symptom Checklist is an 18-item scale developed by the workgroup on Adult ADHD for the World Health Organization designed to assess the frequency of ADHD symptoms on a 0-4 scale (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3= often, and 4 = very often, minimum total summed score of 0 and maximum total summed score of 72, higher score is more impairment).</description>

    <description>The CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression-- Severity of Illness) scale is a single-item rating scale of the clinician's assessment of the global severity of ADHD symptoms in relation to the clinician's total experience with ADHD patients. Severity is rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>

    <description>Patients who were identified as having adult ADHD on the ACDS were offered an open label treatment trial with atomoxetine, up to 120 mg/day over 10 weeks. Atomoxetine was titrated over a period of four weeks based upon clinical response and observed side-effects. All patients receiving atomoxetine gave written informed consent prior to participation and were assessed for ADHD symptoms via the Adult Investigator Adult ADHD Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) every 1-2 weeks. All patients received a physical exam, review of systems and routine blood work prior to treatment. Data were analyzed for patients completing at least 2 weeks of atomoxetine therapy. Treatment response was pre-hoc defined as having a &gt;=30% reduction in total AISRS scores from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale Score</title>
        <description>The AISRS (Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale) consists 18-items that directly correspond to the 18 DSM-IV symptoms of ADHD. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe, higher score is more impaired). The total summed score was at minimum 0 and at maximum 54 (the higher the score the more severe the symptomatology).</description>

            <description>Patients who were identified as having adult ADHD on the ACDS were offered an open label treatment trial with atomoxetine, up to 100 mg/day over 10 weeks. Atomoxetine was titrated over a period of four weeks based upon clinical response and observed side effects. All patients receiving atomoxetine gave written informed consent prior to participation and were assessed for ADHD symptoms via the Adult Investigator Adult ADHD Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) every 1-2 weeks. All patients received a physical exam, review of systems and routine blood work prior to treatment. Data were analyzed for patients completing at least 2 weeks of atomoxetine therapy. Treatment response was pre-hoc defined as having a &gt;=30% reduction in total AISRS scores from baseline. Atomoxetine : In Phase II, atomoxetine was dispensed beginning at 25 mg/day. Dose was adjusted based on clinical response and tolerability over a 4-week period up to 120mg/day and held constant for the final 6 weeks of the trial.</description>
