      CYPRESS: A Prospective,Randomized,Multi-Center,Double-Blind Trial to Assess the Effectiveness
      and Safety of Different Durations of Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy (DAPT) in Subjects Undergoing
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with the CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent (CYPHER®
      Stent)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase I (non-randomized phase) of this study, the primary objective is to assess the
      rate of target lesion failure in subjects implanted with the CYPHER® stent and receiving dual
      antiplatelet therapy for 12 months.

      During Phase II (randomized phase) of this study, the primary objective is to assess safety
      (major and minor bleeding), MACCE, and ST rates in subjects treated with dual antiplatelet
      therapy for 12 or 30 months following CYPHER® stent implantation.

      *Subjects treated with the CYPHER® 2.25mm stent will be followed through 60 months.

      **The last 500 patients enrolled will not be eligible for randomization.

          <description>The CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent is a BX Velocity stent design and is laser cut from 316L stainless steel seamless tubing and electropolished. The stent design is intended to balance radial strength and &quot;closed cell&quot; architecture with longitudinal flexibility in both unexpanded and expanded forms. The design can be broken into two distinct components: the radial expansion ring segments and the flexible connectors in an alternating fashion.</description>

The stent design is intended to balance radial strength and &quot;closed cell&quot; architecture with longitudinal flexibility in both unexpanded and expanded forms. The design can be broken into two distinct components: the radial expansion ring segments and the flexible connectors in an alternating fashion.</description>
