      Study Aims:

        1. To validate a new measure of sexual function and activity in women with PFDs;

        2. To establish the responsiveness to change of the new measure.

      The investigators hypothesis is that the investigators can create a new questionnaire that
      accurately measures sexual health in women with pelvic floor disorders that improves on the
      already published questionnaires.

    <textblock>
      600 women presenting for care to urogynecology clinics in the United States and England will
      be recruited to participate. They will give data regarding their physical exam, including
      measurements by the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification exam and medical and surgical
      history. In addition, they will complete validated questionnaires including the Incontinence
      Severity Index, the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (short form) and question # 35 from the
      Epidemiology of Prolapse and Incontinence Questionnaire. All women will also complete two
      sexual health questionnaires; the Female Sexual Function Index and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (Revised). Women will receive standard care for
      their pelvic floor disorders. They will then be recontacted to repeat the same set of
      questionnaires to determine the responsiveness of the new measure. Reliability of the
      questionnaire will be measured by having a subset of women complete the questionnaire twice;
      a factor analysis will be performed to determine the underlying factor structure. Responses
      to the other QOL measures will be compared to those to the new instrument to establish
      validity.

        Goal to enroll approximately 800 women so that 600 surveys are available for evaluation of
        the sexual health of women with pelvic floor disorders presenting for urogynecological care
        in the United States or England

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for patients include age over 18 years.

          -  Not pregnant.

          -  Able to read/write and understand English.

          -  And, because this is a project to validate a measure of female sexual function, all
             subjects will be women.

          -  All women will be seeking care for PFD including urinary and anal incontinence and
             POP. Since data collection will primarily be by mail

          -  Women must have a stable and current address.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women under the age of 18.

          -  Are pregnant or who are unable to read/write or understand English will not be
             eligible for participation.

          -  In addition, women with a diagnosis of vulvodynia, painful bladder syndrome, or
             chronic pelvic pain (defined as pelvic pain for greater than 6 months) as determined
             by the consenting physician will be excluded.

          -  Since this is a study to evaluate both sexual activity status as well as sexual
             function, women need not be sexually active to participate.
