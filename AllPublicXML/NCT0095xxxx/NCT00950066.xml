    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the extent of reduction of mean Seated Diastolic Blood
      Pressure (SeDBP) at the end of 8 weeks between each Fixed Dose Combination (FDC), its
      individual constituents administered as monotherapy and placebo.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to compare the reduction of mean Seated Systolic Blood Pressure (SeSBP) at the end of 8
           weeks from baseline between each FDC, its individual constituents administered as
           monotherapy and placebo.

        -  to compare the reduction of mean SeDBP and SeSBP at 4 weeks from baseline between each
           FDC, its individual constituents administered as monotherapy and placebo.
