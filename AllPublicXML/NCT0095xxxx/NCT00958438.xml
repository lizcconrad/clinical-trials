  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of
      an experimental drug called rilonacept in participants with gout who are beginning
      allopurinol treatment for gout. Participants will participate in this study for approximately
      22 weeks. Rilonacept was being studied for use in preventing allopurinol-induced gout flares.

    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 113 (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>Gout flare was defined as acute articular pain typical of a gout attack that required treatment with an anti-inflammatory therapeutic: had at least 3 of the following 4 signs or symptoms: joint swelling, tenderness, redness, and pain and with at least 1 of the following: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of motion, joint warmth or other symptoms similar to a prior gout flare. Number of gout flares per participant was reported for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Modified gout flare was defined using modified definition of a gout flare as participant-reported articular pain typical of a gout attack that was deemed to require treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy. Number of modified gout flares per participant were reported for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Gout flare was defined as acute articular pain typical of a gout attack that required treatment with an anti-inflammatory therapeutic: had at least 3 of the following 4 signs or symptoms: joint swelling, tenderness, redness, and pain, and with at least 1 of the following: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of motion, joint warmth or other symptoms similar to a prior gout flare.

    <measure>Number of Gout Flare Days With Participant's Pain Score of 5 or More (From Daily Diary) Per Participant From Day 1 to Day 113 (Week 16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 113 (Week 16)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to complete a telephone diary by calling the IVRS daily beginning at the baseline visit (Day 1) through the follow-up visit (Day 141) and reported their general well-being, gout symptoms, and weekly study drug administrations. At the onset of pain from a gout flare, participants were to answer additional diary questions regarding their gout flare and had to continue daily flare assessments until they reported the flare had ended. If a flare occurred just prior to the follow-up visit (Day 141), participants were to continue completing the daily diary until the flare resolved. Gout flare pain was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=severe pain) within the past 24 hours.</description>

        <title>Number of Gout Flare Days With Participant's Pain Score of 5 or More (From Daily Diary) Per Participant From Day 1 to Day 113 (Week 16)</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to complete a telephone diary by calling the IVRS daily beginning at the baseline visit (Day 1) through the follow-up visit (Day 141) and reported their general well-being, gout symptoms, and weekly study drug administrations. At the onset of pain from a gout flare, participants were to answer additional diary questions regarding their gout flare and had to continue daily flare assessments until they reported the flare had ended. If a flare occurred just prior to the follow-up visit (Day 141), participants were to continue completing the daily diary until the flare resolved. Gout flare pain was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10 (with 0=no pain and 10=severe pain) within the past 24 hours.</description>
