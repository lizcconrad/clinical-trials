  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent retrospective studies have suggested that iron overload is a clinically important
      problem in patients undergoing ablative stem cell transplantation. However, these studies
      relied on serum ferritin as a surrogate of iron overload, which limits the conclusions that
      can be drawn from such analyses. Therefore, the investigators are conducting a prospective
      study to more rigorously examine the prevalence, mechanisms, and consequences of iron
      overload in this patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histologically confirmed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia
             (ALL), or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

          -  Planned allogeneic stem cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning regimen
             (regardless of stem cell source or donor HLA match)

          -  Patients will be eligible even if they have had prior stem cell transplantation
             (autologous or allogeneic)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):

               -  Patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted cardiac defibrillator (ICD), cardiac
                  electrodes, pacing wires, internal electrodes, cochlear, otologic or other ear
                  implants, metallic fragments or foreign body, metallic prosthesis. Patients with
                  surgical staples should not be imaged until 7 days post-op unless approved by a
                  radiologist;

               -  Severe claustrophobia

               -  Note: a history of allergic reaction to gadolinium is not a contraindication to
                  enrollment, as contrast will not be used.

          -  Inability to provide informed consent
