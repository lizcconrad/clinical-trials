  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT)
      device called the SNaP device compared to a traditional NPWT device for the treatment of
      lower extremity diabetic and venous ulcer wounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, two-arm, non-inferiority, multi-center study comparing
      negative pressure therapy wound healing outcomes between the SNaP Wound Care System and
      traditional NPWT systems.
