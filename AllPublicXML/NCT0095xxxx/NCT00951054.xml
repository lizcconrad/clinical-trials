      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NK012 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of advanced and metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open label, single arm, multicenter study of NK012 in patients with
      locally advanced non-resectable and metastatic breast cancer with ER-negative, PR negative
      and HER2-negative phenotype. NK012 will be administered by infusion over 30 minutes once
      every 28 days (on Day 1 of each cycle). Patients will be screened for UGT1A1 polymorphism
      prior to enrollment in order to determine their starting dose.

    <description>30 minute IV infusion once every 28 days. NK012 dose is 28 mg/m^2 (or 18 mg/m^2 depending on UGT1A1 polymorphism, with potential to dose escalate). Dose escalation cannot exceed 28 mg/m^2. Dosing will proceed until progression or unacceptable toxicity develops, or decision by patient or investigator to stop.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer with locally
             advanced disease for which there is no surgical option, or stage IV disease.

          -  ER-negative and PR-negative (defined as less than or equal to 10% tumor staining).

          -  HER2-negative defined as one of the following:

               1. 0 or 1+ IHC;

               2. 2+ or 3+ IHC and FISH negative (ratio &lt; 2.2);

               3. or FISH negative (ratio &lt; 2.2).

          -  No less than one and no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced or
             metastatic disease.

          -  Prior chemotherapy must have included a taxane either as part of an adjuvant regimen
             or as part of a metastatic disease regimen.

          -  Interval from last dose of prior treatment to enrollment in this study must be at
             least 4 weeks for cytotoxic chemotherapy (exception: 6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C), 5 half-lives for non-cytotoxic therapy (to be reviewed by the Medical
             Monitor to establish start date), and 4 weeks for monoclonal antibodies; patients must
             have recovered from all acute toxicities.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Females at least 18 years of age.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as defined by absolute neutrophil count of greater than
             or equal to 1,500/ mm^3 and platelets of greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3.

          -  AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) levels no greater than 3 x the institutional ULN, and total
             bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN, or creatinine clearance greater than
             or equal to 60 mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault formula) for patients with serum creatinine
             levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN.

          -  Able to understand and show willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patient has Gilbert's Syndrome.

          -  Concurrent use of other investigational agent.

          -  History of brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated a minimum of
             4 weeks before study entry and stable without requirement for corticosteroids for &gt; 1
             week.

          -  Prior exposure to topoisomerase 1 inhibitors (i.e., irinotecan, topotecan,
             camptothecin).

          -  Concurrent serious infections requiring parenteral therapy.

          -  Pregnant or of childbearing potential and not using methods to avoid pregnancy. A
             negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be documented at baseline for women of
             childbearing potential. Patients may not breast-feed infants while on this study.

          -  Significant cardiac disease including heart failure that meets New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) class III and IV definitions, history of myocardial infarction
             within one year of study entry, uncontrolled dysrhythmias or poorly controlled angina.

          -  History of serious ventricular arrhythmia (VT or VF, greater than or equal to 3 beats
             in a row), QTc greater than or equal to 450 msec for men and 470 msec for women, or
             LVEF less than or equal to 40% by MUGA or ECHO.
