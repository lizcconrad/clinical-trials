  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Miralax (PEG 3350) has been shown to be a safe and uncomplicated bowel preparation prior to
      colonoscopy in pediatric populations. This study seeks to confirm the efficacy of this bowel
      cleansing regimen in adults and to determine the benefit of adding a pretreatment medication
      to this bowel preparation. The tolerability of Miralax will hopefully improve patient
      satisfaction with colonoscopy and decrease their reluctance to be screened because of the
      uncomfortable taste and side effects of bowel preparation regimens.

    <measure>The Cleanliness of the Prep as Measured by the Ottawa Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at the time of colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Bowel cleansing was evaluated with the Ottawa bowel preparation scale by each endoscopist during the endoscopy. Neither the endoscopist nor the endoscopy nurse was aware of the bowel preparation used prior to the colonoscopy. The Ottawa bowel preparation scale is a validated tool and was used in this study to provide a reliable quality assessment of the bowel preparation used for colonoscopy. This validated scale rates each section of the colon, the right, the mid, and the rectosigmoid colon, on a 5-point scale (0-4), as well as a global 3-point rating for overall colonic fluid (0-2). The total score ranges from 0 to 14. An excellent preparation with little fluid would score 0-3, a good preparation 4-6, while scores higher than 7 would indicate progressively worsening bowel preparations. A completely unprepared colon would score 11-14, depending on the amount of colonic fluid.</description>

        <title>The Cleanliness of the Prep as Measured by the Ottawa Scale</title>
        <description>Bowel cleansing was evaluated with the Ottawa bowel preparation scale by each endoscopist during the endoscopy. Neither the endoscopist nor the endoscopy nurse was aware of the bowel preparation used prior to the colonoscopy. The Ottawa bowel preparation scale is a validated tool and was used in this study to provide a reliable quality assessment of the bowel preparation used for colonoscopy. This validated scale rates each section of the colon, the right, the mid, and the rectosigmoid colon, on a 5-point scale (0-4), as well as a global 3-point rating for overall colonic fluid (0-2). The total score ranges from 0 to 14. An excellent preparation with little fluid would score 0-3, a good preparation 4-6, while scores higher than 7 would indicate progressively worsening bowel preparations. A completely unprepared colon would score 11-14, depending on the amount of colonic fluid.</description>
