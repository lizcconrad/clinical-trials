    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-week study was to assess in subjects with chronic hepatitis C
      (treatment-naïve, genotype 1) receiving weight-based doses of ribavirin the early virologic
      response to the 480 ug dose level of Locteron™, dosed every 2 weeks, in comparison with 1.5
      ug/kg PEG-Intron™ dosed weekly.

      The aim of the 480 STUDY was to compare efficacy and safety of 480ug Locteron dosed every
      other week to 1.5 ug/kg PegIntron dosed weekly in treatment-naïve genotype-1 chronic HCV
      subjects treated with weight-based ribavirin. This 12-week study was comprised of two panels
      (Panel A and Panel B). The designs of both panels were identical. HCV RNA was measured weekly
      for three weeks and then every other week. Adverse events including flu-like events and
      depression were collected during weekly clinic visits for 12 weeks. Flu-like events were also
      collected daily for 12 weeks by subject self-report using the internet (ePRO). Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI) and Short Form-36 scores were measured at baseline and monthly
      through Week 12.

      In Panel A of 480 STUDY, 42 treatment-naïve subjects with chronic genotype-1 HCV in Bulgaria
      and Romania were randomized and dosed with either Locteron q2weeks or weekly PegIntron, both
      in combination with weight-based ribavirin (13). In Panel A, 19 subjects received 480ug
      Locteron and 23 subjects received PegIntron.

      In Panel B of 480 STUDY, 32 treatment-naïve subjects with genotype-1 HCV in Israel were
      randomized and dosed with either Locteron q2weeks or weekly PegIntron, both in combination
      with weight-based ribavirin (13). In Panel B, 16 subjects received 480ug Locteron and 16
      subjects received PegIntron.
