      This randomized phase III trial studies bevacizumab and intravenous (given into a vein)
      chemotherapy to see how well they work compared with bevacizumab and intraperitoneal (given
      into the abdominal cavity) chemotherapy in treating patients with stage II-III ovarian
      epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread by
      blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It
      is not yet known whether giving bevacizumab together with intravenous chemotherapy is more
      effective than giving bevacizumab together with intraperitoneal chemotherapy in treating
      patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if one or both of the proposed intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimens improves
      the progression-free survival (PFS) event rate compared to standard intravenous chemotherapy
      for first-line treatment of patients diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian, peritoneal or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      II. If both intraperitoneal (IP) regimens significantly improve the PFS event rate compared
      to the standard regimen, then a second study objective is to determine whether IP cisplatin
      and intravenous (IV) paclitaxel on day one plus IP paclitaxel on day eight improves the PFS
      event rate when compared to the IP carboplatin and IV paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if intraperitoneal chemotherapy reduces the overall death rate compared to
      standard intravenous chemotherapy.

      II. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0.

      III. To compare the patient-reported outcomes on: Quality of Life (Function Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy-Ovarian-Trial Outcome Index [FACT-O-TOI]), Neuropathy (FACT-Gynecologic
      Oncology Group/Neurotoxicity [GOG/NTX4] scale), Abdominal discomfort (FACT-GOG/AD scale),
      Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue scale), and Nausea (item from FACT-O-TOI).

      IV. To assess the frequency and the reasons for early discontinuation of the study
      treatments.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research and examine the
      association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and measures of clinical outcome
      including overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events.

      II. To bank archival tumor for research and examine the association between tumor markers and
      measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression-free survival and
      adverse events.

      III. Patients will be encouraged to enroll on the companion translational research protocol
      (CEM0703 under development).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV
      over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1 in
      courses 2-6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab alone in courses 7-22
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in Arm I and carboplatin IP on day 1. Patients also
      receive bevacizumab as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab alone as
      in Arm I.

      ARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin IP on day 2, and
      paclitaxel IP on day 8. Patients also receive bevacizumab as in Arm I. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then receive bevacizumab alone as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

    <time_frame>Progression-free survival is measured from date of randomization until first indication of progression based on RECIST criteria or death from any cause, or if progression-free at last contact, the date of last disease assessment up to 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Estimate the median duration of progression-free survival in months. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (RECIST v1.0) as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <description>Eligible and treated patients. CTCAE includes grades 1-5. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event. Grades 0 listed should be interpreted to mean there were no subjects in the arm with a toxicity to report. Grade 1 toxicities are mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms. Grade 2 toxicities are moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated. Grade 3 toxicities are severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening. Grade 4 toxicities are life threatening. Grade 5 is death related to adverse event.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time points: Baseline, prior to cycle 4, prior to cycle 7, prior to cycle 13, prior to cycle 21, up to 84 weeks post starting treatment</time_frame>
    <description>QOL was measured with the FACT-O TOI score. Means at baseline are raw means. Scores are reported at all time points in the outcome measure table. FACT-O TOI is Trial outcome index (TOI) of the Functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT) for ovarian cancer (FACT-O). The FACT-O TOI is composed of three subscales; Physical Well Being (PWB) ( 7 items), and Ovarian Cancer subscale (OCS) (12 items). Each item in the FACT-O TOI are scored using a 5 point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat;3=quite a bit;4=very much). A subscale score is computed as long as more thatn 50% of subscale items have been answered. A total score of the FACT-O items provide valid responses and all three subscales have valid scores. A score of the FACT-) TOI is ranged 0-104 with a larger score indicating a more preferred state of health-related quality of life (HRQOL).</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Neurotoxicity (Ntx)</measure>
    <time_frame>Time points: Baseline, prior to cycle 4, prior to cycle 7, prior to cycle 13, prior to cycle 21, 84 weeks post starting treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT/GOG-NTX subscale (short version) contains 4 items measuring sensory neuropathy. Each item is scored using a 5 point Likert scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit;2=somewhat;3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For each item, reversal was performed prior to score calculation so that a large score suggests less symptoms. According to the FACIT measurement system, the subscale score was calculated as the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of a subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the subscale. The Ntx subscale score ranges from 0-16 with a large subscale score suggesting less symptom or better QOL.</description>

    <time_frame>Time points: Baseline, prior to cycle 4, prior to cycle 7, prior to cycle 13, prior to cycle 21, 84 weeks post starting treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported fatigue as measured with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue scale (FACIT-Fatigue). The FACIT-Fatigue contains 13 items. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat; 3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For the negative items, reversal was performed prior to score calculation. According to the FACIT measurement system, the Fatigue score was the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the scale. The FACIT-Fatigue score ranges 0-52 with a large score suggesting less fatigue.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologic diagnosis of epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
             peritoneal carcinoma, stage II, III, or IV with either optimal (=&lt; 1 cm residual
             disease) or suboptimal residual disease; in the event of a higher priority Phase III
             Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol becoming available for suboptimal and/or
             stage IV patients, the eligibility of this study will narrow and exclude those
             patients at those participating institutions (11/02/2009)

               -  Note: patients with suboptimal disease/and or stage IV will not be eligible as of
                  April 1, 2011; they should be enrolled on GOG-0262 (03/14/11)

               -  All patients must have a procedure for determining diagnosis of epithelial
                  ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, with appropriate tissue for
                  histologic evaluation; the minimum surgery required is an abdominal surgery
                  providing tissue for histologic evaluation and establishing and documenting the
                  primary site and stage, as well as a maximal effort at tumor debulking; if
                  additional surgery was performed, it should have been in accordance with
                  appropriate surgery for ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma described in the GOG
                  Surgical Procedures Manual (https://www.gog.fccc.edu/manuals/pdf/surgman.pdf)
                  (11/02/2009)(08/16/2010)

          -  Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types are eligible: serous
             adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell
             carcinoma, malignant Brenner's Tumor, or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified
             (N.O.S.); however, the histologic features of the tumor must be compatible with a
             primary Müllerian epithelial adenocarcinoma; if doubt exists, it is recommended that
             the investigator should have the slides reviewed by an independent pathologist prior
             to entry; patients may have co-existing endometrial cancer so long as the primary
             origin of invasive tumor is ovarian or peritoneal; Note: patients with mucinous, low
             grade and clear cell disease are eligible unless there is a higher priority GOG trial
             open (11/02/2009) (08/16/2010)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1,500/mcl, equivalent to
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) grade 1; this ANC cannot
             have been induced or supported by granulocyte colony stimulating factors

          -  Platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcl

          -  Creatinine no greater than institutional upper limits of normal (03/29/10)

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to
             2.5 x ULN (CTCAE grade 1)

          -  Alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE grade 1)

          -  Neuropathy (sensory and motor) less than or equal to CTCAE grade 1

          -  Prothrombin time (PT) such that international normalized ratio (INR) is =&lt; 1.5 x ULN
             (or an in-range INR, usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of
             therapeutic warfarin) and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) =&lt; 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal (heparin, Lovenox or alternative anticoagulants are acceptable); this
             corresponds to CTCAE version 3.0 grade 1 one or less (11/02/2009) (03/29/10)

             performed for the combined purpose of diagnosis, staging and/or cytoreduction; the
             first cycle of chemotherapy should not be given until at least seven days after the
             most recent major surgery, which allows 4 weeks to have elapsed prior to the first
             bevacizumab dose; (placement of venous or peritoneal access devices will be considered
             minor surgery) (03/29/10)

          -  Patients who have met the pre-entry requirements specified

          -  An approved informed consent and authorization permitting release of personal health
             information must be signed by the patient or guardian

          -  Patients in this trial may receive ovarian estrogen +/- progestin replacement therapy
             as indicated at the lowest effective dose(s) for control of menopausal symptoms at any
             time, but high dose progestin as an appetite stimulant should be avoided (03/29/10)

             received prior chemotherapy for any ovarian tumor

          -  Patients with a history of other invasive malignancies, with the exception of
             non-melanoma skin cancer and other specific malignancies are excluded if there is any
             evidence of the other malignancy being present within the last five years; patients
             are also excluded if their previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol
             therapy (11/02/2009)

          -  Patients who have received prior radiotherapy to any portion of the abdominal cavity
             or pelvis are excluded; prior radiation for localized cancer of the breast, head and
             neck, or skin is permitted, provided that it was completed more than three years prior
             to registration, and the patient remains free of recurrent or metastatic disease

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for any abdominal or pelvic tumor
             including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for their ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer are
             excluded; patients may have received prior adjuvant chemotherapy for localized breast
             cancer, provided that it was completed more than three years prior to registration,

             within 28 days; patients with granulating incisions healing by secondary intention
             with no evidence of fascial dehiscence or infection are eligible but require weekly
             wound examinations

          -  Patients with active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of
             bleeding, such as known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy, or tumor involving major
             vessels

          -  Patients with history or evidence upon physical examination of major central nervous
             system (CNS) disease (for example: primary brain tumor, metastatic cancer in the

             recombinant human or humanized antibodies; patients with known allergy to Cremophor or
             polysorbate 80

          -  Patients with clinically significant proteinuria; urine protein should be screened by
             urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR); patients must have a UPCR &lt; 1.0 to allow
             participation in the study

          -  Patients with or with anticipation of invasive procedures as defined below:

               -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28
                  days prior to the first date of bevacizumab therapy (cycle 2)

               -  Major surgical procedure anticipated during the course of the study; this
                  includes, but is not limited to abdominal surgery (laparotomy or laparoscopy)

          -  Patients with medical history or conditions not otherwise previously specified which
             in the opinion of the investigator should exclude participation in this study;
             examples of this would be: persistent gastrointestinal symptoms resulting from
             clostridia difficile enterocolitis or bowel surgery which may increase
             gastrointestinal toxicity from bevacizumab; or hearing loss or neuropathy which would
             prevent tolerance to cisplatin, and paclitaxel administration; the investigator should
             feel free to consult the Study Chair or Study Co-Chairs for uncertainty in this regard
             (12/20/10)

          -  Patients with metastatic tumor in the parenchyma of the liver or lungs with proximity

          <description>The Histology/Grade lists how many participants entered the study with each type of tumor histology and the grade for the serous tumors. Histology is the type of tissue that the tumor is comprised of. The histologic types listed below include serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous and other or not specified. Grading refers to (along with staging) describes the severity. Grade 1 tumor cells look a lot like normal ovarian cells. The outcome is good for grade I tumors. Grade 2 tumors are well differentiated. Grade 3 cells are more irregular and likely to metastasize.</description>

        <description>QOL was measured with the FACT-O TOI score. Means at baseline are raw means. Scores are reported at all time points in the outcome measure table. FACT-O TOI is Trial outcome index (TOI) of the Functional assessment of cancer therapy (FACT) for ovarian cancer (FACT-O). The FACT-O TOI is composed of three subscales; Physical Well Being (PWB) ( 7 items), and Ovarian Cancer subscale (OCS) (12 items). Each item in the FACT-O TOI are scored using a 5 point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit; 2=somewhat;3=quite a bit;4=very much). A subscale score is computed as long as more thatn 50% of subscale items have been answered. A total score of the FACT-O items provide valid responses and all three subscales have valid scores. A score of the FACT-) TOI is ranged 0-104 with a larger score indicating a more preferred state of health-related quality of life (HRQOL).</description>

        <title>Patient Reported Neurotoxicity (Ntx)</title>
        <description>The FACT/GOG-NTX subscale (short version) contains 4 items measuring sensory neuropathy. Each item is scored using a 5 point Likert scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit;2=somewhat;3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For each item, reversal was performed prior to score calculation so that a large score suggests less symptoms. According to the FACIT measurement system, the subscale score was calculated as the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of a subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the subscale. The Ntx subscale score ranges from 0-16 with a large subscale score suggesting less symptom or better QOL.</description>

          <title>Patient Reported Neurotoxicity (Ntx)</title>
          <description>The FACT/GOG-NTX subscale (short version) contains 4 items measuring sensory neuropathy. Each item is scored using a 5 point Likert scale (0=not at all; 1=a little bit;2=somewhat;3=quite a bit; 4=very much). For each item, reversal was performed prior to score calculation so that a large score suggests less symptoms. According to the FACIT measurement system, the subscale score was calculated as the summation of the individual item scores if more than 50% of a subscale items were answered. When unanswered items existed, a subscale score was prorated by multiplying the mean of the answered item scores by the number of items in the subscale. The Ntx subscale score ranges from 0-16 with a large subscale score suggesting less symptom or better QOL.</description>
