      RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer
      may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor samples in patients undergoing treatment for
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors on clinical trial ACOSOG-Z9001.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To examine polymorphisms in selected genes involved in the detoxifying/metabolizing and
           DNA repair pathways in relation to specific mutations and types of mutation in the c-kit
           gene in tumor tissue from patients with gastrointestinal tumors (GIST) undergoing
           treatment on clinical trial ACOSOG-Z9001.

      Secondary

        -  To examine approximately 758 polymorphisms among candidate genes involved in
           detoxification/metabolism, cell cycle control, and DNA damage/repair in relation to
           specific mutations and types of mutation in the c-kit gene in tumor tissue from GIST
           patients for hypothesis generation. (exploratory)

        -  To conduct an exploratory analysis of the polymorphism distribution in these patients.
           (exploratory)

        -  To examine the association between the above polymorphisms and major toxicity (Grade
           3/4) of adjuvant imatinib mesylate. (exploratory)

      OUTLINE: Tumor samples are used for polymorphism and mutation analysis.
