  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twin-Block treatment and Dynamax treatment for Class II division 1 malocclusion do not have
      different effects with regards to treatment duration, the quality of dento-occlusal outcome,
      skeletal and soft tissue profile, patient discomfort and gingival health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Dynamax appliance is a relatively new appliance for the treatment of Class II
      malocclusion and was introduced in 2003. The appliance has the theoretical advantages of
      incremental mandibular advancement without the need for bite registration, and the ability
      for the operator to simultaneously provide the functional and fixed appliance phases of
      treatment. Furthermore, the Dynamax appliance is designed to limit lower both lower incisor
      proclination and upper incisor retroclination without an increase in lower facial height.
      There has been limited research into this appliance and only one trial has been carried out.
      In this study the effects of the Dynamax were compared with the Twin-block, unfortunately,
      the trial was not carried out to contemporary standards and suffered from severe
      shortcomings. For example, the non compliance rate was not accounted for in the sample size
      calculation, the randomisation sequence was not clear, the investigators did not carry out an
      intention-to-treat analysis, the statistical analysis was simplistic and the study was
      carried out in a single dental school setting. This raises the question about the efficiency
      of the Dynamax appliance and whether or not they are effective in a 'real' world setting.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the Dynamax appliance and the
      Twin-block appliance for the treatment of Class II Division 1 malocclusion.
