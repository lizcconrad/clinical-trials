  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparison, at this VA Hospital, of standard operating room management in
      colorectal surgery to a more rigid management using an additional five previously tested
      treatments to determine if this changes the rate of post operative wound infections.

      A comparison between standard operating room:

        1. use of pre-op bowel prep (Golytely or Phosphosoda,plus 3 doses of oral
           antibiotics(Erythromycin and Neomycin), and fleets enema the day before surgery

        2. Standard anesthesia FiO2 (approx. 30-50%)during surgery

        3. Standard IV fluids during surgery(greater than 200cc per hour)

        4. Standard post-op O2 by mask for 2 hours

      To extended operating room procedures of:

        1. No po antibiotics or pre-op bowel prep other than enema prior to surgery

        2. Skin warming at least 15 minutes prior to and during surgery(core temp 36C+)

        3. IOBAN drapes and Plastic wound protectors used during surgery

        4. Restricted IV fluids less than 200cc per hour during surgery

        5. Increased FiO2 to 80% during surgery and 2 hours after by mask

      Monitoring for post-op wound infections at discharge and up to 30days post-op
