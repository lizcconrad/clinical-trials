  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to capture a large group of patients who undergo pulmonary
      rehabilitation and map their progression over a 5 year time-frame.

      The outcome measures have been chosen to capture physiological, functional capacity,
      free-living activities plus admission and exacerbation rates thereby enhancing our
      understanding of the potential effects exercise and self management techniques may have on
      the disease progression.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation has not been shown to reduce inflammation; therefore, unlike acute
      exacerbation's where a decrease in inflammation indicates recovery, the exact mechanisms
      responsible for improvement during pulmonary rehabilitation are as yet unknown.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation are well documented elsewhere, however, the exact
      mechanisms responsible for these significant improvements and alteration of the disease
      progression are unexplained. Also unexplained is the apparent lack of carry over of
      functional capacity into free-living activities as measured by activity monitors.

      There are no reported effects on decreasing level of inflammatory cytokines or C-reactive
      protein (CRP) post rehabilitation, however, a training response to reactive oxidative stress
      (ROS) after a moderate intensity pulmonary rehabilitation programme has been reported. As
      oxidative stress is a catalyst to inflammation, a training response to exercise induced ROS
      in patients with COPD may also have a secondary effect of modifying inflammation in the
      stable COPD patient thereby improving patient outcomes.

      No studies to-date have combined free-living activities, biomarkers and standard outcome
      measures in patient's pre and post pulmonary rehabilitation or follow-up patients over a five
      year period.

      Subjects referred to pulmonary rehabilitation who fulfil the GOLD criteria for COPD will be
      recruited on a rolling basis and randomly allocated to one of two groups. Group 1 (Control),
      Group 2 (Intervention).

      It is a multi-centred, randomised controlled trial using the above convenience sample of
      patients referred to pulmonary rehabilitation who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

    <description>Sixteen, two hourly pulmonary rehabilitation sessions over an eight week period. The first hour will consist of an individualized exercise programme based on exercise field tests. The second hour will consist of an educational component. A home exercise programme of inspiratory muscle training (Threshold(R)IMT (respiratory muscle trainer re:HS730EU-001 single patient use) starting between 15% -30% of PiMax and progress weekly to 60% for 30 mins a day/ 5 dats a week with an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 3:4. Patients will also be encouraged to walk or undertake an home exercise programme based on a Borg score of between 3 and 5 an additional 3 days a week.</description>
