      The purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of fatigue in patients with dystonia.
      There are many factors which may impact fatigue but perhaps the most important of these is
      sleep. It is therefore critical that we collect data on sleep habits and sleepiness to help
      interpret our data on fatigue. We will be using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to assess
      daytime somnolence and the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale to assess the presence or absence
      of common sleep disorders affecting patients with movement disorders along with the
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and the Fatigue Severity Scale.
