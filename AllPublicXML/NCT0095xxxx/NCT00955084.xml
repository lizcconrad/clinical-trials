      The primary objective of this study is to allow rollover of the two remaining subjects from
      the other XL999 studies to continue to receive XL999.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate tumor response after long term repeat administration of XL999 in two
           subjects rolled over from other XL999 studies.

        -  To characterize the long term safety and tolerability of XL999 after repeat
           administration in two subjects rolled over from other XL999 studies.

        -  To characterize the long term effects of XL999 on cardiac function after repeat
           administration in two subjects rolled over from other XL999 studies.
