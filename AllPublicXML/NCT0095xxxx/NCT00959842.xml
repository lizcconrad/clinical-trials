  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will build upon a previous finding that showed a triglyceride lowering effect of
      prescription omega-3 in combined therapy with statins. The proposed study will use a simple
      change from baseline design on 15 subjects who are hypertriglyceridemic on stable statin
      therapy. The protocol involves 3 study visits; each involve drawing a blood sample: day 1 -
      screening (blood draw for qualification and safety); day 7 - before taking prescription
      omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza, 4 capsules/d; GlaxoSmithKline), day 63 -after taking
      prescription omega-3 fatty acids (Lovaza, 4 capsules/d; GlaxoSmithKline). The proposed study
      will include up to 15 subjects and will utilize several different measures of lipoprotein
      structure and function. The investigators will measure functional parameters such as the
      binding affinity of lipoproteins before and after treatment with omega-3 fatty acids. The
      investigators will also measure fatty acid, oxylipin and apolipoprotein content of plasma,
      very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL).
