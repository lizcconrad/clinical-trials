  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LenSx 550 laser system is a femtosecond laser intended for use in performing anterior
      capsulotomy during cataract surgery. The anterior capsulotomy creates a circular opening in
      the anterior surface of the capsular bag that contains the cataractous crystalline lens. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of the LenSx 550 laser to successfully
      perform anterior capsulotomy during cataract surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be eligible to undergo cataract extraction by phacoemulsification with primary
             intraocular lens implantation in at least 1 eye.

          -  Must be at least 24 years of age.

          -  Must be willing and able to return for scheduled follow-up examinations.

          -  Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the written Informed Consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Corneal disease or pathology that precludes applanation of the cornea or transmission
             of laser wavelength or distortion of laser light.

          -  Subjects with a poorly dilating pupil or other defect of the pupil that prevents the
             iris from adequate retraction peripherally are excluded.

          -  Subjects with residual, recurrent, active ocular or eyelid disease, including any
             corneal abnormality (for example, recurrent corneal erosion, severe basement membrane
             disease) in either eye are excluded.

          -  History of steroid-responsive rise in intraocular pressure, glaucoma, or preoperative
             IOP&gt;21 mm Hg in either eye.

          -  Lens/zonular instability such as, but not restricted to, Marfan's Syndrome,
             Pseudoexfoliation Syndrome, etc.

          -  Previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind, including any type of surgery for
             either refractive or therapeutic purposes in either eye.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to be pregnant during the course of
             the study.

          -  Known sensitivity to planned study concomitant medications.

          -  Subjects participating in any other ophthalmic drug or device clinical trial during
             the time of this clinical investigation.

          -  Subjects presenting any contraindications to cataract surgery.
