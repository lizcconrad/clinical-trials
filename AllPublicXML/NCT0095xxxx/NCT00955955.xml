  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether oral 6(S)-5-MTHF (Deplin) is safe and effective
      in relieving depression when it is added to standard kinds of antidepressants called
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two phases, each lasting a total of four weeks (8 weeks total), with
      visits at the DCRP every 10 days. If the subject is eligible, they will be asked to return
      two weeks later for a baseline visit, when they will be randomly assigned, like a flip of a
      coin, to one of three treatment groups: a) drug/drug, b) placebo/drug, c) placebo/placebo (a
      placebo is a pill that looks like a study drug but contains no active medication). They will
      have a greater than 50% chance of receiving active medication (Deplin) at some point in the 8
      week study.

      Neither the subject nor the research staff will know which group the subject is in.

      All subjects will be asked to take the study medication in the morning, in addition to their
      ongoing SSRI treatment.

    <measure>The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D-17)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D-17 is a multiple choice questionnaire that clinicians may use to rate the severity of a patient's major depression. Items are scored on a scale of zero to four and higher scores indicate greater impairment. This scale is scored by summing the scores on each item and scores can range from 0-68.
When assessing changes in HAMD score, negative changes indicate improvement (i.e. the score has decreased) and positive scores indicate a worsening of symptoms (i.e. scores have increased).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a 16 item self report questionnaire assessing symptoms of depression. For each item, scores range from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating greater impairment. To score this measure:
Enter the highest score from questions 1-4 (sleep items): ______
Enter score on item 5 ____
Enter the highest score from questions 6-9 (appetite/weight): ______
Enter score on item 10 ____
Enter score on item 11 ____
Enter score on item 12 ____
Enter score on item 13 ____
Enter score on item 14 ____
Enter the highest score from questions 15-16 (psychomotor items): ______
Total score range 0-27: ______
When assessing changes in this measure over time, negative means indicate an improvement (i.e. the scores decreased over time) and positive means indicate worsening in functioning.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 15 mg/day of Deplin, a medical food, for 8 weeks.
The SPCD approach, is modified and conducted as follows:
The phase II dataset of interest is limited to patients treated with placebo during phase I who completed phase I, who did not experience a clinical response according to the HDRS-17 during phase I and entered phase II. Drug is compared to placebo in phase II for this patient subset alone.
The ITT/LOCF data comparing drug and placebo during phase I is combined with the data comparing drug and placebo according to the SPCD model for phase II (see steps 2 and 3 above), and analyzed using the statistical model as described in Fava et al, 2003</description>

        <title>The 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D-17)</title>
        <description>The HAM-D-17 is a multiple choice questionnaire that clinicians may use to rate the severity of a patient's major depression. Items are scored on a scale of zero to four and higher scores indicate greater impairment. This scale is scored by summing the scores on each item and scores can range from 0-68.
When assessing changes in HAMD score, negative changes indicate improvement (i.e. the score has decreased) and positive scores indicate a worsening of symptoms (i.e. scores have increased).</description>

        <population>The phase II dataset of interest is limited to patients treated with placebo in phase I, completed phase I, did not experience a clinical response and entered phase II. Drug is compared to placebo in phase II for this subset alone. Some patients received Deplin in both phases of the study, but those patients are not included in these analyses.</population>
