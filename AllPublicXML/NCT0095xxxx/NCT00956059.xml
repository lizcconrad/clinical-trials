    <textblock>
      Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) is characterized by heavy proteinuria and
      nephritic syndrome in clinic. The major pathological change is scarring of the glomerulus
      that is focal and segmental. The incidence of FSGS is increasing in recent years, but no
      unified protocol for FSGS treatment has been provided. Corticosteroid is the primary drug for
      FSGS treatment in clinic. However, corticosteroid treatment has a low response rate as 20% in
      clinic but some severe side-effects. The side-effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment
      urged researchers to find more reliable and secure methods for FSGS treatment. The new
      immunosuppressants shed light on FSGS treatment recently. The usage of immunosuppressants to
      FSGS treatment is in the preliminary stage and accounts for a few problems. The main problems
      include the uncertainty of curative effects, the lack of large-scale clinical trial, the
      side-effects of long-term application, and the high recurrence rate after withdraw. FSGS is
      immune-induced damage, which includes abnormality of many steps in humoral immunity and
      cellular immunity. According to it, we designed to inhibit the immune response at
      multi-targets with Prednisone Combined With MMF and FK506. Thus the dosage of these drugs can
      be decreased to a secure level for long-term treatment while the side-effects can be
      controlled well. Prednisone Combined With MMF and FK506 then can be used to FSGS treatment
      with effectiveness and security.
