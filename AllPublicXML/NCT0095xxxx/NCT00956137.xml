  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is the technique of choice in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty
      at Toronto Western Hospital (UHN). The most significant predictor of the ease of performance
      of spinal anesthesia is the quality of palpable surface landmarks (the spinous processes of
      the lumbar vertebrae). These surface landmarks may be absent, indistinct or distorted in many
      of the patients presenting for total joint arthroplasty. This is because of obesity, previous
      spinal surgery, scoliosis and degenerative changes of aging. The investigators have shown in
      a previous study that a pre-procedural ultrasound scan of the spine can reliably identify an
      appropriate site for needle insertion in spinal anesthesia, and that this results in a high
      success rate on the first needle insertion attempt (84% vs 61-64% in published studies). The
      investigators therefore believe that this ultrasound-assisted technique of spinal anesthesia
      is extremely useful, especially in patients with poor-quality surface landmarks. However
      there are no published randomized controlled trials to date that compare the efficacy of the
      ultrasound-assisted technique with the traditional surface landmark-guided technique of
      spinal anesthesia.
