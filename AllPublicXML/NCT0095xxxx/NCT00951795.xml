  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study designed to assess the accuracy of Pima™ CD4 Test to enumerate
      CD4+ T-cells in whole blood over the measurement range expected for the intended population.
      The Pima CD4 Test consists of the Pima™ CD4 cartridge and Pima™ Analyzer to identify and
      determine the absolute counts of mature helper (CD3+/CD4+) T-lymphocytes in whole blood.

      Blood samples will be collected from HIV infected adolescents and adult men and women
      presenting to a physician's office or outpatient clinic. Capillary whole blood samples will
      be obtained by fingerstick in duplicate from all Subjects in the study for immediate
      measurement of CD4+ T-cell count on the Pima CD4 Test by a trained healthcare professional.
      Venous whole blood samples from all Subjects in the study will also be collected and
      transported to the clinical laboratory of each study site for concurrent testing on the
      reference method by a trained laboratory professional. Venous samples from all Subjects in
      the study will also be measured on the Pima CD4 Test at the study site. Hematocrit will also
      be measured for all Subjects.
