    <textblock>
      Blood clotting abnormalities or problems that happen during surgery ? even minor surgery ?
      are serious because of the possibility of serious bleeding that cannot be stopped. The
      current standard practice for people with clotting abnormalities is to transfuse additional
      blood before the surgery, in an effort to decrease bleeding problems. However, transfusing
      blood before the surgery is not very effective in decreasing bleeding complications. In
      addition, it may be associated with other complications, including fluid buildup and swelling
      in the lungs. For this study, a person with a mild clotting problem is defined as one with an
      INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.5 and 3. Severe clotting is defined as an INR
      greater than 3. This study will aim to test if limiting or restricting transfusion for those
      patients with severe clotting problems (an INR greater than 3) will result in fewer
      transfusion problems and fewer unnecessary transfusions in comparison with the current, more
      liberal, transfusion use for all patients with both mild and severe clotting problems (an INR
      greater than 1.5).The investigators will also determine if liberal blood transfusion
      decreases the risk of bleeding after surgical procedures.

      While the restrictive red cell transfusion practice has become a standard of care in the
      acutely ill, data on the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are limited. FFP transfusion may
      not only be poorly effective in prevention of bleeding complications but is associated with
      significant complications. In a retrospective cohort of critically ill non-surgical patients
      with abnormal international normalized ratio (INR), we have observed significant variability
      in the practice of FFP transfusion. Rather than a benefit with liberal use, more adverse
      effects were observed, in particular pulmonary edema and acute lung injury. Our overall goal
      is to improve the safety of blood product transfusion and prevent pulmonary complications.
      Here we propose a randomized clinical trial of restrictive (INR 1.6-3) versus liberal (FFP
      transfusion to keep INR &lt; 1.6) FFP transfusion prior to commonly performed invasive
      procedures (thoracocentesis, abdominal paracentesis and central venous cannulation). We will
      use the following outcome measures to compare the differences between the two groups: 1. New
      onset pulmonary edema; 2. Postprocedural bleeding complications; 3. Number of blood product
      transfusions; 4. Hospital mortality and 5. Length of intensive care unit and hospital stay.
      The results of this study will form the basis for future multicenter clinical trials with
      implications for worldwide transfusion practice.
