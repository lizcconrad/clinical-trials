      Overall Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an interventional walking program on the
      quality of life and functional status of patients with Lumbar Spinal Stenosis, post-surgery,
      using subjective (VAS, ODI, RMDQ, SF-36), and objective measures (triaxial accelerometry,
      step count, weight).

      Design and Methods: Two groups of subjects will be examined; patients diagnosed with lumbar
      spinal stenosis (LSS) that progress to surgical management, with one group of subjects
      staring on the walking program at 2 months postop, and the other group starting on the
      walking program at 3 months postop.

      Subjects who agree to participate will be assessed (assessments listed below) after the
      diagnosis preoperatively and 2 months postoperatively. One half of the group will start the
      walking program at the 2 months postop visit and be assessed again at the end of the walking
      program, the other half will be assessed again at 3 months postop and start the walking
      program at that time and be assessed again at 4 months postop. All subjects will be contacted
      by phone during their walking program to allow for questions from the subjects and to offer
      support and encouragement. Subjects will be given instructions and a daily diary to track
      steps taken each day (appendix A).

      Subjects will be recruited from the referrals to the practices of the Orthopedic and
      Neurosurgery Spine Surgeons at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg. This encompasses the
      majority of new and currently managed cases in the Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario.

      Subjects will be between the ages of 18 and 90. Male and female subjects will be recruited
      into the study. All LSS patients will demonstrate intractable neurogenic claudication and
      radiographically confirmed lumbar spinal stenosis. Exclusion criteria will be any previous
      lumbar spine surgery, the existence of significant co-morbidity (e.g. neurologic or cardiac
      condition, disease, etc.) of any form, and any other physical limitations (musculoskeletal
      injury) preventing the subject from participating in regular activity and the walking
      program. Subjects participating will be required to speak English.
