      Study Design. Primary care providers will be sent a providers packet to include a cover
      letter explaining the survey and its purpose as well as a 2-part questionnaire that includes
      nine selected short patient vignettes and a questionnaire regarding their personal and
      practice characteristics.

      Study Population. Individuals who receive the survey will be the primary care provider
      identified by study participants enrolled in our ongoing study entitled, &quot;Asthma in the Delta
      Region of Arkansas: Characterization of Disease and Impact of Environmental Factors&quot;
      (ARIA#53054). We will send the survey to all identified practitioners in Lee, Phillips,

      care providers from other Arkansas Delta counties pending funding.

      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. We will send the survey to all identified practitioners in Lee,
      Phillips, Desha, Chicot, St. Francis, and surrounding counties. Future studies will include
