  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase II non-randomised controlled clinical study. Dose escalation
      will be implemented using 1.8 Gy increments from baseline 75.6 Gy. Patients' RT prescription
      may be escalated up to max 81 Gy once dose volume constraints are adhered to.

      All patients will be treated using the participating institution's standard rectal
      preparation protocol, bladder-filling protocol and appropriate immobilisation device(s).

      Cone beam CT on-treatment imaging is recommended for this study. However, the use of
      individual institutional imaging equipment and techniques is permitted.

      Acute GU/GI toxicities will be assessed weekly during treatment.

      GU/GI toxicities will also be assessed 2 months post RT, 8 months post RT and 6 monthly
      thereafter to year nine and in line with the participating institution's standard routine
      follow-up (FU) thereafter.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine if dose escalated IMRT for high risk localised prostate cancer can provide PSA
      relapse free survival similar to that reported by Memorial Sloan Kettering (Alicikus et al
      2011

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Overall survival and disease-free survival rates.

        -  To evaluate the significance of published prognostic/ stratification factors such as the
           UCSF-CAPRA score and assess their application to the data from this study.

        -  To achieve the maximum dose escalation (up to 81Gy). This will be assessed as the
           percentage of patients that receive each dose level for all categories (dose increments
           of 1.8 Gy from 75.6 Gy up to max 81 Gy).

        -  The incidence and severity of acute and late GU and GI toxicities will be described, and
           correlated with DVH parameters

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing a radical course of RT for high-risk disease (defined according to
             the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Practice Guidelines in Oncology v.1 as one
             or more of the NCCN high risk criteria &gt; or equal to T3, &gt; or equal to Gleason 8, PSA
             &gt; 20ng/ml)

          2. Only patients requiring neo-adjuvant / adjuvant hormonal therapy will be included in
             this study

             FBC, screening profile including liver function tests, PSA and bone scan

          4. All patients must have an MRI/CT of the prostate and pelvis to investigate the nodal
             status and precise T-stage. This MRI/CT scan must be performed prior to commencement
             of hormonal therapy. Suspicious nodes need to be histologically proven to be benign
             before the patient can be included in the study). M0 on staging.

          5. No previous surgery for urinary conditions except TURP or TRUS

          8. Provision of written informed consent in line with ICH-GCP guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous RT to the pelvic region

          2. The patient has nodal involvement or it is decided to electively treat pelvic lymph
             nodes

          3. The patient has had a bilateral orchidectomy

             research/ medical team that the patient may not be able to comply with the protocol

          7. Patients who have had a prostatectomy

          8. The presence of hip prostheses
