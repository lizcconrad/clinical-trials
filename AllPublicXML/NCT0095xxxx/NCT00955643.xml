      Evaluation of the clinical effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) adjunctively to scaling
      and root planing (SRP) in the treatment of severe case of chronic periodontitis.

      Materials and Methods: In 20 patients diagnosed with severe generalized chronic periodontitis
      (pockets&gt;7mm) with bleeding on probing, SRP was rendered in all pockets. Additionally, five
      consecutive hyperbaric sessions were administered in 10 patients after random allocation
      (SRP+HBOT). Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline up to 6 months: plaque index (PI),
      bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical attachment level and BANA test.

      Results: SRP+HBOT resulted in greater probing reduction and attachment gain than SRP alone 3
      months after treatment (p&lt;0.001). The BANA test was negative after 1 week only for sites in
      the SRP+HBOT group (p&lt;0.05). However SRP+HBOT failed to show a significant difference from
      SRP group after 3 months were all BANA sites became negative (p&gt;0.05).

      Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy had a short-term
      beneficial effect on pocket reduction and bacterial elimination, and may be considered a
      potential therapy option to improve the clinical outcomes of scaling in severe cases of
      chronic periodontitis.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  This preliminary (pilot) study was designed with twenty subjects (12 men, 8 women,
             mean age 37.3 years) selected from a pool of 360 patients referred to the Periodontal
             Clinic of the School of Dentistry at Bahian Science Foundation (FBDC, Bahia, Brazil).

          -  The patients had an initial diagnosis of severe generalized chronic periodontitis (AAP
             1999).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded according to the following criteria:

               -  smoking

               -  pregnancy or lactation

               -  antibiotics or periodontal treatment within the last 6 months

               -  a diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis

               -  trauma from occlusion or endodontic lesions

          -  According to an accurate clinical examination performed by a hyperbaric medical doctor
             (MD), the HBOT contra-indications (Iazzeti &amp; Mantovani 1998) served as exclusion
             criteria.

          -  The only absolute contraindication to hyperbaric oxygen therapy was from patients with
             untreated pneumothorax

          -  Relative contraindications were considered:

               -  upper respiratory infections

               -  high fevers

               -  emphysema with CO2 retention

               -  historic of thoracic surgery

               -  malignant disease and middle ear barotrauma

          -  Patients taking or have recently taken the following drugs:

               -  doxorubicin (Adriamycin®)

               -  disulfiram (Antabuse®)

               -  Cis-platinum and mafenide acetate (Sulfamylon®).
