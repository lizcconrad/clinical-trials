      Phase 1: An observational study (registry) will be conducted which will objectively document
      the ACS clinical practice in Brazilian public hospitals, and identify the important barriers
      for the evidence usage incorporation in the clinical practice.

      Phase 2: A Cluster randomized clinical trial in which public hospital will be randomized to
      receive or not a multifaceted strategy in order to increase evidence based therapy in
      clinical practice.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Patients with thoracic pain who the emergency department physician suspects of ACS and plans
      start a treatment for this issue; It will be excluded patients transferred of others
      institutions with 12 hours of symptoms.

      PROGRAM:

      There are multifaceted Interventions Including

        1. Distribution of educational materials

        2. Case manager: Use of a trained person who works in the hospital and will be responsible
           to assure that all interventions were used

        3. Reminders: specific information that is designed or intended to prompt a health
           professional to recall information (patient bracelets, labels, posters, pocket cards,
           checklists).

        4. Practical training

      ENDPOINTS:

      Phase 1 Primary outcome; patient who've received interventions based on evidence proportion
      informed by the indicators; Phase 2

      Primary outcome:

      Increase of prescription of evidence based treatment in clinical practice Secondary outcome
      Total mortality and major cardiovascular events
