    <textblock>
      This study will estimate the radiochemical and radiation safety and assess the efficacy of
      [18F]MK-3328, a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer. The study safety hypotheses
      will test whether [18F]MK-3328 is sufficiently safe and well-tolerated, based on an
      assessment of clinical and laboratory evaluations and adverse experiences in healthy
      participants, including healthy elderly (HE) participants, and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      participants, to permit continued investigation. The study efficacy hypothesis will test
      whether [18F]MK-3328 can discriminate between AD participants and cognitively normal elderly
      control participants based on tracer volume of distribution, or one of its surrogates, in
      brain posterior cingulate gyrus.

    <measure>Effective Dose of [18F]MK-3328</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 6 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Using PET whole body images acquired after dosing, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in all organs showing visible [18F]MK-3328 accumulation. Time activity curves (TACs) showing total [18F]MK-3328 retention as a function of time were determined for each organ. Residence times were calculated from the area under each organ TAC. Radiation exposure of the body and critical organs was calculated from the [18F]MK-3328 residence times using OLINDA (Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment) software. For each organ, the equivalent dose, which is the absorbed radiation dose weighted for the degree of the biological effect of different types of radiation, was calculated. The total radiation exposure to the body is expressed as the effective dose, which is the sum of the equivalent doses in each organ multiplied by a weighting factor for the type of tissue exposed. Effective dose is the primary surrogate for radiation risk. The unit of effective dose is the Sievert (Sv).</description>

    <measure>Mean Brain Cortical [18F]MK-3328 Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in AD Participants and HE Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>60-90 minutes post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Using PET brain images acquired after dosing, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in identified brain areas. The ROIs were projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [18F]MK-3328 tissue TACs. SUVR is calculated as the ratio of the average [18F]MK-3328 uptake over 60-90 minutes post dose in the target brain region and the cerebellum. Cortical SUVR is reported, which is a mean SUVR derived from SUVR from multiple brain regions (frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex, lateral temporal cortex and occipital cortices).</description>

        <title>Effective Dose of [18F]MK-3328</title>
        <description>Using PET whole body images acquired after dosing, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in all organs showing visible [18F]MK-3328 accumulation. Time activity curves (TACs) showing total [18F]MK-3328 retention as a function of time were determined for each organ. Residence times were calculated from the area under each organ TAC. Radiation exposure of the body and critical organs was calculated from the [18F]MK-3328 residence times using OLINDA (Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment) software. For each organ, the equivalent dose, which is the absorbed radiation dose weighted for the degree of the biological effect of different types of radiation, was calculated. The total radiation exposure to the body is expressed as the effective dose, which is the sum of the equivalent doses in each organ multiplied by a weighting factor for the type of tissue exposed. Effective dose is the primary surrogate for radiation risk. The unit of effective dose is the Sievert (Sv).</description>

        <title>Mean Brain Cortical [18F]MK-3328 Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in AD Participants and HE Participants</title>
        <description>Using PET brain images acquired after dosing, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in identified brain areas. The ROIs were projected onto all frames of the dynamic PET scans in order to generate [18F]MK-3328 tissue TACs. SUVR is calculated as the ratio of the average [18F]MK-3328 uptake over 60-90 minutes post dose in the target brain region and the cerebellum. Cortical SUVR is reported, which is a mean SUVR derived from SUVR from multiple brain regions (frontal cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex, lateral temporal cortex and occipital cortices).</description>
