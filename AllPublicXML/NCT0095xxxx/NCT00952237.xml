  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We postulate that the combination of IL-2 and GM-CSF immunotherapy will efficiently mobilize
      autologous peripheral blood stem cells and activated immune effector cells in patients with a
      hematologic malignancy. These activated effector cells will improve the immune function of
      the graft. These hypotheses will be tested using this proposed clinical trial to mobilize
      autologous peripheral blood stem cells pre-transplantation.

    <description>GM-CSF (Recombinant Human Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor) The dose and duration of GM-CSF (7.5 mcg/kg/day) was selected. If used alone, this dose and duration would result in effective mobilization. GM-CSF will be started on Day #7 and will continue until completion of leukapheresis.
G-CSF will be started (5mcg/kg/d) on Day #7 and will be given each morning. G-CSF will continue until completion of leukapheresis.</description>

    <description>IL-2 dose escalation: IL-2 will be administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection each evening until completion of leukapheresis.
Escalation of the dose of IL-2 will be performed using the below schema with the following levels. Patients will be started on Level 1. (Level 0 is included since, if toxicity is meet in Level 1, the dose will be decreased to Level 0).
Level 0 - 3 x 105 i.u./m2/day for 11 days Level 1 - 6 x 105 i.u./m2/day for 11 days Level 2 - 1 x 106 i.u. /m2/day for 11 days as above Level 3 - 1.5 x 106 i.u. /m2/day for 11 days as above Level 4 - 2 x 106 i.u. /m2/day for 11 days as above</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have pathologic diagnosis of one of the following malignancies:
             Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Hodgkin's Disease, Multiple Myeloma or other plasma cell
             dyscrasia (Waldenstrom, Amyloidosis), Leukemia (AML, ALL, CLL)

          -  Prior Treatment: &gt; 2 weeks prior to initiation of therapy.

          -  Performance Status: Karnofsky &gt; 70%

          -  Age &gt;18

          -  Life Expectancy &gt; 4 months

          -  Bone Marrow: bone marrow biopsy and aspirate

          -  Blood counts: The patient must have adequate bone marrow function, i.e. a total WBC of
             &gt; 2,000/ul, a Hgb of &gt; 7 mg/dl, and a platelet count of &gt; 50,000/ul, unless this
             abnormality is believed to be due to the underlying disease.

          -  Pulmonary function tests: DLCO &gt; 55% predicted.

          -  Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction of &gt; 40% by radionuclide scan or
             echocardiography.

          -  Liver function tests (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and SGOT/SGPT) &lt; 3 x normal
             (unless believed to be elevated due to disease).

          -  No significant co-morbid medical or psychiatric illness that would significantly
             compromise the patient's clinical care and chances of survival.

          -  Informed Consent: Informed consent must be signed prior to the treatment. Patients
             must be aware of the neoplastic nature of their disease and willingly consent after
             being informed of the procedure to be followed, the nature of the therapy,
             alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks and discomforts. The patient is
             not deemed eligible if there is any other serious medical or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent informed consent. (Human protection committee approval of this protocol
             and a consent form is required.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical, social, or psychological factors which would prevent the patient from
             receiving or cooperating with the full course of therapy.

          -  Evidence on physical exam, LP, CT, or MRI scans of CNS involvement with malignancy.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including recent (&lt; 6 months)
             myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, angina (symptomatic despite optimal
             medical management), life-threatening arrhythmia, or hypertension or clinically
             significant obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease.

          -  Serology positive for HIV

          -  History of seizures.

          -  Concurrent or expected need for therapy with systemic corticosteroids (since systemic
             steroids may suppress the effects of IL-2).

          -  Current and clinically significant pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites.

          -  Positive pregnancy test or presence of lactation.

          -  Uncontrolled active infection.

          -  Documented hypersensitivity to any of the drugs used in the protocol.

          -  No concomitant, ongoing malignancy that is life-threatening, based on PI's evaluation
