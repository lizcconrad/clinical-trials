    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located
      in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical
      efficacy has been shown in adult with head and neck cancer. The phase I study assessed the
      safety, and efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with
      chemo-radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer tumours.
