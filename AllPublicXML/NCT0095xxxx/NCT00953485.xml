  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore safety and efficacy of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells
      transplantation (MSCT) to treat patients with diagnosis of primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS)
      who have been resistant to multiple standard treatments. The underlying hypothesis is that
      the pSS condition is caused by an abnormal immune homeostasis that can be restored by MSCT.

      -  To test a new approach using allogeneic derived mesenchymal stem cell based therapy
           (MSCT) to treat refractory primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS)

        -  To determine the disease-free survival in pSS patients treated with MSCT in terms of
           disease activity index, pSS serology and salivary gland function

        -  To assess adverse events of allogeneic MSC transplantation

        -  To assess the association of disease activity index, pSS serology levels, and saliva
           flow rate at baseline with disease-free survival

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients fulfilled the international classification criteria (2002) for primary
             Sjögren's Syndrome, man or woman aged from 15 to 70 years old, Sjögren's Syndrome
             Disease Activity Index (SSDAI)≥8.

          -  Stimulated whole saliva flow rate less than 1~6ml/6min.

          -  Patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and give written
             informed consent in accordance with the institutional and hospital guidelines.

          -  Women of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an
             effective contraceptive method while on this trial and for 12 months following
             treatment. Women of child-bearing potential must have a pregnancy test performed
             within 72 hours prior to initiation of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  End-stage renal failure.

          -  Severe cardiopulmonary compromise, or other system failure.

          -  Active, uncontrolled infections.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate due to the possibility of fetal harm or
             harm to nursing infants from this treatment regimen.
