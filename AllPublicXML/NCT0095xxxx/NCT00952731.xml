  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying 4-hydroxytamoxifen to see how well it works
      compared with tamoxifen citrate in treating women with newly diagnosed ductal breast
      carcinoma in situ. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy
      using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.
      It is not yet known whether topical tamoxifen causes less damage to normal tissue than
      systemic tamoxifen in treating patients with ductal carcinoma in situ.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled presurgical trial of 0.228%
      4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) gel vs. oral tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg daily. The study population
      will consist of 112 pre- and postmenopausal women with any grade DCIS, ER positive,
      non-palpable DCIS with no evidence of invasion found on diagnostic core needle biopsy (DCNB).
      In order to accrue a total of 112 participants with DCIS over a period of 22 months, 20
      eligible participants total will be screened at the three participating institutions per
      month with a planned average monthly recruitment of 5 participants total per month. We assume
      that 22 women (20% of the recruited population, 11 women per arm) will be inevaluable because
      of the presence of unanticipated invasive disease in the therapeutic surgical excisional
      (TSE) specimen, or the absence of residual DCIS in the TSE, so that a total of 90 women (45
      per arm) will be evaluable for the study endpoints. These estimates are based on numbers from
      the Lynn Sage Database of NU: over the six-year period 2000-2005, the fraction of women
      diagnosed with DCIS on core needle biopsy who were found to have no residual DCIS in the TSE
      was 2.5% and that of women with invasive disease (T1a or greater) in the TSE when the DCNB
      showed pure DCIS was 13.3%, very similar to the data reported by Bonnett et. al. [56] who
      found that 13% of pure DCIS lesions seen on DCNB (29/122) were in fact invasive in the TSE.
      With regard to racial/ethnic groups, 25.6% of the DCIS population at NU were of non-European
      ancestry (18% African, 4% Hispanic, 3.5% other). WU has higher fractions of African American
      women with DCIS (24% and 21% respectively).

      The participants will be consented following diagnostic core needle biopsy at the time of
      initial surgical consultation. Baseline assessments include medical history, nipple aspirate
      fluid (NAF) collection, explanation of gel application, BESS questionnaire (symptom
      assessment) and blood draw for clinical and research labs including plasma estradiol,
      progesterone and FSH (rushed), CBC, chemistry profile, liver and renal function tests, Factor
      VIII, von Willebrand Factor, Factor IX, and total protein S, plasma for insulin-like growth
      factor (IGF-1) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and DNA extraction for assessment of
      polymorphisms in tamoxifen metabolism genes. At Northwestern plasma and RNA from blood will
      be collected pre- and post-treatment and will be stored for future proteomic and gene
      expression fingerprinting

      No run-in period is planned. The intervention phase will begin within 5 days following
      randomization and end on the day prior to surgical resection. The 4-OHT group will apply
      active gel 2 mg daily to each breast for 4-10 weeks and take oral placebo. The TAM group will
      take 20 mg TAM orally daily and apply gel placebo. The last dose of study medication will be
      used on the morning of the day prior to surgery.

      Participants will be shipped two 100 ml canisters of 4-OHT or placebo gel plus 130 capsules
      of tamoxifen or oral placebo at the time of randomization. Participants will take study
      agents for 4-10 week (minimum). However, if surgery needs to be delayed beyond the 8 week
      study period for clinical reasons (eg scheduling with plastic surgery) the participant will
      be sent additional medication by mail to allow continuation of therapy until the day before
      surgery up to a maximum duration of 10 weeks.

      On the day prior to surgery, baseline assessments will be repeated (with the exception of
      menopausal determination and tamoxifen metabolism gene polymorphisms, but with the addition
      of blood draw for tamoxifen metabolites and E and Z 4-OHT isomer determination). Under
      unavoidable circumstances, the end of intervention visit will be allowed on the day of
      surgery prior to TSE. During the TSE breast adipose tissue from the surgical sample will be
      snap frozen and stored at -800C for measurement of TAM metabolites. The paraffin block of the
      DCNB and TSE samples will be acquired by the recruiting institution and 10 sections from each
      specimen submitted to the NU Pathology Core Facility (NU PCF). The sections will be cut in
      batches (with pre- and post-samples in the same batch), shipped cold, and processed for
      immunohistochemistry within a week of sectioning.

      Compliance assessment will occur through patient diaries, pill counts and the weighing of
      returned drug (gel) canisters.

      Patients will be assessed for adverse events at the post-surgical visit (approximately 7-14
      days after surgery) and by phone at 30 days following the last dose of study agent.

    <description>Hot flashes were assessed by the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) questionnaire. This questionnaire measures the incidence of a number of symptoms by asking participants how frequently they experienced them on a scale of 0-4 (0 being Not at All and 4 being Extremely often). BESS questionnaire was administered at baseline and time of surgery. The incidence of vasomotor symptoms (including hot flashes, night sweats, and cold sweats) was measured at baseline (Day 0) and end of treatment prior to surgery (at least 4 weeks later or up to 10 weeks, depending on scheduled surgery date), and changes in the mean score for hot flashes were observed.</description>

             are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials, if
             applicable.

          3. ECOG performance status ≥1 (Karnofsky ≥70%)

          4. Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               1. Leukocytes≥3,000/uL

               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)≥1,500/uL

               3. Platelets≥100,000/uL

             performed throughout the duration of the study and for three months after cessation of
             study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          7. Ability and willingness to schedule surgical resection of DCIS lesion for 4-10 weeks
             (28-70 days) following the start of study agent.

          8. Willingness to avoid exposing breast skin to natural or artificial sunlight (i.e.
             tanning beds) for the 4-10 weeks of study agent dosing.

          1. Prior history of, or at high risk to develop, thromboembolic disease will be excluded.

          2. Must not have taken exogenous sex hormones since biopsy diagnosing DCIS and must agree
             not to use exogenous sex hormones while on study.

          3. Must not have taken tamoxifen or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
             within 2 years prior to entering the study. Women who have discontinued SERM therapy
             because of thromboembolic or uterine toxicity, will be excluded regardless of duration
             of use.

          4. May not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          5. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to 4-hydroxytamoxifen or tamoxifen.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because tamoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen

          8. Women must not have breastfed within three months prior to DCNB. Women who are breast
             feeding are excluded from entry into this trial because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with tamoxifen or 4-hydroxytamoxifen. Women must agree to forego breastfeeding
             for three months following the use of study agent.

          9. Must not have any dermatologic conditions resulting in skin breakdown in the area of
             gel application.

         10. Must not have a history of previous ipsilateral radiation to the affected breast.

         11. Must not have had a breast reduction or augmentation within the 6 months prior to
             first dose of study agents. Patients who have had breast implants more than 6 months
             prior to first dose of study agents will be eligible.

          <population>18 total subjects were evaluable for immunohistochemistry marker testing including the Ki-67 labeling index. Of the 26 participants who completed study treatment 2 did not have matching samples available for testing and 6 were excluded because of insufficient DCIS lesion in their samples for testing.</population>

        <description>Hot flashes were assessed by the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Eight Symptom Scale (BESS) questionnaire. This questionnaire measures the incidence of a number of symptoms by asking participants how frequently they experienced them on a scale of 0-4 (0 being Not at All and 4 being Extremely often). BESS questionnaire was administered at baseline and time of surgery. The incidence of vasomotor symptoms (including hot flashes, night sweats, and cold sweats) was measured at baseline (Day 0) and end of treatment prior to surgery (at least 4 weeks later or up to 10 weeks, depending on scheduled surgery date), and changes in the mean score for hot flashes were observed.</description>
