  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the long-term health and mental health status of women Vietnam
      veterans. For many of these women, the effects of this war are still present in their daily
      lives. As these women approach their mid-sixties, it is important to understand the impact of
      wartime deployment on health and mental health outcomes nearly 40 years later. The
      investigators propose to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
      other mental and physical health conditions for women Vietnam veterans, and to explore the
      relationship between PTSD and other conditions and the Vietnam deployment experience. The
      investigators are interested in studying women Vietnam veterans who may have had direct
      exposure to traumatic events. For the first time, the investigators also want to study those
      who served in facilities near Vietnam. These women may have had similar, but less direct
      exposures. This cross-sectional study will seek to contact approximately 10,000 women for
      participation in a mailed survey, telephone interview and a review of their medical records.
      Women identified as serving in Vietnam, near Vietnam (in Asia during the Vietnam Ware) and in
      the U.S. during the Vietnam War will be identified from an established cohort and sent a
      survey on demographics, behaviors, disability, health-related quality of life, and medical
      conditions. Women agreeing to be contacted will also be interviewed by study investigators
      using the modified CIDI to ascertain current and lifetime mental health conditions (including
      PTSD) and exposure to traumatic events. A more extensive chart review will be conducted by a
      clinician to validate self-report of key medical conditions.

    <description>For this study we will use a cohort of women who are on a roster of Vietnam Era women veterans (4,644 Vietnam, 1,213 near Vietnam, 5,465 non-Vietnam) previously identified and characterized by a review of their military personnel records and link it to a list of 8,061 women who presumably served in Southeast Asia. This final cohort could potentially contain approximately 14,000 women. After deceased individuals are removed from the active cohort and contact information is updated, we estimate that there could be approximately 10,000 women to whom the informed consent and mailed survey will be initially mailed.</description>
