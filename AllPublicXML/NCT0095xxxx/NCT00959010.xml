  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential fatty acids (EFA) deficiency has been often reported in patients with cystic
      fibrosis (CF), particularly in those homozygous for the DF508 mutation. Clinical symptoms of
      CF may be influenced by correcting EFA deficiency. Nevertheless, the value of EFA
      supplementation in CF remains controversial. Within this multicentric and international
      randomized placebo-controlled trial it will be evaluated, according to recommendations of
      Cochrane analysis, beneficial effects of an oral supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty
      acids on selected biochemical and functional outcome parameters such as inflammatory
      biomarkers, incorporation into cell membrane phospholipids, lung function, exercise
      tolerance, clinical and nutritional status and properties of transepithelial ion transport.
      The study will be undertaken in a cohort of CF patients aged over 6 years old (60 patients),
      homozygous for the DF508 mutation and treated by Azithromycine. Supplementation will be
      performed with a triglyceride source at a daily dose of 60 mg/kg of omega-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (Omega 3 Premiumâ, Laboratoires Ponroy, France). Before enrolled into the trial
      and during the study, patients will undergo nutritional assessment by evaluation of total and
      fat dietary intake and overall calorie intake using a 3-days diet records and a food
      frequency questionnaire. Plasma and erythrocyte membrane EFA profiles and inflammatory
      markers will be monitored in baseline conditions, at 3, at 6 and 12 months after starting the
      treatment. Lung function will be performed at each patient visit and an exercise test will be
      done before and at the end of the treatment. Properties of ion transport will be searched by
      sweat testing before and at the end of the treatment.
