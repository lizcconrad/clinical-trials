      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bio-K+ CL-1285 in the
      prevention of Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea (AAD) and Clostridum difficile-Associated
      Diarrhea (CDAD) in hospitalized patients exposed to nosocomial infection.

    <measure>To Assess if Probiotic Prophylaxis (BIO-K+CL1285®) is Effective for the Prevention of AAD in Hospitalized Patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of AAD data were collected using questionnaire and diaries given to participants upon discharge. Diagnosis of AAD was made when a patient produced three or more liquid stools in a 24h period after antibiotic treatment with no other obvious reason for diarrhea.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of AAD in Hospitalized Patients Ingesting BIO-K+CL1285® or Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of diarrhea was determined by number of continuous days of diarrhea. Average number of liquid stools per day was determined by the sum of the number of liquid stools per day in the AAD episode divided by the duration of diarrhea in days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Stool Samples Positive for Clostridium Difficile (C. Difficile) Toxin A and/or B.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 40 days</time_frame>
    <description>If diarrhea occured while hospitalized, patients provided a stool sample for C. difficile analysis of Toxin A and/or B. All episodes were recorded by a nurse of clinician on a case report form using the seven-item Bristol Stool Form Scale (Riegler et al., 2001). A diarrhea episode was described as a bowel movement consisting of watery stool with or without solids.</description>

Diagnosis of AAD was made when a patient produced three or more liquid stools in a 24h period after antibiotic treatment with no other obvious reason for diarrhea.</description>

            <groups_desc>The sample size calculation was based on the incidence of AAD. A total of 255 patients was enrolled in order to obtain at least the required 225 evaluable patients.With expected AAD rates of at most 15% - 25% in the treatment groups; and 25% - 35% in the placebo group, these numbers were sufficient to detect the difference in the incidence of AAD between either of the treatment groups vs. placebo with a minimum of 86% statistical power.</groups_desc>

        <description>If diarrhea occured while hospitalized, patients provided a stool sample for C. difficile analysis of Toxin A and/or B. All episodes were recorded by a nurse of clinician on a case report form using the seven-item Bristol Stool Form Scale (Riegler et al., 2001). A diarrhea episode was described as a bowel movement consisting of watery stool with or without solids.</description>
