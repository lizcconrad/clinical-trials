    <textblock>
      The subjects are being asked to take part in the Phase I or Phase II portion of a research
      study of a new investigational drug, LBH589, in combination with chemotherapeutic agents,
      carboplatin with etoposide. LBH589 (made by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) is considered
      &quot;investigational&quot; because it has not been approved for commercial use in the treatment of
      cancer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Etoposide and carboplatin are
      chemotherapeutic agents approved by the FDA for the treatment of for small cell lung cancer.

      LBH589 is a drug that may slow down the growth of cancer cells or kill cancer cells by
      blocking certain enzymes (proteins produced by cells). LBH589 has shown effects against
      cancer in laboratory studies and in studies using animals; however, it is not known if this
      medicine will show the same activity in humans. As of May 2006, approximately 100 patients
      have received treatment with either an intravenous or capsule form of LBH589. Only the
      capsule form of LBH589 will be used in this study.

      The main goal during the Phase I portion of this research study is to find out the highest
      and safest dose of LBH589 that can be given in combination with carboplatin with etoposide in
      subjects with lung cancer without causing severe side effects. The main goal of the Phase II
      portion of this study is to find how the subject's lung cancer responds to the LBH589 in
      combination with carboplatin and etoposide at the highest and safest dose that was given in
      Phase I.

      The subject may be enrolled in either Phase I or Phase II of the trial, depending on when
      they entered the study, but they will not be enrolled in both phases.

      This study will also investigate how the subject's body processes the combination of LBH589
      and carboplatin with etoposide. To determine this, the investigators will measure the amount
      of study drug in the subject's blood. This will be done with a series of blood tests, called
      pharmacokinetic (PK) tests. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how the study drug moves through
      the body. Other purposes of this study will be to sample the subject's genetic material
      (DNA/RNA) as well as to determine biomarkers in their blood. (For some cancers, biomarkers
      are a way to measure the extent of their disease or the effects of treatment.) These samples
      will also be stored for future studies.

      Treatment plan

        -  LBH589 will be given in oral formulation starting at a dose of 10 mg (Dose Level 1)
           three times per week (doses will be given at least 2 days apart, e.g. Monday, Wednesday,
           Friday), 2 out of 3 weeks dosing schedule.

        -  After establishing the MTD of LBH589 at a 2 out 3 weeks dosing schedule, a 3 out of 3
           weeks dosing schedule will be tested at that dose, and this schedule will be adopted in
           the absence of limiting toxicities.

        -  Carboplatin will be given on day 1, every 21 days, and etoposide on days 1,2,3 every 21
           days for up to 6 cycles. LBH589 will be continued weekly, three times-a-week, without
           interruption after completion of 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy until progression,
           or intolerable toxicities.

      In the phase I part and for cycle 1 only, for the purpose of the PK studies LBH589 will start
      the week prior to the first carboplatin/etoposide cycle and PD studies will be performed
      (week -1).

      Study design and sample size:

      This is a phase I/II study. Phase I: 15-24 patients (estimated; Three to six patients will be
      enrolled at each dose level); Phase II: 39 patients.

    <description>LBH589 will be given in oral formulation starting at a dose of 10 mg (Dose Level 1) 3x/week (2 days apart, e.g. Mon, Wed, Fri), during 2 weeks out of 3-weekly dosing schedule.

Etoposide: Cycles 1-6: 100 mg/mÂ² IV over 60 mins, Days 1-3 every 21 days for 6 cycles Carboplatin: commercially available as a sterile lyophilized powder available in single dose vials containing 50mg, 150mg, or 450mg of carboplatin. Each vial contains equal parts by weight of carboplatin &amp; mannitol. Commercial supplies will be used for this study. It will be administered as an i.v. infusion over 30 minutes. The dose will be calculated based on patient's body weight at each treatment visit.</description>

             therapy. A minimum time period of 3 weeks should elapse between the completion of
             extensive radiation therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease and enrollment in the
             study.

             disease-free interval.

         13. Patients should temporarily stop certain Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAIDS)
             starting 5 days prior to protocol therapy, as described in 6.5.1.

         14. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of the first administration of study treatment and must be willing to

             and for 3 months after last study drug administration. Sexually active males and their
             female partners must agree to use an accepted and effective method of contraception
             (hormonal or barrier methods, abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             the study. Oral contraceptives are generally metabolized by CYP3A4. Since the
             potential of LBH589 to induce CYP3A4 is unknown, patients who are using oral
             contraceptives as a method of contraception, and are sexually active, should use
             another effective contraceptive method.

         10. Patients who have received chemotherapy, any investigational drug or undergone major
             surgery &lt; 4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered from side
