    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to answer the following question: In healthy infants aged four to
      six months undergoing routine immunization for diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis,
      inactivated poliovirus and Haemophilus influenzae type B (DTaP-IPV-Hib) and pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine (PCV) while receiving a combination of proven analgesic interventions
      (least painful injection technique, holding by parent, and oral sucrose solution) and
      non-procedural talk by the parent, does the addition of rubbing near the site of injection
      reduce pain as measured by the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS) to a greater extent than
      no rubbing?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunization is a significant source of pain and distress for infants. At present
      pain-relieving interventions are rarely employed to manage this pain.

      There are many non-pharmacological methods that can be used to reduce immunization pain.
      These include: sugar water, fast injection without aspiration, holding infants during the
      procedure, and non-procedural related parental behaviours such as distraction. At present,
      there are no studies of tactile stimulation during noxious procedures in infants and its
      effectiveness, therefore, is unclear. Light rubbing of the skin near the injection site that
      is administered by a parent immediately before, during and immediately after immunization is
      an easily learned, cost neutral intervention that could offer improved pain management.
