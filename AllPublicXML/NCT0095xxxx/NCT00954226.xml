    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the effects of the standard dose of
      erlotinib and the higher dose of erlotinib on biomarker levels in patients with head and neck
      cancer. Biomarkers are chemical &quot;markers&quot; in the blood and/or tissue that may be related to
      your response to the study drug. The safety of the drug will also be studied.

      The Study Drug:

      Erlotinib is designed to block the activity of a protein found on the surface of many tumor
      cells that may control tumor growth and survival. This may stop tumors from growing.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the toss of a coin) to receive erlotinib at either the standard dose or the high dose.
      There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group. If you are assigned to the high
      dose group and you are a current smoker, you will receive an even higher daily dose of
      erlotinib. Both you and your study doctor will know which group you are in.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Group 1 will take 1 tablet of erlotinib once a day, every day leading up to surgery.

      Group 2 will take 2 tablets once a day, every day leading up to surgery. Depending on your
      assigned dose level, the 2 tablets may contain the same drug amount or 2 different drug
      amounts.

      Erlotinib should be taken at the same time of day, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.
      Each dose should be taken with 8 ounces of water. You should not consume grapefruit or
      grapefruit juice while on this study.

      If you vomit after taking the medication, you can take another dose again, but only if the
      vomited tablet(s) can be seen and counted (in other words, they have not been digested yet).

      Study Visits:

      Every 2 weeks, you will have a study visit. The following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease within 1 week before
           the surgery.

      Within one week before your surgery, you will also have blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) drawn to
      check your blood clotting function.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for at least 2-3 weeks up to the day before surgery. You may be on study
      for up to 8 weeks if there is a delay in surgery.

      After you have completed the study, you will have surgery to remove your tumor. During your
      surgery, a sample of your tumor tissue that is already being removed will be collected to
      check for biomarkers.

      Follow-up:

      Within 30 days after your surgery, you will be contacted by phone to be asked you about any
      side effects you have experienced. The phone call will last about 10 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer (first-line therapy in
      combination with gemcitabine). Its use in this study is investigational.

      Up to 55 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

             salivary gland tumors and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are also eligible.
             (Note: Any patient with a diagnosis of aggressive squamous cell carcinoma of the skin
             and determined to be surgically resectable will be considered for eligibility. These
             patients are typically seen in the Head &amp; Neck surgery clinic and decisions for study
             consideration will be based on consultations with the department of Head &amp; Neck

             erlotinib would cause a deleterious delay in surgical treatment.

          3. Patients with uncompensated congestive cardiac failure.

          4. Patients with an organ allograft.

          5. Patients with a serious concurrent infection or illness including, but not limited to,
