  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if stereotactic radiosurgery can help to
      reduce the risk of a brain tumor returning after surgery. The safety of this treatment will
      also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After surgery to remove brain metastasis, patients are usually given whole brain radiotherapy
      because of the risk of the tumor regrowing in that area or in other places in the brain. It
      is given in 10-14 daily sessions over 2-3 weeks. Because of the potential side effects of
      whole brain radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery to the area of the brain with metastasis
      or observation is also used.

      This study will be using stereotactic radiosurgery or observation instead of whole brain
      radiotherapy.

      Stereotactic radiosurgery is a highly focused, 1 day outpatient radiation procedure.

      Observation is checking the brain through repeat magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) scans, but
      performing no treatment.

      Study Groups:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a
      coin) to 1 of 2 groups.

        -  Group 1 will receive stereotactic radiosurgery to the area of the brain that had the
           brain metastasis removed.

        -  Group 2 will be observed with routine MRI scans only.

      You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.

      Stereotactic Radiosurgery:

      Stereotactic radiosurgery will be offered for treatment of any tumor that was not removed by
      surgery whether or not you are randomized to treatment of the surgical bed or not.

      If you are assigned to receive stereotactic radiosurgery, your neurosurgeon and radiation
      oncologist will discuss the procedure with you in detail. You will also sign a separate
      consent form, which will include the potential risks.

      Stereotactic radiosurgery requires the placement of a stereotactic head frame, which is a
      ring attached to the head with 4 small pins. The frame placement is done with local
      anesthetic (numbing medicine) by the neurosurgeon on the day of the procedure and will remain
      in place until the end of the stereotactic radiosurgery later in the day. The stereotactic
      frame will help the doctor to target the radiotherapy to the area of the surgery that was
      found by an MRI scan. The surgical area and up to 2 other lesions will be treated.

      Study Visits:

      You will have standard MRI scans of the brain after surgery, at 5-8 weeks after surgery,
      every 6-9 weeks for a year and then every 3-4 months for a year, then every 6 months after
      that. At these times, the area of surgery and any other brain tumors that were treated will
      be evaluated for regrowth or side effects from the treatment. The doctors will also decide
      whether there are any new lesions that require treatment.

      Length of Study:

      You will be considered to be off study if the tumor has returned to the surgery site or if
      whole brain radiotherapy is used.

      Additional Information:

      If an MRI scan indicates that the tumor has returned or a new lesion has occurred in the
      brain, you and your doctor will discuss other treatment options including surgery,
      stereotactic radiosurgery, whole brain radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.

      This is an investigational study. Stereotactic radiosurgery is FDA approved and commercially
      available. The comparison of stereotactic radiosurgery to observation is investigational.

      Up to 132 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
