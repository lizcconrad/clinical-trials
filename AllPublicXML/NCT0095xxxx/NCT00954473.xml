      This research trial studies blood samples from patients with osteosarcoma. Studying the genes
      found in samples of blood from patients with osteosarcoma may help doctors identify
      biomarkers related to the disease.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Conduct a large-scale candidate gene association study in osteosarcoma (OS) using cases
      from the national Children's Oncology Group (COG) OS biology study (P9851 and successor study
      AOST06B1).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of OS. II. Fine-map genomic regions
      associated with OS to identify putative functional loci.

      III. Conduct whole-exome sequencing of germline OS deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples.

      IV. Investigate the functional implications of promising genetic variants associated with OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Blood samples undergo polymorphism analysis of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms and
      haplotypes to examine genetic variation, gene-gene interactions, and the population
      structure.

    <description>Logistic regression will be used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between each SNP and OS under co-dominant, dominant and recessive genetic models. Stratified analyses will be conducted to examine sex, tumor subtype and outcome differences.</description>

    <measure>Gene-gene interactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using a multiplicative model. Haplotypes will be constructed using both Bayesian and expectation-maximization algorithms. Differences between cases and controls will be evaluated with HaploStats which uses haplotype posterior probabilities as weights to update the regression coefficients in an iterative manner.</description>

    <measure>Whole-exome variant loci</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Annotation and filtering of each whole-exome variant locus will be performed using a custom software pipeline. Variants in &gt;= 2 OS cases will be validated, and then subsequently replicated in additional OS cases (samples previously received for the GWAS from international collaborators). Variants will also be evaluated for presence in known biologically plausible pathways and genes.</description>
