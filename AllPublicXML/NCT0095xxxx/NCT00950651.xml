    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is a statistically validated, 24-item questionnaire assessing current OA symptoms and functional limitations. The Pain subscale score consists of 5 items each rated on a 100mm VAS scale (0mm=no pain to 100mm=extreme pain). In case of premature discontinuation, the last assessment was used to calculate the percentage of change.</description>

          <title>Patient Global Assessment: Current Interfering Side Effects Versus Pain Relief During Previous Tramadol Treatment at Week 12</title>
          <description>Patients who have previously taken tramadol HCl were asked: “Compared to when you were previously taking tramadol, how have any side effects you have felt during this study interfered with your day-to-day activities?”. Possible answers were: “Interfered much less now”, “Interfered somewhat less now”, “Same as before”, “Interfered more now”.</description>
          <population>Per protocol population: patients who completed study, had no major protocol deviations before/during trial and had primary efficacy variable rating at end of study. Early drop-outs due to AEs / lack of efficacy were included if they took study drug for &gt;2weeks in maintenance phase and had efficacy assessments within 2 days after end of study drug.</population>

Mean scores summarizing the entries of the preceding period were calculated.</description>
          <population>Per protocol population: patients who completed study, had no major protocol deviations before/during trial and had primary efficacy variable rating at end of study. Early drop-outs due to AEs / lack of efficacy were included if they took study drug for &gt;2weeks in maintenance phase and had efficacy assessments within 2 days after end of study drug.</population>
