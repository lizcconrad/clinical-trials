      Eligibility for participation of this study was determined from demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 3 weeks before study drug administration. Subjects suitable for this study were
      admitted to the Clinical Trials Center, Seoul National University Hospital on the day before
      dosing, and they were overnight-fasted from 10 p.m. of Day -1. Subjects were dosed study drug
      orally with 240 ml water around at 9 a.m. of Day 1 and they were fasted until 4 hours
      post-dose. Subjects performed scheduled procedures including clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms and pharmacokinetic samplings. During admission, subjects were served low
      calcium diets. Subjects were discharged on Day 2, and visited Clinical Trials Center on Day
      3, Day 4 and Day 5. Study participation was terminated on post-study visit (Day 7 - 10).
