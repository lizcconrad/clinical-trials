  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, Aprepitant, is currently used to control chemotherapy induced nausea and
      vomiting and is also approved for post-operative nausea and vomiting. The investigators'
      evaluation of it in morbidly obese patients will demonstrate its ability to control nausea
      and vomiting post-operatively in this subset of patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Aprepitant, also known as
      Emend, in reducing post-operative nausea and vomiting in morbidly obese patients.
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting that occurs in morbidly obese patients can greatly
      increase the chances of complications during the post-operative period. By treating morbidly
      obese patients with Aprepitant, the goal is to reduce the risk of such complications that may
      be induced by nausea and vomiting.
