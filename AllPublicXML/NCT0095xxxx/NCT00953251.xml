      BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the diagnostic value of the new TnThs assay for early
      detection of evolving non-STEMI in patients with acute coronary syndrome and a negative 4th
      generation cTnT result on admission.

      METHODS: We evaluated several statistical patterns of blood results of TnT hs and cTnT of 115
      patients and calculated necessity of prediction of evolving non-STEMI within 6 hours.

      RESULTS: Based on the results of the 4th generation cTnT assay, an evolving non-STEMI was
      diagnosed in 26 patients, 31 were classified as unstable angina. The TnThs lead to an
      increase of non-STEMI diagnosis as compared to the 4th generation assay. We could calculate
      increased sensitivities for earlier detection of evolving non-STEMI from 61.5% on admission
      to 90.9% within 3 hours and 100% within 6 hours compared to cTnT.

      CONCLUSIONS: The TnThs assay enables earlier detection of non-STEMI and allows identification
      of an additional percentage of cases with non-STEMI previously classified as unstable angina.

      Blood samples were collected on admission and ideally every hour within the initial 6 hours
      after admission, unless the patient refused the blood draw, or venipuncture was not feasible
      due to technical reasons.

      After collection, blood samples were centrifuged immediately and serum stored at -80°C until
      analysis. The laboratory staff responsible for measurements was blinded to patient data.

        Between May 2008 and December 2008, 115 consecutive patients were enrolled with symptoms
        suggestive of ACS. All patients received a 12-lead electrocardiogram recording on
        admission, and a second 12-lead ECG after 6 hours. Blood samples were collected on
        admission and ideally every hour within the initial 6 hours after admission.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  115 consecutive patients were enrolled with symptoms suggestive of ACS, admitted to
             the Chest Pain Unit of the University of Heidelberg. All patients received a 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) recording on admission, and a second 12-lead ECG after 6 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during follow-up
             sampling were excluded as were patients with a significant kidney dysfunction defined
             as an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min/1.73m2.

          -  Patients with STEMI were excluded.

          -  Patients with only 1 blood sample were also excluded.
