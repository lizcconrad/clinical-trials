      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography and computed
      tomography, may help learn the extent of disease and allow doctors to plan 3-dimensional
      conformal radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of positron emission tomography and
      computed tomography and to see how well it works in planning treatment for patients
      undergoing 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer that
      cannot be removed by surgery.

      This is a clinical study, as the patient will be treated using the PET-CT-GTV: - The pilot
      study is investigating the technological feasibility - The Phase II study will be a 2-stage
      Phase II study

      Pilot Study- Primary Objectives:

        -  Prospective evaluation of the technical feasibility of integrating PET-CT fusion in St
           Luke's Hospital

        -  Rate of PET-CT Scan based treatment delivery

      Pilot Study- Secondary Objectives:

      -Comparison of GTV, PTV and OAR DVHs between conventional 3-DCRT plan and PET-CT based 3-DCRT
      plan.

      Phase II Study- Primary Objective:

      -The safety of PET-CT scan based radiotherapy, with regard to loco-regional disease control.

      Phase II Study- Secondary Objectives:

      -Comparison of GTV, PTV and OAR DVHs between conventional 3-DCRT plan and PET-CT based 3-DCRT
      plan.
