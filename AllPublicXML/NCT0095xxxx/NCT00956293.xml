  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study wants to address whether a calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI)-free regimen six weeks
      after transplantation for Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP) patients is as safe and well
      tolerated as standard treatment but optimizing immunosuppressive therapy with benefits in
      renal function, new-onset diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk, cancer and allograft
      nephropathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated because the required sample size of 240-260 de novo senior renal
    transplant patients was not achieved within a reasonable time.
