  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subtle changes to the brain, which doctors find difficult to detect through conversation or
      examination, may occur in patients with HIV and/or hepatitis C infection. It is not currently
      known whether the brain is affected in early (or acute) hepatitis C.

      This study plans to evaluate what happens to the brain in patients with HIV and early
      hepatitis C. The investigators will be comparing 3 groups of individuals:

        -  Group 1: Individuals with HIV infection and acute (early) hepatitis C infection

        -  Group 2: Individuals with HIV infection

        -  Group 3: Healthy volunteers

      Individuals wishing to take part will complete a series of tests assessing different aspects
      of their brain including:

        -  2 brain scans using different technology:

             -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan with spectroscopy

             -  CT PET brain scan

        -  A computer game test which measures brain function

        -  2 short questionnaires

      Results of these tests will be analyzed and compared between 3 groups.
