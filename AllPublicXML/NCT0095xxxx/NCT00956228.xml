  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study involves a novel and aggressive therapeutic approach for patients' prostate
      cancer. In addition, the investigators propose to administer hormonal therapy to patients
      with an especially high risk: those with initial Gleason scores of &gt; 6, PSA &gt; 10 ng/ml, T3/T4
      primary tumors, and those found to be node positive (N+). The use of hormonal therapy in
      these specific settings correlates with our current standard of care. IMRT is better able to
      spare and protect normal tissues from receiving radiation than 3-D conformal RT. The
      radiotherapy would be followed by continued hormonal therapy for a total of 6 months in those
      who have one of the following Gleason 7 and PSA 10-20 and as per the previous version of this
      trial, 1 year similar to that delivered by the EORTC for higher risk patients, (those with
      initial Gleason scores of &gt; 8, PSA &gt; 20 ng/ml, or T3/T4 tumors). Those found to be N(+) would
      have the hormonal therapy continued indefinitely or until disease progression occurred in a
      manner analogous to the Messing et. al. series in prostatectomy patients. The goals are to
      develop and administer a program of treatment that includes the most recent developments in
      imaging, integrating data from both the CT scan and the ProstaScint scan to optimize prostate
      cancer RT. The CT scan will be used for staging and to determine the exact location of the
      entire prostate which will receive a reasonable dose of RT. The ProstaScint will be used to
      assess the spread of disease to lymph nodes as well as to determine the exact location of the
      tumor within the prostate gland. This region will then be boosted to a tumorcidal dose. The
      investigators then plan to monitor the toxicity and outcome of this treatment. The
      investigators expect that this program of radioimmunoguided IMRT will likely result in
      similar or less toxicity and increased cure rates when compared to conventional radiotherapy
      and standard IMRT programs.
