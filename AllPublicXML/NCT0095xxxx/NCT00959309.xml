  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is an epidemic and increasing. There are very few effective treatments for
      obesity in children. Recent studies have shown an association between obesity and sedentary
      behaviors such as television, video viewing and playing video games ('screen time') in
      preschool aged children. A school based intervention to reduce screen time in older children
      has been effective in preventing obesity.

      The reduction of screen time may lead to the prevention of obesity and its complications in
      preschool children.

      There have been no trials examining an intervention to decrease screen time in preschool
      children in the physician office setting. This setting is appealing for interventions
      directed to preschool children because of accessibility. In addition, other public health
      interventions implemented in a physician office setting, such as home safety advice, have
      been effective.

      The proposed study design will be a randomized controlled trial. The intervention group will
      receive the study intervention, which is a 15 minute session about the health impact of
      screen time in children and strategies to decrease screen time.

      The objective of this study is to determine if an office based intervention is effective in
      decreasing screen time (television, video viewing and playing video games) in preschool
      children.

    <description>15 minute session about the health impact of screen time in children and strategies to decrease screen time (removing televisions from the child's bedroom, budgeting screen time, providing a contingency plan for time spent not watching TV, encouraging family meal time, and implementing a one week television turn off, where children are encouraged to spend one week without watching TV/videos). Activities for the child include reading a story about television viewing (The Berenstain Bears and Too Much TV), and creating a list of non TV related activities to replace TV time. The intervention group will receive a CPS handout titled 'Promoting Good Television Habits' and a calendar with stickers for the television turn off.
