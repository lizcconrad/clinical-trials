  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an ancillary study to Protocol 16997 to examine the stress hormone level in women
      with menopausal symptoms. This ancillary project will collect additional data from the 45
      subjects enrolled in Protocol 16997 (no subjects have enrolled in Protocol 16997 so far).
      This study protocol differs from the main protocol (16997) because it will include an ACTH
      (Hormone) Stimulation Test which will assess the functioning of stress response in the
      subjects at entry and exit.

      Subjects will undergo the ACTH test for this ancillary protocol in the morning when they
      complete 24-hour urine collection for Protocol 16997. The ACTH (Hormone) Stimulation Test
      will not be done in the main protocol 16997. During the ACTH test an IV will be placed in
      subjects arms, 25mL of blood will be drawn at -30 minutes and 6mL of blood will be drawn at
      -15 minutes and 0 minutes respectively. Following, 0.25mg of ACTH will be injected
      intravenous over 60 seconds, and a final 12mL of blood will be drawn 60 minutes later. That
      is, a total of 50mL of blood will be drawn to test serum blood hormone levels from the
      subjects during the ACTH (Hormone) Stimulation Test.

      The 24 hour cortisol data collected in the main protocol 16997 will be used for this study
      analysis.

      When subjects are consented for Protocol 16997, they will also be consented for this
      ancillary study. In addition to the consent visit, subjects will have two study specific
      visits (entry and exit) for this ancillary study. The PI will schedule the specific visits
      for this study to be in conjunction with those scheduled for Protocol 16997.

      There is no collaborations with other sites in the ancillary study.
