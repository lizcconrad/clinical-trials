    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if supervised exercise training using a treadmill
      with partial weight support is safe and has an impact on gait and function of persons with
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

      Twenty ALS patients who are independent in their transfer with assistive devise such as
      walker, cane, or AFO will be offered the opportunity to participate in this study. 20
      subjects will be enrolled at Carolinas ALS/Neuromuscular Center at the Carolinas HealthCare
      System. Eligible subjects will return for 26 sessions, each lasting between 1-2 hours. At
      Session 1 (4 weeks pre-treatment), assessments of muscle strength, spasticity, gait, and
      balance will be performed, which will take between 30-60 minutes. At Sessions 2-25, patients
      will do supported treadmill ambulation training at a very low speed 3 times a week for 6
      weeks under the supervision of the physical therapist. Each session will have 30 minutes of
      direct ambulation with the suspension system and treadmill over a 60 minute period of time.
      Additionally, at sessions 13 and 26 (4 and 8 weeks post-treatment), the assessments of muscle
      strength, spasticity, gait, and balance will be repeated. Needle EMG to assess denervation
      potential will be performed at base line and at the conclusion of the study. The study will
      last a total of 26 weeks for each patient.

    <description>The intervention will consist of 30 minutes of exercise, performed 3 times per week for 8 weeks (24 sessions). Patient will walk on a treadmill with up to 40% of their body weight supported by a body weight support system with an overhead harness. The training session duration will be 60 minutes consisting of six intervals of 5 minutes exercise, interspersed with 6 intervals of 5 minutes rest to avoid overwork weakness and fatigue. Five minute exercise intervals should be sufficient for patients to reach a steady state. Patients will build up their endurance to this training level at their own pace as tolerated. Walking speed will be determined as tolerated by each patient. Exercise intensity will be guided by each patient's own perception of exertion, but not to exceed level 12-13 (mild to moderate) on the modified Borg perceived exertion scale, and by oxygen saturation (Sa O2) â‰¥ 90% monitor by handheld pulse Oximeter.</description>
