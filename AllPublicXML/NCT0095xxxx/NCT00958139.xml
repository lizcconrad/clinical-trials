    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized clinical trial using permethrin treatment of clothing to
      prevent Lyme disease.

      Subjects (N=200) will be recruited from camp staff to participate in the study and screened
      by inclusion and exclusion criteria.Qualifying subjects will be randomized to either the
      treatment (N=100) or non-treatment arm (N=100).

      Subjects in the treatment arm will have their scout shorts, pants, and socks sprayed with
      0.5% permethrin and allowed to dry. Subjects in the non-treatment arm will have their scout
      shorts, pants, and socks sprayed with water and allowed to dry.

      Subjects will then be followed over the summer camping season to see if they develop Lyme
      disease. At 70 days, all subjects will have their Lyme titers rechecked to ensure that all
      cases of Lyme disease were documented.

      Following the 70 day visit, there will be an assessment of the final study outcomes.
