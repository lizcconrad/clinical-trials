      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related
      to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying blood and urine samples in patients with newly
      diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormone therapy and radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Detect changes in serum and urine proteomic profiles that predict outcome in patients
           with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer treated with hormonal therapy and
           radiotherapy.

        -  Identify prognostic and biochemical markers of early disease progression in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Identify unique protein expression and temporal alterations, in these profiles, that
           facilitate understanding of the factors predicting relapse or toxicity.

        -  Identify molecular signatures that allow identification of targets for therapeutic
           intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction hormones* (bicalutimide and releasing-hormone agonist) for
      approximately 4 months prior to starting radiotherapy. Patients then receive radiotherapy
      consisting of 74 Gy up to a maximum of 81 Gy to the prostate gland per standard
      treatment.NOTE: * Patients receiving short-term hormonal treatment for 4-8 months are
      eligible to participate in the trial.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline, and periodically during and after
      induction therapy for proteomic analysis.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for up to 3 years.

        Patients diagnosed with localised prostate cancer who will receive radiation therapy plus
        hormonal therapy, for 4 - 8 months, are eligible for the trial. Patients will be eligible
        to participate in the trial provided they have not received prior therapy for their
        prostate cancer. It is planned that 60 patients will participate in the research study. All
        patients will receive approx 4 months of induction hormone therapy (LHRH agonist and
        Bicalutamide) prior to starting radiotherapy treatment.
