    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the functional outcomes of resynchronization
      management and to describe the patient psychosocial characteristics (depression ad anxiety)
      and associated outcomes with electrophysiologic device therapy for chronic congestive heart
      failure.

      This project will prospectively enroll all consecutive patients undergoing implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and ICD with biventricular pacemaker (CRT-D) implantation
      for heart failure from in-patient and out-patient setting. Primary objective: Compare the
      psychosocial function and quality of life of ICD patients to Patients receiving CRT-D
      therapy. Secondary outcome objectives: 1)Determine and compare the change in LVED (left
      ventricular end distolic) dimension and LVESV (left ventricular end systolic volume)from
      baseline to 9 month follow up in CRT and ICD patient.2)Determine and compare the change in
      NYHA (New York Heart Association) classification, KCCQ, optimisim and pessimism, degree of
      stress, and social support from baseline to 9 month follow up in CRT and ICD patients.
      Florida Patient Acceptance Survey and Florida Shock Anxiety Scale will be determined and
      compared at 3 monthe and 9 months.3)Determine and compare Clinical composite score(Packer M
      2002)in patient groups where: Worsened-patient dies, improved, unchanged. Inclusion Criteria:
      Patient referred for device therapy (ICD or CRT-D) for chronic congestive heart failure who
      are willing and able to give informed consent and participate in follow-up calls. Duration of
      patient follow up will be 9 months. Statistical Mehtodology: Univariate, Multivariatae,
      Kaplan-Meier analysis
