  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has become apparent that many cancers depend on specific fats (lipids) for their continued
      growth. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a safe, popular, and well-tolerated dietary
      supplement that promotes weight loss and loss of fat. CLA was recently shown to block the
      metabolism (uptake and production) of lipids required for growth of some cancers, resulting
      in killing of cancer cells. The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to test whether
      oral CLA blocks metabolism of lipids in patients with advanced cancers. Since the dose of CLA
      that may do this is not yet known, the investigators will start at a dose of CLA known to be
      tolerable and effective for weight loss. If this dose does not block lipid metabolism, the
      investigators will test higher doses in successive groups of patients until the investigators
      identify an effective dose, unless the investigators find that these higher doses cannot be
      tolerated. In order to verify that CLA is absorbed, it is necessary to measure CLA levels in
      blood before and after doses are given. Likewise, in order to verify that CLA blocks lipid
      metabolism, the investigators will need to obtain small samples of abdominal fat (and, in
      some patients, samples of tumors).

    <description>This is a open-label dose-titration trial of CLA in patients with advanced, refractory malignancies. The dose a participant receives is dependent upon the cohort to with the patient is assigned.
CLA will be given as oral soft gels, once daily, with pharmacokinetic sampling and biopsies (pretreatment and on day 15). Doses will be escalated by patient cohorts, using an accelerated titration design (single-patient cohorts) with expansion to conventional cohort sizes (3-6 patients) once either inhibition of S14 expression or clinical toxicity is observed. Subjects with stable or responsive disease and who tolerate treatment may continue on CLA until the time of disease progression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

        A subject is eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Written informed consent.

          2. Age 18 years or more.

          3. Performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Scale.

          4. A predicted life expectancy of at least 3 months, in the estimation of the
             investigator.

          5. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors, who
             have failed conventional therapy for their tumor type or have a tumor type for which
             no standard effective therapy exists.

          6. At least 4 weeks since last chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic therapy or surgery.
             Subjects must be free of post-treatment side effects. No concurrent chemotherapy,
             biologic therapy or radiotherapy is allowed.

          7. Hematological/clinical chemistry criteria of:

             Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL WBC ≥ 3,500/mm3 [≥ 3.5 x 109/L] Neutrophils ≥ 1,500/mm3 [≥ 1.5 x
             109/L] Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 [≥ 100.0 x 109/L] Calculated creatinine clearance ≥60
             mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault Formula.

          8. Serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL (34 µmol/L)

          9. SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT and alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2 times the upper limit of normal if
             liver metastases cannot be visualized by abdominal computed tomography (CT) or
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan). If liver metastases are present, subjects with
             &lt; 5 times the upper limit of normal are eligible to participate.

         10. Once the RP2D is established, additional patients enrolled at the expanded dose cohort
             must have tumor that is accessible to two serial biopsies and that is documented (by
             IHC or RT-PCR) to express S14.

        Exclusion Criteria

        A subject is ineligible if any of the following criteria apply:

          1. Cancer cachexia, defined by the combination of: unintentional weight loss ≥10%, low

             caloric intake (≤ 1500 kcal/day), and systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein ≥
             10mg/L).[52]

          2. Type II diabetes mellitus

          3. Women who are pregnant or lactating, or women subjects of childbearing potential who
             refuse to practice adequate contraception. (oral contraceptives or IUD; double barrier
             such as diaphragm plus spermicide; vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the
             female subject's entry and is the sole sexual partner of that female). Childbearing
             potential is defined as women who are not surgically sterilized (i.e. have not had a
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy [ovariectomy], or bilateral tubal ligation) or
             post-menopausal (i.e., documented absence of menses for one year prior to entry into
             the study).

          4. Men unwilling to abstain from sex or use effective contraception during the study.

          5. Subjects with uncontrolled emesis, regardless of etiology.

          6. Active infection, or seropositivity for HIV or Hepatitis B/C.

          7. Subjects with clinical evidence of any gastrointestinal (GI) conditions (i.e., removal
             of a portion of the stomach, recent GI obstruction or GI neuropathy) or subjects
             taking drugs that would alter GI absorption or motility (e.g., cisapride).

          8. Intercurrent severe medical problems, which would significantly limit full compliance
             with the study or expose the subject to unnecessary risk.
