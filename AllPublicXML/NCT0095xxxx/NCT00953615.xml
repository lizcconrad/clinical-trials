    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and benefit of Thalidomide with primary
      sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). This is a six month study.

      At entry, patients will have a complete history and physical, blood tests, ultrasound, and
      will complete questionnaires. Eligible patients will take Thalidomide 400 mg once a day in
      the evening. Patients will start a dose of 100 mg per day for two weeks, increasing by 100 mg
      per day every two weeks to a maximum dose of 400 mg per day for 6 months. Patients will
      return at 6 months for an evaluation, blood tests and completion of questionnaires. Blood
      tests will be performed by mailed-in kits at 3 months. Patients will receive weekly phone
      calls for the first 2 months and bi-monthly thereafter.

    <time_frame>6 months, baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome was the change in serum liver biochemical parameter levels after 6 months of thalidomide when compared to baseline values. This was to be analyzed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test of significance. This was based on the non-normal distribution of serum hepatic biochemical parameters among patients with PSC and the continuous nature of these variables.</description>

    <measure>Overall Toxicity and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall toxicity and tolerability were to be measured by the number of patients with development of neuropathy, increased liver biochemistries, drowsiness, dizziness and orthostatic hypotension.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis as defined by: serum alkaline
             phosphatase level greater than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal,
             negative serum antimitochondrial antibody test, cholangiography diagnostic of PSC
             without other etiology for biliary obstruction, and liver histology consistent with or
             diagnostic of PSC

          -  Patients must give written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to comply with the most recent version of the
             FDA-mandated System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.®)
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and/or lactating female

             hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune
             hepatitis, and cryptogenic liver disease

          -  Anticipated need for liver transplantation in one year from decompensated chronic
             liver disease or recurrent variceal bleeding, spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy, or
             refractory ascites

          -  Treatment with tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus, ursodeoxycholic acid,
             corticosteroids, colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, chlorambucil,
