      Potential donors who are undergoing bone marrow biopsy or bone marrow donation as part of
      clinical care will be asked by the principal investigator (PI) if they might be interested in
      donating marrow for this research project. If they are interested, the PI will meet with the
      prospective donor to review the information contained in the informed consent document and to
      answer any questions the potential subject may have. Bone marrow aspirates of approximately
      5cc will be obtained from the posterior iliac crest of subjects using standard techniques.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the mechanisms that regulate human globin gene
      expression by analyzing the function of cell signaling pathways and the expression of other
      related genes and their protein products in the bone marrow cells of people without blood
      diseases. This includes the effects of drugs and other in vitro manipulations of the cells
      once they are removed from donors. These assays will include, but are not limited to,
      determinations of DNA methylation status, histone acetylation profiles, DNAse sensitivity,
      transcription factor binding to DNA, levels of various proteins, messenger RNAs and miRNAs in
      the cells of the marrow samples. By understanding how this process occurs in people without
      blood diseases, we hope to to design future treatments for people with diseases such as
      sickle cell disease and B-thalassemia.
