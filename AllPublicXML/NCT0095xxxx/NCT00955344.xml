  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if a Web-based intervention increases physician
      rates of colorectal cancer recommendation rates in a group of physicians participating in the
      American Board of Internal Medicine's Maintenance of Certification Program. This study will
      also compare the content of practice improvement plans submitted by the diplomats in each
      study arm to determine the components of the plans that are associated with colorectal cancer
      rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. Although colorectal
      cancer screening (CRCS) is effective, cost-effective and consistently recommended by clinical
      practice guidelines, only 57.3% of the adults over 50 years have been screened within the
      recommended interval. Preliminary research conducted by this PI demonstrates that
      approximately 90% of patients who have not had CRCS report that a doctors recommendation
      would motivate them to undergo screening. However, research also shows that physicians do not
      consistently recommend CRCS to each eligible patient. In this study the barriers of and
      facilitators to physician recommendation of CRCS are tested in the to proposed randomized
      controlled trial. The trial will pilot test an interactive, multifaceted, Web-based
      intervention (eToolbox) to increase primary care physician rates of CRCS. This application
      innovatively proposes to pilot test the eToolbox in the setting of the American Board of
      Internal Medicine (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification process within the Preventive Services
      Practice Improvement Module, a physician-directed measurement of their performance and
      quality improvement requirement for board re-certification.
