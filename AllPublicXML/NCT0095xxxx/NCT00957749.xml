  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molybdenum Cofactor Deficiency Type A (MoCD) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder that
      is essentially fatal early in life. Naturally occurring cPMP is present in the body of all
      healthy normal individuals. It is processed to molybdopterin, which is further processed to
      molybdenum cofactor. Molybdenum cofactor is essential for the function of important enzymes.

      There is currently no treatment for MoCD, and affected infants develop severe neurological
      damage which often results in infant death.

      This study is the first clinical trial to investigate the potential of replacement of cPMP to
      infants with MoCD Type A. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of daily intravenous
      administration of cPMP over 3 months will be determined.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonate or infant, less then 6 weeks at the time of diagnosis, age less than 8 weeks
             at start of treatment with the study medication. It is important to diagnose the
             condition and initiate treatment as soon after birth as possible.

          -  Documented diagnosis of molybdenum cofactor deficiency (MoCD) Type A based on the
             absence of cPMP and the presence of sulfite and s-sulfocysteine in the urine, absence
             of urothione in the urine and genetic analysis showing a mutation in the MOCS1 gene

          -  A parent or legal guardian voluntarily provided written informed consent to
             participate in the study and comply with study procedures.

          -  Approval of the study protocol by the local HE / IRB and government or regulatory
             authorities (if applicable)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  MoCD Type B (MOCS2 mutation) or Type C (gephyrin gene mutation)

          -  Sulfite oxidase deficiency

          -  Patients older than 6 weeks at the time of diagnosis
