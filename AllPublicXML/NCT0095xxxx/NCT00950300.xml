  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label multicenter trial, participants with operable or locally advanced breast
      cancer will be randomized to pre-operative treatment with 8 cycles of chemotherapy (4 cycles
      of docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide)
      concurrent with either SC Herceptin or IV Herceptin. After surgery, participants will receive
      a further 10 cycles of SC or IV Herceptin as per randomization to complete 1 year of
      treatment. All cycles will be 21 days in length. After the end of study treatment,
      participants will be followed for safety and efficacy for up to 5 years or until disease
      recurrence, whichever is earlier.

          <title>Herceptin IV + Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Participants received eight cycles of Herceptin IV plus chemotherapy prior to surgery and ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 75 milligrams per meter-squared (mg/m^2) every 21 days for four cycles followed by 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m^2, epirubicin 75 mg/m^2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m^2 (FEC) every 21 days for four cycles. Herceptin was administered as 8 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) on Day 1 and then as 6 mg/kg on Day 22 and every 21 days thereafter. The first eight cycles prior to surgery comprised the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period, and the ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery comprised the Adjuvant Treatment Period. Thereafter, participants entered the Treatment-Free Follow-Up (TFFU) Period. Participants who were withdrawn from the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period for any reason, or who experienced disease recurrence during either the Adjuvant Treatment Period or TFFU Period, could be entered into the Survival Follow-Up (SFU) Period.</description>

            <description>Participants received eight cycles of Herceptin SC plus chemotherapy prior to surgery and ten cycles of Herceptin SC after surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 every 21 days for four cycles followed by FEC every 21 days for four cycles. Herceptin was administered as a 600-mg fixed dose given every 21 days. The first eight cycles prior to surgery comprised the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period, and the ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery comprised the Adjuvant Treatment Period. Thereafter, participants entered the TFFU Period. Participants who were withdrawn from the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period for any reason, or who experienced disease recurrence during either the Adjuvant Treatment Period or TFFU Period, could be entered into the SFU Period.</description>

            <description>Participants received eight cycles of Herceptin IV plus chemotherapy prior to surgery and ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 every 21 days for four cycles followed by FEC every 21 days for four cycles. Herceptin was administered as 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and then as 6 mg/kg on Day 22 and every 21 days thereafter. The first eight cycles prior to surgery comprised the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period, and the ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery comprised the Adjuvant Treatment Period. Thereafter, participants entered the TFFU Period. Participants who were withdrawn from the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period for any reason, or who experienced disease recurrence during either the Adjuvant Treatment Period or TFFU Period, could be entered into the SFU Period.</description>

            <description>Participants received eight cycles of Herceptin IV plus chemotherapy prior to surgery and ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 every 21 days for four cycles followed by FEC every 21 days for four cycles. Herceptin was administered as 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and then as 6 mg/kg on Day 22 and every 21 days thereafter. The first eight cycles prior to surgery comprised the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period, and the ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery comprised the Adjuvant Treatment Period. Thereafter, participants entered the TFFU Period. Participants who were withdrawn from the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period for any reason, or who experienced disease recurrence during either the Adjuvant Treatment Period or TFFU Period, could be entered into the SFU Period.</description>

          <title>Time to Response According to RECIST Version 1.0, Among Those With Measurable Disease at Baseline</title>
          <description>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions and short-axis reduction of any pathological lymph nodes to &lt;10 mm with no prior assessment of PD. PR was defined as ≥30% decrease from Baseline in SD of target lesions with no prior assessment of PD. PD was defined as ≥20% relative increase and ≥5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started; or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Time to response was defined as the time from first dose of study medication to the first assessment of CR or PR, which was the date the response was first documented by objective evidence, among participants with an overall response of CR or PR.</description>
          <population>EPP Population; only participants with measurable disease at Baseline and a response of CR or PR were included.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADAs) Against Trastuzumab</title>
        <description>Participants provided PK samples for evaluation of anti-trastuzumab antibodies. The number of participants with “Treatment-induced ADAs” and “Treatment-enhanced ADA” against trastuzumab at any time during or after treatment was reported. Treatment-induced ADA = a participant with negative or missing Baseline ADA result(s) and at least one positive post-Baseline ADA result. Treatment-enhanced ADA = a participant with positive ADA result at Baseline who has one or more post Baseline titer results that are at least 0.60 titer unit greater than the Baseline titer result (four-fold increase of titer).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline; pre-dose (0 hours) on Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, 13, 18 (cycle length of 21 days); and Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 from last dose of Cycle 18</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population: All participants who received at least one dose of study medication. Here, Overall Number of Participants Analyzed = participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

            <title>Herceptin IV + Chemotherapy</title>
            <description>Participants received eight cycles of Herceptin IV plus chemotherapy prior to surgery and ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery. Chemotherapy consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 every 21 days for four cycles followed by FEC every 21 days for four cycles. Herceptin was administered as 8 mg/kg on Day 1 and then as 6 mg/kg on Day 22 and every 21 days thereafter. The first eight cycles prior to surgery comprised the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period, and the ten cycles of Herceptin IV after surgery comprised the Adjuvant Treatment Period. Thereafter, participants entered the TFFU Period. Participants who were withdrawn from the Neoadjuvant Treatment Period for any reason, or who experienced disease recurrence during either the Adjuvant Treatment Period or TFFU Period, could be entered into the SFU Period.</description>
