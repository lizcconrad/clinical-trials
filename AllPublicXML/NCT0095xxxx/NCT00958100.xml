    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the persistent control of the virus replication at 48 weeks after
      the simplification to tenofovir + emtricitabine + raltegravir or to
      lamivudine+abacavir+raltegravir in patients with optimal virological suppression without any
      virological failure to previous combined antiretroviral therapies needing a therapeutic
      switch for toxicity related issues or adverse events.

    <description>Patients will receive raltegravir with tenofovir/emtricitabine; data will be added to those of Tenofovir Emtricitabine Raltegravir arm in a separate longitudinal analysis comparing data at baseline and at 48 weeks. In this separate analysis, data will not be compared to those obtained from the Lamivudine Abacavir Raltegravir arm. The number of patients in this arm is not pre-established.</description>

             years

          -  Current alcohol or drug abuse or any other condition which, in the judgment of the
