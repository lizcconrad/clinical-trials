    <textblock>
      A life review program is mainly developed based on Erickson's theory, Confucius's teaching on
      human development, and the empirical findings of the researcher's preliminary study and
      pre-pilot study. The program covers reviewing a life for advanced cancer patients and
      formulating a booklet for them. A randomized controlled trial will be adopted for evaluation
      of this program. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and
      the control group. The subjects in the experimental group will receive a life review program
      for three weeks. The outcome measure is quality of life (QOL), including domains of physical
      discomfort, food-related concerns, health care concerns, support, negative emotions, sense of
      alienation, existential distress and value of life. Subjects' QOL will be assessed before
      commencement of the program (T0) and one day (T1) and three weeks (T2) after the completion
      of the program for all subjects in two groups. Perceptions of the program will be elicited
      within three days after the program for subjects in the experimental group.Descriptive
      statistics will be used to analyze patients' personal information, disease related
      information, functional performance and QOL of advanced cancer patients. Repeated measures
      ANOVA will be used to measure QOL differences in between-group, within-group and interaction
      effects. Content analysis will be used to analyze the qualitative data collected.
