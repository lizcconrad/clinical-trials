    <description>The Functional Living Index-Emesis is a self-administered, validated emesis &amp; nausea-specific questionnaire. Participants completed the questionnaire 5 days post chemotherapy. It had 9 questions each on nausea and vomiting. &quot;No impact of chemotherapy-induced nausea &amp; vomiting (CINV) on daily life&quot; was defined as an average item score of &gt;6 on the 7-point scale (i.e., &gt;108 total score). The scale was in the opposite direction for questions 3, 6, 11, 15 &amp; 18. For each question: score ranged from 1 (worst) to 7 (best, i.e., no CINV). Total score range was 7 (worst) to 126 (best).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cycle 1:

          -  Patient is scheduled to receive his/her first course of cisplatin chemotherapy at a
             dose of at least 70 mg/m^2 administered a maximum of 3 hours

          -  Patient has a predicted life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Patient is not pregnant

        Cycle 2 (optional):

          -  Participation in the study during the next cycle of chemotherapy is considered

        appropriate by the investigator and will not pose unwarranted risk to the patient.

          -  Satisfactory completion of the preceding cycle of chemotherapy and related

        study procedures.

          -  Patient will continue to receive the same chemotherapy regimen as in Cycle 1. The
             cisplatin dose may be reduced in subsequent cycle, as long as the new

        dose is still no less than 70 mg/m^2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Cycles 1 &amp; 2:

          -  Patient will receive stem cell therapy in conjunction with cisplatin

          -  Patient has an active infection or any uncontrolled disease (e.g. diabetes)

          -  Patient will receive multiple-day chemotherapy with cisplatin

          -  Patient will receive chemotherapy of moderate or high emetogenicity on the 6 days
             prior to cisplatin infusion or the 6 days following the cisplatin infusion

          -  Patient has vomited within 24 hours prior to cisplatin infusion

          -  Patient received or will receive radiation therapy to the abdomen

        <description>The Functional Living Index-Emesis is a self-administered, validated emesis &amp; nausea-specific questionnaire. Participants completed the questionnaire 5 days post chemotherapy. It had 9 questions each on nausea and vomiting. &quot;No impact of chemotherapy-induced nausea &amp; vomiting (CINV) on daily life&quot; was defined as an average item score of &gt;6 on the 7-point scale (i.e., &gt;108 total score). The scale was in the opposite direction for questions 3, 6, 11, 15 &amp; 18. For each question: score ranged from 1 (worst) to 7 (best, i.e., no CINV).
