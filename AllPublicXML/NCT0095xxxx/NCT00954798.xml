  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to generate data on immunogenicity and safety of the monovalent
      H1N1 vaccine in support of the development and registration.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response to study vaccine 21 days after each vaccination.

        -  To describe the antibody persistence 8 months after the first vaccine administration
           using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) method in a randomized subset of adult subjects
           who received two injections.

        -  To describe the immune response against the A/H1N1 strain using HAI method 21 days after
           a vaccination with the 2010-2011 Northern Hemisphere (NH) seasonal trivalent influenza
           vaccine (TIV) administered 13 months after the first vaccination in a subset subjects
           who received the A/H1N1 influenza vaccine and in subjects naïve to the swine origin
           A/H1N1 strain.

        -  To describe the safety profiles of study vaccines in all participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive two injections of their randomized vaccine on Day 0 and Day 21,
      respectively.

      A subset of the participants will receive a third vaccine injection (2010-2011 Northern
      Hemisphere [NH] seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine [TIV]) approximately 13 months after the
      first vaccination; additionally, a subset of participants' naïve to the swine-origin A/H1N1
      strain will also receive one vaccine injection of the 2010-2011 NH seasonal TIV.
