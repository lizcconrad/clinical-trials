  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the fact that the post-myocardial infarction survival rate has improved with
      recent medical advances, reduced heart function attributed to irreversible loss of viable
      cardiomyocytes is still a major clinical problem.

      The aim of the current study is to determine whether intramyocardial injection of autologous
      CD133+ bone marrow stem cells yields a functional benefit in addition to coronary artery
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with chronic ischemic coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beginning in 2001, a phase-1 equivalent feasibility and safety evaluation of intramyocardial
      injection of autologous CD133+ bone marrow cells during elective CABG surgery was conducted
      at Rostock University. No procedure-related adverse events were observed and there was some
      improvement of myocardial contractility and perfusion. It was decided to proceed with a
      controlled efficacy testing, comparing the outcome of standard CABG surgery with that after
      CABG and CD133+ cell injection. The results of that study indicate that the additional cell
      injection yields a better left ventricular contractility than CABG alone (LVEF = 47.1±8% vs.
      41.3±9% at 6 months). Although this result is encouraging, the trial had several limitations
      that hamper interpretation of the data. Most notably, no sham-injection of placebo material
      was performed in the control group, and standard 2D echocardiography served as the only
      measurement of global LV contractility.

      However, there were no procedure-related complications up to 18 months postoperatively,
      especially no new ventricular arrhythmia or neoplasia.

      Therefore, a prospective, double blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled multi-center
      trial will be conducted in Germany, employing current state-of-the art measurement of global
      and regional LV contractility by cardiac MRI. The following hypothesis will be tested:
      &quot;Patients who undergo CABG &amp; CD133+ cell injection do not have a higher LV ejection fraction
      than patient who undergo CABG alone, measured 6 months after the operation&quot;. A power analysis
      based on the previous trial results indicated that 71 patients per group need to be enrolled
      so as to reject the null-hypothesis with sufficient statistical power. A total of 142
      patients will therefore be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
      to undergo CABG surgery in conjunction with either intramyocardial injection of autologous
      CD133-enriched bone marrow cells or placebo. Bone marrow will be harvested one or two days
      prior to surgery and a CD133-enriched cell product (or placebo) will be prepared at a central
      cell processing GMP unit. Bypass surgery will be performed and the investigational product
      will be injected in the border zone of the infarcted myocardium. Random allocation will be
      performed in the cell production facility, so that neither the patient nor the surgeon nor
      any of the personnel involved in follow-up examinations will know whether the cell product or
      placebo was administered. The primary outcome parameter (LVEF at 6 months) will be measured
      by cardiac MRI, and secondary outcome parameters include physical exercise capacity, cardiac
      function, safety and Quality of Life (QoL).
