      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 300 IR sublingual tablet of
      grass pollen allergen extract compared to placebo in adult patient with allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergy is one of the most common chronic disease in the world currently affecting between
      10% and 25% of the general population.

      Allergies to pollens characteristically result in seasonal rhinitis symptoms and allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis is characterized by sneezing, congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal or palatal
      itching and itchy, watery, red and swollen eyes.

      Even if several drugs effectively manage allergic rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms, immunotherapy
      is considered more appropriate for patients in whom these symptoms are not optimally
      controlled with relief medications.

      In the study, each of the six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose,
      nasal congestion, itchy eyes, watery eyes) will be evaluated daily and relief medication
      intake (oral antihistamines, eye drop antihistamine, nasal corticosteroid, oral
      corticosteroid) reported daily during the grass pollen season.

      Efficacy and good safety profile of 300IR SLIT tablet administered once per day for
      approximately six months (starting 4 months before and over the season) will be demonstrated
      during the grass pollen season compared to placebo.

    <description>The daily Combined Score (CS) is a patient specific score taking into account the patient's daily Rhinoconjunctivis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) and daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS), assuming equivalent importance of symptoms and rescue medication scores.
The RMS (range 0-3) is derived as follows: 0, no rescue medication; 1, use of antihistamine; 2, use of nasal corticosteroid; 3, use of oral corticosteroid. The RTSS (range 0-18) is the sum of the 6 individual rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score (each symptom is scored as follows: 0: no symptoms, 1: mild symptoms, 2: moderate symptoms and 3: severe symptoms).
The CS (range 0-3) = (RTSS/6 + RMS)/2. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Grass pollen-related allergic rhinoconjunctivitis for at least the last two pollen
             seasons.

          2. Positive SPT to grasses

          3. Total symptoms score for the previous pollen season more than 12 out of 18.

        <title>Combined Score (CS)</title>
        <description>The daily Combined Score (CS) is a patient specific score taking into account the patient’s daily Rhinoconjunctivis Total Symptom Score (RTSS) and daily Rescue Medication Score (RMS), assuming equivalent importance of symptoms and rescue medication scores.
The RMS (range 0-3) is derived as follows: 0, no rescue medication; 1, use of antihistamine; 2, use of nasal corticosteroid; 3, use of oral corticosteroid. The RTSS (range 0-18) is the sum of the 6 individual rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score (each symptom is scored as follows: 0: no symptoms, 1: mild symptoms, 2: moderate symptoms and 3: severe symptoms).
The CS (range 0-3) = (RTSS/6 + RMS)/2. The lower the score, the better the outcome.</description>
