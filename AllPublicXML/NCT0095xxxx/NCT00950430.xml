  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, non-therapeutic, diagnostic imaging study. The purpose of
      this study is to utilize Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission imaging (PiB PET) to
      ascertain the relationship between change in amyloid burden over time, and concurrent change
      in clinical status.

    <textblock>
      Identification of risk factors and biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease is essential in
      caring for the growing numbers of elderly. Imaging biomarkers provide non-invasive ways to
      look at brain function. A new PET imaging agent, Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB), that identifies
      brain amyloid is an exciting development in brain imaging that needs to be studied. We plan
      to study this imaging technique in normal volunteers and patients with a variety of
      neurodegenerative diseases to determine its utility. Long term followup of these subjects
      will allow us to understand the predictive ability of this new test.

Repeat these scans approximately every 24-30 months for up to 10 years in those with all three PETs or 20 years in those with only PiB PET and FDG PET. A second PiB PET, TAU PET and/or FDG PET may be administered within a year if needed to ensure a completed exam for analysis in the rare case of exam failure or data loss. ECG will be performed on subjects who have not had previous ECG test at Mayo to rule out prolonged QT interval prior to PET TAU scan.</description>
