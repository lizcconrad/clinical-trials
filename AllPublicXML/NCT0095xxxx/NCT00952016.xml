  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of methotrexate in a genetically selected population of patients with
      advanced colorectal cancer, who have loss of a particular gene, MSH2. The efficacy of
      methotrexate will be evaluated by the proportion of cases that have a significant response to
      treatment (objective response rate).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve treating 29 subjects with methotrexate given intravenously. All
      subjects will receive treatment; there is no control arm or randomisation. The subjects will
      be known to have deficiency of MSH2, or a mutation (genetic change) in MSH2 that stops it
      functioning normally. This can either be demonstrated by testing for loss of MSH2 protein in
      the tumour itself, or by the demonstration of a mutation in the MSH2 gene in the subject's
      blood.
