      with Hokunalin (tulobuterol) tape 2mg once a day, in terms of improvement in pulmonary
      function (peak expiratory flow: PEF) in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group
      comparative study in adult patients with bronchial asthma on ICS 400mcg/day of FP equivalent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For entry into run-in period (Visit 1)

          2. Subjects who are able to give a written informed consent to participation in the
             study.

             However, if a subject is aged &lt; 20 years at the time of giving informed consent, a
             written informed consent should be obtained from the subject and his/her legally
             acceptable representative.

          3. Outpatients.

          4. Subjects who had been diagnosed as asthma at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

          5. Subjects who have been receiving ICS 400mcg/day of FP equivalent for at least 8 weeks
             prior to Visit 1.

               -  For entry into the treatment period (Visit 2)

        A subject will be considered eligible for entering the treatment period only if he/she
        completes the run-in period and meets all of the following criteria:

          1. Subjects who meet both of the following criteria in terms of pulmonary function.

               -  Has a mean morning PEF during the last 7 days (at least 4 days) prior to Visit 2
                  is &gt;= 40% of the predicted value.

               -  Has at least 2 days with a diurnal variation in PEF of &gt;= 15% during the run-in
                  period, or had been confirmed and recorded reversibility of &gt;= 15% using
                  rapid-acting inhaled beta2 agonists within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (including
                  Visit 1).

          2. Subjects who have &gt;= 70 % compliance with asthma medication during the run-in period.

          3. Subjects who were able to measure peak flows correctly during the run-in period, in
             the investigator's/subinvestigator's judgment.

          4. Subjects who were able to keep the asthma diary correctly during the run-in period, in

              11. Subjects who received the last dose of other investigational drugs in the past 30
                  days.
