      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the night procedure in regards to
      colon cleansing level and capsule excretion rate.

      The evaluation of subjects with suspected colonic disease includes endoscopic imaging by
      colonoscopy and radiologic imaging such as air-contrast barium enema, or CT colonography. The
      Given® Diagnostic System offers an alternative approach for endoscopic visualization of the
      colon using capsule endoscopy, an ingestible device which contains imagers, light sources, a
      power source and a RF transmitter. Advantages of the Given® Diagnostic System include the
      elimination of the need for sedation, the minimally invasive, painless nature of the exam,
      and the ability to pursue normal daily activities immediately following the procedure .
      Furthermore, compared to standard colonoscopy, the Given® Diagnostic System may be more
      readily accepted by the subjects, thereby improving subjects' willingness to undergo a
      diagnostic evaluation of the colon and comply with colorectal cancer screening
      recommendations.

      The PillCam™ SB capsule (formerly M2A® Capsule) that was FDA-approved in August 2001 for
      small bowel evaluation has been ingested to date by more than 500,000 people worldwide and is
      well accepted by patients and physicians as well as the processional societies. However,
      adequate visualization of the colon cannot be achieved with the standard PillCam™ SB capsule
      because of the anatomical and physiological properties of the colon which are significantly
      different than the small bowel. Moreover, other issues that limit the evaluation of the
      colonic mucosa by the standard PillCam™ SB procedure include an unsatisfactory level of colon
      cleanliness and slow progression of the PillCam™ SB capsule through the colon during the
      desired examination time. Therefore, the development and introduction of a specially
      designed, customized colon capsule combined with a dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure
      protocol will allow for more efficient evaluation of the colonic mucosa. This is expected to
      improve the capability of the Given® Diagnostic System to detect colonic pathologies and to
      serve as a diagnostic and screening tool for colonic disease. Further details of the PillCam™
      Colon Capsule Endoscope (PCCE) can be found in the device description section.

      This is a pilot study that is designed to evaluate the level of cleanliness and visualization
      of colon achieved by colon capsule endoscopy when using Night procedure regimens for
      preparation of the colon.
