      This is a Phase 1 study, involving a 10-day dosing period, designed to test the safety of
      investigational study drug ARRY-403 (as monotherapy or in addition to stable metformin
      therapy) in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Approximately 128 patients from the US will be
      enrolled in this study.
