      RATIONALE: Doctors use a swab to collect cell samples when testing for anal cancer and human
      papillomavirus. It is not yet known which type of swab is more effective in collecting cell
      samples for anal Pap tests and human papillomavirus tests in men who have sex with men.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is comparing two types of swabs in collecting cell samples for
      anal Pap tests and human papillomavirus tests in men who have sex with men.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether the anal cytology screening outcome derived from specimens
           collected by a flocked nylon swab are equivalent to those derived from Dacron swab
           specimens in men who have sex with men.

        -  To determine whether the number and type-specific identification for human
           papillomavirus derived from specimens collected by a flocked nylon swab are equivalent
           to those derived from Dacron swab specimens.

      OUTLINE: Dry sterile Dacron swabs and flocked nylon swabs are used to collect intra-anal
      cytology specimens for anal Pap testing and human papillomavirus typing. Participants undergo
      a digital rectal examination and high-resolution anoscopy. If lesions are identified, an anal
      biopsy is performed for histological examination.
