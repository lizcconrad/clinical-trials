    <textblock>
      Thirty eight autistic spectrum disorder children age 2-6 years recruited into the study. The
      new treatment intervention is based on the DIR Model. Parents will be coached at the start
      and then every 3-4 months for 1 year. Outcome will be measured at the first session and at
      the end of the study using Functional Emotional Assessment Scale and Childhood Autism Rating
      Scales, Functional Emotional Level, and parent satisfaction rating.

      Hypothesis of the study: Children who get additional treatment of DIR/floortime show much
      improvement in climbing the developmental &quot;ladder&quot; and declining in the autistic behaviors.
