    <textblock>
      To identify the occurrence of serotonin toxicity in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients
      receiving antidepressant therapy and rasagiline, compared to those receiving rasagiline
      without antidepressant medications and compared to PD patients receiving antidepressants, but
      not rasagiline.

        Male or female patients with a diagnosis of PD:

             concomitant antidepressant medication, OR

          -  who received rasagiline at any dose, as mono- or adjunct therapy for PD, without
             concomitant antidepressant medication, OR

          -  who received antidepressant medication and any other dopaminergic anti-PD therapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients with a diagnosis of PD

          2. Rasagiline treatment as mono- or adjunct therapy for PD with concomitant
             antidepressant medication (SSRIs, SNRIs, St. John's wort and/or TCAs) at any time
             during the specified review period, OR Rasagiline treatment as mono- or adjunct
             therapy for PD without concomitant antidepressant medication (SSRIs, SNRIs, St. John's
             wort and/or TCAs) at any time during the specified review period. OR Antidepressant
             therapy (SSRIs, SNRIs, St. John's wort and/or TCAs) and any other dopaminergic anti-PD
             treatment besides rasagiline or selegiline at any time during the specified review
             period

          3. Willing to consent to review of office chart and to review of records of ER visits
             and/or hospitalizations corresponding to the review window, if required

          4. Patients previously participating in a rasagiline clinical trial (and their follow-up
             protocols) are eligible, provided that they did not receive antidepressant therapy
             during trial participation.

          5. In addition to the above criteria, each group has specific inclusion criteria stated
             below:

               -  Group R+AD: Enrollment in this group requires that patients must have taken
                  rasagiline and an antidepressant (SSRIs, SNRIs, St. John's wort and/or TCAs,
                  regardless of indication) within 14 days of each other (or five weeks, if
                  fluoxetine preceded rasagiline).

               -  Group R: Enrollment in this group requires patients must have at least 2 months
                  of rasagiline use.

               -  Group AD: Patients must be taking an approved dopaminergic medication for PD.
                  Enrollment in this group requires that patients must have at least 2 months of
                  treatment with an antidepressant medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of rasagiline for any indication other than PD

          2. Patients taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressant and/or selegiline

          3. Inability or unwillingness to request records of ER visits and/or hospitalizations
             corresponding to the review period.
