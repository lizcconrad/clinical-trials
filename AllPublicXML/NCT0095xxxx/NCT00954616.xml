  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In each of the 7 French areas that should be involved, patients aged 75 years and over from
      three different sectors will be included: the geriatric consultation unit (60%) and two kinds
      of nursing homes, private (20%) and state (10%). Outpatients will be included in
      chronological order; patients in nursing homes will be included at random. The patients and
      their families will be asked about the treatments received on the day of inclusion. The
      inclusion period will extend over a year. The investigating practitioners will be asked to
      fill in a questionnaire reporting the main clinical data, adverse effects occurrence, and
      information on the treatment given.
