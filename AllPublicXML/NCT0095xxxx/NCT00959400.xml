      Eligible patients who agree to participate will migrate from oral opioids to transdermal
      patches and be followed for four weeks. Oral morphine will be provided as pain rescue
      medication. The patients will inform the adverse events and rescue medication consumption.
      The number of Fentanest® patches will be adjusted every visit aiming to reduce the rescue
      medication consumption and adverse events to a minimum. The WHO-QOL- bref (quality of life
      questionary) will be filled before and after the use of Fentanest®. Patients showing benefit
      are eligible to a 3 weeks compassionate study.
