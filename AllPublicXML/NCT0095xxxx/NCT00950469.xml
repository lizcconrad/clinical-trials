      OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the early diagnostic value of the new high
      sensitive cardiac troponin T assay (TnThs) in suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and to
      compare it with the 4th generation cTnT assay from the same manufacturer, myoglobin and
      heart-type fatty acid binding protein (h-FABP).

      METHODS: The study consisted of 94 patients with chest pain admitted to the chest pain unit
      with the diagnosis of suspected ACS without ST-Elevation. Patients were divided according to
      time from onset of symptoms to presentation into an early presenter group (&lt;4 hours) and a
      late presenter group (≥4 hours).

      A median of 6 samples (range 2-8) were available per patient. The diagnostic performance of
      TnThs was assessed using ROC analysis and areas under the curve (AUC) of baseline and
      follow-up results of TnThs, cTnT, myoglobin, and h-FABP were compared using c-statistics.

      RESULTS: The TnThs assay allows an excellent prediction of non-ST-segment-elevation
      myocardial infarction (non-STEMI) at presentation.A follow-up sample improves diagnostic
      performance in a time dependent manner. The AUC of the TnThs was superior to cTnT at all time
      points.

      CONCLUSIONS: A baseline sample of TnThs allows an earlier prediction of non-STEMI than the
      less sensitive and precise 4th generation cTnT assay. The excellent performance of TnThs at
      baseline and follow-up might obviate the need for other early necrosis markers.

    <description>94 consecutive patients without ST-segment elevation admitted to the Chest Pain Unit of the University of Heidelberg were enrolled with symptoms suggestive of ACS.
Unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were diagnosed using the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/World Heart Federation Task Force redefinition of myocardial infarction guidelines. Patients with ST-segment elevation were excluded.</description>

      Blood samples (serum) were collected at presentation and after 6 hours. After collection,
      serum was centrifuged immediately and stored at -80°C until analysis.

      The laboratory staff responsible for measurements was blinded to patient data.
