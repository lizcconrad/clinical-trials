  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-centre study that will be looking at two groups of males and
      females over the course of their operative treatment for cerebral palsy (CP) scoliosis and
      the years following that treatment. The first group the study will be looking at is those
      individuals who undergo surgery for CP Scoliosis. The second group will be those individuals
      who do not undergo surgical treatment for CP Scoliosis, either because the family declines
      surgery or surgery is not recommended during the course of study participation.
