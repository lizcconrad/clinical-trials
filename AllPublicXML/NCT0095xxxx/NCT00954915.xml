  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether teplizumab is safe when administered
      subcutaneously (by needle under the skin) in subjects with psoriasis. The study will also
      evaluate how long teplizumab stays in the blood and how long it takes for it to leave the
      body, what is the highest dose that can safely be given, and whether it improves psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypotheses that therapeutic modulation of T-cell function by
      teplizumab is well tolerated in subjects with moderate or more severe psoriasis, and that
      this treatment ameliorates the immunopathology of psoriasis. This study will evaluate the
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of subcutaneous (SC) administration
      for 6 days. Once the SC maximum tolerated dose is identified, this dose will be administered
      to a cohort of subject by intravenous for comparison of PK and PD.

    <time_frame>Day 0, 14, 28, 63 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>The LS-PGA score is determined by estimating the extent of body surface area involved by psoriasis and rating plaque qualities (elevation, erythema, scaling) averaged over the entire body. LS-PGA score is then determined using available software. LS-PGA ranks involvement on an 8 point scale from clear, almost clear, mild, mild to moderate, moderate, moderate to severe, severe, and very severe. Participants who have an improvement of one or more steps in the LS-PGA will be considered to have met the primary criteria for a clinical response.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0, 14, 28, 63 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body-surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of plaque scale, erythema, and plaque induration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of 0 for no psoriasis to a maximum of 72 for severe disease.</description>

    <description>The PGA rates the subject's psoriasis relative to baseline as 1 (100% clearing), 2 (excellent: 75% through 99% clearing with striking improvement), 3 (good: 50% through 74% clearing with moderate improvement), 4 (fair: 25% through 49% clearing with slight improvement), 5 (poor: 0% through 24% clearing with little or no change), or 6 (worsening). Involvement of body-surface area, induration, scaling, and erythema are taken into account.</description>

        <description>The PGA rates the subject’s psoriasis relative to baseline as 1 (100% clearing), 2 (excellent: 75% through 99% clearing with striking improvement), 3 (good: 50% through 74% clearing with moderate improvement), 4 (fair: 25% through 49% clearing with slight improvement), 5 (poor: 0% through 24% clearing with little or no change), or 6 (worsening). Involvement of body-surface area, induration, scaling, and erythema are taken into account.</description>
