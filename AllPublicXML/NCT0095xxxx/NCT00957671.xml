  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifteen to twenty percent of adults who suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that requires
      hospitalization and rehabilitation have been found to have growth hormone (GH) deficiency by
      GH stimulation testing. Moreover, abnormalities have also been established for the cortisol
      and thyroid axis. The hypothesis of this proposal is that hormone replacement in TBI patients
      with documented abnormalities in the GH, thyroid, or cortisol axis will improve muscle
      function, body composition, aerobic capacity (GH) and tests of neuropsychologic function (GH,
      thyroid, cortisol).

    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to screen and detect evidence of pituitary hormone deficiency in
      adults following traumatic brain injury. Growth hormone deficiency will be replaced for a
      period of one year. Subject will not be screened until at least one year following brain
      injury to allow for natural recovery of hormone function.

    <measure>Neuropsychological Function as Measured by Processing Speed Index at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Processing Speed Index is a subcategory of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III). Processing speed refers to the speed of cognitive processes and response output.
This index is comprised of performances on two separate tests of visuomotor speed of information processing ability. On one test (Coding) participants refer to a key on top of a page to translate non-verbal symbols to an alpha-numeric digit. The participants then fill in boxes with the correct symbol assigned to a particular number. On the other test (Symbol Search) participants are asked to visually scan and mark items that are identical to one of two targets. If neither target is shown in the array the participant must mark out the work &quot;NO&quot;. Total correct responses for both task within 120 seconds are recorded.
Ranges are 0 (lowest) to 150 (highest) with 100 being the normal average. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Letter Fluency is a condition measured as part of the subcategory, Verbal Fluency, in the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Subjects are asked to name as many words as they can starting with a specified letter for 60 seconds. The words can not be names, places, numbers or grammatical variants of previous answers. Repeated answers are not scored as a correct response. There are 3 trials, with 3 different letters. The total number of correct responses is totaled for all 3 trials and a Letter Fluency Score is given. A higher score is considered better. There is no set range as the score depends on how many correct words the subject relays in the given time period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 21 and older.

          -  Documented moderate to severe traumatic brain injury at least one year post injury.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The only absolute exclusionary medication will be an anticoagulant (Coumadin) because
             of the risk of bleeding during the possible muscle biopsy procedure and daily
             injections of rhGH in the GH arm of the study.

          -  Any subject with a history of hepatitis or a 3-fold elevation of liver function tests
             (Alk phos, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)). We are
             uncertain of the effects of hormone replacement such as rhGH on the liver, so we will
             exclude any subjects with hepatitis. This exclusion applies only to subjects who would
             be enrolled in the GH arm of the study.

          -  Subjects who are deficient in cortisol or thyroid at screening will be excluded until
             hormone abnormalities have been corrected.

          -  Subjects with chronic pain who are being managed with narcotics will be excluded as
             the effects of central nervous system depressants may interfere with study test
             results.

        <title>Neuropsychological Function as Measured by Processing Speed Index at Baseline</title>
        <description>Processing Speed Index is a subcategory of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III). Processing speed refers to the speed of cognitive processes and response output.
This index is comprised of performances on two separate tests of visuomotor speed of information processing ability. On one test (Coding) participants refer to a key on top of a page to translate non-verbal symbols to an alpha-numeric digit. The participants then fill in boxes with the correct symbol assigned to a particular number. On the other test (Symbol Search) participants are asked to visually scan and mark items that are identical to one of two targets. If neither target is shown in the array the participant must mark out the work &quot;NO&quot;. Total correct responses for both task within 120 seconds are recorded.
Ranges are 0 (lowest) to 150 (highest) with 100 being the normal average. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

          <description>Processing Speed Index is a subcategory of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III). Processing speed refers to the speed of cognitive processes and response output.
This index is comprised of performances on two separate tests of visuomotor speed of information processing ability. On one test (Coding) participants refer to a key on top of a page to translate non-verbal symbols to an alpha-numeric digit. The participants then fill in boxes with the correct symbol assigned to a particular number. On the other test (Symbol Search) participants are asked to visually scan and mark items that are identical to one of two targets. If neither target is shown in the array the participant must mark out the work &quot;NO&quot;. Total correct responses for both task within 120 seconds are recorded.
Ranges are 0 (lowest) to 150 (highest) with 100 being the normal average. A higher score indicates a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Neuropsychological Function as Measured by Letter Fluency at Baseline</title>
        <description>Letter Fluency is a condition measured as part of the subcategory, Verbal Fluency, in the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). Subjects are asked to name as many words as they can starting with a specified letter for 60 seconds. The words can not be names, places, numbers or grammatical variants of previous answers. Repeated answers are not scored as a correct response. There are 3 trials, with 3 different letters. The total number of correct responses is totaled for all 3 trials and a Letter Fluency Score is given. A higher score is considered better. There is no set range as the score depends on how many correct words the subject relays in the given time period.</description>

        <title>Perceptual Fatigability as Measured by a Fatigue Rating Scale After One Year of Human Growth Hormone Therapy.</title>
        <description>Perceptual fatigue was measured before and directly after performing the muscle fatigue exercise protocol (40 continuous maximal force isokinetic knee extensions at 90 degress per second). Subjects were asked to rate their fatigue on a scale of 0-10 with 0 being no fatigue at all and 10 being extreme fatigue. Data is presented as change in fatigue rating induced by exercise testing.</description>
