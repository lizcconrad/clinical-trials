  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early identification of tuberculosis (TB) is of particular importance in HIV-infected
      individuals, as a delay of therapy can be devastating in those with compromised immune
      systems. Diagnosis of TB in HIV is difficult, however, because 24-61% of HIV co-infected
      individuals with pulmonary TB have negative TB test results. In addition, conventional
      testing can take 6 weeks or longer and may not be available at all in many settings. This
      study is being conducted to see whether some new tests for identifying TB and for identifying
      resistance to TB drugs are at least as accurate as the current testing methods when used on
      HIV-infected individuals. The study will also assess whether the new tests can provide
      accurate results faster than the current methods.

      Early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is of particular importance in HIV-infected individuals,
      as a delay of therapy can be devastating in those with compromised immune systems. Diagnosis
      of TB in HIV can be a particular challenge, however, because 24-61% of HIV co-infected
      individuals with pulmonary TB are smear-negative. Conventional solid media-based culture can
      take 6 weeks or longer for mycobacterial growth, and may not be available at all in many
      settings. The purpose of this study is to determine whether new tests for identifying TB and
      resistance to TB drugs are as effective as current tests and if these new tests can provide
      accurate results faster than the current method of testing for TB and drug resistance.

      This trial will enroll HIV-infected individuals who are suspected to be co-infected with TB.
      Participants may be in this trial for up to nine months, depending on their test results.
      During the study, participants will provide one or two sputum samples, have a chest x-ray,
      and may have blood collected.
