  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main study is a single arm, open-label, prospective study to assess antiretroviral
      activity and tolerability of etravirine (TMC-125) 400 mg once daily, given with fixed-dose
      tenofovir/emtricitabine, in treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected men and women. There are also a
      genital secretions pharmacokinetic (PK) sub-study and a metabolic sub-study. The purpose of
      the genital secretions PK sub-study is to gain information about drug levels and HIV-1 RNA in
      genital secretions when subjects are taking etravirine. The purpose of the metabolic
      sub-study is to learn about the effects of etravirine on body composition, as well as lipid
      and glucose levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: There will be approximately 80 HIV-1-infected men and women aged 18 years or
      older who have taken less than or equal to 10 days of prior antiretroviral therapy and have
      never taken etravirine, dapivirine (TMC120), or rilpivirine (TMC 278) in the main study.
      There will be approximately 40 subjects who enroll in the main study that will be in the
      metabolic sub-study and approximately 20 subjects (10 pre-menopausal women and 10 men) who
      enroll in the main study that will be in the genital secretions PK sub-study.

      Procedures (methods): For the main study subjects will take etravirine 400 mg once daily
      orally with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) one tablet once daily. For the
      genital secretions PK sub-study, genital secretion samples will be self-collected throughout
      the study except for the week 4 study visit where women will have the cervicovaginal sample
      at time 0 and at 24 hours collected by study staff. For the metabolic sub-study, waist
      measurements and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be performed at entry,
      week 24, and week 96, and 2-3 teaspoons of blood to check lipids, insulin, and glucose will
      be taken at entry and weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96.

    <measure>The Antiretroviral Activity of Etravirine 400 mg Given Once Daily, With Fixed-dose Truvada Once Daily, Among Treatment-naïve HIV-1 Infected Adults as Measured by the Percentage of Participants With HIV RNA &lt; 50 Copies/mL at Week 24</measure>

    <description>Per-protocol, genotype testing was conducted at confirmation of virologic failure if the confirmatory HIV-1 RNA was above the laboratory-specified threshold of 500 copies/mL.

    <measure>Tolerability of Etravirine in HIV-1 Infected Adults Initiating Antiretroviral Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The safety/tolerability endpoint was defined as the first grade 3 or higher sign, symptom or laboratory abnormality that was at least one grade higher than baseline among participants ever exposed to etravirine (regardless of treatment status), or permanent discontinuation of etravirine due to any toxicity (regardless of grade). Modification of tenofovir/emtricitabine was not a safety/tolerability event.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of participants ever exposed to etravirine who remained event-free through Week 96, with a 95% CI using Greenwood's variance estimate and a log-log transformation. Time was handled as continuous (weeks from treatment start to event or censoring).</description>

        <title>The Antiretroviral Activity of Etravirine 400 mg Given Once Daily, With Fixed-dose Truvada Once Daily, Among Treatment-naïve HIV-1 Infected Adults as Measured by the Percentage of Participants With HIV RNA &lt; 50 Copies/mL at Week 24</title>
        <description>The primary study endpoint was the proportion of participants who achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml at Week 24 of study participation. The per-protocol primary analysis was conducted intention-to-treat, with missing evaluations counted as failures. Achievement of HIV-1 viral load below 50 copies/ml was defined as having HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/ml during the Week 24 analysis window (&gt;18 and &lt;30 weeks post-entry).</description>

        <population>Of 79 participants who initiated study medications, 74 had a Week 24 HIV-1 RNA measurement. The primary analysis was conducted intention-to-treat, with missing evaluations counted as failure.</population>

Modification of tenofovir/emtricitabine was not a safety/tolerability event.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the proportion of participants ever exposed to etravirine who remained event-free through Week 96, with a 95% CI using Greenwood’s variance estimate and a log-log transformation.

        <title>Change in Glucose Metabolism (Insulin Resistance), in a Subgroup of up to 40 Participants, From Baseline to Week 96 of Treatment With Etravirine and Fixed-dose Tenofovir/Emtricitabine</title>
        <description>Metabolic data analyses were conducted as-treated. Insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and was calculated as [fasting insulin (µU/mL) × fasting glucose (mmol/L)]/22.5. Changes from baseline to follow-up were calculated using the value closest to schedule and within the analysis window, and were quantified with the median and inter-quartile range.</description>

        <description>Population pharmacokinetics were calculated using sparse sampling. Plasma concentrations of etravirine measured in samples from participants who provided blood samples at multiple study visits, with variation in sampling times relative to dosing of etravirine used to cover the spectrum of the dosing schedule. Model simulations and fitting were performed with NONMEM ® 7.3. (ICON, plc) and model exploration was performed with Berkeley Madonna (Berkeley, CA, USA)</description>
