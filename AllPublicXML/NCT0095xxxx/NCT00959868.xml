    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open label, phase I dose escalation trial using a modified
      accelerated titration design. Patients with superficial bladder tumour (Ta or T1) or CIS and
      candidates for transurethral resection or muscle invasive disease (&gt;T2) and candidates for
      radical cystectomy will be enrolled.

      OGX-427 will be given neoadjuvantly over 8 days, followed by a transurethral resection (for
      superficial disease) or radical cystectomy (for muscle invasive disease).

      Baseline Hsp27 levels will be determined from pre-treatment cytological samples from bladder
      washings and tumour biopsies performed prior to therapy.

      Post-treatment PK and PD data will be determined from TUR (for Ta, T1 tumours) or radical
      cystectomy (for T2 tumours) specimens. A recommended phase II dose will be determined from
      the toxicity, tissue pK, and percentage of Hsp27 knockdown. Effects of treatment on Hsp27
      client protein levels and apoptotic index will also be evaluated.

      Evaluation during protocol treatment will take place to assess toxicity. Assessments will
      occur on various visits as per Evaluation Schedule. Adverse event evaluation based on NCI
      CTCAEv3.0. For quality of life assessment during treatment, the EORTC QLC-BLS24 will be used
      before first treatment (day 1) and prior to surgery (TURBT or radical cystectomy). The Day 1
      QOL assessment will serve as baseline.

      After removal from protocol treatment, all subjects will be followed for toxicity related to
      study drug for 30 days.

      After the study, subjects will be followed according to standard of care. Follow-up for
      tumour recurrence or superficial tumours will be assessed every three months by cystoscopic
      examination for two years, then every six months for the next two years, and then yearly
      thereafter.
