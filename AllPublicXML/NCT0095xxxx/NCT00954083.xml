    <textblock>
      Thirty two children age 2-6 years are recruited into the study and the randomization will be
      stratified for chronological age and symptom severity into 2 main groups, intervention and
      control. The intervention group will receive an additional target treatment of DIR/Floortime
      parent training intervention, while the control group will continue on their routine care for
      3 months.

      Hypothesis: Children in the intervention group show much improvement in climbing the
      developmental &quot;ladder&quot; and declining in the autistic behaviors.
