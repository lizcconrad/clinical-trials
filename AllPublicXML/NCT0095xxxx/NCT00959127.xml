      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced solid tumors will receive
      investigational study drug ARRY-438162 (MEK162).

      This study has 3 parts. In the first part, patients with advanced solid tumors will receive
      increasing doses of study drug in order to achieve the highest dose of the study drug
      possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Approximately 30 patients from the US
      will be enrolled in Part 1. (Active, not recruiting)

      In the second part of the study, patients with advanced or metastatic biliary cancer will
      receive the best dose of study drug determined from the first part of the study and will be
      followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating
      the cancer. Approximately 25 patients from the US will be enrolled in Part 2. (Active, not
      recruiting)

      In the third part of the study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) will receive
      the best dose of the study drug determined from the first part of the study and will be
      followed to see what side effects and effectiveness the study drug has, if any, in treating
      the cancer. Approximately 25 patients with KRAS mutation (Active, not recruiting) and 15
      patients with BRAF mutation (Active, not recruiting) from the US will be enrolled in Part 3.

        Key Inclusion Criteria (for Part 3):

          -  A histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma
             which is metastatic (measurable disease).

          -  Documented KRAS- or BRAF- tumor mutation.

          -  Previously treated with or unsuitable for treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU),
             oxaliplatin, irinotecan and, if available, bevacizumab.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Additional criteria exist.

        Key Exclusion Criteria (for Part 3):

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (if the patient has brain metastases and
             is on steroids, the steroid dose must have been stable for at least 30 days).

          -  History of central serous retinopathy, retinopathy visible at baseline that would be
             considered a risk factor for central serous retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion.

          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than a 2-year disease free
             interval at the time of enrollment; patients with adequately resected basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or stage A low
             grade prostate cancer may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis.
