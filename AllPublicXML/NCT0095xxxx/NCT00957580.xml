  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation trial of pimasertib (MSC1936369B) in
      blood and bone marrow cancers. The trial will be conducted in two parts:

      Part 1 (safety run-in period): Will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the study
      drug in subjects with advanced hematological malignancies.

      Part 2: Will assess the anti-leukemic activity of the study drug in older subjects with newly
      diagnosed poor prognosis acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who are not candidates for intensive
      chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The trial has been terminated due to an estimated low probability of clinical benefit based on
    limited anti-leukemic effects observed in safety run-in (Part 1)

    <description>The DLT was any toxicity that resulted in treatment delay for more than (&gt;) 2 weeks due to treatment-related adverse effects, or any Grade greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3 non-hematological toxicity excluding Grade 4 asymptomatic increases in liver function tests reversible within 7 days in subjects with liver involvement, and Grade 3 asymptomatic increases in liver function tests reversible within 7 days for subjects without liver involvement, Grade 3 vomiting unless encountered and persistent for more than 3 days despite adequate and optimal therapy, and Grade 3 diarrhea unless encountered and persistent for more than 3 days despite adequate and optimal anti-diarrhea therapy at any DL and judged to be possibly or probably related to the trial treatment by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor.</description>

    <description>The best overall response was to be reported as either of the following: (1) Morphologic complete remission (CR) = normalization of the peripheral blood absolute neutrophil count (PBANC) &gt;1.0x10^9 per liter (/L), platelets &gt;100x10^9 /L, bone marrow aspirate with less than or equal to (&lt;=) 5 percent (%) blasts, no blasts with Auer rods (AML only). (2) Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) = Same as CR without normalization of PBANC and platelet count. (3) Partial remission (PR) = normalization of PBANC &gt;1.0x10^9/L, platelets &gt;100x10^9/L, and at least a 50% decrease in the percentage of marrow aspirate blasts to 5-25%, or marrow blasts less than (&lt;) 5%. (4) Progressive disease (PD) = &gt;50% increase in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts. (5) Stable disease (SD) = subjects who failed to achieve CR, CRi or PR and without criteria for PD.</description>

                       documenting the diagnosis

                    -  At least one of the following unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities:
                       del(5q), -5, -7, del(7q), abn 3q, 9q, 11q, 20q, 21q, 17p, t(6;9), t(9;22) or
                       complex karyotypes (greater than or equal to 3 unrelated abnormalities)

                    -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 2

          3. Subjects have read and understood the Informed Consent Form and are willing and able
             to give informed consent. They fully understand requirements of the trial and are
             willing to comply with all trial visits and assessments

          4. Subjects and their partners must be willing to avoid pregnancy during the trial and
             until 1 month after the last trial drug administration. Subjects must therefore be
             willing to use adequate contraception as approved by the Investigator such as two
             barrier methods or one barrier method with spermicide or intrauterine device, 2 weeks
             before, during the trial and 1 month after. The use of hormonal contraceptives should
             be avoided due to a possible drug-drug interaction in female subjects of childbearing
             age

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Part 1 and Part 2:

          1. ECOG performance status 3 or greater

          4. Administration of any antineoplastic therapy within at least 2 weeks or 5 half lives

             permitted in inclusion criteria

          5. Participation in other clinical trials within at least 2 weeks of the first pimasertib
             dose

          7. Active and uncontrolled infection including but not limited to known infection with
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Subjects with
             an infection receiving treatment with antibiotics may be entered into the trial if
             they are afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 48 hours prior to trial entry

          8. Major surgery within two weeks prior to trial entry

          9. Liver function tests above the following limits at screening: total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x
             upper limit of normal (ULN) unless related to Gilbert's syndrome or hemolysis,
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 x ULN, or
             for subjects with liver involvement AST and/or ALT &gt;5 x ULN

         10. Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN and /or creatinine clearance &lt;30 milliliter per minute
             (mL/min) at screening

         11. International normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.5 x ULN unless on treatment with
             warfarin

         12. For female subjects: pregnant or breast-feeding

         13. History of difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic gastro-intestinal
             disease or conditions that may hamper compliance and/or absorption of the tested
             product

         14. Has significant cardiac conduction abnormalities and/or pacemaker

         15. Has retinal degenerative disease (heredity retinal degeneration or age-related macular
             degeneration), history of uveitis or history of retinal vein occlusion and/or any
             medically relevant abnormal findings at the initial ophthalmologic examination

         16. Subjects with solid tumors, for whom the Investigator has clinical suspicion of active
             disease at the time of enrolment. Subjects with adequately treated early stage
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or cervical
             intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) are eligible for this study

         17. Signs and symptoms suggestive of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or family
             members who suffer(ed) from such

         18. Other significant disease that in the Investigator's opinion would exclude the subject
             from the trial

         19. Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity
