    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus (FK506) is an immunosuppressive medication that promotes organ allograft survival.
      It has also been shown to enhance nerve regeneration and muscle reinnervation in animals but
      these properties have not previously been studied in patients. Moreover, currently there is
      no method in clinical use to speed the rate of recovery after nerve injury. The objective of
      this study is to explore the ability of tacrolimus to benefit the treatment of patients with
      peripheral nerve injury. To minimize the morbidity of tacrolimus therapy, its phase-specific
      effects on nerve regeneration and muscle reinnervation will be defined in the murine model to
      permit further limitation of the duration of therapy. The investigators hypothesize that
      treatment with tacrolimus after autogenous peripheral nerve reconstruction will accelerate
      nerve regeneration, reduce the period of denervation and improve muscle reinnervation and
      recovery in patients with peripheral nerve injury.

      There are 2 specific aims:

        1. Determine the safety and efficacy of tacrolimus following reconstructive nerve surgery
           in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized pilot clinical trial of patients with
           severe nerve injuries of the extremities;

        2. Correlate the quality of life outcome with assessment of functional recovery after
           surgical reconstruction of patients with severe peripheral nerve injuries of the
           extremities.
