      1. To establish a retrospective compilation of clinical, histopathological, treatment and
           follow-up (clinic pathological) data of previous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
           cases.

        2. To establish a prospective collection of clinic pathological information from NSCLC
           patients with corresponding blood and tissue samples

        3. To discover and validate molecular biomarkers of survival and treatment outcome in NSCLC

      One of the current difficulties in the management of lung cancer is the decision to treat and
      the type of treatment to select. Thus there is a need for additional prognostic (indicative
      of disease aggressiveness) and predictive (indicative of likely response to treatment)
      markers for lung cancer. To conduct a successful prognostic and predictive marker program,
      several factors are required, including: a comprehensive database linking clinical,
      histopathological, treatment and outcome characteristics of each case, a collection of
      samples linked to the database that is suitable for the testing of candidate markers, and a
      multi-disciplinary, interdepartmental level of expertise in the management of lung cancer.

      Objective 1:

      A review of the case records will be conducted to extract clinical, treatment and follow-up
      data

      Objective 2:

      Patients aged 21 years or more with newly diagnosed, untreated non-small cell lung cancer
      shall be approached for consent. Patients will be identified through the pathology records,
      and from the study investigators' clinic. After subject consent, baseline characteristics
      will be obtained. Follow up data on therapies received and toxicities encountered will be
      obtained. Tumor samples will be obtained only from patients with NSCLC undergoing surgery as
      part of routine clinical care. The surgical specimen will be sent to Pathology to verify the
      adequacy of the diagnostic sample as per usual practice. Blood will be collected at the
      baseline (or prior to any anti-cancer treatment) and will be sampled again at the time of
      relapse or disease progression. Collection will entail drawing 7ml blood into a Vacutainer
      CPT tube (Becton Dickinson, USA), centrifugation, extraction of a separated layer of
      mononuclear cells (MNC), labeling followed by storage below -80oC. The frequency of blood
      drawn will be about 1-5 times (7-35mls total). The number of times depends on whether the
      lung cancer relapses and in the advanced stage, how often the lung cancer relapses after
      treatment. DNA and RNA will be extracted by CSIS and stored in freezer space there. Stored
      samples will be used for investigation of prognostic and predictive markers of outcome and
      for discovery of novel molecular alterations

      Objective 3:

      Biomarker analysis of tumor and blood. Blood will be enriched for circulating tumor cells
      (CTC) using previously optimized methods (11) and DNA will be extracted from CTC and tumor
      using the Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinatti, OH). DNA will be extracted from
      tumor, CTC and mononucleated cells and tested for somatic lung mutations by sequencing (2).
      Germline DNA will be analysed for genes linked to genetic risk for NSCLC and, for treatment
      toxicities, for genes related to NSCLC chemotherapy metabolic pathways.

      Tissue microarray (TMA) is a high-throughput method of analysing large numbers of
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor at a minimal cost and effort. To analyse the
      expression of proteins of putative relevance to EGFR function, cell proliferation,
      angiogenesis, apoptosis, metastasis, and hormonal, TMA will be utilised. PTEN and C/EBPa will
      also be analysed.

        The investigators for this protocol are clinicians and scientists in the departments of
        Cardiac/Thoracic and Vascular Surgery, Haematology and Oncology, Pathology, Radiation
        Oncology, Respiratory Medicine, and the Cancer Sciences Institute of Singapore (CSIS) from
        NUH, and NUS with major roles in their departments in the clinical management and/or
        research of lung cancer. Each will be providing access to clinical information and
        assisting in the collection and processing of samples, according to their resources and
        expertise.
