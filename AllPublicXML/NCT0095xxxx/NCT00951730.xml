  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Down syndrome are at increased risk of sleep apnea, not only from obstruction of
      the upper airway, but also of central origin. According to published data, sleep apnea may
      occur in at least 40% of children and adults with Down syndrome. Consequences of these sleep
      apnea are numerous : failure to thrive, cognitive decline, high blood pressure, heart
      disease, accident due to day sleepiness, fatigue. This condition is treatable in people with
      Down syndrome, as it is in ordinary people.

      Diagnosis of sleep apnea in people with Down syndrome is therefore a major concern. In
      addition, data regarding age of apparition of this complication are missing, making repeated
      screening necessary.

      Polysomnography is the method of choice for the diagnosis of sleep apnea. Unfortunately, it
      is time consuming and sleep departments are heavily busy.

      The main objective of our study is to evaluate an easier screening strategy combining
      questionnaire and overnight recording of few data, compared to polysomnography.

      We hope our strategy will permit regular screening for people with Down syndrome, helping us
      to draw guidelines for the survey of sleep apnea in this population.
