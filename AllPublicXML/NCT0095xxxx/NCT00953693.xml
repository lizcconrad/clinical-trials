  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are adult cells that have been genetically
      reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state by being forced to express genes and
      factors important for maintaining the defining properties of embryonic stem cells. The
      reprogramming of adult cells into embryonic stem (ES) cells enables the generation of
      patient-specific stem cells and thus has enormous potential for the treatment and analysis of
      degenerative diseases. In this project the investigators are going to induce pluripotent stem
      cells from cell cultures from skin biopsies of patients. The iPS cells will be developed for
      modeling diseases and drug discovery as well as basic research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      iPS cells are typically derived by transfection of certain stem cell-associated genes into
      non-pluripotent cells, such as adult fibroblasts. Transfection is typically achieved through
      viral vectors, such as retroviruses. Transfected genes include the master transcriptional
      regulators Oct-3/4 (Pouf51) and Sox2, although to enhance the efficiency of induction some
      other genes e.g. Klf4, c-Myc. In this study after separation the fibroblasts from patient`s
      skin biopsy, the cells are transfected with 4 Yamanaka factors (human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4,
      c-Myc) after 3-4 weeks, transfected cells are isolated through morphological selection.
