  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analyze in children and adults, risk factors in the onset of the APA. The main hypothesis
      focuses on the use of anti-inflammatory in the context of pharyngitis or sore throat before
      the symptoms of ABS. Secondary objectives:

        1. - Analyze the implementation of a rapid diagnostic test and its result on the occurrence
           of an ABS

        2. - Measure the frequency of prescription and describe the reasons for not prescribing an
           antibiotic for patients who consulted for a sore throat and having developed a PLA

        3. - Describe the microbial flora could puncture of patients hospitalized for APA

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  clinical existence of a PLA (phlegmon), validated by a senior ENT, usually (but not
             necessarily) following a request by an emergency. The visible appearance to the merits
             throat must justify puncture. Cases will be included whether or not they had consulted
             for a &quot;sore throat&quot; in the 10 days preceding the date of diagnosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Neoplastic disease of the throat, scalable Hematologic with tonsillar localization
