    <measure>Time to Clinical Resolution (Kaplan-Meier Estimate)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clinical resolution was defined as the time in hours from initiation of study treatment until normalization of at least 4 of the 5 signs within the respective normalization criteria, maintained for at least 24-hours. Time to clinical resolution was summarized by treatment group using the method of Kaplan-Meier. For subjects who did not experience clinical resolution, values were censored at the date of their last non-missing assessment of clinical resolution during the study (whether this assessment occurred as an inpatient or as an outpatient).</description>

    <measure>Change (Reduction) in Influenza Virus Titer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24, 48, 108 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The reduction in viral shedding was assessed as the change from baseline in log10 tissue culture infective dose50 (TCID50/mL) and RT-PCR and was summarized for each treatment group and study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Alleviation of Clinical Symptoms of Influenza</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to alleviation of clinical symptoms of influenza was measured as the time from the first dose of study drug through the time period in which all 7 symptoms of influenza (cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, myalgia [aches and pains], headache, feverishness, and fatigue) were absent or rated as no greater than mild for at least 24 hours. Time to alleviation of symptoms was estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Subjects who did not have resolution of any individual clinical sign were censored at the time of their last non-missing assessment of that sign.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of Fever (Kaplan-Meier Estimate)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to resolution of fever was measured as the time from initiation of study treatment until resolution of fever, maintained for at least 24 hours; temperature measurements taken less than 4 hours after antipyretic use were treated as missing values.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resumption of Usual Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to resumption of usual activities was determined from the visual analog scale (scale ranged from 0 to 10 where 0 indicated subject was unable to perform usual activities at all and 10 indicated subject was able to perform all usual activities fully). Time to resumption of usual activities was summarized by treatment group using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With ICU Admission</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of All ICU Admissions (Kaplan-Meier Estimate)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of postbaseline ICU admission was defined as the total number of days in the ICU for those subjects who had a post-baseline admission to the ICU. Only days starting after the initial postbaseline admission were included. If a subject's stay in the ICU was ongoing, the duration was censored at the last study visit. Subjects who did not have a postbaseline admission had a duration of 0.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Hospital Discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to hospital discharge, defined as the number of days from initiation of study treatment until the subject was discharged from the hospital, was summarized by treatment group using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Subjects who were not discharged from the hospital were censored at their last study visit.</description>

                  Sponsor-approved test kit), or positive test (using other methodology) for
                  influenza A and/or B virus antigen or RNA performed in a clinical laboratory at

                  A or B infection in the current influenza season by a) the institution's local
                  laboratory, or b) the local public health system, or c) the national public
                  health system, or d) a laboratory of a recognized multinational influenza
                  surveillance scheme such as the European Influenza Surveillance Network (EISN);

        <description>Time to clinical resolution was defined as the time in hours from initiation of study treatment until normalization of at least 4 of the 5 signs within the respective normalization criteria, maintained for at least 24-hours. Time to clinical resolution was summarized by treatment group using the method of Kaplan-Meier. For subjects who did not experience clinical resolution, values were censored at the date of their last non-missing assessment of clinical resolution during the study (whether this assessment occurred as an inpatient or as an outpatient).</description>
