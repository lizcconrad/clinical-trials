  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to test a novel rehabilitation device for subacute stroke hemiplegic upper
      limbs based on state-of-the-art non invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) robotic
      rehabilitation in a clinical setting. The investigators aim to prove the clinical efficacy
      and safety of BCI therapy over traditional rehabilitation methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed rehabilitation device is the first neuro-rehabilitation system which combines
      non-invasive BCI and robotic rehabilitation for the paralysed stroke upper extremity within 6
      months of stroke.Spontaneous recovery after stroke takes place over the first 6-12 months
      after stroke. The first 3-6 months are the most crucial periods as this is the period of
      maximal neurological recovery and neuroplasticity. Differential rates of recovery occur for
      various types of impairments post-stroke. In general, motor functions (mobility, walking,
      upper limb function, activities of daily living (ADL)) recover faster than cognitive or
      language impairments which may recover over 12 months. A number of approaches to stroke
      injury rehabilitation have been introduced to facilitate intrinsic recovery or aid adaptive
      compensation for stroke-related impairments. Generally for rehabilitative training to be
      effective, it must be commenced as early as possible after stroke. Current research proves
      that rehabilitation using traditional neuro-facilitation approaches is effective in improving
      neurological and functional recovery and is superior to no treatment or nursing care alone.
      Rehabilitated patients have shorter total hospitalization stays, lower complication rates,
      earlier and higher rates of discharge home than patients who do not receive rehabilitation.
      In addition, rehabilitation involving a multidisciplinary team approach led by rehabilitation
      physician or specialist result in better functional outcomes compared to acute general
      ward-based therapies. In order for rehabilitation to be effective in modifying cortical
      neuroplasticity, it must be targeted at the specific stroke impairment, task specific,
      exercise must be repetitive and intensive, goal directed and command the attention of the
      stroke patient. Some of the components of rehabilitation include physical therapy, gait and
      balance training, aerobic conditioning, functional Activities of Daily Living (ADL) training,
      physical modalities to treat pain, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) or Neuro-Muscular
      Electrical Stimulation (NMES). Other methods include specific treatments to address
      complications of rehabilitation such as spasticity, ataxia, contractures and bladder or bowel
      incontinence. Often, one-to-one and highly labour-intensive and expensive therapies with
      close hand-over-hand treatments are required. Limitations of current physiotherapy and
      occupational therapy techniques include the following:(1) Difficulties in rehabilitation for
      the severely paralysed arm and hand which are often treated with passive modalities such as
      NMES, passive ROMs and other modalities. (2) Difficulties in achieving intensive
      rehabilitation and high repetitions in those with moderate to severe upper extremity
      paralysis either due to non participation or pain which is commoner in those with severe
      paralysis. (3)Problems in motivating and sustaining patient interest in repetitive
      exercises.(4)Therapy is often perceived to be boring and due to lack of immediate
      biofeedback. (I) Robot Aided Rehabilitation: MIT (USA) has developed a robot, named the
      MIT-MANUS, to aid therapy of stroke victims. Small clinical trials have reported that the
      robot significantly improved patients' recovery of arm motor movement and function with
      sustained gains several months after cessation of treatment. This system is being clinically
      used as a rehabilitation training tool in over 20 centres world-wide. Advantages of robot
      aided rehabilitation include the ability to document and store motion and force parameters,
      the ability to achieve thousands of repetitions per treatment session (100 times more than
      conventional treatment or FES) without causing tissue injury or pain, high intensity with low
      friction, attention training and increased biofeedback through the incorporation of
      interactive video games, which can simulate trajectories, mazes, ADL tasks such as preparing
      a meal and spatial task simulation such as going shopping. In addition, after the initial
      training period, supervision of the patient by the therapist can be reduced due to the
      sustainability of participation of the patient from the robot or BCI based Robotic
      Rehabilitation. Hence, productivity of the human therapist is increased by the robot. The
      robot thus acts as a high technology aid to the clinician and therapist. The system is also
      portable, giving rise to the possibility of tele-rehabilitation options with the performance
      and progress of the patient being monitored by the institution remotely. (II)BCI-based BCI
      based Robotic Rehabilitation:This non invasive device aims to use a novel approach in robotic
      training, which has not been employed in the therapeutic realm before.In the MIT-MANUS and
      related commercially available systems, there is no direct communication between the
      patient's mind or thinking processes or motor volitional thinking and the robotic system.
      Although some sensors are used to detect the patient's weak movement, it never knows when and
      how the patient wants to move. The robot arm to which the patient is tethered or constrained
      plans the trajectory of movement for the patient and reduces its active role as the patient
      recovers voluntary motion. In most times, the patient can only passively follow the
      predefined program, which may not fully explore the patient's motor initiatives and potential
      or attention processes.
