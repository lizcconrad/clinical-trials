  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to investigate the short-term efficacy and long-term prognosis of liver
      failure patients caused by hepatitis B after single transplantation with autologous marrow
      mesenchymal stem cells (MMSCs). Liver failure inpatients caused by hepatitis B were recruited
      and received the same medical treatments, among whom some patients underwent single
      transplantation with autologous MMSCs and other patients with matched age, gender and
      biochemical indexes [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin (ALB), total bilirubin (TBIL),
      prothrombin time (PT) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) ] were in control group. A
      total of 120 ml bone marrow were obtained from patients, diluted and separated. Then MMSCs
      suspension were slowly transfused into the liver through the proper hepatic artery by
      interventional procedures. The levels of ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD score of patients in
      translation group were compared with those in control group. In 3 ~ 48 months of follow-up,
      differences in long-term outcomes such as incidence of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) and
      mortality between two groups were compared.

      A total of 527 patients with chronic hepatitis B induced liver failure were recruited from
      May 2005 to June 2009 from our department. The diagnoses of chronic hepatitis B and liver
      failure were based on previously described criteria. All patients received the same medical
      treatments (reducibility glutathione, glycyrrhizin, ademetionine, polyene
      phosphatidylcholine, alprostadil, and human serum albumin). Informed consent was obtained
      before study. Among these patients, 53 received transplantation with autologous MMSCs. The
      day of surgery served as the first day of observation. And 105 patients with matched age,
      gender and some biochemical indexes (ALT, ALB, TBIL, PT and MELD ) were served as controls.
