    <description>Panitumumab will be administered as a 60 minute ± 15 minutes IV infusion, just prior to administration of chemotherapy at a dose of 6 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle. A cycle of Panitumumab is defined as 14 days.
Irinotecan chemotherapy (180 mg/m2 in 90 min on day 1 of each cycle) will be administered after the administration of Panitumumab.
Each treatment cycle will have a duration of 14 days.</description>

             informed consent and/or comply with the study procedures.

          -  Any investigational agent within 30 days before initiation of the treatment.

          -  Subject who is pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Surgery (excluding diagnostic biopsy or central venous catheter placement) and/or
