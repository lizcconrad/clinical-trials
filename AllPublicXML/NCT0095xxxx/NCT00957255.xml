    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, multi-center, controlled study for patients undergoing open rotator
      cuff repair. Patients are stratified based on tear size to one of three groups. Each group is
      then randomized 1:1 to either repair with OrthoADAPT or repair without OrthoADAPT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18-70

          -  MRI confirmed full thickness or high grade partial thickness rotator cuff tear equal
             or more than 1 cm and involving the supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tendons

          -  Tear is repairable by surgery using protocol prescribed fixation procedure

          -  Patient is able to sign and IRB approved study informed consent

          -  Patient is willing and able to return for follow-up appointments and study related
             procedures

          -  Patient is willing to comply with prescribed physical therapy regimen

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergency, poly trauma patients

          -  Prior same shoulder surgery including rotator cuff repair except prior subacromial
             decompression or distal clavicle resection

          -  Shoulder pathology requiring concomitant procedures during the rotator cuff repair
             including Labral repair, anterior or posterior stabilization, and/or capsular
             plication or shift

          -  Cervical spine disease

          -  Diabetics

          -  Rotator cuff tear cannot be repaired by primary surgical means including superiorly
             migrated humeral head, retracted rotator cuff that cannot be mobilized to humeral
             head, end stage tears, rotator cuff tissue cannot retain sutures, any comorbidities
             that would directly or indirectly affect the reparability of the cuff

          -  Patients with grade 3 or 4 glenohumeral arthritis

          -  Patients with systemic collage disease

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to equine derived materials

          -  Active or latent infection
