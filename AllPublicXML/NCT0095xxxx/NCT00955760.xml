    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:

      • Assess the effects of poly-specific cytochrome P450 and drug-transporter induction by
      repeated dose Rifampicin (600 mg/day) co-administration on the single-dose pharmacokinetics
      of Neramexane.

      Secondary Objectives:

      • To assess safety and tolerability of Neramexane single dose treatment alone and
      co-administration of a Neramexane single dose with a Rifampicin repeated dose treatment.
