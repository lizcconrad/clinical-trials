    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety of MBL-HCV1 in
      healthy adult volunteers. Eligible volunteers will be admitted to a phase 1 unit for study
      infusion. A single dose of human monoclonal antibody will be administered. The study duration
      is 56 days. During this time, safety will be assessed via physical examinations, laboratory
      testing, concomitant medication usage and review of treatment emergent adverse events should
      they occur. Pharmacokinetics will be derived from analysis of blood samples obtained during
      the 56 day study.

      This is a phase I, open-label, dose escalation study in healthy adult volunteers. Eligible
      volunteers will be admitted to a phase I unit for study infusion and be discharged after
      collection of a 24 hour post infusion sample. Thirty subjects are anticipated to be enrolled.
      There will be five cohorts of 6 subjects each. A single dose of human monoclonal antibody
      MBL-HCV1 will be administered on Day 0 and subjects will be followed for 56 days. Dose
      escalation to the next cohort will occur after review of safety data by the principal
      investigator, sponsor and an independent safety monitor through day 10 for all subjects in a
      cohort. Assessment of safety will be determined from vital sign measurements, physical
      examinations, hematology, chemistry and urinalysis laboratory testing, electrocardiograms,
      use of concomitant medications and review of treatment-emergent adverse events should they
      occur. Subjects will be evaluated at study visits on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14+/-1, 28+/-3 and
      56+/-7. Blood samples and urinalysis for safety analyses will be drawn during screening and
      on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 28+/-3. Blood samples for Pharmacokinetic analysis will be drawn on
      days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14+/-1, 28+/-3 and 56+/-7. Blood samples for human anti-human antibody
      detection will be drawn on days 0, 14+/-1 and 56+/-7.
