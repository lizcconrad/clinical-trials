    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine in women the risk/benefit profile and
      non-inferiority of a topical 5% Minoxidil foam formulation applied once daily for the
      treatment of androgenetic alopecia in comparison to 2% MTS used twice daily, using objective
      and subjective efficacy measures and safety assessments for a study period of 24 weeks.
