  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, randomized, active comparator controlled study,
      comparing the effects of vitamin D replacement using oral ergocalciferol versus paricalcitol
      on parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD and vitamin D
      deficiency or insufficiency. The purpose of this study is to determine which of these two
      approaches is more successful.

      This study will enroll chronic kidney disease patients, stage 3 and 4, who have low serum
      vitamin D levels as defined by K DOQI Guidelines. Patients will be randomized to receive oral
      daily ergocalciferol or paricalcitol. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled, 40 in the
      cholecalciferol group and 40 in the paricalcitol group. Outcomes will be assessed as
      proportion of patients achieving pre-defined changes from baseline and as absolute changes
      from baseline values. Baseline values will be determined from averaging two consecutive
      measurements of the variables of interest prior to randomization.

    <description>Arm 1: 40 patients will be assigned to paricalcitol treatment group. Patients will be randomized once they meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. If patients are not on any vitamin D treatment when enrolled, they will have 2 screening visits before randomization. Screening visits will consist of a physical exam and lab tests to measure Vitamin D, calcium, iPTH, and safety profile. Patients on vitamin D treatment prior to study will have a minimum 4 week washout period before screening tests. Patients' Lean Body Mass and Aortic Blood Pressure and pulse wave velocity will be measured before dosing. Cardiovascular markers will be checked throughout the study. Patients will be monitored monthly after starting study treatment. Total treatment period: 4 months.</description>
