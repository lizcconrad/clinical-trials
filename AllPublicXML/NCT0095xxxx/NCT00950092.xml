      This is a multi center, non-randomized, prospective, open label, clinical trial evaluating
      the safety and efficacy of the nContact Surgical Numeris-AF Tethered Coagulation System when
      used to treat patients with persistent and longstanding persistent AF during concomitant
      cardiac surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the Numeris-AF Tethered
      Coagulation System with VisiTrax when used to treat persistent and longstanding persistent
      Atrial Fibrillation(AF)during concomitant cardiac surgery.
