    <textblock>
      Sensory input from the foot as well as all other body parts results in activation of sensory
      cortex.

      It is well known that the cortical body map is experienced-dependant and can rapidly change
      in response to changes in activity and sensory input from the periphery [10-12]. Increased
      activity and sensory input from the hand results in expansion of the cortical hand
      representation [13-15], while decreased sensory input, for instance by anaesthesia,
      amputation or nerve injury, results in shrinkage of the cortical hand representation [16-21].
      Due to the constant ongoing &quot;cortical competition&quot; between body parts the adjacent cortical
      areas expand and take over the silent area, deprived of sensory input.

      The investigators have recently described striking examples of such rapid cortical
      re-organisations induced by selective cutaneous anaesthesia of the forearm: application of
      EMLA cream to the volar aspect of the forearm results in improved sensory functions of the
      hand [18] linked to expansion of the hand representational area in sensory cortex . In
      analogy, EMLA application to the lower leg in healthy controls results in improved sensory
      functions in the sole of the foot linked to expansion of the foot representational area in
      sensory cortex.

      To test the hypothesis that EMLA application to the lower leg of diabetic patients will
      result in improved sensory functions in the sole of the foot as well as expansion of the foot
      representation in sensory cortex. The investigators hypothesize that repeated applications of
      EMLA will result in a long lasting sensibility improvement.

    <description>The study subjects are treated either by 50 g of a local anesthetic agent containing 2.5% Lidocaine and 2.5% Prilocaine (EMLA®, AstraZeneca - Södertälje, Sweden) or a placebo cream, applied to the lower leg. The cream is applied under occlusive bandage (plastic foam and a tube) for 1.5 hours circumferential to the lower leg 10-12 cm distally of the tibial tuberosity and the malleolus at ankle level. Administration of the treatment cream as well as removal after 1,5 hour and at sensory assessment after 1.5 hour and 24 hours, and interviewing the patient about subjective experience from the treatment are performed by an independent research nurse, not involved in the sensory assessment.</description>
