  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increase of longevity and of the number of men and women older than 60 years old is
      observed in most industrialized countries. Aging is a complex, multifactorial and continuous
      process involving physical and biological modifications such as a notably decrease in glucose
      tolerance and type 2 diabetes risk. Insulin sensitivity follow-up during aging is difficult
      mainly because of many confounding factors (environment, lifestyle).

      In 2006, SUVIMAX 2 study began, based on the monitoring of volunteers who participated in
      former SUVIMAX study (1994-2003). This study was a randomised trial which was designed to
      study the link between a low antioxidant intake and risk of cancer or ischemic heart disease.
      The subjects recently had a health check-up including complete information about their diet,
      physical and neurosensory status. Based on these data, a score was established to classify
      subjects according to their quality of aging (&quot;successful aging versus &quot;problematic aging&quot;)
      These volunteers, who undertook a 13-year follow-up (dietary and medical status), constitute
      the reference population to determine the mechanisms involved in the insulin resistance
      development in aging.

      The purpose of our research work is to determine whether the quality of aging could influence
      insulin sensitivity, by studying metabolic profile and change in gene expression (genes
      involved in glucose metabolism and metabolic senescence in muscle tissue) during aging.
