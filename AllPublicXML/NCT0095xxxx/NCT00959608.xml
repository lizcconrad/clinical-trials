      Think Health! A Personal Weight Management Program, or &quot;Â¡Vive Saludable! Un programa
      personalizado de control de peso&quot; aims to improve the treatment of obesity in adults in the
      general population, by conducting research with men and women recruited from primary care
      medical practices. The study has a particular focus on African Americans and Latino. The
      design is randomized trial of the effectiveness of two versions of a lifestyle weight loss
      program called delivered by primary care providers (PCP) and ancillary staff at 5 clinical
      practice sites to their own patients. The two versions of the lifestyle weight loss program
      are called Basic (minimal counseling provided by PCP every four months) and Basic Plus (same
      PCP counseling plus additional counseling by specially trained ancillary practice staff
      acting as Lifestyle Coaches (LC), monthly for the first 12 months and then every other month
      for up to 2 years).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Women and men

          2. Ages 18 to 70 years

          3. Body mass index &gt; 25 kg/m2 but &lt; 55 kg/m2 or who weigh &lt;400 pounds.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or lactation, since contraindicated for weight loss or affecting weight
             status

          2. Weight loss &gt; 10 pounds in the previous 3 months

          3. Current use of weight loss medications

          4. Use of medications known to result in significant weight gain (e.g., oral steroids or
             second generation anti-psychotics)

          5. Psychiatric disorders including untreated major depression, psychosis, bulimia
             nervosa, and substance abuse

          6. Active chemo- or radiation therapy

          7. Unstable renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease, including malignant arrhythmias

          8. Recent (past 3 months) history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart
             failure

          9. Participants age &lt; 18 will be excluded because we are only using adult practices and a
             different type of program would be needed for patients &lt; 18, and age &gt; 70 years will
             be excluded because our experience has been that a specially tailored program would be
             needed. As a design consideration, we wanted to decrease the heterogeneity of the
             program.

         10. Participants with a BMI &gt; 55 kg/m2 will be excluded because they are likely to require
             more extensive medical and behavioral care than can be provided in this study.

         11. More than 1 participant residing in the same household will be excluded to avoid
             contamination across the treatment conditions.

         12. Final exclusion criteria will be determined in collaboration with participating
             primary care providers
