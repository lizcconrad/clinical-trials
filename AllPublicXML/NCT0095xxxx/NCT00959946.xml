  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study in 2 parts assessing the following parameters of the combination of
      the study drug called bosutinib, and a drug called capecitabine: the safety, how well the
      subject's body handles the study drug, and preliminary anti-tumor activity as treatment for
      different types of cancers in part 1, and breast cancer only in part 2.

      In part 1, subjects will receive bosutinib and capecitabine daily at different dose levels of
      each drug in order to determine the highest tolerated dose of the combination study
      treatment. In part 2, subjects will receive bosutinib and capecitabine at this highest
      tolerated dose to see how well the study treatment works to treat breast cancer. In addition,
      genetic research testing (research analyses involving genes and gene products) will be
      performed on biological samples from subjects.

    <textblock>
      The study was prematurely discontinued following Part 1 evaluation, when the sponsor
      concluded that further translational biomarker analyses were needed to better define the
      breast tumor biomarkers that predict sensitivity to Src family kinase inhibitors. Thus the
      Sponsor made a determination to stop the study after Part 1 as communicated to investigators
      on 02Dec2010 . No subjects were enrolled into Part 2 of this study. The study was not
      terminated due to safety reasons.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) - Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1 Baseline up to Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD contour is defined as the dose combinations that achieve a toxicity rate (dose-limiting toxicity [DLT] rate) of less than (&lt;) 1/3. The observed toxicity rates for all the reporting groups (to which at least 1 cohort of participants was allocated) was estimated by calculating the proportion of DLTs observed in the first 21 days of treatment at those reporting groups. DLT includes grade (Gr) 3/4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or asthenia more than 3 days, Gr 4 hematologic toxicities, delayed study treatment administration due to dose toxicities by more than 3 weeks. Pre-defined criterion for MTD: if a higher dose level of capecitabine existed such that the same dose level of bosutinib had a DLT rate of &lt;1/3, no MTD was recommended for that capecitabine dose and if even the lowest dose of bosutinib achieved a toxicity rate of greater than (&gt;) 1/3, no MTD was recommended for that capecitabine dose level.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1 Baseline up to 28 days after last dose of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response - Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 6 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.0). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR is defined as the disappearance of all lesions (target and/or non target). PR are those with at least 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions (LDs) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LDs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response - Part 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 1 Baseline, every 6 weeks up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response based on investigator's disease status assessment. CR: disappearance of all lesions. PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of LDs of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum LDs. Progressive disease (PD): at least 20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of the recorded LDs since treatment start, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD taking as reference smallest sum of LD since treatment started.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 6 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of randomization plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for PD), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was &quot;Death&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Benefit Rate - Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 6 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Percent of participants with confirmed CR, PR or SD for at least 24 weeks on study according to RECIST. CR: disappearance of all lesions. PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of LDs of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum LDs. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage for PR nor sufficient increase for PD taking as reference smallest sum of LD since treatment started.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DR) - Part 2</measure>
    <time_frame>Part 2 Baseline, every 6 weeks up to 2 to 6 weeks after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>

        <title>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) - Part 1</title>
        <description>The MTD contour is defined as the dose combinations that achieve a toxicity rate (dose-limiting toxicity [DLT] rate) of less than (&lt;) 1/3. The observed toxicity rates for all the reporting groups (to which at least 1 cohort of participants was allocated) was estimated by calculating the proportion of DLTs observed in the first 21 days of treatment at those reporting groups. DLT includes grade (Gr) 3/4 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or asthenia more than 3 days, Gr 4 hematologic toxicities, delayed study treatment administration due to dose toxicities by more than 3 weeks. Pre-defined criterion for MTD: if a higher dose level of capecitabine existed such that the same dose level of bosutinib had a DLT rate of &lt;1/3, no MTD was recommended for that capecitabine dose and if even the lowest dose of bosutinib achieved a toxicity rate of greater than (&gt;) 1/3, no MTD was recommended for that capecitabine dose level.</description>

N (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

          <population>DLT evaluable population included all participants who received at least 14 doses of bosutinib and at least 10 doses of capecitabine in the first 21 days of treatment or had experienced a DLT within the first 21 days of treatment. N (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
