      The investigators hypothecate that pentoxyfilline increase significantly the liver
      regeneration and reduces significantly ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury in major liver
      using aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as marker of I/R
      injury.

    <textblock>
      Liver resection is for many patients with primary or secondary hepatic malignancies the only
      curative treatment option. Often, the complete clearance of the hepatic tumor disease can be
      only achieved by extended liver resections. Clinical studies have demonstrated that
      intra-operative blood loss is associated reduced outcome after major liver resection. An
      effective strategy to reduce blood loss is the occlusion of the portal triad (Pringle
      manoeuvre). On the other hand, inflow occlusion results in ischemia- and reperfusion (I/R)
      injury. Randomized trials have shown that ischemic preconditioning (10 min clamping, 10 min
      reperfusion) and intermittent clamping (15 min clamping, 5 min reperfusion) result in
      reduction of the I/R injury. Another potential strategy to reduce I/R injury is the
      pharmacological protection. One promising drug is pentoxyfilline (PTF) which has vasodilative
      and hemorheologic effects. Furthermore, PTF suppresses the TNF release. These effects may be
      also protective in major liver resection under inflow occlusion (Pringle manoeuvre)and
      increase the liver regeneration. Therefore, we designed a randomised prospective trial to
      investigate the effects of PTF treatment in liver resection under inflow occlusion. The
      specific aims of the research project are:The investigators hypothecate that pentoxyfilline
      increases significantly the liver regeneration and reduces significantly ischemia and
      reperfusion (I/R) injury in liver using aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) as marker of I/R injury.

Afterwards, a continuous intravenous infusion of PTX 1 mg/kg of body weight per hour will be started intra-operatively and will be continued for a total of 72 hours after surgery.</description>
