    <textblock>
      A single center, stratified, randomized and double-blind phase IV clinical trial is to be
      conducted in healthy elders (equal to or more than 61 years), adults (18-60 years),
      adolescents (12-17 years) and children (3-11 years) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of Sinovac's split-virion or whole-virion novel influenza A (H1N1) vaccines.
