    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to compare the effectiveness of
      surgical and conservative treatment in acute lateral ligament injury of ankle. The more
      detailed aims were to assess the function, physical activity level, re-injuries, objective
      stability and radiographic changes seen by magnetic resonance imaging in patients randomized
      to surgery or to functional treatment after a mean of 14 years follow-up.

    <description>All twenty-five patients underwent ligament repair, where the ruptured ends of the FTA (in 11 cases) or FTA and FC (in 14 cases) ligaments were rejoined by using absorbable sutures. A supine position and a tourniquet were used. A curvilinear skin incision of 5-10 cm was made; the retinacular structures were incised and the hematoma was removed.</description>

    <description>Twenty-six patients randomized to the functional treatment received a functional light-weight orthotic device (Air-Cast ankle brace, Summit, New Jersey) for 3 weeks. Full weight bearing was allowed. The ankle brace allowed dorsi- and plantarflexion but it restricted inversion and eversion of the ankle</description>

    <description>. The disrupted FTA or/and FC and superficial retinacular structures were repaired by using absorbable sutures. In case of avulsion from the bone, the ligament was reapproximated with the use of sutures that were passed through 2.0 millimeter drill-holes in the bone.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The inclusion criteria included positive stress radiographs (in all cases) and
             arthrography 15 (5 cases) proven fibulotalar anterior (FTA) and fibulocalcanear (FC)
             ligament injury.

          -  The positive findings for a lateral ligament injury included a clinically unstable
             ankle and a radiological talar tilt &gt;6 degrees or ADS &gt;5 mm compared with the
             uninjured opposite ankle.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria for the study were diabetes, inflammatory arthritis, previous
             severe trauma, pre-existing instability of joints.

          -  In addition, patients were excluded from our study if they had previously undergone
             surgery of the ankle region.
