    <description>Participants were treated with vaniprevir twice daily on days 1,2, and 3. On treatment Day 4 participants were treated once with vaniprevir; then core needle liver biopsies were to be collected at 6, 12 and 24 hours postdose to determine the AUC of vaniprevir. AUC is the integrated area under the curve for plasma concentration of vaniprevir over time.</description>

    <description>Participants were treated with vaniprevir twice daily on days 1,2, and 3. On treatment Day 4 participants were treated once with vaniprevir; then core needle liver biopsies were to be collected at 6, 12 and 24 hours postdose to determine the t-1/2 of vaniprevir.

        <description>Participants were treated with vaniprevir twice daily on days 1,2, and 3. On treatment Day 4 participants were treated once with vaniprevir; then core needle liver biopsies were to be collected at 6, 12 and 24 hours postdose to determine the AUC of vaniprevir. AUC is the integrated area under the curve for plasma concentration of vaniprevir over time.</description>
        <time_frame>6, 12 and 24 hours postdose on day 4 of each period (up to Day 148)</time_frame>
        <population>Since only a single liver sample timepoint at either 6 or 12 hours was obtained from each participant, and no 24 hour timepoint was collected from any participant due to the early termination of the study, the AUC (0-12 hrs) was not calculated</population>
