  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study of Iodine 131 Anti B1 Antibody for the treatment of
      1st or 2nd relapsed indolent B cell lymphomas or B cell lymphomas that have transformed to a
      more aggressive histology. The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the response
      rate. Secondary endpoints of the study is to determine the duration of response, time to
      progression, time-to-treatment failure, safety, and survival.

      Forty patients will receive therapy on this study at the 2 clinical sites. Patients will
      undergo 2 phases of the study. In the first phase, termed the &quot;dosimetric dose&quot;, patients
      will receive an infusion of unlabeled Anti B1 Antibody (450 mg) over 70 minutes (including a
      10 minute flush) immediately followed by a 30 minute infusion (including a 10 minute flush)
      of Anti B1 Antibody (35 mg) which has been trace-labeled with 5 mCi of Iodine 131. Whole body
      gamma camera scans will be obtained on 1) Day 0; 2) Day 2, 3, or 4; and 3) Day 6 or 7
      following the dosimetric dose. Using the dosimetric data from the 3 imaging timepoints, a
      patient-specific dose of Iodine 131 Anti B1 Antibody to deliver the desired total body dose
      of radiotherapy will be calculated. In the second phase, termed the &quot;radioimmunotherapeutic
      dose&quot;, patients will receive a 70 minute infusion (including a 10 minute flush) of unlabeled
      Anti B1 Antibody (450 mg) immediately followed by a 30 minute infusion (including a 10 minute
      flush) of 35 mg Anti B1 Antibody labeled with the patient-specific dose of Iodine 131 to
      deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy to patients with no hematologic risk factors. Patients
      who have platelet counts of 100,001-149,999 cells/mm3 will receive 65 cGy and patients who
      are obese will be dosed based upon 137% of their lean body mass (see Appendix A). Patients
      will be treated with either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or
      potassium iodide tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the Iodine
      131 Anti B1 Antibody and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of Iodine 131
      Anti B1 Antibody (i.e., therapeutic dose).

    <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>

             greater than 5 years must be carefully assessed at the time of study entry to rule out
             recurrent disease.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection.

          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Patients of child-bearing potential must
             undergo a serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry and radiolabeled
             antibody is not to be administered until a negative result is obtained. Males and
             females must agree to use effective contraception for 6 months following treatment.

          -  Patients with previous allergic reactions to iodine. This does not include reacting to
             IV iodine-containing contrast materials.

          -  Patients who were previously given any monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies of any
             non-human species for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. This includes
             engineered chimeric and humanized antibodies.

          -  Patients who previously received radioimmunotherapy.

          -  Patients with progressive disease within 1 year of irradiation arising in a field that
             has been previously irradiated with &gt;3500 cGy.

          -  Patients who are concurrently receiving either approved or non-approved (through
             another protocol) anti-cancer drugs or biologics.

          -  Patients who have received more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Prior therapy with
             radiation, immunosuppressants, or steroids are not counted as chemotherapy regimens.

        <description>An SAE is any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (ADE; at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious ADEs when based upon appropriate medical judgment. Relatedness was based on the Investigator's medical judgement.</description>

            <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had disease progression or had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104528) were followed for up to 10 years. Participants did not receive any study medication during the LTFU study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Infection</title>
        <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>
        <time_frame>Par. were evaluated until death/disease progression or 2 years in Study BEX104505. Par. who completed 2 years in BEX104505 were followed in study BEX104528 for up to 125 months. Data are included from both Study BEX104505 and Study BEX104528.</time_frame>
