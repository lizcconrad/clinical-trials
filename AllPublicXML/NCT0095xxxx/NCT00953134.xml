    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that periconceptional iron supplementation to married,
      nulliparous women in rural Bangladesh will significantly reduce anemia and improve hemoglobin
      concentrations before and during pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2007, the National Strategy for Anemia Prevention and Control in Bangladesh included
      adolescents and newly married women as target groups for future iron and folic acid (IFA)
      supplementation programs. This double-blinded RCT examined the effect of daily
      periconceptional IFA vs. folic acid (FA) on anemia and iron indictors before and during
      pregnancy among married, nulliparous women in rural Bangladesh. Biochemical indices were
      collected at baseline and either at 15 weeks gestation or after 9 months among non-pregnant
      women (NPW).
