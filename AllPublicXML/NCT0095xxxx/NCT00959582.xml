      This study will characterize FDG-PET (18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography) as
      an early response marker in recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer treated with
      platinum-based therapy.

    <description>Patients will receive standard-of-care therapy (carboplatin or cisplatin monotherapy, or a two-drug combination where one is platinum). FDG-PET/CT scans will be performed at baseline following enrollment, after Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy, and if patients are progression-free at the end of Cycle 6. Volumetric CT scans will be performed at baseline following enrollment, after Cycles 1 and 2 of chemotherapy, after Cycle 3 of chemotherapy (optional), and if patients are progression-free at the end of Cycle 6 and at 40 weeks after Cycle 1 dosing.</description>
