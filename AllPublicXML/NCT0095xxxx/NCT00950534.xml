  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate the improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
      levels after general practitioner (GP) initiation and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) with insulin glargine compared with their usual clinical practice.

      The secondary objective is to demonstrate the importance of GP initiation of insulin glargine
      for the treatment of T2DM.
