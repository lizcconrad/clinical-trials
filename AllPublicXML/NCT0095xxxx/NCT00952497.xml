  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety, and
      tolerability of telatinib when used in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine and
      cisplatin) as first-line therapy in subjects with advanced gastric cancer. The primary
      objective is to assess progression free survival (PFS) in subjects receiving telatinib in
      combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin). The secondary objectives are to
      assess overall survival, overall response rate, safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      biomarkers.

    <description>Subjects will receive: Chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin) and telatinib Capecitabine will be administered (1000 mg/m2) twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Cisplatin (80 mg/m2) will be given as a 1-3 hour infusion once every 3 weeks. Telatinib (3 tablets) will be administered orally, twice daily as a continuous administration. After a maximum of 6 cycles of cisplatin, subjects continue with capecitabine and telatinib or monotherapy with either study drug,depending on the toxicity experienced by the subject, until disease progression.</description>
