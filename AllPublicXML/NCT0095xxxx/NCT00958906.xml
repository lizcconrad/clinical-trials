      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravitreal infliximab is a safe and effective
      treatment for macular edema secondary to uveitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with uveitic macular edema will be treated with one injection of intravitreal
      infliximab (2.0mg/0.05ml) and followed for three months. Outcomes that be assessed include
      best-corrected visual acuity, macular thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography,
      and electroretinogram responses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Participant must understand and sign the protocol's informed consent document.

          3. Participants must have uveitic macular edema in one eye as defined by all of the
             following criteria:

               1. Presence of active intermediate uveitis or posterior uveitis.

               2. Macular edema defined as a central macular thickness of ≥ 250 μm on OCT.

               3. Uveitis must be noninfectious as determined by standard investigations used in
                  the diagnostic investigation of uveitis.

          4. Participant must have visual acuity between 20/40 and hand motions in the study eye.

          5. Participant must have a steady fixation in the study eye and media clear enough for
             good quality imaging.

          6. Female participants of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding,
             must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must practice an adequate method
             of birth control. Males able to father a child must agree to practice birth control.
             Acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal contraception (birth control
             pills, injected hormones or vaginal ring), intrauterine device, barrier methods with
             spermicide (diaphragm with spermicide, condom and spermicide) or surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation or vasectomy in a partner). If a
             participant is of childbearing potential, she must be willing to undergo monthly urine
             pregnancy tests. Both males and females must agree to use adequate birth control for
             three months after the intravitreal infliximab injection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is in another investigational study and actively receiving study therapy.

          2. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.

          3. Participant has uveitic macular edema (as defined above) in both eyes.

          4. Participant has multiple sclerosis or symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis.

          5. Participant has evidence of ocular disease other than uveitis in either eye that may
             confound the outcome of the study (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
             degeneration, vitreomacular traction, moderate/severe myopia, etc.).

          6. Participant is expected to need ocular surgery in the study eye during the course of
             the study.

          7. Participant has undergone ocular surgery or an intravitreal/periocular steroid
             injection in the study eye within the past 3 months.

          8. Participant has had a YAG laser capsulotomy or intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment in the
             study eye within the past 6 weeks.

          9. Participant has had a pars plana vitrectomy in the study eye.

         10. Participant is on ocular or systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens,
             retina, or optic nerve.

         11. Participant with a history of ocular herpes simplex virus infection in the study eye.

         12. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure and glycemic
             control).

         13. There are no criteria for inclusion/exclusion for the fellow eye. Only one eye can
             have macular edema in order for the potential participant to be considered for
             enrollment.
