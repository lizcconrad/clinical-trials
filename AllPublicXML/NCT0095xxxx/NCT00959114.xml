  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind, placebo controlled study of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 6-weeks
      treatment of ALV003 in patients with well-controlled celiac disease. Approximately 110 biopsy
      proven celiac disease patients will be randomized to treatment with ALV003 or placebo in a
      1:1 ratio. Patients will be required to have a pre-dose and a post-treatment intestinal
      biopsy, and also will be required to ingest a foodstuff that contains a specified amount of
      gluten during the active phase of the study along with the study treatment. Patients will
      return to the clinic weekly for the first two weeks, then every two weeks thereafter for
      safety visits. Patients will return to the clinic 28 days after completion of treatment for
      final safety and follow-up. Safety will be closely monitored throughout the study including
      laboratory parameters and clinical assessment of adverse events.
