  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are affected by an inflammatory condition
      of the bile ducts. Unfortunately, patients with PSC have a 10 to 15 percent lifetime risk of
      developing gallbladder and bile duct cancers. Gallbladder and bile duct cancers have a
      five-year survival of only 5 to 10 percent. Surgery to provide a cure must remove all cancer
      confined to one area.

      In order to increase survival rates there is a need to identify cancer and pre-cancer early.
      This has been difficult to do.

      Patients who have lab tests, positive imaging tests or obstructions will usually have a test
      called ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatogram) to take biopsies and enlarge bile
      ducts or opening bile ducts with stents. Patients usually have cells in the bile ducts
      removed and analyzed, but there are not studies to show how sensitive this may be to
      determine if the cells are cancer or pre-cancerous. A new scope with a system using light
      filters called Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) may help detect cancer and pre-cancer more often and
      at an earlier stage.
