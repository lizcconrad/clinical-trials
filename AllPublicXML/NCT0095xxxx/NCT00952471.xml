  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective redesign of order sets using different ways to frame the order and physician
      decision-making in a computerized provider order entry system could increase adherence to
      evidence-based care and reduce population-specific variance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Variance in ordering of care can be characterized as the lack of uniform use of specific
      treatments by clinicians for a given medical condition. Unwarranted variance in healthcare
      has been associated with prolonged length of stay, diminished health and increased cost.
      Practice variation in the management of asthma can be significant and few investigators have
      evaluated strategies to reduce this variation. We hypothesized that selective redesign of
      order sets using different ways to frame the order and physician decision-making in a
      computerized provider order entry system could increase adherence to evidence-based care and
      reduce population-specific variance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients admitted using an acute asthma exacerbation order set.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who did not have either an admission or discharge diagnosis of asthma
             exacerbation.

          -  In addition, patients admitted to the intensive care unit directly or transferred to
             the intensive care unit within 24-hours were excluded from analysis.

          -  Finally, patients were excluded from analysis if asthma was not the presenting
             problem.
