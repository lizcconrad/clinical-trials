      This study seeks to determine the burnout rate among minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons
      (MIGS) as well as to evaluate other personal, professional, and psychosocial factors
      associated with this condition.

      An anonymous electronic survey will be sent to the American Association of Gynecologic
      Laparoscopists (AAGL) members. The survey will contain items that will inquire about
      socioeconomic background, professional characteristic, and about physical and psychologic
