  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the effectiveness of CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor), enhanced by
      a diabetes management platform (DMP), collectively called enhanced CGM (eCGM), in the care of
      older patients with T1D. The DMP includes an automated data transfer from CGM,
      insulin-delivery devices, and activity tracker to a clinical decision support system (CDS)
      that provides dosing adjustment recommendations based on that data to the healthcare team. In
      addition, the DMP includes on-demand education for patients and caregivers, and an interface
      for communication between providers, patients, and their caregivers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is a major and often devastating complication of T1D in the elderly. CGM has
      been shown to reduce the risk for hypoglycemia in adults with T1D including some more
      functional patients over 65 years old. However, the Medicare population is heterogeneous and
      may have age-related clinical and functional impairments that can impact self-care. These
      patients will require additional targeted guidance and support to fully realize the potential
      benefits of CGM. To address these age-specific barriers which could limit the effective use
      of CGM, in our planned RCT (Specific Aim 1) the use of CGM will be coupled with the DMP
      (Diabetes Management Platform), a tablet-based technology platform ( termed enhanced CGM
      (eCGM)). The CGM, insulin delivery, and activity data uploaded from the DMP will be analyzed
      by the clinical decision support system (CDS), which will provide insulin dosing
      recommendations to the study physicians, who will then accept or reject changes in therapy.
      The use of the DMP is expected to help the less technologically proficient Medicare patients
      to derive benefit from CGM. Specific Aim 2 will involve extensive mixed methods research
      (including semi-structured interviews of patients and caregivers) directed at making an
      in-depth assessment of barriers to the use of diabetes technology in older adults. This
      investigation will provide the evidence-base for future improvements in both the technology
      and clinical approach to the training of older adults and their caregivers. Specific Aim 3
      will involve a cost-effectiveness analysis of the technology system (CGM with DMP = enhanced
      CGM [eCGM]) used in the trial as well as quality of life measures, providing a foundation for
      decision-making on coverage.

    <description>The intervention group will use eCGM (CGM with Diabetes Management Platform(DMP)) and an activity meter. The DMP will be pre-loaded with geriatric-specific education material, weblink to online education and surveys. The CGM, insulin delivery, and activity data uploaded from the DMP will be analyzed by the clinical decision support system (CDS), which will provide insulin dosing recommendations to the study physicians, who will then accept or reject changes in therapy. The DMP can also be configured to route the insulin regimen change approved by the study physician to the designated care providers of the patient. Blue-tooth unabled insulin pens will also provide additional data to verify if the patient is taking recommended insulin doses.</description>

    <description>Glucose (CGM and Bluetooth BG meter), insulin (pump or Bluetooth insulin pen) and activity data will be automatically uploaded via the subjects' tablet computers, and analyzed by the CDS. The CDS will, if indicated generate adjustable insulin dosing recommendations that will compensate for different insulin requirements following high vs low activity days. The recommendations of the CDS will be used by the clinical team in their therapeutic decision-making about insulin dosing adjustments at the scheduled study follow up visits and the remote visits between these in-person visits. In addition, study staff will provide recommendations regarding hypoglycemic warning symptoms, causes, and appropriateness of treatment.</description>
