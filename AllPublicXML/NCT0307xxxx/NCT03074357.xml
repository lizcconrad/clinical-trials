    <textblock>
      This biomarker study is a follow-up to CPLATFRM2201. The goal of CBASICHR0005 is to collect
      another urine sample, interval clinical information, and an optional DNA sample from as many
      of the original 80 patients as possible. This new information will transform the data
      obtained in PLATFRM2201 from a cross-section to a temporal profile, which will (a) further
      enable the identification of biomarkers predictive of faster progression, and (b) satisfy the
      FDA's recommendation to perform &quot;natural history studies&quot; in rare diseases.

        The study population will be males and females comprised of up to 80 Alport subjects who
        participated in CPLATFRM2201 study as well as up to 20 pediatric and adolescent healthy
        volunteers (including healthy siblings of Alport subjects) that have met all other
        eligibility criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        • Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
        requirements of the study and able to provide written informed consent (parent or legal
        guardian for pediatric and adolescent subjects), which must be obtained before any
        assessment is performed.

        Alport Subject-Specific Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in CPLATFRM2201

          -  Physically able to provide a single first-morning urine sample of at least 30 mL (one
             ounce). Alport patients who have initiated dialysis therapy since participation in
             CPLATFRM2201 are exempt from this criterion and may still participate in this study.

        Healthy Volunteer-Specific Inclusion Criteria:

        • Male and Female Volunteers (may include healthy siblings of Alport patients) aged 5 to 15
        years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Alport Subject-Specific Exclusion Criteria:

        • None

        Healthy Volunteer-Specific Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5
             halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local
             regulations, and for any other limitation of participation in an investigational trial
             based on local regulations.

          -  Known history of one of more of (a) hematuria (gross or microscopic), (b)audiological
             deficits, (c) fixed (non-orthostatic) proteinuria, or (d) reduced renal filtration
             function with serum creatinine (Cr) above the upper limit of the normal age-specific
             reference range, on at least 2 prior occasions (serum Cr need not be measured
             specifically for eligibility).

          -  Any other clinically significant underlying medical conditions as judged by the PI.
