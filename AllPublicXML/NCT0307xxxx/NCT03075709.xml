  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has substantial economic and human costs. To
      minimize these costs high quality guidelines have been developed. However, development of
      guidelines alone rarely results in changes to practice. One method of integrating guidelines
      into professional practice is the use of clinical pathways (CPWs).

      The investigators are working with local stakeholders to develop CPWs for COPD with the aims
      of improving quality of care and guideline adherence while reducing healthcare utilization.
      The CPWs will utilize several steps including: standardizing diagnostic training,
      implementing and unifying common components of chronic disease care, coordinating the
      provision of education and reconditioning programs, and ensuring disease specific care
      utilizes and delivers evidence-informed practices. In addition, the investigators have worked
      to identify evidence-informed strategies for the implementation of the CPWs. Efforts are
      underway to tailor these implementation strategies for the local context.

      The investigators will conduct a three-year quantitative health services research project
      using an interrupted time series (ITS) design in the form of a multiple baseline approach
      with control groups. The CPW will be implemented in two Saskatchewan health regions
      (experimental groups) and two health regions will act as controls (control groups). The
      experimental and control groups will each contain one urban and one rural health region.

      This project is expected to improve quality of life and reduce healthcare utilization. The
      project will also provide evidence on the effects of CPWs in both urban and rural settings.
      If the pathways are found effective the investigators will work with all stakeholders to
      implement similar CPWs for the remaining health regions in the province.

    <description>We are working with Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region (RQHR), a primarily urban health region, to develop and implement a clinical pathway (CPW). The CPW will improve care through the following steps: standardizing diagnostic, coordinating and unifying common components of chronic disease care, coordinating the provision of education and reconditioning programs, and ensuring disease specific care utilizes and delivers evidence-informed practices.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Experimental - CPW (Rural)</arm_group_label>
    <description>Following implementation in RQHR a rural health region will be chosen as an intervention site for a second CPW. The CPW will improve care through the following steps: standardizing diagnostic, coordinating and unifying common components of chronic disease care, coordinating the provision of education and reconditioning programs, and ensuring disease specific care utilizes and delivers evidence-informed practices.</description>

        The intervention will be implemented at the health region level and will therefore include
        all individuals diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) residing within
        a control or intervention health region.
