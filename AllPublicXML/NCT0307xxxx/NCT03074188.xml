  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are severe deficiency of database concerning the oral health status in both
      pre-dialysis and end stage renal disease in Egyptian population. Our aim in the present study
      is to assess the oral health of the chronic kidney disease patients to increase their
      awareness and minimize all the possible risk factors, to achieve a proper management for all
      oral problems.

      The study will be held in the Nephrology units at the Kasr Al-Ainy Cairo university hospital.
      The data collected through the questionnaire will be obtained through an interview between
      the investigator and the patient. Clinical examination will be performed for both oral (soft
      tissue) and dental (hard) tissue. For patients undergoing dialysis, examination will be
      performed before dialysis therapy.

      Selection bias: will be minimized by enrolling the participants in the study in a consecutive
      order of the entering the clinic.

      Non-respondent bias: will be minimized by explaining to the participants the aim of the study
      and their importance and role in the study.

      Incomplete records: will be excluded from statistical analysis with reporting the cause of
      not completing the record.

      Sample size estimation:

      Using a precision of 5, a design effect set at 1 with 90% CI (confidence interval), a total
      sample size of 250 pre-dialysis patients and 200 end stage renal disease patients will be
      sufficient. The sample size was calculated by Epi info software.

      The sample will be divided between two researchers; each researcher will have 50% of the
      whole sample to collect.
