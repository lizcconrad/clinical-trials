  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to investigate in patients of Alzheimer's disease in a prodromal state
      (early state of the disease) compared to healthy subjects whether neurofeedback training with
      functional MRI (fMRI) can improve cognitive ability. It is of interest if voluntary
      modulation of brain activation with real-time (rt) fMRI as a novel method affects cognitive
      ability, as well as functional and structural measures of the brain.

      Over the course of the study subjects will learn a real-world footpath. During neurofeedback
      training subjects are then asked to recall this footpath while simultaneously trying to
      modulate their own brain activation based on feedback. Feedback is given about the
      parahippocampal gyrus - a region of the brain associated with episodic and visuo-spatial
      memory, which is known to be affected early by Alzheimer's disease pathology.

      Before and after the training cognitive ability is assessed using neuropsychological tests
      mainly measuring numerous domains of memory.

      The investigators hypothesise that the training leads to an improvement of the trained
      cognitive domain, but also induces changes in brain structure and function.
