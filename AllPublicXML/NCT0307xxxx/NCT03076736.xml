  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To undertake a pilot study that will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of procedures
      to inform the design and delivery of a definitive RCT of SPA (which would assess the clinical
      and cost effectiveness of SPA for people with aphasia)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beyond language function, people with aphasia (PWA) report a range of health problems which
      negatively affect wellbeing, including reduced confidence and social isolation. These
      psychosocial outcomes of aphasia are not sufficiently met by healthcare services:
      improvements in language function do not appear to lead to improvements in wellbeing.
      National clinical guidelines for stroke reflect this observation and highlight the need for
      community integration and participation of people with aphasia. This research is about
      singing groups for people with aphasia (SPA) and is intended to address this need by focusing
      on the wellbeing and social participation needs of people with aphasia after stroke.

      The Investigators engagement activities and early development project provided strong impetus
      for the proposed study: people with aphasia repeatedly told the investigators that singing in
      groups may help the participants to reconnect with society, and that this will improve
      wellbeing.

      The investigators have planned a pilot study that will allow an assessment of the extent to
      which the study processes and the singing groups themselves are feasible to run and are
      acceptable to participants. The information from this work will help the investigators to
      decide whether to conduct a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) which would be a fair
      test of whether SPA can improve the lives of individuals with post stroke aphasia.

    <description>SPA is a community-based, 10 weekly singing group. Each SPA session comprises 30 minutes of settling in/wrap-up and departure, and 60 minutes of group singing. Sessions will be led by a community music leader, co-facilitated by a person with aphasia, and involve the group singing from a songbook. Musical accompaniment will be provided by the facilitator(s). Small percussion instruments will be available for participants, enabling involvement of those with limited singing ability. Intervention content integrates the Information-Motivation-Behavioural (IMB) skills model of health behaviour change to support individuals in developing the social skills and confidence needed to improve psychosocial outcomes. Participants will also receive the resource pack.</description>
