      This study is to test the effectiveness of integrating and adapting two National Institute on
      Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded procedures for use in primary care pediatric clinics serving
      low-income youth: 1)the Youth Risk Index (YRI) and Transmissible Liability Index-Parent
      (TLI-P) nurse and/or research assistant-administered screening tools for high risk of
      substance use (SU) prior to high school and thus also for SUD and 2) the Family Check-Up
      (FCU) - a brief, family-based program to prevent SU/SUD with replicated efficacy.

      This study is to test the effectiveness of integrating and adapting two National Institute on
      Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded procedures for use in primary care pediatric clinics serving
      low-income youth: 1) the Youth Risk Index (YRI) and Transmissible Liability Index (TLI-P)
      nurse and/or research assistant-administered screening tools for high risk of substance use
      (SU) prior to high school and thus also for SUD and 2) the Family Check-Up (FCU) - a brief,
      family-based program to prevent SU/SUD with replicated efficacy.

      The following three aims focus on evaluating and refining the adaptation of the YRI &amp; TLI-P
      program for primary-care use: 1) to replicate the effectiveness of the YRI &amp; TLI-P screening
      tool in terms of concurrent and predictive validity and the engagement rate in the FCU; 2) to
      identify and address challenges in implementing and integrating the YRI &amp; TLI-P/FCU
      prevention strategy within a primary care clinic serving urban, low-income youth; and 3) to
      test the effectiveness of the YRI &amp; TLI-P/FCU on emerging SU, sexual activity, and conduct
      problems, as well as the putative mediators of these outcomes including parenting and
      parental well-being.

      Based on prior FCU efficacy studies, 500 dyads of parents and their 9 years, 9 months to 13
      years, 11 months old children from low-income, ethnically diverse families will be recruited
      from two large primary care clinics in an urban community. The FCU will be delivered for two
      or three years to test impact of dosage. Participants will be followed-up one year after
      completing FCU to evaluate longitudinal outcomes of the Integrated YRI &amp; TLI-P/FCU .

The FCU intervention process consists of 3, and in some cases, 4 components: a) family assessment, b) a &quot;Get to Know You&quot; session, c) feedback, and d) follow-up treatment sessions.</description>
