  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain and fatigue are characterized by peripheral and central mechanisms including low
      pain thresholds, temporal summation, peripheral and central sensitization. This application
      will focus on central factors of chronic pain and fatigue. Functional brain imaging will be
      used to characterized brain and spinal cord abnormalities that contribute to the mechanisms
      of these disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic fatigue (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) are a chronic musculoskeletal pain
      disorder that predominantly afflicts women. Frequently associated insomnia, cognitive
      abnormalities, and fatigue may lead to early disability. No consistent soft tissue
      abnormalities have been identified so far in these patients. The cause of these disorders is
      unknown, no highly effective treatment is available and the current methods of diagnosis are
      imprecise and unreliable. The Investigators previously used quantitative sensory testing to
      improve upon diagnoses of these disorders by supplementing the current procedure of
      manipulating defined pressure points by hand and noting the presence or absence of pain. The
      quantitative methods of evaluation involve repetitive application of brief, non-injurious
      thermal/mechanical stimulation that normally produces a moderate degree of temporal summation
      of sensation intensity. The patients and normal control subjects will verbally rate the
      magnitude of late sensations elicited by each stimulus, using a numerical scale. Chronic pain
      in these patients results, at least partially, from exaggerated activation of central
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors as a result of enhanced input from unmyelinated
      peripheral afferent nerve fibers supplying deep tissues. Temporal summation of second pain
      can lead to central sensitization with subsequent signs of hyperalgesia and allodynia.
      Functional brain imaging of ME/CFS and FM patients, as proposed in this study, will be used
      to document their ratings of repetitive experimental stimuli and the resulting pain
      augmentation. Successful completion of this study will provide a new method for the
      evaluation of chronic pain/fatigue mechanism and their response to therapy.
