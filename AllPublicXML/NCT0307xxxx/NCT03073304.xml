  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the possibility to replace an erythrocyte
      based prime solution with a crystalloid based prime solution while maintaining metabolic
      function. Secondary also to study if potentially reduced immunological influence is obtained
      during hyper thermic isolated limb perfusion with a crystalloid based prime solution.
