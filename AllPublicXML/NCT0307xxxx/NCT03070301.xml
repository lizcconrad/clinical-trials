    <description>This study will be conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of LEE011 and everolimus in subjects with advanced WDNETs of foregut origin (thymic, bronchopulmonary, gastric, duodenal, and pancreatic). The first 10 patients enrolled on this study were treated with a starting dose of LEE011 300 mg once daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off and everolimus 2.5mg daily, based on the results of CLEE011X2106 in breast cancer. Subsequent enrolled patients will receive the oral combination of LEE011 200 mg once daily and everolimus 5 mg daily, based on more recent data from CLEE011XUS29 (TRINITI-1) study in metastatic breast cancer.</description>
