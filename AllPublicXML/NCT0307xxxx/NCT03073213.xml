    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to research how much ixekizumab enters the bloodstream and how
      long the body takes to get rid of the drug and the safety of ixekizumab and any side effects
      that might be associated with it. The study has two parts: A single-dose part and
      multiple-dose part. The single dose part of this study will last up to 24 weeks, including
      the screening period. The multiple dose part of this study will last up to 32 weeks including
      the screening period.
