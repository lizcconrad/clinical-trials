  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether secukinumab is a potential therapy for those with
      papulopustular rosacea. We will observe whether this drug decreases the size and/or amount
      and severity of the pustules of those who suffer from rosacea.

      Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 10% of adults. Despite this,
      the etiology of rosacea is unclear, although there may be a genetic predisposition (Chang et
      al., 2015). Currently, there is no cure. Rosacea can lead to scarring, itching, burning, and
      is associated with anxiety and depression (Moustafa et al., 2015), significantly affecting
      quality of life.

      Secukinumab is an antibody that binds to a protein (interleukin (IL)-17A) that is involved in
      inflammation. When IL-17A is bound to secukinumab, it cannot bind to its receptor, thereby
      inhibiting its ability to feed the inflammatory response. In clinical trials, secukinumab has
      been effective for moderate to severe psoriasis (Blauvelt et al., 2015). Recently, human data
      from all types of rosacea have shown Th1/Th17 polarization profile of the T-cell response,
      suggesting that anti-IL-17 therapy may be beneficial for rosacea (Buhl et al., 2015). Hence,
      secukinumab could be effective against rosacea. This proposal is a proof-of-concept study to
      use secukinumab in open label design for moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea defined clinically using the grading
             system of Wilkin et al. (2004) as having at least ten lesions (either papules or
             pustules) on face at time of enrollment 2) age 18 years or greater willing and able to
             understand and sign informed consent form
