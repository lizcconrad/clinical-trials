      Objective: To evaluate the curative effect of TCM multi-channel interventional therapy on
      women with ART Failure; to compare the curative effect of the dual therapy and triple therapy
      on women with ART Failure; to choose the best TCM interventional therapeutic plan.

      Methods: The cases with ART Failure from West China second University Hospital of Sichuan
      University (West China Women's and Children's Hospital of Sichuan University) meeting the
      inclusion criteria were randomly divided into three groups: the dual therapy group, the
      triple therapy group and the control group, compare the natural pregnancy number, the
      condition during the period of secondary IVF-ET and the improvement of the kidney deficiency,
      liver depression and blood stasis syndrome among those three groups.
