  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives was to obtain MRI images of the index finger of the subjects without loading
      and with loadings (normal and shear forces from 1 to 4N).

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The different stresses will be: compression of the fingertip by a static loading on the phalanx distal of the index of the subjects; Then also a shear stress in the transverse direction of the finger.</description>

    <description>In order to develop realistic biomechanical models of the fingers allowing the simulation of the grip, an essential step will be the experimental mechanical characterization of the distal phalanges.</description>

    <description>Compression of the fingertip by a static loading on the phalanx distal of the index of the subjects; Then also a shear stress in the transverse direction of the finger. The data provided by the MRI images will be geometric information such as the thickness of the skin and its possible variation as a function of the area of the finger, the total thickness of soft tissues in compression as a function of the variation in l The angle between the axis of the phalanx and the plane of contact; Mechanical type information relating to the displacements and reaction forces, to the internal deformations of the different areas of the finger.</description>
