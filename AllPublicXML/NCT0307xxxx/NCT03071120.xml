  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to pilot a parent-mediated intervention for feeding challenges in children with
      autism building on our recent research and current successful models already being used. A
      parent-mediated intervention would primarily occur in the home environment, working with the
      parent to establish goals and implement the intervention based on their child's specific
      needs.

      Recruitment of participants:

      Families will be recruited through local autism and therapy organizations, the Waisman Center
      Research Registry and existing studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and feeding. In
      addition, a targeted effort will be made to recruit a sample representative of the larger
      Madison community. A total of seventeen families who have a child with a diagnosis of ASD
      (ages 2-7 years) and parent reported feeding problems will be recruited. Each child will be
      screened for eligibility based on the BAMBIC, STEP-CHILD, and a 10-item screening
      questionnaire developed for the study. The age range was selected to reliably confirm the ASD
      diagnosis, high parental involvement in feeding, and capture a small developmental range with
      a high prevalence of disordered feeding patterns. The diagnosis of ASD will be confirmed
      based on gold-standard assessment procedures: the ADOS and clinical impression under the
      supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist. The parent who assumes the primary role of
      feeding the child will be asked to participate with the child in the study. All individuals
      will be informed that they may withdraw participation at any time.

      Intervention:

        1. Parents will attend 8 group sessions that will be clustered in the first three quarters
           of the program focused on topics related to feeding challenges (e.g. goal setting,
           feeding development, parent-child interactions, sensory processing, behavior management,
           nutrition, the gastrointestinal system, and family mealtimes). Education sessions will
           be facilitated by the principal investigator and research team members.

        2. Parents will receive 6-10 individual sessions with a feeding interventionist that will
           support targeted goal setting, problem solving and individual coaching and feedback
           through video review of parent-led intervention.

        3. Parent-child dyads will receive weekly sessions in the home that demonstrate modeling of
           intervention strategies and provide direct feedback of parent-led intervention. Parent
           satisfaction and burden will be assessed after each weekly session using a brief Likert
           scale questionnaire.

        4. Parents will be asked to commit 10-15 hours per week in the home setting to directly
           support targeted feeding goals and related challenges such as sensory processing that
           may be a barrier to successful eating. Two trained individuals with experience working
           with children with ASD will be hired to support facilitation of the parent-mediated
           intervention. Several steps will be taken to train and supervise the interventionists.
           In addition, a minimum of 20% of their interactions will be video-taped reviewed by the
           principal investigator to monitor treatment fidelity.

      Analysis:

      Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the family and child characteristics as well
      as family satisfaction. Interview data from the parents will be audio recorded, transcribed
      verbatim and imported into Nvivo for data management and analysis support to inform future
      adaptations of the intervention program as well as beginning to unravel who the program may
      be most effective for and why. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess the
      pre- and post-intervention differences of the key variables of interest.
