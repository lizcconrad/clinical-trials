    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed at investigating the effects of thyroidectomy on tracheal anatomy and
      airflow in patients with benign nodular goiter, employing a prospective observational study.

      Magnetic resonance images of the neck and respiratory flow-volume curves were performed prior
      to and six months following surgery. Tracheal and thyroid volumes, smallest cross-sectional
      area of the trachea (SCAT), tracheal narrowing, tracheal deviation and tracheal encirclement
      by the thyroid were evaluated. Through flow-volume curves respiratory function, including
      both in- and expiration, was evaluated.
