  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit participants from three tertiary care hospitals in Uganda into an
      observational cohort study of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and HIV-uninfected persons
      matched for gender and residency, presenting with CT-confirmed stroke. We will collect socio
      demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, cardiac, and clinical neurologic disease
      measures to investigate the effect of HIV-infection on 1) clinical and radiologic
      presentation, 2) risk factor profiles; and 3) stroke outcomes (death or disability).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll 100 HIV-infected adults presenting to the emergency department with acute or
      sub-acute stroke (within 14 days of onset) confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan at
      Mbarara Regional Referral, Mulago National Referral, and Nsambya Hospitals in Uganda. We will
      also enroll 100 HIV-uninfected controls, also presenting with acute or sub-acute stroke,
      matched by gender and county/district of residence. Participants will be followed for up to
      one year after enrollment. We plan to complete the following research aims:

      Aim 1: To identify the impact of HIV-infection on outcomes after acute or sub-acute stroke in
      Uganda. Our primary outcome will be poor stroke outcome defined as mortality or poor
      functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] &gt; 2). We will assess for mortality and
      functional status at one, three, six, and 12 months after presentation. We will estimate the
      relative risk of poor outcome by HIV serostatus in both unadjusted models and models adjusted
      for traditional stroke risk factors. We hypothesize that HIV-infected patients have higher
      rates of poor stroke outcomes compared to HIV-uninfected patients, and that this difference
      is, in part, attributable to the presence of concurrent central nervous system opportunistic
      infections.

      Aim 2: To describe the clinical and radiologic characteristics of stroke in Uganda, with
      particular attention to differences by HIV serostatus. We will describe the clinical
      presentation of stroke, including history and physical exam findings and presenting modified
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) score. We will also compare radiologic
      characteristics, including location of the stroke and its classification as either ischemic
      or hemorrhagic. We hypothesize that: i) HIV-infected patients are predominantly younger at
      the time of presentation, ii) HIV infected-patients have more severe stroke presentations
      with higher mNIHHS scores, iii) HIV-infected patients are more likely to suffer from ischemic
      (versus hemorrhagic) stroke, and that iv) HIV-infected patients have a greater proportion of
      small vessel territory strokes due to the association with central nervous system infections
      and basal meningitis.

      Aim 3: To identify the traditional and HIV-specific risk factors for poor outcome after
      stroke in Uganda. We will fit regression models to identify predictors of poor outcomes as
      described in Aim 1, both in the total cohort, and restricted to the HIV-infected cohort. We
      hypothesize that age, presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and low Glasgow coma
      score are associated with PSO in Uganda and that HIV-specific predictors of poor outcome are
      low mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), low CD4 cell count, high HIV viral load, and report
      of recent constitutional symptoms.
