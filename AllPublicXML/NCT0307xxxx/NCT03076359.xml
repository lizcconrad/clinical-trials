  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to adapt and assess the impact of a traditional healer
      training program/intervention on the adherence, retention, and viral load of HIV infected
      patients newly initiated on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) in rural Mozambique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incorporating healers as anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence counselors can help reduce
      the crisis of HIV treatment abandonment. Healers are often accused of encouraging patients to
      abandon HIV care, but they can also serve as strong advocates for patient health. When
      healers were engaged as tuberculosis (TB) adherence counselors in South Africa, their
      patients were as successful as those supported by non-healer counselors. An innovative
      solution would be to engage trained healers as treatment partners to support medication and
      appointment adherence for PLHIV.

      Healers are well positioned to address reported patient concerns, including: (1) keeping a
      patients HIV status a secret while providing support; (2) assisting with partner disclosure
      and initiating community/clinical systems of assistance if gender base violence is
      threatened/occurs; and (3) advocating for patients during clinical visits to ensure quality
      care is provided. Other programs in SSA have shown that incorporating healers into an
      allopathic health system as adherence supporters for TB treatment is feasible, but healer use
      in HIV treatment is not well-documented. This novel intervention would provide patients newly
      initiated on ART a choice to nominate a specially trained healer as a treatment partner, and
      assess acceptability, feasibility, and patient outcomes using an interrupted time series
      quasi-experimental design. Community-based treatment partners can improve pharmacy adherence
      and loss to follow up (LTFU), while decreasing stigma and isolation.

      Engaging healers to conduct counseling sessions in a community setting to improve ART
      adherence necessitates technical clinical and psychosocial training. The ART Adherence
      Support Worker Training program (from FHI 360) will be adapted (using ADAPT-ITT) and used to
      train healers to be quality treatment partners and advocates. The training will ensure
      healers have the knowledge and skills to effectively: (1) Educate PLHIV about ART and HIV
      care; (2) Assess serious ART side effects or HIV co-infections; (3) Counsel patients about
      safer strategies for partner disclosure (with assistance if needed); (4) Accompany the
      patient for each clinical appointment; and (5) Advocate for quality health care delivery when
      assisting each patient. The FGH training team will conduct training of the healers. All
      patients initiating ART will be screened for interest in having a healer treatment partner.
      Control and intervention patients will be followed for one year, allowing the investigators
      to compare outcomes at 12-months to study the effectiveness of healers as adherence partners.

    <description>This group will receive standard of care as described above. In addition, the investigators will assess an intervention partnership with traditional healer including: community and clinic based support from a trained traditional healer.
The intervention includes: (1) healer visits to the patient at home, healer support for couples counseling, healer provision of nutritional advice, and healer counsel about the importance of adherence. If anything is amiss, the healer will accompany the patient to the health facility for additional clinical services. In addition, the healer will accompany the patient on all regularly scheduled clinical visits.</description>
