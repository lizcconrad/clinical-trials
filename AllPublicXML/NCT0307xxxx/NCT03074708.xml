      Background:The aim of the study is to value the application of three-dimensional
      visualization and three-dimensional printing in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic
      surgery.Methodï¼šFrom January 2016 to December 2018,the clinical data of 200 patients with the
      hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases will be collected.All the patients received abdominal
      CT scanning and 3D reconstruction. Then we used the 3D reconstruction model and the 3D
      printed model based on the 3D reconstruction model in the operation planning and the
      operation.The clinical data include operative time, intraoperative blood loss,and
      postoperative complications after surgery.
