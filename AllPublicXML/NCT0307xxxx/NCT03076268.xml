  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treinta Millones de Palabras- Visitas al Hogar (TMP) is designed to intervene upon mothers'
      knowledge, beliefs, and behavior, which in turn influences their interaction with their
      children, impacting children's development. The investigators will measure change in mothers'
      knowledge, beliefs, and behavior during and after intervention, and measure impacts on
      children's development across major developmental domains. Specifically, the investigators
      will measure mothers'

        1. Knowledge of child language development and the role of parents in that development

        2. Beliefs about the malleability of intelligence and their role in shaping their
           children's intelligence

        3. Interaction with their child, specifically their linguistic input and responsiveness to
           their child's communication

      Concurrently, the investigators will measure children's

        1. Emergent oral language development, in both Spanish and English

        2. Social-emotional development

        3. Math and spatial reasoning skill development

The TMP Curriculum is comprised of 1) 12 educational modules, 2) animations and videos of real parent-child interactions to teach parents about the science behind child brain development, and model strategies for improving parents' child-directed speech, 3) video modeling and collaborative goal setting, and 4) quantitative linguistic feedback from Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) recordings.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>TMP-Visitas al Hogar is a cultural and linguistic adaptation of the TMW-Home Visiting curriculum into Spanish. The 12-module curriculum has been translated into Spanish and adapted to address concerns that are vital to mono- and bilingual Spanish-speaking families, including the broadening research base for when to introduce a second language to a child and the benefits of bilingualism.</description>
