  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      (COPD) patients. Domain-specific cognitive impairments include deficits in domains such as
      cognitive flexibility, verbal memory, working memory, planning, and psychomotor speed; which
      in general are associated with poor health behaviours, such as infrequent exercising and poor
      diet. Additional cognitive training may reverse these effects. Recent evidence suggests that
      working memory training is linked to self-control and, indirectly, to improved lifestyle
      behaviour including increased physical activity. The investigators hypothesise that enhancing
      cognitive performance through administering specific working memory training not only
      improves cognitive function but that it facilitates better adherence to a more active
      lifestyle and a healthier diet in COPD patients.

    <description>The working memory intervention training programme consists of a domain-general cognitive working memory training programme. One training session will take 20 to 30 minutes, and participants will have to complete approximately 40 cognitive training sessions.
The sham treatment is the same as the intervention training however it does not increase in difficulty. Participants are presented with the same task at the same level of difficulty over and over again. Thus a training effect is not expected.</description>
