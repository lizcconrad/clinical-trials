  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of detraining in the components of physical
      aptitude of people living with HIV/Aids (PVHA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was experimental with a sample composed by an Experimental Group (EG) with 11 PVHA,
      under antiretroviral therapy and a Control Group (CG) with 10 individuals without the
      infection; all which were under medical release and insufficiently active. The body
      composition was evaluated through the DXA, as well as the cardiorespiratory aptitude through
      the ergometer and the strength of the upper and lower limbs through dynamometry. Both groups
      conducted interventions with concurrent training for 15 weeks and the interruption of
      exercise was evaluated after a period of 5 weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a longitudinal study of the non-randomized experimental type, presenting a non-probabilistic sample for convenience and independent groups. The sample consisted of 21 individuals divided into 2 groups: Experimental Group (EG) and Control Group (CG). The EG was composed of 11 people living with HIV/AIDS and CG composed of 10 people with no infection</intervention_model_description>
