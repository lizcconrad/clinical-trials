  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be done in two parts: Phase I (NCT02212561) has been completed and published.
      The goal of the Phase I portion of this study was to find the highest tolerable dose of
      selinexor (KPT-330) that can be given to patients with leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS), when it is combined with fludarabine and cytarabine.

      The Phase II portion of the protocol is reflected in this registration.

      The goal of the Phase II portion of this protocol is to give the highest dose of selinexor
      (KPT-330) in combination with fludarabine/cytarabine that was found in Phase I to be safe for
      children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The investigators will examine the effect of this
      combination treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the recommended Phase II dose was determined, additional patients began enrolling to
      receive selinexor at the recommended dose level for further evaluation of tolerability and
      response.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the overall response rate, as defined by complete response or complete
           response with incomplete count recovery, of selinexor in combination with fludarabine
           and cytarabine for patients with relapsed or refractory AML in the phase II portion of
           the study.

             is refractory to chemotherapy, or that has relapsed after hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation (HSCT)
