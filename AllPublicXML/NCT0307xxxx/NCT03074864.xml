  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of intercalated combination
      of erlotinib and radiotherapy for patients with EGFR-mutant, unresectable, locally advanced
      NSCLC, and to explore a new treatment strategy for this subset. After Induction by erlotinib,
      local radiotherapy is intercalated, and followed by 24-week erlotinib maintenance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemoradiation therapy is the standard treatment for unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC,
      but its efficacy reaches a platform, and treatment-related life threatening toxicity limits
      its use. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) produce a dramatic response in patients
      carrying EGFR activating mutations in the metastatic setting. Multiple prospective trials
      show that EGFR-TKIs have a better tolerability when compared with chemotherapy.
