    <textblock>
      This phase I/II studies the side effects of avelumab and trabectedin and how well they work
      in treating patients with leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma that has spread to other places in
      the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may block
      tumor growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as trabectedin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      avelumab and trabectedin may work better in treating patients with liposarcoma or
      leiomyosarcoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of trabectedin and avelumab in
      patients with advanced leiomyosarcoma and liposarcomas (L-type sarcomas).

      II. To assess the objective response rate of advanced L-type sarcoma patients receiving the
      combination of avelumab and trabectedin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the clinical activity of avelumab and trabectedin with respect to time to
      response.

      II. To explore the clinical activity of avelumab and trabectedin with respect to duration of
      response.

      III. To explore the clinical activity of avelumab and trabectedin with respect to
      progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks.

      IV. To explore the clinical activity of avelumab and trabectedin with respect to clinical
      benefit rate (complete response [CR]+ partial response [PR]+ stable disease [SD]) at 12
      weeks.

      V. To explore the clinical activity of avelumab and trabectedin with respect to overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive
      trabectedin IV over 24 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks and may repeat up to
      every 5 weeks after 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.
