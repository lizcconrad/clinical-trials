  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, descriptive, pilot case series involving patients with significant
      burns who are candidates for reconstruction with Integra®. Subjects would have a small area
      of the wound would, at the time of excision, have the smallest sheet of thin Integra® (125
      cm2) placed and be immediately autografted with a 3:1 meshed split-thickness skin graft. Of
      note, 125 cm2 represents approximately 0.7% of an average sized patient's total body surface
      area, so for even the smallest burns in our proposed trial, this area would represent a small
      portion of the patient's area of injury. The remaining injury areas would be covered with
      standard-thickness Integra® only.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integra®, a synthetic dermal substitute, has been utilized in burn care for decades.
      Typically, 10-14 days after Integra® placement, a patient returns to the operating room, the
      top silastic layer of the Integra® is removed, and an autograft - a split-thickness skin
      graft harvested from the patient - is applied directly on top of the incorporated Integra®.
      The result is regarded to be a cosmetically and functionally superior result to that which
      would have been obtained had the wound bed itself been autografted at the time of excision,
      as opposed to being covered by Integra® and autografted during a second operation.

      Integra® use in single-stage procedures to cover defects without grafting has shown benefit
      when defects are fairly small, e.g. fingertip injuries, and small head and neck skin cancer
      resections. While single-stage reconstruction with Integra® has been demonstrated with
      standard thickness Integra®, this decreased thickness would increase the likelihood of graft
      survival due to the decreased distance of nutrient diffusion.

    <description>Composed of a porous collagen-chondroitin 6-sulfate fibrillary mat covered with a thin sheet of silastic, it serves to cover wound beds of freshly excised burns and allow for the infiltration of fibroblasts, capillaries, and macrophages, essentially creating a &quot;neodermis&quot; while also acting as a barrier against infection and a blockade against heat and moisture loss</description>

    <description>125 cm2 represents approximately 0.7% of an average sized patient's total body surface area. The remaining injury areas would be covered with standard-thickness Integra® only. The donor graft, a 4 cm x 10 cm sheet of skin, would be meshed in a 3:1 ratio to be expanded to cover the 125 cm2 sheet of thin Integra®. The patient's post-operative care would be largely unchanged, although the patient would have a donor site of 40 cm2 that would be dressed and managed in the usual fashion.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English-speaking adult burn patients greater than 18 years old, admitted with burn
             injuries eligible for Integra® reconstruction at the discretion of the burn attending
             physicians.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with isolated hand or face burns - these burns are treated with sheet grafts
             (unmeshed); the 3:1 mesh grafts would not be used on these cosmetically sensitive
             areas. If they have hand and/or face burns in addition to other areas, they will not
             be excluded. However, the study itself will not be performed on the hands or face.
             Additionally, patients unable to present to our clinic for routine follow-up due to
             geographic limitations or otherwise will be ineligible.
