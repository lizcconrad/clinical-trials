    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, prospective, population-based, single-center study designed to
      evaluate conditions resulting emergency admission in patients with abdominal pain.
      Furthermore, we are interested in how many patients are discharged with &quot;non-specific
      abdominal pain&quot; but later readmitted and diagnosed with a specific diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1000 adult patients with acute abdominal pain will be recruited at Tampere University
      Hospital Emergency department. The patients will fill in a questionaire about the symptoms
      and their duration. A urine sample will be collected for polyamine molecule analysis with an
      electronic nose. At later stage of the study, a serum sample for coeliac tests will be
      collected. Patient outcome will be obtained during the hospital stay, at one-month after
      discharge and at one year.
