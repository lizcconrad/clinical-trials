  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CHALO (&quot;Child Health Action to Lower Oral Health and Obesity&quot;) -- from an Urdu word
      meaning &quot;Let's go!&quot;â€”is a multi-level strategy to reduce pediatric obesity and dental caries
      risk in South Asian (SA) children. Obesity and caries are the two most prominent health
      disparities of early childhood. Both caries and obesity: a) disproportionately impact
      low-income children of color, b) share common risk behaviors, i.e., feeding practices, and c)
      can most effectively be reduced or prevented prevention in infancy and early childhood. SA
      immigrant children are at high risk for both. CHALO includes both a randomized controlled
      trial (RCT) aimed at reducing risk behavior, and a Knowledge Translation project to raise
      awareness in SA lay and professional communities regarding child health risks.

  <detailed_description>

      CHALO builds upon the team's prior research re: cariogenic (R34-DE-022282) and obesogenic
      behaviors (10, 14, 15). CHALO's intervention components-- home visits, phone support, and
      &quot;patient navigation&quot; to dental visits-- proved to be feasible and acceptable. In the pilot
      R34, there were promising behavioral change on all measures. CHALO builds on this work, with
      the addition of: a) sippy cups as an intervention target, b) an iPad-based dietary recall
      tool, &quot;MySmileBuddy,&quot; c) caries and obesity data, and; d) increased intervention contacts-
      consistent with recent child obesity and caries interventions (16, 17).

      An RCT (Aim 1) will enroll 360 mothers of children 4-6 month olds from New York City (n=3)
      and New Jersey (n=2) pediatric practices in SAPPHIRE (&quot;SA Practice Partnership for Health
      Improvement and Research&quot;). The Community Health Worker intervention includes: a) home visits
      with mothers/families (n=6 visits over one year) and follow up telephone support; b) patient
      navigation to make/keep timely dental visits (2x by 18 months). The Knowledge Translation
      component (Aim 2) will raise awareness of child health risks in SA communities and among
      professionals who provide their care. The campaign will include both traditional and social
      media components and will be evaluated using multiple metrics.

    <masking_description>Research Assessment- at 6, 12, and 18 months will be conducted by RAs. Data collected include a computerized 24 hour recall: MySmileBuddy (see below); and questionnaires. The T2 interview, in addition, will include the Intra-oral Camera Caries Assessment. Study identifiers will not include indication of group assignment. The REDCap database will include group assignment in a field that is not accessible to RAs
Caries Outcomes- Intra-oral camera images will be transmitted electronically to the University of Rochester; no group assignment identifier will be included.
Obesity Outcomes- RAs will obtained weight and length measures in the home- see above.</masking_description>
