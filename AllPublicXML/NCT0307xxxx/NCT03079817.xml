  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In past work is has been shown that yoga can be as effective as a standard balance or Tai Chi
      protocol; however, there is an inability to distinguish between the mind and body
      contributions of yoga training. This study will compare an accepted proprioceptive training
      program to a meditation program which concentrates on body awareness in individuals with
      Parkinson's disease.

    <measure>8ft Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>60 seconds</time_frame>
    <description>Individuals sits in a chair at the verbal cue of &quot;go&quot;, individual rises from chair and walks as quickly as possible around a cone placed 8 ft from the front of the chair, individual returns to and sits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint Position Sense</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The joint position sense technique for the knee involves the reduction of visual cues while moving the knee to a specific target angle, holding that target angle, returning the knee to the starting position, and then reproducing that target angle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Joint Kinesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Joint Kinesthesia measurement technique involves the participant sitting in the Biodex chair with visual, audio, and tactile cues reduced and the leg supported by an external movement device. The knee is placed at a predetermined angle and slowly flexed or extended at a random starting time while the participant is instructed to signal when movement is felt.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Posturography</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participant stands on a randomly moving platform with a sonar emitter affixed to the lumbar spine. As the platform moves the linear and curvilinear displacement of the emitter is evaluated and a dynamic movement analysis core is generated.</description>
