  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a region with 15-20% HIV prevalence, an estimated 20% of HIV-uninfected women could have
      HIV exposures in pregnancy. In a theoretical scenario of perfect PrEP coverage, all women at
      risk receive PrEP while no women not at HIV risk receive PrEP (Figure 4). With mandatory PrEP
      given to all women (similar to the approaches used for malaria prophylaxis), all women at
      risk would be covered but many women not at risk receive unnecessary PrEP. Our premise is
      that a targeted PrEP model may be closer to perfect coverage than a universal
      offer/self-select model. Implementing targeted PrEP through strategies that include
      facilitation of partner testing with self-tests could add HIV prevention benefit by
      increasing partner HIV diagnosis and treatment similar to the initiation of PrEP among
      pregnant women. By implementing these strategies and measuring uptake, process, and HIV
      incidence, we can inform the best health systems model for PrEP delivery in pregnancy.

      Women living in regions with high HIV prevalence are at high risk of HIV acquisition in
      pregnancy and postpartum because they infrequently use condoms, do not know their partner's
      HIV status, and have biologic changes or changes in their partner's sexual partnerships that
      increase susceptibility. Oral pre-exposure antiretroviral prophylaxis (PrEP) may be an
      attractive strategy for HIV prevention in pregnancy/postpartum; however, it is important to
      ensure PrEP reaches women who are at risk for acquiring HIV during pregnancy while avoiding
      unnecessary PrEP use during pregnancy. Clinicians and women are using PrEP in pregnancy; in
      qualitative studies, women, health workers and policy-makers support use of PrEP in pregnancy
      but advocate for models of PrEP delivery that ensure women at risk receive PrEP while
      minimizing unnecessary PrEP use in women not at risk. Targeting PrEP to women at greatest
      risk of HIV may maximize benefits, minimize potential risks, and optimize cost-effectiveness.
      This cluster-randomized clinical trial (RCT) in 20 Maternal Child Health (MCH) clinics in
      western Kenya (10 clinics per arm, 200 women per clinic, 4000 women overall), will compare 2
      models of PrEP delivery in pregnancy. Clinics will offer universal availability of PrEP (and
      women self-select whether to use) or targeted offer of PrEP (i.e., offer to women identified
      as high risk through a standardized risk assessment and partner self-testing, and then women
      identified as high-risk select whether to use). Leveraging the pre-existing MCH clinic visit
      schedule will enable programmatically relevant assessment of PrEP uptake, use, and HIV
      incidence. The outcome of the study will be a model of PrEP delivery in pregnancy that
      optimizes effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Our team has expertise in
      maternal-child HIV (John-Stewart, Kinuthia), PrEP clinical trials and implementation science
      (Baeten, Richardson), partner self-testing (Thirumurthy), economics and qualitative research
      (Barnabas, O'Malley).

      AIM 1a. In a cluster-RCT, compare universal PrEP (offer to all; women self-select PrEP) to
      targeted PrEP (limit the offer to women identified as high risk through a standardized risk
      assessment and partner self-testing) for outcomes reflecting the balance of PrEP
      effectiveness and avoiding unnecessary PrEP exposure to women at low or no risk of HIV: HIV
      incidence at 9 months postpartum among all women (including those who did and did not receive
      PrEP) and proportion of women exposed to PrEP.

      AIM 1b. To compare trial arms for proportion of women 'appropriately' on PrEP (risk factors),
      PrEP adherence (drug levels) and duration, partners with known HIV status, partners on ART;
      infant outcomes (growth, birth outcomes, HIV status).

      AIM 2. To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of targeted PrEP compared to universal
      PrEP for women during pregnancy and postpartum, per HIV infection and disability-adjusted
      life-year (DALY) averted.

      AIM 3. To qualitatively assess barriers and facilitators to uptake, adherence, acceptability,
      and feasibility in universal and targeted PrEP models at the organizational, provider, and
      individual woman level.

    <description>Counseling at universal sites, will use a standardized counseling script to state that PrEP is available for women at risk for HIV, explain that HIV prevalence in the region is high, and will note that women with HIV positive partners or who don't know their partner's status may be at risk. Counseling will specify that women may have their own reasons to feel at risk or to want PrEP. Following standardized counseling, women will select PrEP at the same visit or will be allowed to deliberate on the decision and come back at the next visit with a decision. Women will be informed that it is advisable to use PrEP if they know their partner is HIV positive or if they do not know their partner's status and will be encouraged to bring untested partners to clinic if status is unknown.</description>

    <description>Following enrollment, the targeted PrEP clinics will provide two inter-related innovations over two ANC visits. In the targeted PrEP clinics, any of the following three criteria can trigger enhanced PrEP counseling. A participant that meets any one of these criteria will receive PrEP counseling during the study visit where the criteria is met:
Risk Score &gt;5 (Risk score includes male partner status known/unknown, syphilis infection, and lifetime number of male partners).
participant declines partner self-tests regardless of partner HIV status, and/or
their partner declines self-testing or tests positive.</description>
