  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of a novel prebiotic, XOS95, at
      two different dosages, in comparison to a placebo by assessing shifts in microbial
      populations after 8 weeks of supplementation, assessed as changes in abundance of microbial
      populations.
