      The study titled, Manual Versus Electric Vacuum Aspiration for Pregnancy Termination Between
      10-14 weeks: A Randomized Trial, is a randomized trial to compare procedure times for manual
      and electric vacuum aspiration for surgical abortion between 10 0/7 and 13 6/7 weeks
      gestation. Women presenting for surgical abortion between 10 0/7 and 13 6/7 weeks gestation
      will be randomized to either undergo manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or electric vacuum
      aspiration (EVA). The investigators hypothesize that operative times will be increased when
      using manual vacuum aspiration, as compared to electric vacuum aspiration, for surgical
      abortion performed in the late first trimester (10 0/7 and-13 6/7 weeks).
