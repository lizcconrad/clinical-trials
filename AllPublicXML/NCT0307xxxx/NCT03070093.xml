      The purpose of this study is to provide expanded access to ASP2215 for subjects with
      FLT3-mutated relapsed or refractory AML or FLT3-mutated AML in composite complete remission
      (CRc) (complete remission [CR], complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery
      [CRi], complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery [CRp]) with MRD without access to
      comparable or alternative therapy.

      This treatment protocol is being conducted while phase 3 ASP2215 studies are ongoing in
      FLT3-mutated AML subjects.

      Subjects will complete visits on cycle 1 - days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 - days 1, 15; cycles 3
      to 6 - day 1; and day 1 of every 2 cycles thereafter (i.e., cycle 8 day 1, cycle 10 day 1,
      etc.) until discontinued from the study.

      Subjects will be provided with study medication until the investigator determines the subject
      is no longer receiving clinical benefit.

      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of investigational
      product (ASP2215), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever occurs
      earlier, followed by a 30-day follow-up. [Specific to investigational sites in Japan: Study
      population does not include subjects with FLT3-mutated AML in CRc (CR, CRi, CRp) with MRD.
      Hence, efficacy (MRD response rate and duration of response) data will not be collected for
      subjects enrolled in Japan.]

                  addition of new agent/modality in prior 2 weeks (note that increasing calcineurin
                  inhibitors or sirolimus to achieve therapeutic trough levels is allowed)
