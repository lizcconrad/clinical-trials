    <textblock>
      This study involves the collection of cognitive and biomarker responses to HIGH and LOW meals
      in healthy older adults with and without the APOE E4 genotype. Subjects will eat the meal
      after an overnight fast, followed by cognitive testing, spinal fluid and blood collection.
      The HIGH meal will be a meal high in saturated fat and high glycemic index foods vs. LOW meal
      which will be low in saturated fat and low glycemic index foods.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how the risk gene for Alzheimer's disease APOE
      epsilon 4 (E4) influences acute cognitive responses to different types of meals. The
      rationale for this study is that we know that a diet high in saturated fat and high glycemic
      index foods (HIGH diet) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However we have found
      paradoxically that a Western style HIGH diet acutely improved cognition in APOE E4 carriers,
      but worsened cognition in E4 non-carriers. This experiment will examine mechanisms that
      underlie this differential response between E4 carriers and non-carriers.

      We will enroll older adults who do not have dementia, half of which will be E4 carriers and
      the other half will be non-carriers. Both groups will contain equal numbers of men and women.
      These individuals will undergo two experiments in which they eat either a high or a low fat
      meal, and then after the meal will undergo several tests. The outcome measures include blood
      measures of metabolic markers, cognitive tests that are known to be sensitive to changes even
      after a single meal, and spinal fluid measures of Alzheimer's biomarkers such as
      beta-amyloid, as well as spinal fluid levels of lipids, glucose and insulin. This study will
      allow us to test whether high and low fat meals acutely affect cognitive and Alzheimer's
      biomarkers, and if those changes depend on APOE genotype or gender. It is our hope that this
      work will contribute to our broader understanding about the risks of diet and AD, to help us
      understand more about how to prevent and treat this devastating neurological disease.

    <description>The study will examine CSF biomarker responses to HIGH and LOW meals in 80 men and women with and without the E4 allele in a cross-over design. After an overnight fast, participants will ingest either a HIGH or LOW meal on separate days 3-5 weeks apart in random order.

          5. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject will be able to complete the study
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes: Known type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, currently taking diabetic medications or
             insulin, and/or fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 as per the 2009 American Diabetes
             Association guidelines. Remote use of diabetic agents, or a history of gestational
             diabetes, is ok.

          2. Liver and kidney disease: Active liver disease will be excluded. Also excluded are
             elevations in liver function tests of SGOT (AST) and/or SGPT (ALT) &gt; 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal. Active renal disease (Stage IV or V chronic kidney disease)
             will also be excluded.

          3. Lipid abnormalities: Diagnosis of hyperlipidemia or hypertriglyceridemia requiring
             statin, bile acid resins, fibrate medications, and/or high dose niacin will be
             excluded, as these medications may interfere with the study outcomes. If subjects are
             on omega-3 fatty acids, low dose niacin, or other alternative/herbal remedies such as
             red yeast rice, they can be enrolled if they agree to stop the medication during the
             study period. Also excluded are significant cholesterol abnormalities as defined by
             the Adult Treatment Panel III classification: LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL, total
             cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL, or triglycerides &gt; 200. HDL levels outside of the typical
             range are ok.

          4. Dementia and cognitive impairment: Known diagnosis of dementia, use of dementia
             medications, or identification of dementia during the baseline visit, will be
             excluded. Also excluded are other significant neurologic diseases which affect
             cognition, such as recent stroke, recent severe head injury, or advanced Parkinson's
             disease. Mild cognitive impairment with no functional deficits is ok.

          5. Contraindications to lumbar puncture: Those with medical conditions that preclude a
             lumbar puncture such as an intracranial tumor, lower spinal hardware, or use of
             anticoagulation, will be excluded. Daily aspirin for prevention is ok. Use of NSAIDS
             is ok as long as participant uses them as needed rather than daily, and is able to
             discontinue these agents two days prior to the LP procedures.

          6. Significant medical illnesses: Illnesses which would cause a hardship on the
             participant to attend study visits and undergo a lumbar puncture. This includes
             uncontrolled severe hypertension, unstable angina or cardiovascular disease, moderate
             pulmonary disease (COPD), and Class III-IV congestive heart failure (CHF).

          7. Active malignancy undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutic or radiation treatments.
             Remote history of treated cancer is ok, as long as current cognition and digestion are
             not affected

          8. Treatment with hormones: Use of estrogen, testosterone, and continuous corticosteroid
             replacements will be excluded, as these may have effects on study outcomes. Women must
             be post-menopausal for at least 1 year before enrolling in the study, or be one year
             out from a hysterectomy. Women who use hormone replacement therapy for symptomatic
             menopause can be enrolled, if they agree to discontinue the medication four weeks
             before the first meal and then throughout the study. Transgendered subjects can be
             included in the study, provided that they are not taking sex steroids.

          9. Psychiatric disorders: Subjects who report active untreated major depression,
             psychosis, or mania, or who present with those symptoms at the baseline visit, will be
             excluded. Psychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
             depression, and anxiety which are stable and treated with medication or therapy are
             ok.

         10. Major digestive disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel
             syndrome, and celiac disease. History of surgical procedures which may affect the
             absorption of meals, such as any weight loss surgery such as gastric bypass or
             banding, or small intestine resection. Acid reflux is allowed if participant is on a
             stable medication regimen.

         11. Food allergies and intolerances: Those subjects allergic to the ingredients of the
             meals will be excluded. Also excluded are medical conditions requiring strict
             adherence to a particular diet, such as celiac disease or phenylketonuria.

         12. Alcohol use: While they are in the study, subjects will be asked to limit their
             alcohol intake to two drinks per day or less for men, or one drink per day or less for
             women, due to alcohol's effects on lipid biochemistry and the study outcomes. Subjects
             who are unable or unwilling to meet these criteria will not be enrolled.
