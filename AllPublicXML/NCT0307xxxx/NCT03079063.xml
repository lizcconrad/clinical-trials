  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicentre, randomized, double blinded, single dose, two-way cross-over
      study, is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of biosimilar eptacog alfa (activated) with
      Novoseven in 24 patients, adult and children (&gt;12 years), not bleeding, with inherited
      coagulation factor VII (FVII) deficiency (FVII &lt;1%). Patients will be randomized to receive
      either a single dose of eptacog alfa biosimilar 30 μg/kg and one single dose of NovoSeven 30
      μg/kg, or vice versa, with doses separated by a washout period. All patients will be followed
      12 months and will receive biosimilar eptacog alfa, on demand, for every bleeding episode
      that should occur - or - for prophylaxis, with the aim of monitoring of inhibiting antibody
      formation, lack of efficacy and collection of safety data.

      Additional 26 patients with the same inclusions and exclusions criteria will be included in
      this study (for a total 50 patients). These patients will not enter the PK phase of the study
      but they will be followed to receive biosimilar eptacog alfa, on demand, for every bleeding
      episode that should occur during 12 months - or - for prophylaxis, with the aim of monitoring
      of inhibiting antibody formation, lack of efficacy and collection of safety data. The
      modality of treatment with biosimilar eptacog alfa (on demand or prophylaxis) will be decided
      by the Investigator.
