      The purpose of this study is to show that cochlear implant treatment improves the overall
      health related quality of life and general well-being in elderly individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an observational prospective repeated measures study with each
      subject acting as his/her own control. Subjects are evaluated subjectively at pre- and
      post-operative intervals that coincide with their routine visits to the clinic. Outcomes from
      routine practice and application of cochlear implant intervention are recorded through
      observational measures using clinical standards scales used widely in geriatrics and
      audiology. The study is aimed at collection of data for patients who have already made the
      decision together with their implant centre clinician for an implant device from the company
      Cochlear. Patients are approached for study participation prior to surgery by the caring
      clinician on a consecutive and voluntary basis and on condition of signing the patient
      informed consent.

          -  Implant ear: meets all local criteria for cochlear implant treatment

          -  Contralateral ear: average pure tone thresholds indicate a moderately-severe to

          -  Willingness to participate in and to comply with all study procedures

          -  Fluency in languages used to assess clinical performance

          -  Appropriate expectations from routine cochlear implant treatment

          -  Able to decide on study participation personally and independently sign their consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significantly/severely dependent or fragile

          -  Unable to provide consent personally

          -  Unable to complete questionnaires for self-assessment independently

          -  Unilateral hearing loss

          -  Sequential and simultaneous bilateral cochlear implant recipients

          -  Ossification or other cochlear anomalies preventing full electrode insertion

          -  Retro cochlear or central origins of hearing impairment.

          -  Significant comorbidities preventing study participation (e.g. blindness, immobility
             or in a wheel chair, severe aphasia)

          -  Medical contraindications to surgery

          -  Clinic Standard fail criteria for cochlear implant candidacy in regards to chronic
             depression, dementia, and cognitive disorders.

          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits,
             risks and limitations that are inherent to the procedure and prosthetic device.
