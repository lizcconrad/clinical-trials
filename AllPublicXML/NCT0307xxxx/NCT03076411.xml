  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, observational study investigates the course of symptoms in patients
      with functional dyspepsia under treatment with a fixed combination of pepsin and amino acid
      hydrochloride over a period of approximately 6 weeks. The change of the Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Score (GISÂ©) was the primary parameter for the assessment of efficacy and was
      performed at baseline, after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment respectively. Safety measures
      included recording of AEs and physical examination as well as measurement of vital signs. The
      aim was to observe 100 patients during the course of this non-interventional study.

        Patients presented with acute and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, it was decided on the
        basis of their history, previous findings (diagnostic endoscopy and imaging, if available)
        and findings on physical examination whether they could participate in the postmarketing
        surveillance.
