      A study of the skeletal structure and how the structure changes over time. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the skeleton in 10 year increments to determine an understanding of the
      normal skeleton as a person ages. By using x-ray analysis, a new low dose x-ray system (EOS)
      can be used to evaluate the whole body to see changes in the bone structure over time.
      Subjects will be asked to undertake one x-ray analysis of their whole body skeletal
      structure. There will be 25 male and 25 female subjects per decade. The averaging of the
      measured skeletal parameters will provide information on changes over time generating a
      standardized expectation of general changes in skeletal structure as participants age.

      Current techniques of advanced spinal surgery allow physicians to correct complex spinal
      deformity to nearly any alignment desired. The investigators ability to analyze spino-pelvic
      alignment has evolved concurrently; however, the investigators goals in deformity correction
      are still not completely understood. With increasing ability to assess whole body alignment,
      the investigators must establish a baseline for the &quot;normal&quot; population inclusive of age
      related changes. the investigators hypothesis is that global body alignment will vary based
      on sex and progressively vary with age.

      The goal of this study is to create an open access database of &quot;normal&quot; volunteer full body
      radiographic images obtained using the new EOS biplanar x-ray imaging system. The system
      provides a radiographic view of the weight-bearing skeleton equivalent to plain radiography.
      The development of an open access database of full body images and global spine parameters
      will provide spine surgeons with normative data that can be used to guide clinical decision
      making and surgical planning. Furthermore, the database can be used by researchers to obtain
      control measurements for comparison in studies of various spine, and potentially non-spine,
      pathologies.

      Specific Aims

        1. To create an open access database of radiographic full body images in the sagittal and
           coronal planes of subjectswithout spine deformities or acute or severe chronic disease,
           across a range of age groups from 20 to 80 year old males and females.

        2. To document age related changes that occur in radiographic parameters in the spine and
           pelvis by including subjects across a wide range of ages.
