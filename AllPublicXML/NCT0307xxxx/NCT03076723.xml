  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the so called pulsatility curve, which describes
      the relationship between intracranial pressure (ICP) and ICP pulsatility, can be used to
      predict outcome of treatment, in the form of shunt surgery, in idiopathic normal pressure
      hydrocephalus (INPH) and to guide the adjustment of shunt opening pressure after the surgery.
      The main hypotheses of the study are:

        1. The pulsatility curve may be the best auxiliary test to predict shunt surgery outcome in
           INPH patients. With a &quot;fixed&quot; shunt opening pressure, the preoperatively assessed
           potential pulse amplitude reduction (determined by analysis of the pulsatility curve)
           predicts postoperative improvement in gait velocity and cognitive functions.

        2. A postoperative pulsatility curve can be used to further optimize ICP pulsatility by
           guiding opening pressure adjustment. Shunt adjustment based on the pulsatility curve
           three months postoperatively will increase improvement, but not complications, compared
           to a shunt with &quot;fixed&quot; opening pressure.

      Based on these hypotheses, three specific aims for the study have been defined:

        1. To determine if improvement three month after surgery is associated with postoperative
           reduction in pulse amplitude.

        2. To determine if a pulsatility curve obtained preoperatively can predict improvement in
           gait velocity and cognitive functions in INPH patients three months after surgery.

        3. To compare outcome six months after surgery and complications rates between INPH
           patients with a &quot;fixed&quot; opening pressure versus those where the shunt has been adjusted
           based on the pulsatility curve, three months after the shunt insertion.
