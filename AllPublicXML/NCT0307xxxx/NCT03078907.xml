  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of selexipag on the physical
      activity of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in their daily life, by using
      a wearable wrist device (actigraph). The actigraph will collect data on daily life physical
      activity in the patient's real environment. In addition, the PAH symptoms and their impacts
      will be assessed by using an electronic patient reported outcome measure in the patient's
      real environment. Patients will be assigned randomly to either selexipag or placebo.
