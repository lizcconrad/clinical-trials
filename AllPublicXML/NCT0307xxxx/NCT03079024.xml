      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive training exercises can improve
      cognitive functioning in young patients with recent-onset schizophrenia, schizoaffective,
      schizophreniform, and psychosis NOS who are being treated in community mental health
      settings. The investigators will examine the effects of web-based cognitive training
      exercises delivered on a portable laptop computer. The findings will provide valuable
      information on whether cognitive training can improve the cognition and functioning of young
      individuals early in the course of schizophrenia.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) in
      young patients with recent-onset (RO) schizophrenia to target improvement in cognitive
      functioning within real-world treatment settings. This study will be performed in the
      University of Minnesota Department of Psychiatry's First Episode Psychosis Program with
      specialized Early Intervention Services (EIS). The investigators will compare the effects of
      web-based targeted cognitive training (TCT) vs. web-based general cognitive exercises (GCE),
      both delivered via portable laptop computers. The investigators will examine the behavioral
      and functional changes seen immediately after the intervention as well as at 6-month
      follow-up, compared to a treatment as usual group (TAU). This will be the first study to
      investigate cognitive enhancement for young RO schizophrenia patients in community mental
      health settings, using scalable interactive neurotechnology, and the first to compare two
      distinct cognitive training approaches. This study will generate high impact data on the
      potential for targeted pre-emotion of the downward spiral of in cognitive and functional
      disability that often characterizes psychotic illness. It will also generate valuable data on
      the relative effects of two distinct cognitive training approaches in schizophrenia, each
      derived from a very different theoretical rationale, providing much-needed information on the
      efficacy of a targeted &quot;distributed neural system&quot; training model derived from systems
      neuroscience vs. a &quot;general cognitive stimulation&quot; training model derived from
      neuropsychological rehabilitation approaches.

      The aims of this project are based on the current state of early psychosis research, as well
      as the investigators' own experience successfully applying neuroscience-informed cognitive
      training in schizophrenia. It is now abundantly clear that cognitive/neural system
      dysfunction represents a significant risk factor for schizophrenia as well as a poor
      prognostic indicator. Functional outcome in RO schizophrenia is predicted by level of
      cognitive impairment and baseline cognitive reserve, and recent findings suggest that
      specialized EIS programs focusing only on symptom reduction and psychosocial support may not
      robustly improve long-term outcomes— indicating that critical treatment targets are not being
      addressed at present in early psychosis interventions. Cognitive dysfunction and underlying
      neural system inefficiency should therefore be one of the primary targets for pre-emptive
      intervention in early psychosis. In this study, the investigators will determine whether this
      goal can be achieved using cognitive training delivered via a portable computer, in order to
      improve functional outcome in young individuals with RO schizophrenia.

    <description>Neurocognition will be assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery [MCCB]. The MCCB assesses the following domains of neurocognitive functioning: 1) Speed of Processing, 2) Attention/Vigilance, 3) Working Memory, 4) Verbal Learning, 5) Visual Learning, 6) Reasoning and Problem Solving; and 7) Social Cognition. We will also assess Verbal Memory (HVLT delayed recall), Visual Memory (BVMT delayed recall), and administer an additional measure of Reasoning and Problem Solving [BACS Tower of London]. In addition to the MCCB measure of social cognition, we will assess the following constructs: affect recognition, emotional prosody [Penn Prosody Identification, and theory of mind [Faux Pas test.7 hours spread over 3 appointments in a 1-2 week period, 5 hours post-training and an additional 5 hours at a 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <description>TCT exercises consist of three modules: an Auditory Processing Module (40-50 hours of training); a Visual Processing Module (30 hours); a Cognitive Control Module prototype (20 hours). [Based on the results of our current RCT, Posit Science has revised aspects of the training modules in order to further optimize its effectiveness for treatment of schizophrenia. In this study, we will use updated versions of the training software: an Auditory Module (20 hours), and a Social Module (10 hours). Features from the Cognitive Control module prototype have been expanded and incorporated into these new modules.</description>
