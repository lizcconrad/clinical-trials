      The investigators propose to develop a smartphone app (called OFFBup) that will help patients
      manage opioid withdrawal during buprenorphine taper and detoxification. The OFFBup smartphone
      intervention will be a resource patients can access anytime and anywhere. If the OFFBup
      intervention were to be effective in helping patients undergoing buprenorphine detoxification
      by decreasing relapse to illicit drug use, it could be integrated into the standard of care
      of office-based buprenorphine clinical practices, as well as methadone programs, thereby
      having a substantial public health impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, the rates of opioid misuse and entry in substance abuse treatment for
      opioid dependence have increased significantly. An increasing number of opioid dependent
      individuals are being treated with buprenorphine (an effective, safe, more convenient,
      accessible alternative to methadone treatment). After a period of maintenance for patients,
      the majority of opioid dependent patients are interested in coming off the medication, either
      out of personal preference (e.g., don't want to substitute on addiction for another) or
      necessity (e.g., can't afford it). Buprenorphine discontinuation, even when planned as a
      dosing taper, is often associated with opiate withdrawal and many patients express concern
      about the anticipated withdrawal symptoms; in turn, many experience decreased self-efficacy
      to remain abstinent during the process. There is a lack of available treatment resources to
      help patients manage buprenorphine discontinuation effectively. Therefore, the investigators
      propose to harness the advantages afforded by existing technologies to address this
      important, unmet treatment need. The investigators propose to develop a smartphone
      application (called OFFBup) that will help patients manage withdrawal during buprenorphine
      taper and detoxification. The components of the OFFBup application will be consistent with
      Relapse Prevention Theory (e.g., coping with withdrawal, increasing self-efficacy) and
      operationalized following the tenets of Self-Determination Theory (i.e., competence,
      autonomy, and relatedness). After the development of the OFFBup application, we will conduct
      a small RCT of 50 opioid dependent patients undergoing buprenorphine discontinuation to
      determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the OFFBup application. The OFFBup
      smartphone intervention will be a resource where patients can access (anytime and anywhere)
      educational information, emotional and instrumental support, and that permits self-monitoring
      with accompanying feedback. If the OFFBup application were to be effective in helping
      patients undergoing buprenorphine detoxification by decreasing relapse to illicit drug use,
      it could be integrated into the standard of care of office-based buprenorphine clinical
      practices, as well as methadone programs, thereby having a substantial public health impact.
