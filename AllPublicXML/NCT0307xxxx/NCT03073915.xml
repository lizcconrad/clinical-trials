  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients hospitalized in internal wards are at risk for VTE. The current guidelines recommend
      the use of thromboprophylaxis for 7-10 days among patients who are at increased risk for VTE.
      Yet several retrospective studies have shown that the compliance with this guideline is low.
      Physicians are often reluctant to administer LMWH to their fragile patients mainly because
      they are not convince that the risk associated with such therapy is greater than the risk for
      VTE.

      In the current study, data concerning the use of thromboprophylaxis among patients admitted
      to the medical wards will be collected. The occurrence of bleeding or thrombotic event will
      be evaluated prospectively.

      Data concerning the use of LMWH among patients admitted to the medical wards at the Hadassah
      University Hospital will be collected prospectively from the electronic medical records. The
      occurrence of bleeding episodes or thrombotic events will be followed for the next 90 days
      following discharge from the hospital.

      The percent of patients actually treated by LMWH among patients entitled for such therapy
      according to the most updated international guidelines will be evaluated. The risk of minor
      and major bleeding will be compared among those given thromboprophylaxis and those who were
      not treated. Similar comparison will be made for thrombotic events.
