    <textblock>
      This is a phase II prospective, randomized, double-blind, longitudinal study evaluating
      whether the administration of aspirin can delay or slow tumor growth and maintain or improve
      hearing in VS patients.

    <intervention_model_description>In the Randomized Treatment Phase, patients aged 12 years or older with VSs will be identified and recruited into one of two randomized groups who receive either 1) 325 mg aspirin twice daily (81 mg aspirin twice daily for pediatric patients &lt;50 kg); or 2) a placebo. Patients will stay on aspirin/placebo as long as there is no more than 20% increase in VS volume. At tumor progression, patients will enter the Open Label Follow Up Phase. Patients who progress on placebo will receive unblinded aspirin. Patients who progress on aspirin (either blinded or unblinded) will be taken off study drug and followed. All patients will be followed for at least 3.5 years after randomization.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiographic diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma (NF2-associated or sporadic).

          -  Ageâ‰¥12 years.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent.Pediatric patients must provide assent in addition
             to their parents'/guardians' consent. Adult patients who cannot consent for themselves
             will not be eligible to participate in this study.

          -  Ability to swallow tablets.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to perform volumetric measurements of vestibular schwannoma(s).

          -  Inability to tolerate MRI with contrast.

          -  Daily use of aspirin within the last two months. Occasional use of aspirin for pain
             relief is not exclusionary.

          -  Known allergy to aspirin.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of aspirin.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Patients with serious medical illnesses (e.g. severe asthma) that in the option of the
             investigator could prevent participation in the trial.

          -  Active bleeding diathesis.

          -  Hydrocephalus from brainstem compression.

          -  Febrile illness or flu-like illness in children and adolescents less than 18 years of
             age.
