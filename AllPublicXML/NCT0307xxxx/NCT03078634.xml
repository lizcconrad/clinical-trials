  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomised controlled trial comparing standard outpatient clinic treatment with
      multi-disciplinary clinic treatment for functional gastrointestinal disorders. Patients will
      be followed up to end of clinic treatment and 12 months beyond the end of treatment.
      Symptoms, quality of life, costs to the healthcare system and psychological outcomes will be
      assessed.
