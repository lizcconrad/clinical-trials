  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if the presence of bacterias with probiotic
      characteristics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium longum) in a commercial milk,
      control some measures that indicate cariogenic processes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a disease caused by a shift in pH balance, resulting in the formation of a
      biofilm composed mainly of cariogenic microflora. The interaction between this microflora and
      host factors conditions the deceleration or acceleration of the disease. Some biotechnology
      tools have been tried based on all this research, including probiotics, intended for a
      selective control of the etiological agents of caries and the maintenance of oral
      homeostasis.

      Methodology: In this study, preschool children belonging to public preschool in Villavicencio
      and Pasto, Colombia will be invited to participate. After obtaining parent´s informed
      consent, the children will start commercial milk (nanPro3 Nestlé) intake without probiotic
      during 3 months. One week after, they will start commercial milk with probiotic during others
      3 months. Clinical and microbiological testing of saliva at baseline, 3 m and 6m will be
      performed. Differences in salivary pH (before and after a sugar solution), remineralization
      and demineralization in early Stage Decay and Established decay tooth (according ICDAS) and
      quantification of Streptococci of the mutans group. Expected results: Statistically
      significant decrease in pH drop, demineralization in decay tooth and quantification of
      Streptococci of the mutans group.
