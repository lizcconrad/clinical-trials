  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about how treatment with vitamin D can affect iron
      metabolism and blood levels of hepcidin (hormone controlling iron levels) in people with
      chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      Iron is an essential mineral which is a major component of proteins that carry oxygen in the
      blood. Problems with iron metabolism can lead to low blood levels (anemia), which can
      commonly happen in people with CKD.

      New research over the last decade has uncovered a new hormone called `hepcidin', which is
      made in the liver and released into the blood. Hepcidin controls how much iron is in the
      blood by preventing the absorption of iron from food. Blood levels of hepcidin C are found to
      be high in people with CKD, and a recent small study in people with normal kidney function
      showed that treatment with vitamin D decreased hepcidin levels.

      In this study, investigators would like to examine the effects of vitamin D (Ergocalciferol)
      on iron metabolism and blood levels of hepcidin in individuals with CKD.
