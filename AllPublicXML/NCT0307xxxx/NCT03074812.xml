    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on
      non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including depression and cognitive symptoms.
      Participants are randomized to receive active or sham tDCS for 30 minutes over 10 treatment
      sessions.

    <description>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a commonly used non-invasive form of brain stimulation for studying motor functions in health and disease [36]. It involves the attachment of surface electrodes to the scalp through which very small electric currents (1 or 2mA) are applied via a current regulated device. The currents do not produce any sensation. The applied current affects excitability of underlying neural tissue.</description>
