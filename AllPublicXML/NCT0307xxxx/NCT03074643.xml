  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of diet composition (i.e., amount of protein and
      carbohydrate) during a 6-month weight loss intervention and 12-months of follow-up on
      physical function, muscle mass, and weight loss maintenance in obese older adults.
      Participants will receive either a protein or carbohydrate supplement along with a behavioral
      weight loss intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a 3-group design in 225 obese (BMI 30-45 kg/m2), older (65-79 years) men
      and women at risk for disability (SPPB â‰¤10) who will undergo a 6-month weight loss
      intervention followed by a 12-month follow-up phase to test the overall hypothesis that a
      higher protein (1.2 g/kg body wt/d) / lower carbohydrate (CHO) diet during a 6-month weight
      loss intervention improves physical function compared with an isocaloric lower protein (the
      current Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), 0.8 g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet, and
      whether continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet for 12-months following weight loss will
      result in better maintenance of improved physical function. All participants will undergo a
      6-month weight loss intervention involving caloric restriction and supervised exercise
      followed by 12 months of follow-up with randomization to one of three groups (n=75/group): 1)
      Lower protein / higher CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (RecProt); 2) Higher
      protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only (6-mo HiProt); or 3) Higher
      protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-month follow-up phases (18-mo
      HiProt). Physical function (primary aim) will be assessed by the expanded Short Physical
      Performance Battery (primary outcome) and lower extremity muscle strength and power at
      baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-months. Weight loss maintenance and body composition (secondary aim)
      will be assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computed tomography (CT) at
      baseline, 6- and 18-months. Bone mineral density (DXA) and cardiometabolic risk factors will
      also be measured at baseline, 6- and 18-months.

    <description>All participants will undergo a dietary weight loss intervention designed to elicit behavioral changes leading to decreased caloric intake sufficient to yield a ~10% loss of initial body mass. The weight loss intervention will incorporate nutrition education (via group and individual meetings with the study dietitian), self-monitoring skills, cognitive-behavioral strategies for promoting lifestyle behavior modifications, and planned meals. Behavioral and educational group and individual sessions will be held weekly in a 3:1 ratio (3 group and 1 individual session per month).</description>
