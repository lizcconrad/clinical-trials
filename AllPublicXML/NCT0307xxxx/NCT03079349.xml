  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test whether the investigator's educational methodology is associated with increasing
      learning of participants. The investigators second objective is to test the hypothesis that
      learning in an online classroom would result in similar outcomes as the traditional
      classroom.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will be randomized into a &quot;control&quot; group attending a traditional classroom and a
      &quot;trial&quot; group of equal numbers participating in an online synchronous Internet streaming
      classroom.

      Main outcome measures: Pre and post multiple choice examinations of Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex
      (VOR), Movement, Head Turns, Head Tremor, Neurodegeneration, Inferior Olivary Complex,
      Collateral Projections, Eye Movement Training, Visual Saccades, Head Saccades, Visual
      Impairment, Walking Speed, Neuroprotection, Autophagy, Hyperkinetic Movement, Eye and Head
      Stability, Oscilllatory Head Movements, Gaze Stability, Leaky Neural Integrator, Cervical
      Dystonia, Interstitial Nucleus of Cajal (INC) and Head Tilts, Visual Pursuits, Optokinetic
      Stimulation, Vestibular Rehabilitation.

      Methods: All candidates will take a pretest examination of the subject material. Two 9-hour
      and one 8-hour sessions over 3 consecutive days will be given live in the classroom or
      synchronously in the online classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. Subjects
      randomized to the online classroom will attend the lectures in a location of their choice and
      will view the sessions live on the Internet. A posttest examination will be given to all
      candidates after completion of the course.
