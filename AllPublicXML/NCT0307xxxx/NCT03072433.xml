  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cluster-randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a four-day
      hospital-based intervention program for primary caregivers of children with severe
      malnutrition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mortality rates remain high in hospitalized children with severe malnutrition and long-term
      impairments in child development exist in children that do survive. Hospitalized children
      with severe malnutrition will be allocated to an intervention or standard of care group in
      each one-week cycle. The intervention package consists of a counseling and support program
      that includes three modules: 1) psychosocial stimulation; 2) nutrition and feeding; and 3)
      water, sanitation and hygiene. Assessments will be done at baseline (t=0) and follow-up (t=6
      months). The primary outcome is child development, which will be assessed using the Malawi
      Developmental Assessment Tool, a validated tool for gross and fine motor, language, and
      social development.
