  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The outcomes from prior clinical evaluation of the study device, including successfully
      treating 99% (84/85) of the intended target vessels and 96% (27/28) limb patency observed at
      one year, demonstrate the potential benefits of the device. When contrasted with open
      repair's significant complication rates and branch fenestrated device's significant anatomic
      and logistic limitations, the potential risk of the proposed novel graft does not outweigh
      the potential benefit of widened anatomic availability and improved patency rates. Given the
      potential benefits, the investigators feel that it is justified to expose the target patient
      population to the potential risk. The non-clinical testing performed by Medtronic and the
      clinical results reported by Sanford Health show adequate safety of the device to support an
      early feasibility study.

      The investigators would like to perform an early feasibility study under a defined and
      controlled protocol to collect prospective preliminary safety and device functionality data.
      The investigators believe an early feasibility study is most appropriate for this novel
      approach. The limited sample size allows adequate patient data to be collected under a
      controlled protocol without exposing a large patient population to the risk associated with a
      novel device design.

      This study is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the
      therapeutic benefit of the TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System. A total of 15 patients will
      be enrolled in the study.

        -  10 subjects total will be treated in the primary study arm

        -  5 subjects total will be treated in the expanded selection arm

      The duration of the Investigation is anticipated as follows:

        -  Time to Complete Enrollment: 24 months

        -  Subject Follow-up Time: 5 years from last subject enrollment

        -  Total Duration Time: 7 years

      The primary objective of the clinical investigation &quot;Visceral Manifold Study for the repair
      of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms&quot; is to assess the use of the TAAA Debranching Stent
      Graft System to repair thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms in patients having appropriate
      anatomy. The primary intent of the study is to assess safety acutely (i.e. freedom from major
      adverse events (MAE) at 30 days) and preliminary effectiveness (i.e., treatment success and
      technical success) of the device acutely (i.e., the proportion of treatment group subjects
      that achieve and maintain treatment success at one year).

      Additionally, the study will assess technical success and treatment success at each follow-up
      interval.

    <description>The TAAA Debranching Stent Graft System is made up of two main body components and makes use of several off-the-shelf FDA-approved stent graft components. The two custom main body grafts are the thoracic bifurcation and the visceral manifold. The thoracic bifurcation is deployed in the thoracic aorta and provides the proximal seal for the device. The two limbs of the thoracic bifurcation allows for continued aortic flow while deploying the visceral segment. The visceral manifold is deployed within the larger 20 mm limb of the thoracic bifurcation to set the stage for the visceral debranching. The branches of the visceral manifold extend to the visceral vessel with the use of covered bridging stents and provide distal seal of the manifold.</description>
