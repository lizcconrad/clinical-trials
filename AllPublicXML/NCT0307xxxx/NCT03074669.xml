      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program in reducing anxiety symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and level of acceptability of an
      Internet-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) program in reducing symptoms of
      anxiety. The effectiveness of the intervention will be compared with a wait-list control
      group using a randomized control trial (RCT) design. The participants with high / clinical
      levels of anxiety from the active treatment group will have the opportunity to read seven ACT
      modules and receive personalized feedback for their completed homework assignments.

      The intervention will be delivered online and participants will have seven weeks to complete
      the seven modules (we might add one extra week of treatment for all participants in the event
      they need to compensate the treatment delays accumulated during the previous seven weeks).

    <description>Participants from the active treatment group will be granted access to seven modules that are structured like chapters of a self-help book adapted for the online environment. In addition, participants from the experimental arm will be guided by an on-line therapist throughout the program duration. The on-line therapists are graduate students in clinical psychology who work under the supervision of an experienced psychotherapist. Participants will be asked to fill in a series of self-report measures to monitor their anxiety and some ACT specific processes (i.e., acceptance, mindfulness, experiential avoidance) throughout the intervention.</description>

    <description>During the first seven weeks, participants in the wait-list control group will only be asked to fill in a series of self-report measures to monitor their anxiety and some ACT specific processes (i.e., acceptance, mindfulness, experiential avoidance). Following the experimental group's completion of the program, participants in this group will also receive the intervention. All participants will be contacted 6 months after the intervention has concluded in order to conduct a follow-up assessment.</description>
