  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the safe and recommended dose of APR-246 in
      combination with azacitidine as well as to see if this combination of therapy improves
      overall survival.

      Participants will be treated for a total of 6 cycles. For participants responding or who have
      stable disease following cycle 6, treatment may continue until one of the following criteria
      applies:

        -  Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,

        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s),

        -  Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or

        -  General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant
           unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

        -  Evidence of disease progression by the International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria.

      Participants who wish not to continue treatment at time of disease assessment at end of cycle
      6 will complete their end of treatment visit upon completion of cycle 6.

    <description>Participants will be evaluated for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 2 cycles of therapy, i.e., 8 weeks for purpose of deciding the dose for next cohort. DLT is defined as follows based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03: Treatment related non-hematological CTCAE grade 3-4 toxicity that lead to dose modification or withdrawal; Grade 3 metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities that are not clinically significant, and are adequately controlled within 72 hours are not to be considered DLT; Grade 3 nausea/vomiting/diarrhea despite maximum medical therapy; Grade 3 central nervous system (CNS) toxicity despite maximal medical therapy.</description>
