    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of bevacizumab (Avastin®) combined with standard
      chemotherapy in participant with advanced cervical cancer, with special focus on the
      incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) fistulas and GI perforations in the
      common practice setting.

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with GI and GU fistulas and GI perforation events will be reported according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE V4.0).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Received Radiotherapy Prior to GI and GU Fistulas and GI Perforation Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who received radiotherapy prior to GI and GU fistulas and GI perforation events will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants who Received Internal, External and Other Radiotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who received internal, external and other radiotherapy will be reported. External radiotherapy will include &quot;Non Precision Orientated&quot; that includes classic cobalt or &quot;Precision Orientated&quot; that includes Linear accelerator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Doses of Prior Radiotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Doses of prior radiotherapy will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Selected Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for this study included: hypertension, proteinuria, wound healing complication, bleeding /haemorrrhage (including pulmonary haemorrhage and CNS bleeding), arterial and venous thromboembolic events (ATES; VTES), congestive heart failure (CHF), posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), fistula/abscess (other than genitourinary and gastrointestinal), gastrointestinal perforations and gallbladder perforation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. In the case where the only target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment to the first occurrence of progression, or death from any cause as assessed by the investigator. Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since study entry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment to death from any cause.</description>
