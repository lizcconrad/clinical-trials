  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain Threshold measured using Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre-treatment to Post-treatment, 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured using Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT) testing. Pressure will be applied to subjects using a digital algometer. Three trials for PPT will be done and the mean value will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in function measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Subjects answer to questions. Their responses indicate no impact to great impact. Scores for each question range from 0 to 5. Total score for the ODI is 50. The higher the score, the greater level of disability/function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Low Back Pain measured using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Pain intensity will be assessed using an 11-point scale. Scores on the scale range from &quot;0&quot; indicating no pain, &quot;1&quot; slight pain, and &quot;10&quot; strongest imaginable pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ is completed by the subject. It determines the level of fear and avoidance about work and physical activity. The measure is comprised of two subscales: a four item physical activity subscale (FABQ-W), and a seven-item work subscale (FABQ-W). An elevated FABQ score is predictive of the development of chronic disability in low back pain (LBP) patients.</description>
