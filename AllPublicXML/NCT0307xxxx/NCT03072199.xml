  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RITA-MI aims to develop of a novel therapeutic concept to target the immune response in
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) by depleting B-cells with a single injection
      of Rituximab which is approved for clinical use in cancer, autoimmune disease and
      inflammatory conditions. The goal is to re-purpose the drug, and translate the discovery into
      benefit for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. Rituximab is expected to limit
      infarction size and improve the healing process, as complementary to other therapeutic
      strategies.

      The applicants intend to perform a clinical study in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (MI). The objective is to find the optimal dose (lowest dose with highest
      biological efficacy and best safety profile) for peripheral blood B cell depletion during the
      first 6 days after injection, and selective molecular signatures associated with improved
      heart function through analysis of peripheral blood samples.

      The study rationale is to decrease the inflammatory reaction upon tissue necrosis following
      heart muscle ischemia.

    <measure>Safety - Review of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events;</measure>
    <time_frame>6month</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse and serious adverse events will be reviewed by daily history taking and clinical examination of patients whilst they are an inpatient. Subsequently patients will be followed up on discharge daily until day 6 with telephone follow up. On days 6, 14 and 6month patients will be assess again in an outpatient setting where adverse events will be documented. There is additional follow telephone follow up at day 30. After each group of 6 patients are recruited and infused with rituximab, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review the clinical and biological data and their side effect profile, including adverse events.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety - Clinically significant changes in biochemical and haematological markers</measure>
    <time_frame>6month</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemistry and haematology bloods will be taken daily after drug administration whilst an inpatient. Upon discharge bloods will be taken on days 6, 14 and 6month for further assessment. Any new abnormalities will be flagged. After each group of 6 patients are recruited and infused with rituximab, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review the clinical and biological data and their side effect profile, including adverse events.</description>

    <measure>Safety - Clinically significant ECG changes</measure>
    <time_frame>6month</time_frame>
    <description>Arrhythmia will be assess as patients will have continued cardiac monitoring whilst an inpatient. ECGs will be performed daily whilst an inpatient and also during outpatient attendance. QTc will be assessed using the Bazett formula. After each group of 6 patients are recruited and infused with rituximab, an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review the clinical and biological data and their side effect profile, including adverse events.</description>
