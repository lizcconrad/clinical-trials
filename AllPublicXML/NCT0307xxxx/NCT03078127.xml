  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study investigating the effectiveness and clinical efficacy of airway
      clearance therapy (ACT) in cystic fibrosis (CF). Enrolled subjects will undergo measurements
      of mucociliary clearance (MCC) and exhaled biomarkers at baseline and after 3 different forms
      of ACT: high frequency chest wall oscillatory vest, oscillatory positive expiratory pressure
      device, and whole-body vibration.
