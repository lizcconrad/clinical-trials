        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has signed and dated the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  The subject is healthy when requesting contraception.

          -  The subject is between 18 - 29 years of age (inclusive) at the time of signing the
             ICF.

          -  The subject has normal or clinically insignificant cervical smear for oncocytology
             (i.e. Pap test) not requiring further follow up (a cervical smear has to be taken at
             the Screening Visit [Visit 1] or a normal result has to have been documented within
             the previous 6 months).

          -  The subject has a history of regular (i.e., endogenous cyclicity without hormonal
             contraceptive use) cyclic menstrual periods (length of cycle 21 - 35 days), as
             confirmed by the subject.

          -  The subject is willing and able to attend the scheduled study visits and to comply
             with the study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or current lactation (less than 6 weeks postpartum or since abortion before
             the Screening Visit)

          -  Infected abortion or postpartum endometritis within 3 months prior to the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Chronic, daily use of drugs that may increase serum potassium levels.

          -  Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.

          -  Acute cervicitis or vaginitis (until successfully treated).

          -  Lower urinary tract infection (until successfully treated).

          -  Acute or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease or conditions associated with increased
             risk for pelvic infections.

          -  Congenital or acquired uterine anomaly including fibroids, in the opinion of the
             investigator, which would interfere with insertion and/or retention of the
             intrauterine system (i.e., if they distort the uterine cavity).

          -  Cervical neoplasia, uterine or cervical malignancy, or sex hormone-dependent tumors.

          -  History of migraine, focal migraine with asymmetrical visual loss or other symptoms
             indicating transient cerebral ischemia.
