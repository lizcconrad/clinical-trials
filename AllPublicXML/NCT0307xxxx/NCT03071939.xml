  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a disease of young adults that affects 1% of the general population.
      According to numerous studies, it has been estimated that between 50% and 80% of patients
      with schizophrenia do not consider to have a mental disorder and are therefore not aware of
      their disorders. A poor degree of insight is associated with poor compliance, a higher number
      of re-hospitalizations, altered social and relational functioning, and a higher number of
      suicides and violent behaviors. This is why insight, which is an essential dimension of
      psychopathology, must be evaluated, as it depends to a large extent on the therapeutic
      alliance, adherence to treatment, likelihood of relapse and prognosis.

      Evaluation (test, re-test) This new tool for assessing insight will allow for a discrepancy
      in assessment and a more refined assessment with a view to developing specific care for the
      patient and / or the relative with regard to the three dimensions Evaluated: disease,
      treatment and functional implications

    <measure>Correlation greater than 0.40 to inter-judge fidelity to Cohen's Kappa test</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-judicial fidelity will be measured with Cohen's Kappa test, which is a coefficient to measure the agreement between two qualitative variables with the same modalities. Conventionally, it is used to measure the degree of concordance between the stages Awarded by two judges. It can also be applied to measure an intra-observer agreement.
The closer the ratio is to 1, the closer the gap between the observed chord proportion and the theoretical proportion of &quot;random&quot; chords approaches the gap between the perfect tuning of the two observers and their random match. The coefficient is always between -1 and 1 (maximum agreement).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cronbach's alpha coefficient with a value of 0.7 measuring internal consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>Internal consistency will be measured with the Cronbach alpha coefficient, sometimes referred to simply as the coefficient.
Which is a statistic used especially in psychometrics to measure the internal consistency (or reliability) of the questions asked during a test (the answers to the questions on the same subject to be correlated). Its value is between 0 and 1, being considered &quot;acceptable&quot; from 0.7. It therefore allows estimation of the fidelity of the score to a test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation greater than 0.40 at the Bravais-Pearson test measuring test fidelity, re-testing</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>This coefficient makes it possible to detect the presence or absence of a linear relationship between two continuous quantitative characters. To calculate this coefficient, one must first calculate the covariance. Covariance is the mean of the product of deviations from the mean. The linear correlation coefficient of two characters X and Y is equal to the covariance of X and Y divided by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y. It can be shown that this coefficient varies between -1 and +1</description>

    <description>This study will evaluate the insight of the patient, something carried out in common practice within the Eastern Pole (CH Le Vinatier). This assessment will take place in the specific services where patients are cared for. It will make it possible to evaluate insight more closely by comparing the opinions of the three actors. There is no risk in this study.
The study will be carried out over 2 years with a recruitment of 119 patients responding to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, taken care of within the Eastern Pole (Intra and Extrahospital services).</description>
