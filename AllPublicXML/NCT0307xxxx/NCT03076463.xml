  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this is study is to evaluate the long-term effects of grape polyphenols in the
      modulation of markers of metabolic syndrome. Most of the previous works about polyphenols
      have only considered a fraction of polyphenols, i.e., extractable polyphenols. As a
      consequence, an important amount of dietary polyphenols, the so-called non-extractable
      polyphenols are ignored. In contrast, the effect of both extractable and non-extractable
      polyphenols will be considered in this study. Also, studies on the long-term effect of grape
      polyphenol on markers of metabolic syndrome have been mostly conducted in animals, so
      clinical trials on this topic are needed.

      Fifty supposedly healthy volunteers with at least two cardiometabolic risk factors were
      recruited. The cardiometabolic risk factors used to select the subjects are described below.

      The whole intervention will be divided in 2 periods, control (CTR) and dried and milled grape
      pomace (GRAPOM). The two periods will have a duration of 6 weeks. During the CTR period,
      subjects will follow their normal dietary habits and samples will be collected at the
      beginning and at the end. No proper placebo could be found for the product, so this CTR
      period was chosen. During the GRAPOM period, the subjects will daily consume 8 g of the
      product solved in water and samples will be collected at the beginning and at the end.
