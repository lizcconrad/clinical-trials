  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR), the R-enantiomer of Lansoprazole, is an FDA approved
      drug (2009) for the management of erosive esophagitis and nonerosive reflux disease 1.
      Dexlansoprazole has a unique dual delayed-release delivery system designed to address unmet
      needs that may accompany traditional proton pump inhibitors, with two separate pH-depended
      release phases, the first in the proximal duodenum and the second in the more distal small
      intestine. This dual release system extends the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamics
      effects beyond those of single-release PPIs, allowing for dosing at any time of the day
      without regard to meals 1. A study conducted by Fass et al. has shown that the use of
      dexlansoprazole MR 30 mg in patients with symptomatic GERD is significantly more effective
      than placebo in improving nocturnal heartburn, reducing GERD-related sleep disturbances, and
      consequently improving work productivity, sleep quality and quality of life 2.

      Because of its pharmacokinetic properties, Dexlansoprazole modified release (MR) may prove
      beneficial in optimizing the management of GERD and the associated burdens that often surface
      after the heavy evening and Suhur meals, such as increased nocturnal symptoms and poor sleep
      quality.
