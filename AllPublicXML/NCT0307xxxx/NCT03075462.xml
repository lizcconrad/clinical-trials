  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2
      inhibitor; Apatinib is an oral selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)
      inhibitor. This open-label, dose finding phase I trial studies the tolerability and the best
      dose of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib and to see how well these two drugs work
      together in the treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer or triple negative breast
      cancer. The safety and efficacy of fluzoparib in combination with apatinib will be explored.
      Both dose escalation and dose expansion parts are included in this study.

          -  Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to fluzoparib, apatinib or any of the
             excipients of the products.

          -  Ongoing infection (determined by investigator).
