  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators recently completed and published a study that demonstrated that
      fexofenadine pharmacokinetics are significantly altered in dialysis patients (Thomson et al.
      (2015) American Journal of Kidney Diseases 65(4):574-582). In this study, patients were
      studied directly before routine dialysis treatment. Other published literature suggests the
      timing of the dose of some drugs (before or after dialysis) may have a profound impact on the
      drug pharmacokinetics (Nolin et al (2006) 17(9):2363-7). The hypothesis is that compounds
      that accumulate in the blood of patients with kidney failure impact the pharmacokinetics such
      that dosing before or after dialysis produces significantly different blood levels of the
      drug.

  <detailed_description>

      This will be an open, randomized pharmacokinetic study in 30 patients treated by dialysis.
      Patients will be asked to spend an additional 3 hours at the hospital on each of two study
      days separated by at least a week. At the first study visit, the patient will be randomized
      to receive the drug fexofenadine (120 mg, orally) either 3 hour prior to, OR at the
      conclusion of their regularly scheduled dialysis treatment. Three hours following
      fexofenadine administration, a single 4 mL (approximately 1 teaspoon) blood sample will be
      drawn. One week or more after the first study day, the patient will have the study repeated
      but with the timing of the dose altered to match the randomization. For example, if at the
      first study visit the patient received fexofenadine after their dialysis session, they will
      now receive the drug 3 hours prior to their dialysis session. The blood sample will be
      centrifuged immediately and plasma stored at -80 celsius until analysis. Fexofenadine
      concentration will be determine by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
