    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, three-period, cross-over study to investigate the effect
      of single doses of sumatriptan (Imitrex) 100 mg on the pharmacodynamics of single doses of
      lasmiditan 200 mg. The study will last approximately 6 weeks including up to 3 weeks for
      screening and 22 days on study. Screening will be conducted within approximately 21 days of
      the first dose of study medication. Each dosing period will last 3 days (Day 1, Day 1, and
      Day 2). A wash-out period of 6 days will take place between each dose. The End of Study Visit
      (EoS) will take place 5 (+/- 2) days after the third dosing period is completed.
