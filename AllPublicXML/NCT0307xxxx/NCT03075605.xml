      This is a prospective case control study that compares the initial immune response with
      severity and outcome in patients with acute pancreatitis. Therefore, the investigators aim to
      determine whether etiology of acute pancreatitis, segregates with candidate genetic
      polymorphisms and their m-RNA expression, as well as whether functional polymorphisms in
      inflammation regulating genes predict a more severe outcome in acute pancreatits. The
      investigators anticipate that based on our results that we will provide a more accurate
      predictor of the clinical course of acute pancreatits and help direct more aggressive or
      cytokine specific treatment of patients at greater risk of a more severe form of the disease.

      Serum and DNA and urine samples will be collected and stored without personal identifiers
      (e.g. using a unique laboratory number or bar code) for future research involving pancreatic
      diseases to include pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Stored biospecimens collected for
      htis protocol may be shared in a de-identified manner with outside investigators with the
      approval of the principal investigator.
