  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if atezolizumab and bevacizumab can help
      to control rare solid tumors.

      This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of metastatic (has spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of metastatic
      colorectal cancer, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, recurrent
      (has come back after treatment) glioblastoma, cervical cancer, and platinum-resistant (a type
      of chemotherapy) recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      The combination of these drugs to treat the type of cancer you have is considered
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 160 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 21 days.

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will receive atezolizumab and bevacizumab by vein over about 60
      minutes each.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of every odd-numbered cycle (Cycles 1, 3, 5, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of every even-numbered cycle (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  During Cycle 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn before your dose of study drugs
           for biomarker testing.

        -  During Cycle 2, you will have an image-guided core biopsy to check the status of the
           disease and for biomarker testing.

      On Day 8 of Cycles 1 and Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      Every 9-12 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan.

      At any time the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG and either an ECHO or MUGA
      scan.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If the disease got worse,
           this sample will also be used for biomarker testing.

        -  If the disease got worse, you will have an image-guided core biopsy to check the status
           of the disease.

      Follow-Up:

      About every 3 months after your end-of-treatment visit, you or your family/caregiver will be
      called by the study staff and asked how you are doing. This call should last about 15
      minutes. The study staff may also access your medical records or publically available records
      to learn about your long-term health status.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent Form

          2. Age &gt;/= 18 years

          3. Ability to comply with the study protocol, in the investigator's judgment

          4. Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesions can be
             considered as measurable disease only if progressive disease has been unequivocally
             documented at that site since radiation. The pleural mesothelioma cohort will require
             measurable disease according to modified RECIST as specified in the appended
             manuscript.

          5. ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1

          6. Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, defined by the following laboratory test
             results, obtained within 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment: ANC &gt;/= 1.5 x
             10(9)/L without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support; Lymphocyte count &gt;/=
             0.5 x 10(9)/L; Platelet count &gt;/= 100 x 10(9)/L without transfusion; WBC Count &gt;/=
             2500/ul; Hemoglobin &gt;/= 90 g/L [Patients may be transfused to meet this criterion];
             AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt;/= 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), with
             the following exceptions: Patients with documented liver metastases: AST and ALT &lt;/= 5
             x ULN Patients with documented liver or bone metastases: ALP &lt;/= 5 x ULN - Serum
             bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN - Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN - Serum albumin &gt;/= 2.5 g/dL -
             For patients not receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: INR or aPTT &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN

          7. For patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation: stable anticoagulant regimen

          8. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt; 1%
             per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after the last dose of study
             treatment.

          9. (cont.) A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is
             postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state (&gt;/= 12 continuous months of
             amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone
             surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive
             methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male
             sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing
             intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual
             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception.
