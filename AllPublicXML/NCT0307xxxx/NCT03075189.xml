  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to approximately 38 (unknown drop-out rate) geriatric patients (at least 65 years old) are
      recruited from a Geriatric ward at Slagelse Sygehus. After inclusion and baseline
      measurements, each individual will be randomized into either an intervention or control group
      arranged in blocks of 8 The intervention group (n≤19) will receive protein enriched
      snacks/dishes in the morning and late evening, before bedtime. Moreover, upon discharge the
      intervention group will receive individual dietary counseling focusing on choosing
      protein-rich foods and on protein rich meals. The control group (n≤19) will receive normal
      hospital food without enrichment and no dietary counseling at discharge. In both groups the
      following data will be obtained: recorded protein intake, anthropometric measurements
      (weight, height, body composition estimated with bioimpedance), functional ability (De Morton
      Mobility Index (DEMMI) and Barthels ADL-index), hand grip strength, sarkopenic status
      (SARC-F), quality of life (EQ-5D-3L), length of stay (LOS) and readmissions (within 30 days
      after discharge). During hospitalization food intake will be registered, as well as 24 hour
      recall interviews and food frequency questionnaires will be done at follow-up visits.

      Assessments will be performed at baseline, on the day of discharge and 4 weeks after
      discharge (follow up).

      The primary outcome is change in protein intake from Baseline to 4 weeks after discharge.

      The hypothesis is that serving of individually selected protein enriched snack/dish in the
      morning and before bedtime during hospitalization results in higher protein intake during
      hospitalization and that this experience combined with dietary counseling at discharge,
      results in a higher protein intake at 28 days after discharge. Further, we hypothesize that
      the increased protein intake will affect functional level, hand grip strength, sarcopenic
      status and quality of life in geriatric patients and will lead to shorter LOS and fewer
      readmission frequency.
