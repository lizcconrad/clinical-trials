  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality in the United States, yet
      less than 10% of smokers making a serious quit attempt remain abstinent from cigarettes 1
      year later, and outcomes from gold-standard behavioral interventions leave much room for
      improvement. As such, in the context of a Stage-I randomized controlled trial (RCT), this
      study will examine (1) treatment characteristics and delivery, treatment integrity, dropout,
      and acceptability, (2) smoking outcomes such as lapse, relapse, and abstinence measures, and
      (3) changes decision-making that result from a novel intervention informed by behavioral
      analysis and social cognition.

    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable mortality in the United States,
      implicated in countless health consequences, and significant economic and societal costs.
      Less than 10% of smokers making a serious quit attempt remain abstinent from cigarettes 1
      year later, and outcomes from gold-standard behavioral interventions leave much room for
      improvement. Thus the development of new interventions and improvements to existing
      interventions is imperative. Behavioral interventions for smoking cessation have
      insufficiently integrated the findings from basic research on decision-making processes.
      Thus, there is extensive laboratory-based research indicating the potential for
      laboratory-based manipulations that affect decision making relevant for smoking, the
      examination of a coherent intervention that capitalizes on this knowledge is limited. The
      proposed research is the first step toward synthesizing insights from the research domains of
      addiction, behavioral analysis, and social cognition into a cohesive formulation with
      potential impact on smoking cessation. Specifically, the research targets impulsive decision
      making associated with cigarette smoking and relapse by incorporating the influential
      Construal Level Theory.

    <description>Treatment will include a 1.5-hour intervention session combined with daily text-messaging for up to 1 week pre-quit and 4 weeks post-quit. The intervention includes: mindful breathing, visualization, and identification and thinking about goals and priorities inconsistent with smoking. During the text-messaging phase, elements of the intervention discussed during the in-person session will be reinforced. Participants will be provided transdermal nicotine patches (TNP). TNP are a safe and effective approach to nicotine replacement when an individual attempts to stop smoking and are safe for use without prescription. Participants will begin the regimen on the scheduled quit date with an initial dose of 21 mg (4 weeks), followed by 14 mg (2 weeks), and 7 mg (2 weeks). Alterations to dosing will be allowed when appropriate and consistent with manufacturer's recommendations. While TNP will be offered to all participants, they can decline or discontinue use of TNP at any time.</description>

    <description>Standard informational treatment is based on conventional, information-based smoking cessation approaches commonly found in public health settings. This will include the following information: prevalence/incidence of cigarette smoking and negative health outcomes associated with cigarette smoking (e.g., cancer, respiratory disease, complications), other health consequences resulting from diseases associated with cigarette smoking, personal/financial/social consequences of cigarette smoking. During the text-messaging phase, information about the consequences of smoking discussed during the in-person session will be reiterated. As with the experimental condition, participants will be provided with 8-weeks TNP.</description>
