  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to establish the bioequivalence of two different
      tablet formulations containing BAY77-1931. The secondary objectives of this study were to
      assess the safety and tolerability, as well as to Investigate the plasma lanthanum
      concentration after BAY 77-1931 ODT 500 mg administration.
