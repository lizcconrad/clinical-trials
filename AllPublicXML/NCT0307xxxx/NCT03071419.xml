  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study evaluates the feasibility and impact of a father-focused childhood obesity
      prevention program on paternal food-related parenting practices, mealtime behaviors and
      father/child nutrition and physical activity behaviors. Half of participants (low-income
      father and child dyads) will receive an intervention immediately while the other half of
      participants will serve as a wait-list control group and receive the intervention at a later
      date.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants (low-income father and child dyads) will receive an 8 session (2
      hours/session) (DAD) including community-based, hands-on, nutrition and parent education
      intervention with between-session technology enhancements. Dyads will be randomly assigned
      within groups of 10 to DAD or a wait-list control group (DELAY). Assessments will be
      conducted at pre, post and 1 month post including a subset of data from cohabiting mothers to
      assess moderating influences on outcomes.
