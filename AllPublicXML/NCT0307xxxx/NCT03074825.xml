    <textblock>
      Chiauranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking Aurora kinase B（Aurora
      B）、VEGFR/PDGFR/c-Kit、CSF-1R targets.

      This clinical trial is studying the efficacy and safety of chiauranib works in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in the meantime, exploring the
      latent biomarkers accompany with chiauranib, as well as the relevancy of which and clinical
      benefit.
