  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's oesophagus is a condition where the lining of the oesophagus (gullet) wall changes.
      People with Barrett's oesophagus are at risk of developing oesophageal cancer but can have
      regular checkups to detect changes before they progress to cancer. Every two years patients
      with Barrett's are offered examination by passing a fibreoptic tube into the oesophagus
      (gastroscopy) to remove small tissue samples (biopsies), which are examined in the laboratory
      to check for changes.

      Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK, and the second leading cause of
      cancer deaths. Prevention and early detection are the most effective strategies of dealing
      with bowel cancer. Most cancers develop from benign polyps (growths) in the bowel. Polyps are
      common and have the potential of developing into cancer over the course of many years.

      Patients with a prior diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus and colonic polyps undergo regular
      endoscopic examinations known as surveillance endoscopies. This is done to detect changes in
      the cells of Barrett's oesophagus or further polyps. Current practice is to capture recorded
      videos of Barrett's surveillance examinations and still images of polyps prior to their
      removal.

      Endoscope technology continues to advance. These newly developed technologies are marketed to
      have claims of superiority in performance over preceding generations often without the back
      up of scientific data but at a significant financial cost. The aim of this study is to use
      endoscopic images and videos recorded as part of routine clinical practice to compare the
      current version of Olympus endoscopes with the new version launched by the company.
