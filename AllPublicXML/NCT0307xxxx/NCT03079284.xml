    <textblock>
      Ten infants undergoing therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy will be
      enrolled in a new protocol that will allow mothers to hold their infants during the
      hypothermia treatment period. This is a safety study that will assess whether or not there is
      an increase in adverse event frequency in infants that are held during hypothermia. Parents
      and NICU nurses will be given a questionnaire after holding is complete investigating their
      feelings on maternal-infant bonding and safety of the holding protocol.

    <description>After meeting inclusion criteria and consenting to participation, mothers of infants who have completed at least 24 hours of therapeutic hypothermia treatment will be allowed to hold their infant who will remain on the cooling blanket for a 30-minute period with the use of a thermal barrier. Vital signs will be measured before holding begins, during holding and following completion of holding. Temperature will be recorded every two minutes during holding. Afterwards, a Likert scale questionnaire to assess the mother's and nurse's reactions will be administered.</description>

    <intervention_name>Holding during cooling</intervention_name>
    <description>An initial set of vital sings will be recorded before the infant is removed from the isolette. The mother will sit in a reclining chair next to the isolette and place a thermal barrier over her chest and abdomen. The infant will be transferred to the mother by placing the hands under the cooling blanket so as to move the infant and cooling blanket together as one unit. The mother will be allowed to hold for thirty minutes provided that the infant's temperature does not increase by greater than one degree centigrade and the oxygen saturation does not drop below 90%. After thirty minutes, the infant will be returned to the isolette.</description>
