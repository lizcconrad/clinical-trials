  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was to monitor effectiveness of glass ionomer sealant and resin-based sealant in
      ICDAS, and to evaluat the correlation between ICDAS and DIAGNOdent over 24 months. Over 200
      8-year-old children with at least 2 permanent molar with the International Caries Detection
      and Assessment System (ICDAS) scores 0-4 were placed glass ionomer sealant and resin-based
      sealant split-mouthed randomly, and examined with ICDAS and DIAGNOdent before sealents
      placement and 6, 12 and 24 months after.
