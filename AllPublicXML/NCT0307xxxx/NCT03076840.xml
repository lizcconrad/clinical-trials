  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hamstring muscle is an important muscle that affect the performance of almost all
      activities of daily living. Since this muscle is a large muscle that pass across two major
      joints (the hip and knee joint), it is more susceptible to become tight and to lose its
      extensibility. On the other hand, there is no agreement on a standard protocol for the
      treatment of hamstring tightness. Kinesio tape is one of the options for treatment of
      hamstring muscle, it is a safe, passive and non-painful intervention, and if proven to be
      effective it will help individuals especially those with poor compliance and poor tolerance
      to painful stretching exercises. The aim of the present study is to investigate the acute
      effectiveness of Kinesio taping on hamstring muscles extensibility. 96 students with
      hamstring tightness will be recruited from the University of Dammam to participate in this
      prospective experimental study. All participants will be assigned randomly to either a
      Kinesio tape group, Sham tape group and control group. Outcome measures will be the hamstring
      length measurement by using active knee extension test and strength measurement for hamstring
      and quadriceps muscles by using a handheld dynamometer. Outcome measurement will be taken at
      baseline and 15 minutes after the intervention.

      Design:

      Prospective, pre-post experimental study with three groups (Kinesio tape group, sham tape
      group and control group)

      Setting:

      This study was conducted at the laboratory of University of Dammam one session (half an hour)
      for each participant.

      Participants:

      96 students with hamstring tightness were recruited from the University of Dammam as a sample
      of convenience to participate in this study. These students were enrolled in the study based
      on the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Female student with an age of 18-25 years

        2. Body mass index between 18-30)

        3. students with reduced hamstring length (hamstring tightness) as defined by the
           literature (popliteal angle less than 160 degree)

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. lower limb musculoskeletal pain

        2. abdominal , lower limb and spinal surgery

        3. pregnancy

        4. previous injury or trauma to hamstring muscle, hip, knee And ankle joint

        5. Skin allergy, disease or hypersensitivity

        6. Low back pain or any neurological impairment in the lower extremity

        7. Body mass index above 30 or below 18

      Procedure:

      A poster announcement was published at University of Dammam, 96 female students were
      recruited from a convenience sampling of students. The possible participants were approached
      and the idea of the research (the duration of the participation, the length of treatment
      session, the goal of the research, any possible risks including skin irritation or allergy
      from the Kinesio tape) were explained to the student. The students were instructed about
      dealing with any skin irritation by removing the tape and applying ice in the area for 10-15
      min, students were informed that there is no compensation for any skin reaction due the
      Kinesio tape, although this may be less likely to happen . The students were given the chance
      to ask questions. If the students agree to participate in the research, they were given the
      consent form to read and ask a question again for any details and then they were asked to
      sign the consent form.

      After that, the subjects were scanned for the eligibility of fitting the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria by the primary researcher, This was done in a safe and secured room in the
      laboratories of physical therapy department where the evaluation and intervention procedures
      were taken place. If the students fit the eligibility, then the students were undergoing a
      tape allergy test by applying a small piece of Kinesio tape to the patient skin for 10
      minute. If the students pass this test by having no allergy reaction, then they were enrolled
      in the study. Students age, height, weight and body mass index(BMI) were recorded, then the
      students were undergo a 5 minute walking as a warming up to pre-condition the muscles before
      the examination. Then, hamstring length measurement, strength measurement of hamstring and
      quadriceps muscle were done (All students data will be coded and stored with the primary
      researcher through a secured password to ensure the student data confidentiality).

      The outcome measures:

        1. Hamstring length measurement:

           Hamstring muscle length was measured by using the active knee extension test
           (AKE)(Active knee extension is reliable and associated with minimal pelvic and lumber
           motion. Therefore, it considers a suitable and preferable test for evaluating the length
           of hamstring muscle. The knee extension angle (popliteal angle) was measured by using a
           conventional goniometer which is a reliable tool for measuring the range of motion

           The hamstring length measurement was performed with the student in a supine position
           with 90-degree hip flexion touching the horizontal bar apparatus.The non-tested lower
           limb was secured with a strap attached to the table. While the student maintains the
           contact between her thigh and the horizontal bar apparatus, she was asked to extend the
           leg as much as possible. The angle of the knee joint was measured by the researcher with
           a goniometer. The measurements were done three times, and the mean value were recorded

        2. Hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength measurement:

      The hamstring and quadriceps muscle strength were measured by the primary researcher by using
      the handheld dynamometer. The hamstring strength measurement was done with the student in
      prone position, then the student was asked to flex the knee as hard as possible while the
      researcher try to prevent the movement with the handheld dynamometer just proximal to the
      medial malleolus. The quadriceps strength measurement was done with the same procedure but
      from sitting position and the student was asked to extend the knee

      After finishing all of the baseline outcome measures (hamstring length measurement and the
      strength measurement), the student were given a number and were assigned randomly to either
      the Kinesio tape group or the sham tape group or the control group. Each group fellow their
      program. The outcome measurements were repeated after 15 min at the conclusion of the
      treatment period
