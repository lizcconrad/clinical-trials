  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections are an efficient method of delivering therapeutic levels of
      medications to the posterior segment of the eye. Prior to receiving an injection, there are
      various methods to provide ocular anesthesia. Vibration may have an anti-nociceptive effect
      by directly decreasing the sensitivity of peripheral nociceptors or by reducing signal
      transmission from peripheral nociceptors to the brain with activation of vibratory sensation
      pathways. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a handheld fingertip vibrator
      compared to topical eye drops for pain control while performing intravitreal eye injections.
      A secondary objective of the study is to measure corneal and conjunctiva sensitivity with and
      without activation of the vibrator to the lower lid using a Luneau Cochet-Bonnet
      aesthesiometer.

      A total of 80 patients will be recruited for part 1 of the study. Participants will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a standard anesthetic group or standard anesthetic with
      vibration groups. All intravitreal drugs will be delivered via 30 gauge needles through the
      pars plana in the inferotemporal quadrant 3.5 to 4 mm posterior to the limbus. Once
      recruited, a single eye requiring injection for each enrolled patient will be randomized into
      1 of 2 groups: aesthesiometer measurement alone with sham vibration (vibrator will not be
      triggered) (Group 1) or handheld vibrator application and triggering followed by
      aesthesiometer measurement (Group 2). The vibrator will be applied to the lower eyelid while
      retracting it during standard intravitreal injection prepped with topical anesthetic
      (Proparacaine 1%) and Betadine. The main outcome measure of will be patient comfort, as
      measured by the patient using a standardized Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale.

      An additional 30 eyes of 30 healthy patients not requiring intravitreal injection will be
      recruited to determine the effect of vibrator application and triggering to the lower lid on
      corneal and conjunctival (inferotemporal quadrant) sensation as measured using an
      aesthesiometer. No topical anesthetic will be applied prior to esthesiometry measurements are
      taken with and without vibration triggering.

      All patient identifying information will be removed and patients will be identified with a
      random number. Data will be checked regularly by a data monitoring committee. Patient records
      will be reviewed and the following data will be collected: demographic data (age, gender,
      injected eye, reason for injection), best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and
      complications/adverse events associated with intravitreal injections. Statistical analyses
      will include univariate comparisons between treatment groups using the Student t-test for
      continuous variables and χ2 test or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.
