  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, we evaluated whether RIPC with RIPostC reduce the major
      neurocomplication in patients undergoing STA-MCA anastomosis.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>The control group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group has a sphygmomanometer wound around the upper arm or lower extremity and applies the same pressure, but a 3-way stopcock is installed in the middle so that no pressure is applied.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>RIPC with RIPostC group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The sphygmomanometer is closed to the lower limb and the cuff is inflated and the pressure is increased by 30 mmHg higher than the systolic blood pressure of each patient for 5 minutes. The loss of the distal pulse is confirmed by Doppler in the dorsalis pedis pulse. If there is a pulse, increase the pressure until it disappears. After 5 minutes of ischemia time, the cuff is deflated to confirm that the pulse has returned and has a reperfusion time of 5 minutes. A total of 4 cycles of 5 cycles of ischemic time and 5 minutes of reperfusion time are performed. (Estimated total 40 minutes) When the skull is started to close, RIpc with RIPostC group performs RpostC and the method is the same as the above RIPC method. (Estimated total 40 minutes)</description>
