  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality with 7.2 million of death in
      industrialized countries (WHO data). Myocardial infarction corresponding to acute occlusion
      of a coronary artery is the most brutal form and the more severe ischemic myocardial disease.
      Every year in France, about 60,000 Myocardial infarctions hospitalized, 30,000 are diagnosed
      remotely and 30,000 are revealed by an inaugural sudden death. Although mortality from
      myocardial decreased by 30% over the past decade, the prognosis is pejorative and difficult
      to assess precisely. The management of the patient depends on these factors, and justifies an
      active search on these topics, including the mechanisms of the deleterious ventricular
      remodeling, myocardial inflammation, reperfusion injury which determines in particular the
      evolution to heart failure. Cohorts of patients with myocardial infarction are rare but can
      be very valuable by their clinical, laboratory and imaging well documented. They are the
      source of new hypotheses for research or interventions as well as the quality of care
      assessment tool.

      The main objective of this project is to identify new markers: biological and imaging,
      treatment response and prognosis after acute myocardial infarction.

      Secondary objectives of the HIBISCUS-STEMI cohort to establish a clinical database, completed
      by biological samples and by imaging data that can be used in the following areas:

        -  Descriptive epidemiology of myocardial infarction and myocardial reperfusion

        -  Pharmacoepidemiology and treatments observatory: safety, efficacy, indication of
           treatment in real life, costs

        -  Assessment of the long-term effect of the treatment on the occurrence of heart failure
           and sudden death

        -  Quality of life and personal consequences, family, professional and social myocardial
           infarction

        -  Research of new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers

        -  Research projects (e.g. risk of developing kidney failure or stroke in patients with
           myocardial infarction compared to the general population).
