  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the changes in visual function at 12 months following a single injection
      of human retinal progenitor cells compared to sham treated controls in a cohort of adult
      subjects with RP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no effective treatment for RP; once photoreceptors are lost, they do not regenerate.
      The rate of deterioration of vision varies from person to person, with most people with RP
      legally blind by age 40. Preclinical studies demonstrated that transplantation of retinal
      progenitor cells into the eye can result in both photoreceptor replacement and significant
      slowing of host photoreceptor loss. Thus, the primary goal of this therapy is to preserve,
      and potentially improve, vision by intervening in the disease at a time when dystrophic host
      photoreceptors can be protected and reactivated. Based on the demonstration of acceptable
      safety and tolerability in a phase 1/2a study, this phase 2b study is designed as a
      controlled comparison of the changes in visual function and functional vision in subjects who
      receive a single jCell injection in comparison to a comparable sham-treated control group of
      subjects with RP.
