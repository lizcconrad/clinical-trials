      The ANTHEM™ Total Knee System is being conducted to demonstrate non-inferiority of 10 year
      implant survivorship in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis
      compared to reported literature

      The ANTHEM Study is a prospective, multicentre, cohort study to collect relevant patient
      reported, clinical, surgical and radiological data from 196 subjects implanted with the
      ANTHEM™ Knee System for degenerative joint disease in up to 6 clinical sites globally. Total
      study duration for study participants will be 10 years with post-operative follow-up visits
      planned for 6 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 7.5 years and 10 years. The study will
      evaluate the 10 year implant survivorship and the safety and outcome of the ANTHEM™ Knee
      System over 10 years. This is a post-market study of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority (5% margin) of 10 year
      implant survivorship of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System in patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty for osteoarthritis compared to reported literature.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate shorter and long term safety and
      outcomes of the ANTHEM™ Total Knee System.
