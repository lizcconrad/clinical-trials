  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the side effects that may occur
      after radiation is given to breast cancer patients for 2 to 2½ weeks at the part of the
      breast where the disease first started. Researchers also want to learn if this treatment can
      help to control the disease and prevent the cancer from coming back in the breast.

      This is an investigational study. Radiation therapy will be delivered using FDA approved and
      commercially available methods. The shorter radiation treatment period is considered
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how radiation is designed to work.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this multicenter study.

      If you agree to take part in this study, one (1) time before you begin radiation treatment:

        -  You will complete 1 questionnaire about how your breast currently looks and feels. It
           should take about 10 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

        -  The study team will take pictures of your breast to compare the way it looks before and
           after you begin receiving radiation. Your face will be covered (as much as possible) and
           will not be included in the pictures.

      Length of Study:

      You will receive radiation for 2 to 2½ weeks. You will no longer be able to receive radiation
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. Your
      participation will be over after the 5-year follow-up visit.

      Study Treatment Administration:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive about 2 weeks of radiation (10
      treatments) to the part of the breast where the disease first started. If the doctor thinks
      it is needed, you will have 3 additional radiation treatments as a &quot;boost.&quot; The boost will be
      delivered to and focus more closely on the part of the breast where the disease first
      started.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      3 weeks after you have finished receiving radiation, you will have a physical exam.

      You will return for additional follow-up visits 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after
      you have finished receiving radiation. At each visit:

        -  You will complete the study questionnaire

        -  The study team will take pictures of both of your breasts.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

             readily visualized on simulation CT and is localized to one quadrant or region of the
             breast that is amenable to partial breast irradiation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Tumor invasion of the skin including dermis, chest wall, or pectoralis musculature.

          2. Any evidence of nodal positivity beyond pathologic stage of pN0(i+).

          3. Systemic chemotherapy prior to final breast conserving surgery.

          4. Patient is pregnant or nursing.

          5. History of therapeutic irradiation to the breast, lower neck, mediastinum or other
             area in which there could potentially be overlap with the affected breast.

          6. History of prior invasive or in situ cancer in either breast.

          7. Current diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer.

          8. History of lupus or scleroderma.
