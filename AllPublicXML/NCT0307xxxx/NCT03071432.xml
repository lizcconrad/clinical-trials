    <textblock>
      Rationale: Complications of chronic hyperglycaemia associated with Diabetes Mellitus type 2
      (DM2) include macro- and microvascular angiopathy. Cerebral Autoregulation (CA), the
      capability of the brain to maintain constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in
      blood pressure, is impaired early in DM2 implicating that CBF becomes dependent on blood
      pressure. In addition, 20-60% of all patients with DM2 suffers from cardiovascular autonomic
      neuropathy (CAN) resulting in more unstable blood pressure regulation. In patients without
      DM2 or CAN, induction of anaesthesia results in slightly decreased blood pressure, but
      cerebral perfusion is maintained through CA. In contrast, patients with DM2 and CAN may
      display greater reductions in blood pressure and cerebral perfusion may become jeopardized
      due to impaired CA. This could be an explanation for the increased incidence of stroke in
      patients with DM2.

      Objective:

        1. To study whether peri-operative haemodynamics fluctuate more in patients with DM2 and
           CAN.

        2. To study whether CAN further worsens cerebral perfusion in addition to impaired CA.

      Study design: Prospective, observational cohort trial. Study population: A total of 45
      patients, 30 with DM2 and 15 healthy controls scheduled for elective, non-cardiothoracic
      surgery under general anesthesia and age 18 years and above will be included in the study.
      After inclusion, DM2-patients will be categorized in two groups (both 15 patients): patients
      with and patients without CAN. Given the prevalence of 20-60% CAN, we plan to screen at most
      100 patients and include 15 patients in each study group.

      Intervention (if applicable):

        1. PRE-operative: chart review, short physical examination, autonomic function tests to
           determine the presence of CAN. These tests are simple physiological tests that can be
           performed on a regular ward and involve a Vasalva manoeuvre, 3 minute paced breathing
           with a frequency of 6Â·min-1 and tests for orthostatic hypotension. Also, we test the
           sensitivity of the cerebral vasculature to CO2 by measuring during one-minute
           hyperventilation and one minute CO2-rebreathing. Continuous blood pressure monitoring
           will be obtained using ccNexfin, a non-invasive monitor that comprises a single
           inflatable finger cuff. Cerebral perfusion will be assessed non-invasively using
           transcranial Doppler attached with a headband to the temporal skin area and
           (non-invasive) measurement of cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy
           (NIRS).

        2. INTRA-operative: we repeat the 3 minute paced breathing test and the CO2-reactivity
           test.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Between group difference in haemodynamic parameters and
      cerebral perfusion parameters.

    <description>Study interventions include a medical history and short physical examination as well as autonomic function tests and cerebral autoregulation tests on the day before surgery. In addition we determine CO2 sensitivity of the cerebral vasculature by three minutes hyperventilation and three minutes CO2 rebreathing. Perioperatively, continuous measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume and cardiac output is aquired using the ccNexfin monitor, a non-invasive device using a single finger cuff. Continuous monitoring of cerebral perfusion parameters using transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared-spectroscopy (NIRS) will be obtained. BRS and condition of CA will be determined preoperatively during autonomic function testing (see below) and 30 minutes after induction of anaesthesia.</description>
