  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively assess the functional aspects of the the esophageal squamous epithelial
      barrier and correlate this with tissue inflammation and intercellular space dilation in
      patients who have successfully completed endoscopic radiofrequency ablation versus balloon
      cryotherapy for Barrett's Esophagus related metaplasia.

      The investigators will measure and correlate mucosal impedance (measured using a novel
      endoscopic mucosal impedance catheter), intercellular space as measured with transmission
      electron microscopy and tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 in patients undergoing surveillance
      following successful endoscopic therapy (defined as two negative endoscopic surveillance
      histology for intestinal metaplasia).

      Mucosal impedance will be measured by an endoscopic probe. Research biopsies will also be
      obtained for measurement of tissue levels of prostaglandin E2 and intracellular space with
      transmission electron microscopy.

      Volumetric laser endomicroscopy will measure the precise thickness of and area of subsquamous
      structures underneath the neosquamous epithelium.
