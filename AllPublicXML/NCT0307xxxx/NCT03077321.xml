  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of the impact of incorporating a peer mentor into a
      primary care based group parenting program on increasing program participation by parents and
      improving program outcomes.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial of the impact of Child Adult
      Relationship Enhancement (CARE) plus peer mentor on increasing program adoption,
      acceptability, and appropriateness among 2-6 year old children and their parents at UNC
      Children's Primary Care Clinic. The investigators will also examine the effectiveness of CARE
      plus peer mentor on dysfunctional parenting and child behavior problems. Participants will be
      randomized to CARE plus peer mentor or standard CARE. Program attendance, acceptability, and
      appropriateness will be measured upon completion of the 6-week program. Dysfunctional
      parenting and child behavior will be measured at baseline and 6 weeks. The investigators will
      conduct semi-structured interviews among a sample of parents (~20-30) in order to understand
      the impact of the peer mentors on program implementation, as well as barriers and
      facilitators to program initiation and long-term participation.

    <description>A parent who has completed the standard CARE program will be recruited to be a peer mentor. The peer mentor will attend the CARE training for group leaders and will also be trained in motivational interviewing. These skills will then be used strategically in weekly phone discussions between the peer mentor and parent about practicing the CARE parenting skills in the home setting and planning for attending the 6 training sessions. The parent mentor will co-facilitate the CARE groups in the peer mentor arm along with 2 additional CARE therapists. The peer mentor will also call the parents in the peer mentor arm before each session to discuss progress on homework, and to address barriers for program attendance.</description>

    <description>CARE involves 6 weekly 90-minute sessions administered to 6-10 parents by 2 therapists. The initial phase focuses on developing parenting skills aimed at increasing attention to children's pro-social behaviors while ignoring minor attention seeking misbehaviors. The second phase teaches techniques for giving children effective commands in order to set age-appropriate limits and increase compliance. Children do not attend the training but parents are expected to practice the skills with their children between sessions.</description>
