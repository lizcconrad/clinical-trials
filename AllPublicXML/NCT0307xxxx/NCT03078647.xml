      Clinical Study to Evaluate the Performance of the Profound System for the Treatment of
      Cellulite.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 healthy female volunteers, seeking cellulite treatment, 18 to 60 years of age from
      up to 3 investigational sites.

      Prospective, open-label, baseline-controlled, two arms, randomized, clinical study to
      evaluate the Profound device using the Dermal and SubQ Cartridges for minimally-invasive
      treatment of the upper thighs and buttocks cellulite appearance.

      The treatment areas of the study subjects will be divided into two arms:

        1. Arm 1 - the upper thigh/buttock on the left or right side of the body will undergo a
           single Profound treatment utilizing the Dermal and SubQ Cartridges

        2. Arm 2 - the contralateral upper thigh/buttock side of the body will undergo a single
           Profound treatment utilizing the SubQ Cartridge only.

      Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at
      each visit.
