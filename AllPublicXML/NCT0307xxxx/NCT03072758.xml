  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breastfeeding remains the optimal mode of feeding for infants younger than six months.
      Exclusive Breast Feeding (EBF) among HIV-infected mothers has been shown to be associated
      with a sustained and significant reduction in HIV transmission and has the potential to
      reduce infant and under-five mortality.

      Given the considerable authority among men as decision makers in sub-Saharan African, we may
      be witnessing a missed opportunity to engage men in the education, awareness, and
      decision-making for EBF. Understanding the role and impact of male partners on this
      decision-making process require further examination to inform the development of effective
      and sustainable evidence-based interventions to support the initiation and sustainment of
      EBF.

      Summary of the Parent Grant (R01HD087994): The parent grant is a cluster randomized
      comparative effectiveness trial designed to test the effectiveness of an integrated
      intervention for sustained testing and retention (iSTAR) on linkage, engagement, and
      retention among women with HIV infection. The iSTAR intervention provides: confidential,
      onsite integrated laboratory testing during baby showers; a network of church-based health
      advisors; clinic based teams trained in motivational interviewing; quality improvement skills
      to engage and support HIV-infected women; and integrated case management to reduce loss to
      follow-up. Primary outcomes are the difference in linkage and engagement rates between iSTAR
      and the clinic-based control group (CG). The secondary outcomes are the difference in
      retention and viral suppression rate.

      Building upon the parent grant, this administrative supplement grant will assess the
      comparative effectiveness of Men's Club (MC) as intervention group (MC-IG) compared to the
      control group (MC-CG) on the initiation and sustainment of exclusive breastfeeding. Men's
      Club is an integrated intervention where male participants receive a five-hour
      interactive/educational session during their partner's pregnancy, and weekly phone reminders
      during the first six-week postnatal period to increase EBF knowledge and support strategies,
      and to improve sustainment of EBF respectively. Male partners in MC-CG will not receive the
      proposed intervention. Additionally, we will explore barriers and facilitators to support and
      sustainment of exclusive breastfeeding among participants from both MC-IG and MC-CG in the
      study. The Primary Outcome is the difference in the rate of initiation and sustainment of EBF
      between the two groups. The Secondary Outcome is the difference in knowledge of feeding
      options among male partners and rate of sustained EBF among the female partners in the two
      groups at 6 months post-delivery.

    <description>Interactive session: This will be a one-day five-hour session that will take place at the church, and will be facilitated by trained lactation nurses. This will involve a maximum of 10 male participants and will occur during the female partner's 3rd trimester. Male partners will (a) complete a structured questionnaire to determine baseline knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about breastfeeding practices, and (b) actively engage in educational information on the benefit of exclusive breastfeeding. At the end of the session, the participants will receive educational pamphlets on breastfeeding to reinforce all the information that had been provided.
Phone call reminders: Participants will receive weekly robocalls during the first six weeks following the birth of the infant to reinforce the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding. This will be an automated service that will deliver the calls at a specific time of the day the participants have indicated on their questionnaire.</description>
