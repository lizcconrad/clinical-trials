      This study is designed to evaluate and verify the clinical accuracy of the Hemochron® MCS
      7000 Whole Blood Microcoagulation System; a point-of-care, whole blood Activated Clotting
      Time (ACT) measurement in comparison with the Hemochron Signature Elite® Whole Blood
      Microcoagulation System; a 510(k) cleared predicate device. This is a multi-center,
      prospective method comparison, with data to be analyzed separately from each site as well as
      combined for all sites.

      The study will be performed in the clinical setting by trained professional operators.

      Group 1: Whole Blood Coagulation Test 1, Hemochron® MCS 7000 Whole Blood Microcoagulation
      System

      Group 2: Whole Blood Coagulation Test 2, Hemochron® Signature Elite® 7000 Whole Blood
      Microcoagulation System

      Ex-vivo whole blood samples destined for discard after all medically directed tests are
      complete will be used from heparinized patients undergoing standard of care interventional
      procedures in different clinical settings. These include, but are not limited to, the
      cardiovascular operating room (CVOR), vascular surgery operating room, cardiac
      catheterization lab, surgical intensive care unit (SICU), neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU), the electrophysiology (EP) lab, hemodialysis unit and in extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) applications.

      A distribution of ACT values is necessary to evaluate clinical accuracy. The target number of
      subjects for each site is 30 with a minimum enrollment of 25 per site.

      Samples will be examined at baseline (pre-heparin administration) and at the end of the
      procedure. Heparinized samples may be obtained for ACT testing once or multiple times while
      heparin is administered throughout the duration of the procedure. The frequency and time
      intervals of ACT testing will be determined by the Standard of Care. No additional blood
      volume or extra blood draws will occur as the result of this study.

      Normal healthy individuals will also be enrolled to insure collection of data that covers the
      entire detection range of the instrument. One whole blood sample will be tested per subject
      (target of 20 subjects from selected clinical sites).

      The work flow for the testing process will be consistent across all sites. Expected duration
      of the study is dependent upon the site logistics but generally is expected to last no more
      than four to six weeks.

      ACT results generated from the MCS 7000 instrument during this study will be used solely for
      research purposes and will not be used for anticoagulation management of study subjects. No
      patient follow up is required.

      The study will include two MCS 7000 instruments, trained operators, and two Signature Elite
      instruments for each procedure.

      Guidance was obtained from Point-of-Care Monitoring of Anticoagulation Therapy; Approved
      Guideline (CLSI POCT14-A), CLSI EP09-A3: &quot;Method Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation
      Using Patient Samples; Approved guideline Third Edition&quot; and peer reviewed literature.

      All study data will be collected on Case Report Forms and all analysis will be performed by
      Accriva.

There is no drug administration intervention in this study. The interventional procedure (described above) is standard of care and all results of blood coagulation testing using Hemochron MCS 7000 performed in this study is not used to influence that care.

        The population to be studied consists of subjects who require parenteral anticoagulant
        therapy with UFH in accordance with the approved label indications for heparin
