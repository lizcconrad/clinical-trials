      Comparison of single versus multicenter outcomes for pelvic organ prolapse repair using a
      mesh-capturing device (The Uphold™ Vaginal Support System for apical and vaginal wall
      prolapse - Boston Scientific). 1-2 years follow up study comprison of 112 vs 207 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      112 women operated by two surgeons at one center (2 years follow up) are to be compared to
      207 women operated by twenty six surgeons at twenty four centers (1 year follow-up).

      Screening at baseline for apical (uterine or vaginal vault) prolapse stage II with or without
      concomitant anterior or vaginal wall prolapse ≥ stage 2 according to the pelvic organ
      prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system.

      Surgical data including operation data, complications and hospital stay are to be compared.

      Anatomical outcome measurements by POP-Q evaluations. Subjective symptoms are to be evaluated
      by prolapse specific symptom questionnaires (PFIQ-7, UDI-6 and PFIQ) whereas sexual function
      to be estimated by PISQ-12.

    <measure>The rate of immediate complications</measure>
    <time_frame>From operation start to hospital discharge, assessed for an estimated total of days (1-7 days).</time_frame>
    <description>Serious surgical complications are categorized as any surgical event which is potentially life-threatening related to the surgical procedure including: internal organ perforation (or other injury), bleeding in excess of 1000 mL.</description>

    <measure>Rate of delayed complications</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anatomical outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years vs 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Anatomical outcome is a composite definition including point C positioned above a point corresponding to half of the total vaginal length. The overall POP-Q outcomes will be analyzed to determine efficacy of the procedure related to correction of anterior prolapse ≥stage II or other defects present at the time of surgery. Days in hospital are counted from the day of surgery i.e. the day of operation is day 1 and the day of returning home is the last day of hospital stay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective outcomes and sexual function</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years vs 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective outcome is the patients' response 'no' to question 2 of the PFDI (pelvic heaviness). The composite outcome is a strictly binary categorization where any residual sense of pelvic heaviness/vaginal bulging results in the classification of the patient as a failure. It also includes the components of the main secondary outcome considered individually, any adverse events in the aftermath of surgery, as well as, patient-reported urogenital distress (UDI), quality of life (PFIQ) and sexual function (PISQ-12) as measured by the self-reported questionnaires. For secondary analyses, the ordinal grading of responses to the PFDI-20, PFIQ-7 and PISQ-12 will be used to determine rates of improvement and progression over time.</description>
