  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous study, on which this study is based, found that a diet higher in fruits and
      vegetables, beta-carotene, vitamin C, alpha-tocopherol, and fish oils (specifically
      eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) was positively associated with
      periodontal healing after sanative therapy (NCT02291835). The investigator's next step, in
      the present study, is to determine long-term benefits of sanative therapy in which patients
      have regular maintenance hygiene cleanings on periodontal health. Specifically, the
      relationship between intakes of specific foods, nutrients and supplements with clinical
      periodontal outcomes will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection that results in the breakdown of connective tissue
      and alveolar bone that support the teeth. Bacteria and the body's own immune system mediate
      the severity of periodontitis, where teeth may become loose, fall out or have to be removed.
      Sanative therapy is a non-surgical process involving mechanical debridement of bacterial
      biofilms on roots of teeth, below the gum line. Participants in this present study previously
      underwent sanative therapy several years ago and have been attending the clinic for regular
      maintenance appointments to maintain periodontal health. While significant associations were
      observed with higher intakes of fruits and vegetables and specific nutrients (vitamins C and
      E, beta-carotene, fish oils) within a few months after sanative therapy, this study will
      follow-up these findings to determine if such relationships persist during a period of
      relatively stable periodontal health. Given new insights into a potential role of flavonoids
      in maintaining periodontal health, this aspect will also be studied. The overall objective is
      to determine if higher intakes of foods, nutrients and supplements known to have osteogenic
      and immunomodulatory effects are associated with improved clinical outcomes in individuals
      who previously underwent sanative therapy. At the regular maintenance appointment, clinical
      measures will be evaluated (clinical attachment loss, probing depth, bleeding on probing,
      plaque index). As well, the following will be evaluated: dietary intakes of macronutrients
      and micronutrients using the Block 2015 food frequency questionnaire; intakes of fruit,
      vegetables and fiber using the Block Dietary Fruit-Vegetable-Fiber Screener; nutritional
      supplement use and tea intake using specially developed questionnaires and salivary markers
      of inflammation using biochemical assays.
