    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity and describe the safety of MenACYW
      conjugate vaccine compared to MENVEO® in healthy children 2 to 9 years of age in the United
      States.

      Primary objective:

      - To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups
      A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine
      compared to that observed following the administration of a single dose of MENVEO® in
      children aged 2 to 9 years.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the hSBA antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) of meningococcal serogroups A,
           C, Y, and W following the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine to those observed
           following the administration of MENVEO® in children 2 to 9 years of age

        -  To evaluate the hSBA antibody GMTs of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W following
           the administration of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and those observed following the
           administration of MENVEO® in children 2 to 5 years of age, and in children 6 to 9 years
           of age, respectively.

        -  To evaluate the hSBA vaccine seroresponse to meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W
           before and 30 days (+14 days) post-vaccination in children 2 to 5 years of age, and in
           children 6 to 9 years of age, respectively.

      Observational objective:

      - To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and that of the licensed
      MENVEO®.

      Healthy participants will be enrolled, randomized, and will receive a single dose of either
      MenACYW conjugate vaccine or MENVEO®.

      All participants will be assessed for immunogenicity at baseline (pre-vaccination) and at
      Visit 2 (post-vaccination). Safety information will be collected post each vaccination and
      throughout the entire study.
