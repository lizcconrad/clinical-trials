      Early feasibility study to determine if a three-treatment protocol with the RenewalNail™
      plasma treatment system over a week will result in mycological cure and/or clear nail growth
      on the treated hallux toe.

      The Sponsor has developed the RenewalNail™ plasma treatment system to topically treat fungal
      infected toenails. The goal of the RenewalNail™ therapy is to overcome the shortcomings of
      both topical and oral therapies by combining the safety of a topical treatment with the
      efficacy of an oral treatment.

      The primary objective of this early feasibility study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of the RenewalNail™ plasma treatment system and Protocol in achieving mycological cure for
      the patient. The Protocol calls for three 45-minute treatments performed over a week to
      achieve mycological cure. Mycological cure will be assessed with two consecutive mycological
      culture tests done over a week. Two consecutive negative results will confirm the elimination
      of fungus causing onychomycosis infection, as recommended by recent FDA guidance. There will
      be no placebo arm in the study.

      Secondary objectives include assessing if the treatment protocol results in clear nail growth
      for the patient over a 5-month interval.
