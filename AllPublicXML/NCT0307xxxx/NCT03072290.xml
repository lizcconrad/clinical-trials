      This is a prospective, single-blinded randomized controlled study to determine the efficacy
      of low dose corticosteroid in patient with CTS. Patient with CTS were randomly assigned to
      group receiving ultrasound guided steroid injection with different dosage of triamcinolone
      acetonide (Shincort) mixed, 1ml 10mg (10mg/ml) or 1ml 40mg (40mg/ml) with 1 ml of 2%
      lidocaine hydrochloride. The follow up at 6 and 12 weeks includes Boston Carpal Tunnel
      Questionnaire, nerve conductive study and VAS pain score.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Median nerve distal motor latency</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the CMAPs were obtained via surface electrodes placed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The active recording electrode was placed on the muscle belly, and the reference electrode was placed on the tendon insertion. The median nerve was stimulated 8 cm proximal to the active recording electrode. Distal motor latencies were measured from the onset of stimulus artifact to the onset of the CMAP</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in sensory nerve conduction velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SNAPs were obtained using an antidromic method and recorded by surface electrodes placed at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints of the index finger for the median nerve and the same joints of the little finger for the ulnar nerve. The median nerves were stimulated at the wrist at a distance of 14 cm from the wrist to the active electrode. Distal sensory latencies were measured from the onset of the stimulus artifact to the onset of the SNAP. SNCV was calculated dividing the distance of 14 cm by the distal sensory latency.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in compound muscle action potential amplitude (CMAP)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the CMAPs were obtained via surface electrodes placed on the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The active recording electrode was placed on the muscle belly, and the reference electrode was placed on the tendon insertion. The median nerve was stimulated 8 cm proximal to the active recording electrode. The amplitude of CMAP were measured from baseline to negative peak.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in self-reported pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to indicate the intensity of their average level of pain for the wrist-hand region within the past 1 week, using an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable).</description>
