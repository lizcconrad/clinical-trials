  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ECMO has improved the outcome of heart or respiratory failure and carcinogenic shock and are
      increasingly used. However bleeding complications occurring in up to 50% of patients are
      poorly understood and worsen the overall results. The aim is to investigate the occurence of
      bleeding and its frequency according to the type of ECMO either veno-arterial or veno-venous.
      The investigators also want to assess the relation of bleeding with von Willebrand Factor
      defects.
