  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effectiveness of a psychotherapeutic
      intervention, the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), to address the mental health
      needs of children and adolescents age 8-17 who have been affected by armed conflict in Kachin
      State, Myanmar. The 10-12 week talk-based counseling treatment, delivered by community mental
      health workers, will be evaluated against a wait-list control group. This project follows on
      a recently completed trial of CETA for adult trauma survivors from Myanmar along the
      Thai-Myanmar border which found that CETA was acceptable, accessible, and effective in
      improving mental health and functioning of adults. The investigators hypothesize that the
      intervention will be similarly effective for improving the mental health and functioning of
      children and adolescents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is a trans-diagnostic psychotherapeutic
      intervention.

      Results from qualitative interviews following the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of CETA
      for adults (IRB # 00003601) and during the scale-up of CETA services have indicated that
      there is a major need for mental health services for children and adolescents in Myanmar, as
      currently there are no evidence-based psychotherapy services for children and adolescents in
      the country. Specifically, since the initial trial the research team has received requests
      from community-based organizations to implement CETA for children and adolescents in Kachin
      language-speaking communities in northern Myanmar. Local partners and the Applied Mental
      Health Research group (AMHR) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) believe that CETA is amenable
      for use with children and adolescents and that this population would benefit in similar ways
      to adults. A qualitative study has since been conducted (IRB# 00006933), and the data used to
      develop and validate an assessment instrument with children and adolescents in Kachin state
      (IRB# 00006929).

      The JHU research team will work with the local partner organization, Kachin Baptist
      Convention (KBC), to implement this project. KBC is a well-established community-based
      organization that currently provides emergency relief services to approximately 20,000
      displaced Kachin people living in 42 camps. Their community outreach activities are
      non-denominational.

      Participants will mostly be accessed through schools and in partnership with the local
      implementing partner. Their teachers, secondary caregivers and persons from the local partner
      organization who work with them regularly - all of whom are involved in the study as key
      community informants - will identify and refer the potential child/adolescent participants
      for screening into the study. Screening will otherwise be open to all children/adolescents,
      and those who are eligible will be asked to participate in the trial. Informed consent will
      be obtained from the parent/guardian and informed assent from the child. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to either receive CETA immediately or be put on a waitlist to receive
      treatment later.

      Counselors will be current employees of the local partner organization who have participated
      in a 2-week initial training followed by 8-10 weeks of supervised practice. Counselors will
      receive weekly clinical supervision for the duration of the trial.

      During the RCT, 10-12 weekly CETA sessions will be delivered individually in private spaces
      either at schools, homes, or in the community. In most cases, the children are living in the
      camps with their parents/guardians. Counselors will also follow-up with control children on a
      weekly basis to assess their symptoms using a client monitoring form. Both treatment and
      control participants will be reassessed using the same assessment instrument following the
      treatment period.

    <description>Self-reported child mental health symptoms will be measured using a modified, locally validated version of the assessment instrument consisting of 23 items from 1) the Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS); 2) and the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ); and 3) items developed from qualitative research in this population. Respondents report how often each problem has bothered him/her in the past two weeks. Response options range from 0 &quot;none of the time&quot; to 3 &quot;almost all of the time&quot;. Results will be reported as a single value from this composite outcome measure consisting of multiple measures.</description>

    <description>For treatment group participants, they will then have weekly Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) counseling sessions with a counselor lasting no more than 1.5 hours per session, and a total of approximately 10-12 sessions. They will then repeat the assessment instrument after their last session, as well as 6 months after finishing treatment, and these meetings will again last no more than 1.5 hours. All total, it is expected that treatment group participants will have 13 meetings with a study team member or counselor over the course of their participation.</description>

    <description>Waitlist group participants be contacted by a study team member from the local partner organization regularly (weekly) while they are on the wait list. These contacts from the study team will be short and last less than 30 minutes and will be used to briefly assess symptom levels and safety. At the end of their wait period, they will be asked to complete the assessment instrument a second time and this meeting will take no more than 1.5 hours. For participants in the waitlist group, we estimate 13 meetings total during their wait period (2 meetings of no more than 1.5 hours, 10 contacts less than 30 minutes).</description>

    <description>The Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), is a trans-diagnostic psychotherapy that is based on common evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, trauma and stress related disorders. This treatment can be used to treat individuals with any of these mental health problems and with any combination of these problems. CETA expands upon traditional treatment approaches that are designed to focus on one specific disorder and has been proven through multiple rigorous trials to reduce the burden of multiple common mental health problems and improve functionality among men and women living in low resource settings. CETA can be provided to people in their own communities by trained and supervised lay providers, for example community health workers.</description>
