  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a chemotherapy as a possible treatment for Meningiomas
      (recurrent).

      The study intervention involved in this study is:

      --AZD2014 (vistusertib)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD2014 as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug AZD2014 can shrink or
      slow the growth of meningioma. Based on laboratory research, the cellular pathways which are
      blocked by AZD2014 are important for the growth and survival of meningiomas. Further,
      treatment of meningioma cells in the laboratory has resulted in decreased survival of tumor
      cells. As such, the purpose of this research is to see whether treating recurrent grade 2-3
      meningioma with AZD2014 will result in tumor size stabilization or shrinkage. The safety of
      AZD2014 will also be studied. The physical state, the symptoms, changes in the size of the
      tumor, and laboratory findings obtained while on-study will help the research team decide if
      AZD2014 is safe and effective in participants with this condition.

      AZD2014 is being studied in patients with various cancers as a single agent (a drug that is
      used alone to treat the cancer) or in combination with a number of well known anticancer
      therapies. Previous studies have also allowed investigators to determine the best dose and
      frequency of AZD2014 to achieve anti-tumor effects while reducing the likelihood of side
      effects.

                  arrhythmias requiring continuous therapy)

               -  supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, which are
                  uncontrolled

               -  hemorrhagic or thrombotic stroke, including transient ischemic attacks or any
                  other central nervous system bleeding

               -  History of drug abuse or alcohol abuse, as judged by the Investigator

          -  Abnormal echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition scan (MUGA) at baseline
             (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &lt;55%). Appropriate correction to be used if
             a MUGA is performed.

          -  Pre-existing renal disease including glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi
             Syndrome or renal tubular acidosis.

          -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc), calculated using Fridericia's formula, &gt; 470
             msec obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs), family or personal history of long or
             short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de
             Pointes within 12 months of the patient entering in the study.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled Type II (HbA1c &gt;8% assessed locally) as judged by the
             investigator or abnormal fasting glucose value defined as &gt;126 mg/dL (&gt;7 mmol/L).

          -  Concomitant medications known to prolong QT interval, or with factors that increase
             the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic events (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, congenital long QT syndrome, family history of long QT syndrome or
             unexplained sudden death under 40 years-of-age). See appendix B for a list of
             medications.

          -  Vaccinated with live, attenuated vaccines within four weeks of the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Judgment by the Investigator that the patient is unsuitable to participate in the
             study and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD2014 is an mTORC1/2 inhibiting
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with AZD2014, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with AZD2014.

          -  HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AZD2014. In addition, these
             participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both AstraZeneca,
             CRO staff, and/or staff at the CPU).
