  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study shows how careful ophthalmic examination of two patients showed signs of
      simultaneous bilateral retinal emboli. Starting from this point significant, life
      threatening, underlying reasons were found and treated.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two patients were found to have signs of simultaneous bilateral retinal emboli. One patient
      was asymptomatic and routine ophthalmic examination showed bilateral retinal hemorrhages and
      exudates close to both optic discs. This patient was on anti-coagulant treatment for atrial
      fibrillation. The finding of bilateral signs of retinal emboli necessitated immediate blood
      tests and dose adjustments of her medication.

      The second case did not have general symptoms other than mild evening chills and her eye
      examination again was the start point of intensive investigation to find the reason of her
      bilateral retinal emboli. Ultrasound studies revealed a life threatening reason that was
      urgently treated.

    <measure>The extreme significance of immediate investigation of cases of bilateral retinal emboli (non-diabetic bilateral posterior pole retinal nerve fiber or pre-retinal hemorrhages).</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of one year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients that are noticed to have signs of bilateral retinal emboli (bilateral retinal nerve fiber layer hemorrhages or bilateral pre-retinal hemorrhages and sometimes bilateral soft exudates) may be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. However these patients must be immediately and, if needed, intensively investigated to find the source of these emboli. The extremely important point of this study is these patients usually have life threatening conditions that should be found out and treated in time.</description>
