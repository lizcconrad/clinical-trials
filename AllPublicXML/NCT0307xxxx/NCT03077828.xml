      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new drug Pembrolizumab in combination
      with chemotherapy, for Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. The chemotherapy regimen is
      called &quot;ICE&quot; and includes three drugs: ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. Pembrolizumab
      is currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of some patients
      with melanoma, lung cancer and head and neck cancer, but has not yet been approved for the
      treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma. The 'ICE' regimen of chemotherapy is
      currently FDA approved for the treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma, but has not
      yet been investigated in combination with pembrolizumab for this disease. For patients who
      have a relapse of their Hodgkin's lymphoma, retreatment with chemotherapy followed by a stem
      cell transplant is recommended. We know that obtaining a complete remission (not able to
      detect any disease on scans) is very important prior to proceeding to the stem cell
      transplant. Patients with negative scans have a lower chance of the disease coming back and a
      higher chance of achieving a long-term cure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate by fludeoxyglucose- positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) prior to autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (AHSCT) with the combination of pembrolizumab and ifosfamide, carboplatin,
      etoposide (ICE) salvage chemotherapy for relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with salvage
      high-dose chemotherapy according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      version (v)4.03.

      II. To estimate the event free survival (EFS) at 2 years from start of treatment.

      III. To estimate the overall survival (OS) at 2 years from start of treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize PD-1 pathway specific expression and correlate with response.

      II. To characterize serum biomarkers of immune and inflammatory response during treatment.

      III. To characterize levels of soluble PD-L1 related to treatment with pembrolizumab.

      IV. To characterize T-lymphocyte subset changes to treatment with pembrolizumab.

      V. To investigate the prevalence and clinical correlation of chromosome 9p24.1 mutations for
      this population.

      VI. To evaluate the effect on stem cell harvest following treatment with pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV over
      60 minutes on days 1-3 of courses 1-2, carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 2 of courses
      1-2, and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 2 of courses 1-2. Pembrolizumab in combination
      with ICE chemotherapy repeats every 21 days for 2 courses, patients will then receive
      pembrolizumab as monotherapy on course 3.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      2 years.

             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed)

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father
             children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening
             or screening visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment

          -  Patients who are unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or have known
             psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with
