    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct 4 focus groups and recruit for 12 participants per
      focus group to explore community members' views about colorectal cancer screening (CRCS)
      processes and perceived benefits and impediments, what information they believe should be
      communicated, communication preferences (style, tone) and perceptions of screenings.

    <description>Successful collection of feedback to complete production of Spanish-language LATINOS CARES Intervention.
This aim involves no statistical analysis except the summary statistics for the participants. To adapt (transcreate) and produce an educational intervention entitled LATINOS CARES (DVD + photonovella booklet), about colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) targeted for a Latino medically underserved population. BENCHMARK: Production of Spanish-language LATINOS CARES intervention that is easy-to understand, salient, and culturally suitable.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the LATINOS CARES condition will receive an I-FOBT kit, DVD and photonovella booklet from the study coordinator. The participant will view the DVD in a private area (headphones are available) using a portable DVD player in clinic before seeing the provider. The DVD will be about 8-10 minutes long. The participant will take the LATINOS CARES toolkit and I-FOBT home after the clinic visit. The participant will be instructed to re-review the materials and complete the I-FOBT stool sampling at home.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the standard brochure (SI) will be provided a packet containing the CDC Spanish-language tri-fold brochure titled Screen for Life and an I-FOBT card. The participant will be instructed to review the materials in clinic and complete the I-FOBT stool sampling at home. This brochure describes CRC, risk factors, symptoms, screening tests, benefits of screening, and insurance coverage.</description>

    <description>Both intervention groups will receive an I-FOBT kit (by study coordinator) with verbal and written instructions in Spanish on how to complete the stool sampling at home within 1 week, and mail the completed kit in the pre-addressed, postage paid mailer. Patients with abnormal results will receive a call explaining the meaning of an abnormal I-FOBT and encouraging them to take specific next steps.</description>
