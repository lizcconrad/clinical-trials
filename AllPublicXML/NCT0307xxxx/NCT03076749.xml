      Background: ß-lactam (BL) antibiotics represent the main cause of allergic reactions to
      drugs, inducing both immediate and non-immediate reactions. The diagnosis is well
      established, usually based upon skin tests and drug provocation tests, but cumbersome.

      Objectives: To design predictive models for the diagnosis of BL allergy, based on the
      clinical history of patients with suspicions of allergic reactions to BL.

      Methods: The study included a retrospective phase in which records of patients consulting and
      explored for a suspicion of BL allergy (in the Allergy Unit of the University Hospital of
      Montpellier between September 1996 and September 2012) where used to construct predictive
      models; a prospective phase, in which we performed an external validation of the chosen
      models, in patients with suspicion of BL allergy recruited from 3 allergy centres
      (Montpellier, Nîmes, Narbonne), between March and November 2013. Data related to clinical
      history and allergy work-up results were retrieved and analysed. Logistic regression and
      decision tree method were used to design two models to predict the diagnosis of allergy to
      BL.
