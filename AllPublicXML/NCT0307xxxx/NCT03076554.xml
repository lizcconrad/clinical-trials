  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are cancers originating in the thymus gland. Platinum-based
      chemotherapy is standard treatment for them. But not uncommonly, the disease returns and
      people need more treatment to keep the cancer from growing. The drug Avelumab could help the
      immune system fight cancer.

      Objective:

      To test if avelumab is safe and well-tolerated, and is effective in treating relapsed or
      refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with thymoma or thymic carcinoma that has returned or progressed
      after platinum-containing chemotherapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests

        -  Scan: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

        -  Physical exam

        -  Medical history

        -  Biopsy: a needle removes a piece of tumor. Samples can be from a previous procedure,
           although it is desirable to undergo a new biopsy.

      Participants will have treatment in 2-week cycles. They will continue until the side effects
      are not tolerable or their disease gets worse.

      Visits at the following time points are required per protocol:

        -  Every 2 weeks: Participants will get avelumab by infusion in a vein (IV). They will get
           diphenhydramine (benadryl) and acetaminophen (tylenol) by mouth or IV before receiving
           avelumab to decrease the chances of developing a reaction to avelumab. They will have
           blood, urine, and heart tests periodically.

        -  Cycles 4 and 7, then every 6 weeks: Scans will be performed to look for shrinkage or
           growth of tumor.

        -  Cycle 4: Participants will be offered a chance to undergo a biopsy.

        -  2 4 weeks after stopping treatment: Blood, urine, and heart tests will be performed.
           Participants might undergo a scan.

        -  10 weeks after stopping treatment: Blood, urine, and heart tests.

        -  About 6 months after stopping treatment, then every 3 months: Participants will have
           scans andcan allow genetic testing on their blood and tissue samples.

      Background:

      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymic
      epithelial tumors (TETs). However more than half of these patients experience disease
      recurrence and require second-line therapy. There are no approved drugs for treatment of
      recurrent thymoma and thymic carcinoma and new therapeutic options are needed for patients
      who have disease progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. The clinical activity
      of checkpoint blockade targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) has been
      demonstrated against various tumor types. We have demonstrated the ability of avelumab to
      induce major responses in

      patients with advanced thymoma in a phase I dose escalation study. Further investigation of
      avelumab in patients with TETs is needed to define the clinical activity and safety of immune
      checkpoint blockade in patients with TETs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of Avelumab in patients with relapsed or
           refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.

        -  To determine the objective response rate (ORR) to Avelumab in patients with relapsed or
           refractory thymoma and thymic carcinoma.

      ELIGIBLITY:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed, unresectable thymoma or thymic carcinoma who
           have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen
           with progressive disease prior to study entry.

        -  Prior treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors is permitted if the reason for
           discontinuation was not disease progression or life-threatening adverse events
           (laboratory abnormalities alone with prior therapy will not exclude patients from this
           trial)

        -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria

        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function

        -  No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of
           avelumab

        -  No prior thymic tumor-associated autoimmune disease with the exception of pure red cell

      aplasia and vitiligo.

      Design:

        -  This will be a single-arm, pilot study to determine the clinical activity and safety of
           treatment with avelumab in patients with relapsed or refractory thymoma and thymic
           carcinoma.

        -  Avelumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously once every two weeks
           until disease progression or development of intolerable adverse events. The two week
           period will constitute one cycle.

        -  Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE version 4.0.

        -  Tumor response will be assessed after completion of every third cycle (6 weeks) using
           RECIST criteria, version 1.1.

        -  When possible, a tumor biopsy will be conducted pre-treatment and on C4D43 to evaluate
           treatment-related, intra-tumoral changes.

             agent. Patients with diabetes type 1, vitiligo, psoriasis, pure red cell aplasia, Good
             s syndrome or hypo- or hyperthyroid diseases not requiring immunosuppressive treatment
             are eligible.

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to
             poor prognosis. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastasis
             and whose brain disease has remained stable for 3 months without steroid therapy may
             be enrolled.

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy or significant acute or chronic infections
             including, among others:

               -  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at screening
                  (positive HBV surface antigen or HCV RNA if anti-HCV antibody screening test
                  positive).

               -  Known history of testing positive for HIV or known acquired immunodeficiency
                  syndrome.

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogenic stem-cell transplantation.

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 Grade &gt; 1) however,
             alopecia, sensory neuropathy Grade less than or equal to 2, or other Grade less than
             or equal to 2 not constituting a safety risk based on investigator s judgment are
             acceptable.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation period. Note: a negative pregnancy test is required for women
             of childbearing potential. Women who are postmenopausal (age-related amenorrhea
             greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;
             40 milli international units per milliliter [mIU/ml]), or who had undergone
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If necessary
             to confirm postmenopausal status a FSH level will be included at screening.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Avelumab is in the class of agents
             known as antineoplastics/monoclonal antibodies with the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in

        nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Avelumab, breastfeeding should be
        discontinued if the mother is treated with Avelumab.

          -  Clinically significant (i.e. active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral vascular
             accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6 months
             prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure greater than or equal
             to New York Heart Association Classification Class II, or serious cardiac arrhythmia
             requiring medication.

          -  All other severe acute or chronic medical conditions including colitis, inflammatory
             bowel disease, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis or psychiatric conditions including
             recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior; or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.

          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of
             informed consent.

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity.

          -  Non-oncology vaccine therapies for prevention of infection disease (e.g. seasonal flu
             vaccine, human papilloma virus vaccine) within 4 weeks of study drug administration.
             Vaccination while on study is also prohibited except for administration of inactivated
             vaccines (e.g. inactivated influenza vaccines).

          -  HIV-positive TET patients are ineligible because of the risk of developing
             opportunistic infections after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Prior
             cases of disseminated herpes virus and fungal infections have been documented in this
             patient population.
