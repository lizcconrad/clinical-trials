  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether genomic based risk-stratification
      can be used in deciding whether to de-intensify in patients with Human Papillomavirus
      (HPV)-associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) with &gt; 10 pack years smoking
      history. Hypothesis: Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC, &gt; 10 pack years smoking history, and
      non-mutated p53 will have similar 2 year progression-free survival (PFS) as patients with &lt;
      10 pack years smoking history.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a follow-up study to LCCC 1120 and 1413. The investigators have shown
      that de-intensification is efficacious in these two phase II studies. A major question is
      whether the investigators can de-intensify in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal
      cancer who have smoking histories. The investigators' hypothesis is that genomic profiling of
      patients' tumors (specifically for p53 mutations) will help in triaging patients to
      de-intensification versus standard of care. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC will be
      enrolled regardless of smoking history and p53 mutational status will be assessed in patients
      with a smoking history. The investigators will use the same de-intensification
      chemoradiotherapy regimen already evaluated in LCCC 1120 and 1413 in patients with
      HPV-associated OPSCC who have a minimal smoking history and in patients with a smoking
      history but with wild-type p53. Patients with a smoking history who have mutated p53 will not
      receive de-intensified chemoradiotherapy, but instead will receive standard doses. The
      hypothesis is that by using genomics in the patients with a significant smoking history, the
      investigators will better select those who can be safely de-intensified. Circulating free HPV
      DNA (cf-HPV-DNA) will also be prospectively assessed from blood samples.
