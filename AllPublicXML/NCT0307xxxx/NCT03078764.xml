  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project explores the feasibility of using automated telephone calls to adult patients
      with type 2 diabetes to improve diabetes self-management in Thailand. This line of work could
      significantly extend Thai nurses' ability to manage this growing epidemic, and ultimately
      reduce the suffering and costs caused by diabetes in Thailand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a serious shortage of community nurses to address Thailand's significant and
      expanding burden of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. However, mobile health (mHealth)
      strategies are likely to significantly improve and extend Thai nurses' ability to monitor and
      manage these patients. This study aims to:

      1) investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally- and clinically-adapted
      mHealth intervention with adult Thai diabetic patients and their community nurses, and 2)
      estimate the intervention's effect upon glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose,
      self-management behaviors, and diabetes-related distress in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
      Thirty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (along with their regular nurses)
      will be recruited through an established community clinic network. After baseline clinical
      and behavioral assessment, patients will receive 12 weeks of automated 10-minute weekly
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls to provide monitoring and self-management support
      related to glycemic symptoms, medication adherence, and several self-care behaviors.
      Patients' clinical nurse will receive weekly summaries of each IVR call by text message and
      email with guidance on Thai-appropriate best practices. Principal investigator will receive
      email whenever patients report a potentially urgent issue by IVR, i.e., symptoms of
      hypoglycemia, or inadequate supply of medication. Immediately after the 12-week intervention
      concludes, clinical and behavioral variables will be reassessed and a mixed-methods process
      evaluation will be performed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diabetes related distress</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured using the emotional and regimen subscales of a Thai translation of the well-validated Diabetes Distress Scale. This is a reliable and validated scale, and correlates with other measures of emotional distress. The responses range from 1-6. The higher scores indicate a greater degree of distress.</description>

    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using the same single item used during the IVR assessment, along with the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance-Short Form. The PROMIS (Patient-Report Outcomes Information System) Sleep Disturbance-Short Form is a 4-item self-report instrument covering the quality of sleep-wake functioning. Responses are scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The higher scores indicating a greater degree of sleep disturbance.</description>

  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms of hypoglycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using a 7 items that ask about low blood sugar symptoms, the same that the study team describe in the IVR calls. The responses range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (6-7 days a week). The higher scores indicate a greater degree of hypoglycemic symptoms.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>

    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) (Kroenke et al., 2009). It consists of 8 items with a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Higher scores indicate greater depressive symptom severity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Readiness for change</measure>
    <time_frame>13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed using 5 items from our prior research that is specifically worded to measure participants'preparedness to change the 5 diabetes self-care behaviors that our program targets, which are answered using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so). Higher scores indicate greater readiness for change.</description>

In the study, only 8 items of Hill-Bone Compliance scale will be used. Reverse coded before analysis will be performed. Higher scores indicate greater medication adherence. In addition, 1-item of the Brief Medication Questionnaire will be used, which allows calculation of percent adherence over the past 2 weeks</description>
