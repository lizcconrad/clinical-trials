  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if a new device is more effective in fluid
      administration than devices currently used when resuscitating pediatric patients in septic
      shock. This study will take place in a simulation lab setting and will not include the use of
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants will be randomized to one of three devices in a Pediatric
      Intensive Care Unit simulation setting. Each participant will be provided the device, a 1L NS
      bag, tubing and a 22g IV. In each scenario, the objective will be to administer 3 20cc/kg
      boluses within a 15 minute period to the simulated patient.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Successful administration of 60 cc/kg</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be timed to determine if they are able to administer 60 cc/kg of fluid within a 15 minute timeframe. This outcome will be measured as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' as to whether the task was completed successfully .</description>

    <measure>Time to complete fluid administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be timed to determine if they are able to administer 60 cc/kg of fluid within a 15 minute timeframe. The time in which they complete the task will be captured in minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NASA Task Load Index (TLX)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) is a measure overall workload that employs multiple visual analog scale measures in a series of domains. The domains are Mental Domain, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort and Frustration Level. The scale has a range from 0 to 100 with 100 being the highest indicator of workload.</description>

    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A qualitative questionnaire will be administered to participants following the simulation. Questions include information about experience with various methods and other feedback relevant to evaluation.</description>
