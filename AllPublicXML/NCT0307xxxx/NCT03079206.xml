      Accurate diagnosis of food allergy depends on food challenge outcome. The proposed study
      intends to compare the outcome of food challenge in hazelnut allergic patients with the
      outcome of basophile activation tests using hazelnut extract and components to evaluate the
      diagnostic utility of basophile activation testing.

      With a view towards improved in vitro diagnostic methods, the investigators intend to
      evaluate the diagnostic potential of basophile activation testing in patients with hazelnut
      allergy confirmed by a positive provocation or supported by a convincing history of
      anaphylactic reaction(s) to hazelnut in the past, patients with pollinosis but no symptoms of
      hazelnut allergy and non-atopic control subjects.
