      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of relationship education (RE) for
      individuals and couples participating in Project Harmony.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although considerable research supports the positive effects of relationship education (RE)
      on relationship satisfaction and communication skills, the majority of existing research
      designs have favored pre/post or quasi-experimental designs. Furthermore, gaps in the
      empirical bases for RE remain regarding programmatic moderators that influence change.
      Consequently, there has been less emphasis on understanding which program elements contribute
      to positive change within couple relationships. To this end, Project Harmony seeks to conduct
      an impact local evaluation design utilizing a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the
      effectiveness of relationship education between low income, ethnically diverse individuals
      and couples in the treatment group compared to the wait-list control group. Secondary
      research questions are focused on investigating mechanisms and moderators of change for the
      target population. Participants (individuals and couples) in Project Harmony will be randomly
      assigned to either the treatment or wait-list control group.
