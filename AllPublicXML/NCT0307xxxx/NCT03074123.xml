  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous study showed that afternoon cosyntropin testing was associated with a sevenfold
      increased likelihood of failing the 1μg test. However, in that study, investigators used a
      20.3 cm plastic tube, which might have led to uncompleted cosyntropin delivery. In ther
      current study investigators will study afternoon 1μg cosyntropin cortisol stimulation using a
      short 2.5 cm tube.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In earlier studies investigators claimed that subnormal cortisol response using plastic tubes
      might result from cosyntropin adherence to the tube and loss of the delivered dosage. It was
      shown that 21.6-58.6% of ACTH dosage had not been recovered when pushed through 20.3 cm
      plastic tube, and loss of ACTH may be up to 70% when cosyntropin was delivered through a
      plastic 30 cm scalp vein set.

      Moreover, it was previously shown that afternoon cosyntropin testing was associated with a
      sevenfold increased likelihood of failing the 1μg test. However, in that study, investigators
      used a 20.3 cm plastic tube, which might have led to uncompleted cosyntropin delivery. In
      ther current study investigators will study afternoon 1μg cosyntropin cortisol stimulation
      using a short 2.5 cm tube.

    <description>Each subject recruited in the study will undergo low dose cosyntropin stimulation test via intravenous short 2.5 cm plastic tube. 1 μg/ml ACTH aliquot stock solution will be pushed through, followed by 5 ml physiologic saline (0.9%). For each subject, serum and salivary cortisol will be measured just before cosyntropin administration and 30 minutes later.</description>
