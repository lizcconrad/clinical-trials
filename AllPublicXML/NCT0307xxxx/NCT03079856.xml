  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop a technology-augmented HIV and substance use risk reduction
      intervention for delivery in the Emergency Department, a medical setting where at-risk
      emerging adults who use drugs and engage in HIV-related risk behaviors are likely to present.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research regarding substance use (including illicit drugs and non-medical use of prescription
      drugs) and HIV-related sexual risk behaviors (HIV SRBs; e.g., inconsistent condom use,
      multiple partners, sex while intoxicated; and prevention of injection drug use) among
      emerging adults (EAs; ages 18-25) has generally focused on alcohol use among college students
      from campus settings; however, substance use and HIV (and other associated Sexually
      Transmitted Infections) disproportionately occur among young people living in urban,
      low-resource communities, particularly individuals of racial minorities. The Emergency
      Department (ED) is a critical venue for accessing at-risk EAs engaging in substance use and
      HIV risk behaviors. Research shows high rates of substance use and HIV SRBs among EA patients
      in the ED, yet no intervention exists for EAs in this setting. The ED may be the only
      opportunity to intervene with these young people because EAs in urban, low-resource settings
      often lack a primary care provider during the transition from pediatric to adult medicine,
      may be un-insured or under-insured, and may not be involved in a traditional college campus
      setting. Further the use of technology (e.g., mobile phones) is relatively ubiquitous among
      this age group, and most prefer technology-based communication (e.g., text messaging or
      instant messaging via apps), therefore interventions for EAs may be enhanced by this type of
      technology. In this phase we will test a tailored intervention for EA patients in the ED
      focusing on reducing substance use and HIV SRBs, which will be enhanced through the use of
      mobile app notifications.

    <description>Intervention for emerging adults (EAs) seeking care in the ED. The intervention will be rooted in motivational interviewing (MI) and will be guided by social cognitive, self-determination, and the trans-theoretical theories. The ED visit presents a &quot;teachable moment&quot; for intervening to promote health behavior, therefore eligible EAs will receive a ~30 minute MI-based session in the ED. In order to capitalize on and potentially extend this moment, participants will receive daily booster notifications delivered through a secure mobile app that they will download to their phone at enrollment.</description>
