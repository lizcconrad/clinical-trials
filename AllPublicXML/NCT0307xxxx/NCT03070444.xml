    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate and compare stability after orthodontic treatment
      with an Essix retainer and a bonded cuspid-to-cuspid retainer (CTC), respectively in the
      mandibular arch and longitudinally follow these patients over time up to 5 years. The
      patients' perceptions of the two methods are also evaluated with questionnaires during the
      follow-up period.

      A further aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between diagnosis, treatment
      outcome, treatment time, age at start of treatment and stability with an Essix retainer in
      the maxilla.

      The null hypotheses are:

        -  that there is no difference in retention capacity between Essix retainer and
           cuspid-to-cuspid retainer

        -  that there is no difference in patients' perception between Essix retainer and
           cuspid-to-cuspid retainer

        -  that there is no difference in retention capacity for Essix retainer in the maxilla
           concerning diagnosis before treatment, treatment outcomes, treatment time and age at
           start of treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted at the Orthodontic Clinic, Gävle, Sweden and consists of 104 patients.
      All patients are treated with fixed appliances in the upper and lower jaw (standard .022
      straight wire), both with and without extractions. The patients are randomized into two
      groups with 52 patients in each group (Group A: cuspid-to-cuspid retainer, Group B: Essix
      retainer).

      Dental cast are obtained at the debond appointment (T1) and at the follow-up controls after
      six months (T2), 18 months (T3) and 60 months (T4) for both groups.

      At the visit two weeks in retention and at the follow-up visits after 6, 18 and 60 months the
      patients assess questionnaires in order to evaluate their experience of retention with the
      retention device.
