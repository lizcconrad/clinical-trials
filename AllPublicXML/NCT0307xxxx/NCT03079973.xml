  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase III study is to evaluate the efficacy, systemic safety and local
      tolerability of P-3073 (calcipotriene 0.005%) nail solution in patients with mild to moderate
      psoriatic fingernail/s.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase III study versus vehicle will be conducted to confirm the clinical efficacy and
      safety of P-3073 in patients affected by isolated psoriatic nail(s) and/or those with
      psoriatic nails and concomitant mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis.

      The evaluation of the primary endpoint will be made using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index
      (NAPSI).

      The secondary objectives will be:

        -  To assess if the topical treatment with P-3073 is able to improve the quality of life
           and discomfort in patients with psoriatic fingernail.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of topical P-3073 in the treatment of psoriatic
           fingernail.

      The study consists of two arms comparing P-3073 (calcipotriene 0.005%) and vehicle. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to either P-3073 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by their
      target nail NAPSI severity at screening.

      The study population will include at least 470 patients (235 for each group) with nail
      psoriasis (fingernails) of the matrix and/or of the nail bed in at least one fingernail.

      The total duration of the trial for each patient will be approximately 29 weeks (from
      Screening to Follow-up). During the 24 weeks of the treatment period, patients will apply the
      assigned treatment to all affected psoriatic fingernails once daily.
