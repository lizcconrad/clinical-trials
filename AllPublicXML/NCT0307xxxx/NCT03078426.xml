    <textblock>
      High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) plays a major role in the management of idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) by identifying characteristic lesions of usual interstitial
      pneumonia (UIP). Though HRCT is the standard reference to describe pulmonary structural
      alterations using a non invasive technique, it is nonetheless a radiating exam which provides
      limited functional information regarding inflammation. In this trial, the investigators aimed
      to evaluate whether MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) using ultra-short echotime could be an
      alternative to HRCT in the assessment of the four morphological criteria required to define
      an UIP pattern. The investigators also planned to study the clinical value of the additional
      informations derived from MRI such as contrasts and lung perfusion using functional MRI.

    <textblock>
      High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is an essential component in the diagnostic
      pathway of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). With the appropriate clinical setting, the
      presence of an usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on HRCT is sufficient to diagnose
      IPF. Four morphological criteria are required: (1) Subpleural, basal predominance, (2)
      Reticular abnormality, (3) Honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis, (4) Absence
      of features inconsistent with UIP pattern. However, HRCT is a radiating technique and only
      give data about structural alterations. Recent advances in three-dimensional ultra-short echo
      time (3D-UTE) imaging have shown promising results in improving lung MR (Magnetic Resonance)
      imaging quality. Since HRCT is the standard reference in IPF, the investigators aimed to
      evaluate whether thoracic MRI could be an alternative to HRCT in the assessment of the four
      radiologic criteria required for the diagnosis of IPF. Moreover, thoracic MRI could give new
      functional data, expected to relate to lung inflammation.

      In order to study the diagnostic's accuracy of MRI for each radiological criteria defining
      UIP pattern, the investigators will compare HRCT and thoracic MRI of patients with IPF to
      HRCT and thoracic MRI of patients with other lung diseases that do not have all the UIP
      criteria.

      Study procedure will be gadolinium-enhanced PETRA (pointwise encoding time reduction with
      radial acquisition) MR sequencing compared to unenhanced HRCT within 15 days. No follow-up is
      needed.
