  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate two new biomarkers in sputum samples. These are PiP3
      (phosphoinositolphospat ) and phosphor proteins, representing important proteins within
      inflammatory situations of the lung.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the study, sputum samples will be collected at 3 repetitive occasions in a 3 week
      interval of the different donors.

      The objective is to assess for biomarker specificity and reproducibility in the two groups
      (smokers and non-smokers). The methods for measurement shall be validated by repetitive
      measurement of the sputum samples, i.e. comparison of multiple measurements of the same
      sample and comparison of different samples from the same donor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • Healthy male and female subjects, aged 25-45 years. Women will be considered for
             inclusion if they are not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test and not nursing.

        Females of childbearing potential need to use a highly effective method of contraception
        during the entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle of the
        female should be such that there is complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks
        prior to the first visit until at least 72 hours after the last visit -, implants,
        injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs (intrauterine device) or
        double-barrier methods, i.e. any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel,
        diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap).

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg and BMI (body mass index) within the range 19-32 kg/m²

          -  Smokers need to consume at least ten cigarettes per day and need to have at least ten
             packyear

          -  Non-smokers need to be non-smoking since at least a year with a smoking history of no
             more than 1 packyear.

          -  FEV1 (forced expiratory volume at one second)≥80% predicted and FEV1/FVC (forced
             expiratory vital capacity) ≥70%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • History of an acute infection four weeks prior to the informed consent visit.

               -  Regular intake of medication.

               -  Past or present disease, which as judged by the investigator, may affect the
                  outcome of this study. These diseases include, but are not limited to,
                  cardiovascular disease, malignancy, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological
                  disease, neurological disease, endocrine disease or pulmonary disease (including
                  but not confined to chronic bronchitis, emphysema, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis
                  or cystic fibrosis).

               -  Participation in another clinical trial 30 days prior to enrollment.
