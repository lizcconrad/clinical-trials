  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the neural correlates of cognitive control
      (CC) deficits in schizophrenia and determine how these mechanisms can be modulated by
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). CC is a critical neurocognitive process that
      is required for flexible, directed thought and action based on goals and intentions.
      Identifying and developing paradigms to improve CC is therefore a mental health priority.
      Current theories of CC postulate that recruitment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) is essential for this process by maintaining high-level information that it can then
      use to orchestrate patterns of activation in other brain networks to support optimal
      performance. tDCS is a safe, noninvasive method of modulating regional brain excitability via
      brief (15-20 m) application of a weak (1-2 mA) current. The goal of the proposed experiments
      is to combine tDCS with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypotheses
      that 1) acute tDCS over the DLPFC can improve performance during a CC task (the dot pattern
      expectancy (DPX) variant of the AX-Continuous Performance Task) in schizophrenia patients and
      healthy control subjects, and 2) acute tDCS over the DLPFC can increase recruitment of the
      DLPFC during the DPX. Effects of tDCS on brain functional connectivity (during CC as well as
      during the resting state) will also be examined, as well as effects on an episodic memory
      task. The current study will be the first to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      to examine the effects of tDCS on the neuronal mechanisms of CC in schizophrenia, and has
      potentially important implications for therapeutic development for this treatment refractory
      yet disabling aspect of the illness.

    <description>In tDCS, saline-soaked electrodes are temporary affixed to the scalp and connected to a battery-powered current generator. A weak (2 mA) constant current is then briefly applied (~20 minutes) to stimulate the targeted brain area (e.g. the DLPFC). To control for placebo effects, the study will utilize a sham stimulation protocol that consists of very brief constant stimulation (~1 minute). Subjects usually cannot discern the difference between the sham and experimental stimulation protocols due to habituation.</description>
