    <measure>Phase I part: To evaluate the safety profile of intratumoral (IT) Pexa-Vec combined with intravenous (IV) nivolumab in patients with advanced HCC. Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DLTs are defined as the occurrence of any of the following events evaluated as related to study drugs and occurring during the first 4 weeks:
All Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity that represent a 2-grade increase over baseline, excluding: inadequately treated nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, alopecia, transient fatigue and laboratory/metabolic abnormalities.
Any Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related acute immune-related AE involving major organs.
Grade ≥ 3 injection site reaction.
AST or ALT ≥ 10xULN, unless it is related to a definite progression of liver metastases or another clearly identifiable etiology; doubling of AST or ALT that is concurrent with a doubling of the total bilirubin.
Any toxicity related to study therapy that results in a delay in treatment of 2 or more weeks.
Neutropenia lasting for more than 7 days; Neutropenic fever; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding.</description>

    <measure>Phase IIa part: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity and efficacy of IT Pexa-Vec combined with IV nivolumab in patients with advanced HCC with respect to Overall Response Rate (ORR) (RECIST 1.1).</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological/cytological diagnosis of primary HCC, excluding cholangiocarcinoma,
             hepatocholangiocarcinoma, fibrolamellar carcinoma and hepatoblastoma

          -  Advanced stage HCC per EASL-EORTC (European Association for the Study of the
             Liver-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) guidelines, i.e.
             patients who are not candidates for curative interventions and not candidates for
             locoregional modalities

          -  Patients naïve to systemic therapy for HCC

          -  Tumor status (as determined by radiology evaluation): At least one measurable viable
             tumor in the liver, ≥1 cm longest diameter (LD), using a dynamic imaging technique
             (arterial phase of triphasic computerized tomography [CT] scan, or dynamic
             contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), and injectable under
             imaging-guidance (CT or ultrasound)

          -  At least one tumor that has not received prior local-regional treatment, or that has
             exhibited definitive growth of viable tumor since prior local-regional treatment of
             HCC undertaken at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment or 3 months prior to enrolment for
             radioembolization

          -  Child-Pugh Class A. Note: paracentesis, albumin infusion or diuretic treatment cannot
             be used to downgrade Child-Pugh score (e.g., to improve from severe to moderate/mild
             or from moderate to mild ascites)

          -  Performance status 0 or 1 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic, and renal function

          -  Current or past history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., past history of myocardial
             infarction, ischemic cardiomyopathy) unless cardiology consultation and clearance has

             encephalopathy or pleural effusions related to liver insufficiency within 6 months of

          -  Active, known or suspected significant immunodeficiency due to underlying illness
             including HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases, and/or immune-suppressive medication
             including high-dose corticosteroids

          -  History of severe eczema and/or ongoing severe inflammatory skin condition (as
             determined by the Investigator) requiring medical treatment
