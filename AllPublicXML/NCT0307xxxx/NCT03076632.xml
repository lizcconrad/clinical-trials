    <textblock>
      -  People with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
           have reduced connections in the nerve circuits between the brain and the hands.
           Activating spared nerve circuits is one potential way to improve recovery.

        -  The investigators are testing different combinations of physical wrist and hand
           movements paired with magnetic brain stimulation and electrical spinal cord or nerve
           stimulation to see the effects on nerve transmission to hand muscles.

        -  This is a preliminary study. This study is testing for temporary changes in nerve
           transmission to hand muscles. There is no expectation of long-term benefit from this
           study. If temporary changes are seen in this study, then future studies would focus on
           how to prolong that effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) result in a mixture of
      destroyed, damaged, and spared neural circuits. Activating spared nerve circuits augments
      neural transmission.

      With this goal in mind, the investigators recently developed a novel method of cervical
      electrical stimulation (CES) to noninvasively activate arm and hand muscles. The
      investigators are conducting a pilot clinical study (NCT02469675) to establish CES safety in
      subjects with cervical SCI, ALS, and non-disabled volunteers. To date, 19 subjects have
      undergone &gt;120 CES sessions without major safety or tolerability issues.

      The current study is designed to gain further mechanistic insight. In Aim 1, the
      investigators will test in more detail how CES (traveling through spinal and peripheral
      circuits) interacts with individual pulses of TMS (traveling through corticospinal circuits).
      In Aim 2, the investigators will further test CES's therapeutic potential by combining
      stimulation with simultaneous physical exercises. In Aim 3, the investigators will compare
      the acute effects on synaptic transmission of passive stimulation to stimulation triggered by
      the subject's own muscle activity.

      Please note, this is a preliminary study. This study is testing for temporary changes in
      nerve transmission to hand muscles. There is no expectation of long-term benefit from this
      study. If the investigators see temporary changes in this study, then future studies would
      focus on how to prolong that effect.
