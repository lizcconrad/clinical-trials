  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the value of employing the aortic no-touch
      off-pump coronary artery bypass technique and the practice of carbon dioxide surgical field
      flooding for the prevention of type 1 and 2 neurological injuries following surgical coronary
      revascularization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurological injuries remain a major concern following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
      that offset survival benefit of CABG over percutaneous coronary interventions. Among numerous
      efforts to combat this issue, is off-pump CABG (OPCABG) that obviates the need for
      extracorporeal circulation and is associated with improved outcomes. The objective of this
      study is to examine whether the neuroprotective effect of OPCABG can be further pronounced by
      the use of two state-of-the-art operating techniques.

      In this randomised, controlled, investigator and patient blinded single center superiority
      trial with three parallel arms a total of 360 patients will be recruited. They will be
      allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to two treatment and one control arms. Treatment arms undergoing
      either aortic no-touch OPCABG or OPCABG with a partial clamp applying carbon dioxide surgical
      field flooding will be compared against control arm undergoing OPCABG. The primary endpoint
      will be the appearance of new lesions on control brain magnetic resonance imaging 3 days
      after surgery. Secondary endpoints will include the prevalence of new focal neurological
      deficits in the first 7 days after surgery, the occurrence of postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction at either 1 week or 3 months after surgery and the incidence of delirium in the
      first 7 days after surgery. Data will be analysed on intention-to-treat principles and a per
      protocol basis.

    <description>(Study arm 1) In this intervention only the internal mammary artery grafts will be used (i.e. left internal mammary artery graft, right internal mammary artery graft, or a Y-graft that uses right internal mammary artery graft anastomosed onto left internal mammary artery graft to allow for a wide territory of myocardial revascularization). However, in the rare event that the aforementioned approach is insufficient to reach all target vessels, a reversed (great) saphenous vein graft may be used to extend the left internal mammary artery graft or the right internal mammary artery graft.</description>
