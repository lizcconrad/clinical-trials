  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PROREPAIR is a prospective multicenter observational cohort study of unselected patients with
      metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) with unknown germline mutational
      status at study entry and who are candidates to start 1st line treatment with any approved
      survival-prolonging agent.

      The study aims to evaluate the impact of aberrations in DNA-repair genes,(BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM
      and PALB2 and other genes) on cause-specific survival from the diagnosis of the metastatic
      castration resistant status and other outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study in which eligible patients are prospectively followed-up
      until death or the end-of-study, whichever happens first.

      Patients are enrolled after mCRPC diagnosis and before or within the 6 first months of
      starting a first-line treatment with any approved survival-prolonging agent for mCRPC. First
      and subsequent treatment lines will be chosen according to the patients and their treating
      physicians preferences and will not be dictated by this study.

      A whole blood sample for germline DNA extraction as well as any available archival prostate
      cancer tissue samples will be collected at baseline. Optional plasma, serum and whole blood
      samples will be collected at baseline and at different time points along the evolution of the
      disease. A sample will be collected within the last 6 months of life.

      Survival and treatment outcomes including biochemical, radiological and clinical progression
      with standard approved agents abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, cabazitaxel and
      radium-223 will be prospectively collected.

      Primary aim is to evaluate the prevalence and impact of DNA repair germline mutations in the
      BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and PALB2 genes on cause-specific survival from mCRPC. Secondary aims will
      include the correlation of additional germline alterations in DNA-repair with survival and
      treatment outcomes; the analyses of the survival and treatment outcomes impact of somatic
      alterations in these genes and the role of germline and somatic defects in the clonal
      evolution of prostate cancer.

    <description>The exposition to the primary analysis risk factor (germline deleterious mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM or PALB2 gene) will be determined after inclusion. Briefly, a NGS targeted-panel based on the majority of genes included in the BROCA panel and additional DNA-repair related genes has been designed based on the available technology. The pathogenicity of germline variants will be determined according to established American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology current consensus at the time of final primary outcome analyses. Variants will also be reviewed against published literature and public databases. According to their mutation-carrier status patients will be classified as: A) Mutation Carriers in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and PALB2 genes; B) Mutation carriers in other genes included in the BROCA panel; C) Mutation carriers in others DNA-repair genes D)Non-carriers</description>
