    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of the zinc biofortified rice on plasma zinc concentrations in infants
      from a rural area of Bangladesh.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Around the world and estimated 30% of the population is at risk of Zinc
      deficiency, mainly due to monotonous plant base diets and the poor bioavailability of this
      sources. One staple food crop which is low in zinc content is rice. Therefore, zinc
      deficiency is highly common in Asia. Zinc plays a major role in child growth and
      neurobehavioral development. Furthermore, it is linked to infection control and normal immune
      response. One way to add extra zinc to someone's diet is zinc bio fortification of staple
      crops, which can be a cost saving sustainable approach to improve zinc nutrition. However,
      data on long-term intake of biofortified crops with zinc is scarce and efficacy of newly
      developed rice crops high in zinc are not well known.

      Objective: The objective is to assess the efficacy of a newly developed zinc biofortified
      rice variety on plasma zinc concentrations in children in a rural area of Bangladesh when
      compared to their controls in a 9 month randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      Study design: A double randomized control trial. Study population: Stunted children whom are
      zinc deficient at start of the study intervention determined by plasma zinc levels &lt;9.9
      µmol/L.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The difference in zinc status between the intervention and
      control group expressed in blood plasma zinc levels. Plasma zinc will be measured 4 times
      during the intervention period. Besides plasma zinc other zinc biomarkers will be tested for
      their usefulness.
