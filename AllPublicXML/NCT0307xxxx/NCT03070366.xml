      The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of living patients at 1 year with a quality of
      life criteria (no decrease) and reduced toxicities. This criteria will be compared in both
      groups., A cost effectiveness study is scheduled also.

    <textblock>
      Patients with cancers of aerodigestive tract have metastases limited in their evolution and a
      pauci-metastatic disease. In these cases, systemic therapy is the standard attitude. However,
      patients often received chemotherapy in their history and response rates are relatively low.
      The median survival is between 7 and 11 months with secondary effects and degradation of
      quality of life. It is a palliative treatment. Data on systemic treatment in the context of a
      micro-metastatic disease are limited. In contrast, stereotactic irradiation in
      pauci-metastatic context leads to better local control rates and may sustainedly reduce the
      progression of metastatic disease.

      Stereotactic radiotherapy is increasing use in clinical practice for limited metastatic
      stages (oligo metastatic with 1-3 synchronized metastases). Radiotherapy in this indication
      has major advantages and a similar efficacy compared with other ablative treatments.

    <description>Chemotherapy is based on patient Performance Status (PS) and comorbidities:
PS 0-1: standard treatment: 6 cycles, every 3 weeks cisplatin (100 mg/m² iv on D1), 5FU (4000 mg/m² total dose starting on Day 1 to Day 4 and during 96h in continuous infusion)
PS 2/cardiac contra-indication to 5 Fluorouracil (5FU): 6 cycles, every 3-4 weeks cisplatin (100 mg/m² iv on Day 1) or carboplatin Area Under Curve (AUC) 4 or 5 on Day 1 In both case: Cetuximab (loading dose 400 mg/m² iv on Day1, then 250 mg/m² weekly or 500mg/m² every 2 weeks).
Cycle 1 of systemic treatment will be administered before the start of the stereotactic RT. Then, following cycles will be performed after the end of stereotactic irradiation.
Cetuximab maintenance: 250 mg/m² iv weekly. It will be given only if at least disease stabilization is observed at the end of chemotherapy, and will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>

    <description>Splitting will be based on the tumor diameter, and proximity of organs at risk which constitutes any limiting toxicities. It will be 3 or 5 fractions based on the recommendations (CARO-Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) 2012) and for the purpose of harmonization practices. The prescription dose is 3 x 10 = 30 Gy 3 x 11 = 33 Gy or 3 x 15 = 45 Gy (if 3 fractions) with the possibility of 3 x 20 Gy to the peripheral lung nodules with tracking in Cyberknife or 5 x 7 = 35 Gy or 5 Gy x 10 = 50 (if 5 fractions). Beyond 3 cm of tumor diameter and / or to a distance of less than 1 cm from the GTV in an organ critical risk (eg spinal cord), a splitting up into 5 sessions must be privileged.</description>
