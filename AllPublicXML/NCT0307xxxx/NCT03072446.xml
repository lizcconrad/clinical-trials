  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-market study is to evaluate UFE agents for the treatment of
      symptomatic uterine fibroids, using Gel-Bead compared to four other commonly used embolic
      agents.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective study will be conducted at one site in the United Kingdom. Up
      to 30 subjects will be enrolled and treated with Gel-Bead. Prospectively. Enrolled Gel-Bead
      subjects will be followed at 1-month and 3-months post-procedure.

      Data from subjects treated with Gel-Bead will be compared to data from a previously
      unpublished, but widely presented, 100-patient cohort study at the University Hospital
      Southampton. This study evaluated 20 subjects in five different treatment groups for the
      treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. The five treatment groups include gelatin foam
      slurry, Embospheres, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), Bead Block and Embozenes.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the degree of fibroid tissue infarction at 3 months post-procedure. Results for the total fibroid load and the dominant fibroid will be categorized as either 100% (Group A) â‰¥ 90-99% (Group B) or &lt;90% (Group C) infarcted. The degree of infarction will be visually estimated by the investigator.</description>

    <measure>Change in uterine and dominant fibroid volumes</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in uterine and dominant fibroid volumes between pre-procedure and Month 3 based on CE-MRI. The absolute dimensions of the uterus will be measured and the approximate uterine volumes will be calculated using the formula for a prolate ellipse (length X width X depth X 0.5233).</description>
