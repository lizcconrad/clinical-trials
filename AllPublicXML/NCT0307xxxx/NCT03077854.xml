  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is a standard curative treatment for locally advanced,
      unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and limited stage small cell lung cancer
      (SCLC). TRT has been recognized to cause moderate to severe lung injury in a substantial
      portion of patients. Conventional standard curative TRT planning techniques minimize the
      radiation dose to the anatomical lungs, without adaption of regional pulmonary function
      variations. The principal investigator hypothesized that preferential avoidance of functional
      lung during curative TRT may decrease the risk of pulmonary toxicity. Functional lung regions
      are identified using four- dimensional computed tomography for ventilation imaging. This
      randomized, single-blind trial will comprehensively assess the impact of functional lung
      avoidance on pulmonary toxicity, quality of life, and clinical outcome in patients receiving
      curative TRT for locally advanced NSCLC and SCLC.

          4. Patients do not have prior radiotherapy to the thorax

          5. Age ≥ 20 years

          6. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 60%.

          7. Women of childbearing potential and male participants must practice adequate
             contraception

          8. Patients must be able to comply with the study protocol and follow-up schedules and
             provide study-specific informed consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Prior radiotherapy to thorax

          2. Unable to receive assigned radiation dose due to normal lung constraint

          3. Inability to attend full course of radiotherapy or follow-up visits

             where all metastases have been ablated (with surgery or radiotherapy) or in complete
             remission after systemic therapy are candidates if they are receiving radiotherapy to
             the thoracic disease with curative intent

          5. Severe, active comorbidities which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or interfere significantly with
             the proper assessment of safety and adverse events of the protocol, or limit
             compliance with study requirements, defined as follows:

               -  Uncontrolled active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time of
                  registration

               -  Transmural myocardial infarction ≤ 6 months prior to registration.

                  prior to registration.

               -  Life-threatening uncontrolled clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias.

               -  Hepatic insufficiency resulting in clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defects.

               -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
                  requiring hospitalization or precluding study therapy at the time of

               -  Uncontrolled psychiatric disorder.

          6. Women of childbearing potential and male participants who are sexually active and not
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this exclusion is
             necessary because the radiation treatment involved in this study may be significantly
             teratogenic.
