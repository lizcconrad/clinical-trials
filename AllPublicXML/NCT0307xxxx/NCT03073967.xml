      Randomized, open-label, multi-center, comparative trial to assess the efficacy and safety in
      immunocompromised subjects with acyclovir resistant mucocutaneous HSV infection, treated with
      pritelivir 100 mg qd (following a loading dose of 400 mg as first dose to rapidly reach
      steady-state plasma concentration) or foscarnet 40 mg/kg iv tid/60mg/kg iv bid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunocompromised male or female subjects with acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV
      infection based on clinical failure requiring switch to foscarnet treatment. The acyclovir
      resistance status will be documented by genotypic testing, if the results from genotypic
      testing are negative or inconclusive phenotypic testing will be performed.

      Pritelivir trial medication will be given orally as single daily doses until 7 days after the
      mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to a maximum of 28 days, whichever is earlier.
      Foscarnet will be given as intermittent infusions at a dose of 40 mg/kg every 8 hours or
      60mg/kg every 12 hours (to be adjusted in case of renal impairment) for a minimum of 1 hour
      duration until 7 days after the mucocutaneous HSV lesions are healed or up to a maximum of 28
      days, whichever is earlier.

             transaminase) or ALT (alanine transaminase) &gt; 5 x ULN (upper Limit of normal),
             bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN

          4. History or current evidence of gastrointestinal malabsorption which, in the opinion of

          5. Severe renal insufficiency (GFR ≤ 29).

          6. History or current evidence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, hematological, endocrinological, metabolic, neurological,
             psychiatric, or other diseases, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             the subject's safety or interfere with the trial.

          7. Abnormalities in hematological, clinical chemical or any other laboratory variables at
             Screening measured by the central or local laboratory regarded as clinically relevant
             by the investigator unless they are due to underlying disease or condition.

          8. Not able to communicate meaningfully with the Investigator and site staff.

          9. Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with

         12. Having received an investigational drug in an investigational drug trial within the
             last 30 days before randomization for this clinical trial. Participation in a clinical

             observational study) is permitted.
