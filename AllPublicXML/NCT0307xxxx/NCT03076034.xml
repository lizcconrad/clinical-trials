  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether a new minimally invasive method for in
      vivo measurement of cortical bone tissue properties can identify those who are at risk for
      fragility fractures of the hip and radius. The investigators hypothesis is that women with
      fragility fractures of the hip and radius have altered cortical bone tissue properties
      compared to non-fracture controls independent of standard clinical tests, such as bone
      mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

      The objective of this study is to determine whether a new minimally invasive method for in
      vivo measurement of cortical bone tissue properties can identify those who are at risk for
      fragility fractures of the hip and radius. The investigators hypothesis is that women with
      fragility fractures of the hip and radius have altered cortical bone tissue properties
      compared to non-fracture controls independent of standard clinical tests, such as BMD. To
      test these hypotheses, The investigators propose two aims:

      Aim 1: Compare cortical bone tissue properties as assessed in vivo by reference point
      indentation in women with hip fractures and non-fracture controls.

      The investigators will compare cortical bone tissue material properties, as assessed by novel
      in vivo indentation at the mid-tibia in postmenopausal women with recent hip fractures (n)
      and age-similar controls without fractures (n=). In addition to in vivo indentation
      measurements, The investigators will assess hip and spine BMD by DXA; as well as other
      factors that may influence risk of fractures (e.g, vit D status, medication use and physical
      activity). Hypotheses: Postmenopausal women with hip fractures will have worse bone tissue
      material properties compared to non-fracture controls even after adjustment for BMD and other
      potential confounders.

      Aim 2: Compare cortical bone tissue properties as assessed in vivo by reference point
      indentation in women with distal radius fractures to non-fracture controls.

      The investigators will compare cortical bone tissue material properties, as assessed by novel
      in vivo indentation at the mid-tibia in postmenopausal women with recent distal radius
      fractures (n) and age-similar controls without fractures (n=). In addition to in vivo
      indentation measurements, The investigators will assess hip and spine BMD by DXA; as well as
      other factors that may influence risk of fractures (e.g, vit D status, medication use and
      physical activity). Hypotheses: Postmenopausal women with distal radius fractures will have
      worse bone tissue material properties compared to non-fracture controls even after adjustment
      for BMD and other potential confounders.

      Successful completion of this project will address the need to better assess bone mechanical
      properties at the tissue level in order to accurately predict fracture risk. The study will
      provide novel information about possible clinical utility of minimally invasive, in vivo bone
      indentation measurements to measure bone strength and its relationship to fracture risk.

    <description>The &quot;Osteoprobe&quot;: Since these first reports of indentation measurements in humans in vivo, a more 'user-friendly' device, the Osteoprobe® has been developed by Active Life Scientific (Santa Barbara, CA) (10). The Osteoprobe®, which we will use in the current study, is smaller than the previous reference point indentation (RPI) instrument and is designed to be used in a hand-held fashion to allow for rapid measurements. The new instrument does not require a reference probe, because the inertia of the instrument keeps it adequately fixed in space during the short time of the indentation impact (~0.25 milliseconds). The main parameter measured is the distance that the probe further indents into the bone from the reference point. Key components of the Osteoprobe® include an impact generation mechanism, a displacement transducer, and a probe made of hardened stainless steel with a 90 degree conical tip, with a tip diameter of ~375 µm.</description>
