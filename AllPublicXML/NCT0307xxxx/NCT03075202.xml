  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established in the scientific literature that people with schizophrenia smoke
      tobacco cigarettes at rates up to three times that of the general population, relapse more
      frequently, and die an average of 25 years earlier from cigarette smoking and other
      life-style attributable illnesses. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are becoming
      increasingly popular with smokers worldwide and new research suggests that e-cigarettes are
      appealing to smokers with schizophrenia. There is a paucity of research focused on the
      experience of smokers with schizophrenia who decide to try an e-cigarette. A well-designed
      prospective-observational study is needed to learn more about the influence of e-cigarette
      use on cigarette smoking behavior and mental and physical health among smokers with
      schizophrenia. In response, the investigators have designed a study titled, Role of an
      electronic cigarette on smoking displacement in smokers with schizophrenia: A prospective
      3-month pilot study (SchizEcig).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective 3 month pilot study to observe cigarette use behavior among people with
      a schizophrenia spectrum disorder diagnosis who smoke conventional tobacco cigarettes, do not
      intend to reduce or quit smoking, and are invited to use an e-cigarette. The investigators
      are interested to know if e-cigarette use is associated with cigarette smoking displacement.
      Displacement is defined as switching from conventional tobacco cigarettes to e-cigarettes.
      The investigators will also monitor for physical and mental health, including blood pressure,
      weight, and scores from the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the
      Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) as well as any reported adverse events
      participants' feel are attributed to e-cigarette use and participants' perceptions of the
      sensory experience associated with e-cigarette use.

    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of study participants with a self-reported complete displacement from tobacco cigarette smoking - not even a puff in between study visits, along with confirmatory eCO values ≤10 ppm at each study visit. These participants will be referred to as &quot;Displacers&quot;. Discrepancies between self-report and eCO measures will be handled on a case-by-case basis. To assure an accurate eCO reading participants will be asked not to smoke cigarettes within one hour of the study visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Partial Displacement</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>Partial displacement will be defined as a minimization in cigarette consumption by ≥50% in the number of tobacco cigarettes smoked per day from baseline to the final visit (week 12) by participants' self-report together with an eCO decline from baseline.. The measures will be taken at each study visit. These participants will be referred to as &quot;Partial Displacers&quot;. Discrepancies between self-report and eCO measures will be handled on a case-by-case basis. To assure an accurate eCO reading participants will be asked not to smoke cigarettes within one hour of the study visit.</description>

        per day and at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and do not intend to reduce or quit
