      Research question and basic idea:

      Interprofessional collaboration is a skill that many health professionals need to develop.
      Interprofessional training offers a way to improve collaboration and patient care. The
      increasing number of psychiatric patients with complex needs, requires mental healthcare
      providers to enhance their skills. It necessitates that healthcare professionals collaborate
      effectively; nevertheless, many have not been trained in an interprofessional environment.
      Health professionals lack sufficient knowledge of other professional roles and competences to
      engage in teamwork. Interprofessional study units have been designed to create an optimal
      learning environment for healthcare students. These study units provide a new environment for
      learning, where students can learn from each other and develop competence in
      interprofessional collaboration. This collaboration gives students from several health
      professions an opportunity to achieve a greater understanding of the overall picture of the
      patient´s life. The limited data available suggest interprofessional collaboration
      interventions can improve health-care processes and outcomes; however, better designed
      studies are needed.

      Objective: Therefore, we will investigate whether placement at a psychiatric study unit
      compared with placement at a standard psychiatric ward improves students´ interprofessional
      skills.

      Objective: Therefore, we will investigate whether placement at a psychiatric study unit
      compared with placement at a standard psychiatric ward improves students´ interprofessional
      skills.

      Methods Design This quasi-experimental study with an intervention group (of 100 students) and
      a control group (of 90 students), where students in the intervention group receive
      interprofessional training in the psychiatric study unit in Slagelse (SL3), while students in
      the control group receive training in standard psychiatric wards (SL2,SL4,SL5). The
      intervention is an interprofessional clinical study unit including students from nursing,
      medicine, psychology, social work and nursing assistants.

      Sample size and feasibility:

      The power calculation in this study is based on findings in a cross-sectional study. We use
      the students' interprofessional skills as the primary outcome. In the cross-sectional study
      the students had a mean score (RIPLS) of 69.98 (SD 25.5). When the sample size was
      calculated, 70 patients were needed in both the intervention and the control group. 82
      students have clinical placement in the psychiatric study unit in Slagelse annually (SL3) and
      67 students have clinical placement in the standard psychiatric wards (SL2, SL4 and SL5).
      Therefore, it seems realistic to include 190 students within 18 months.

      Participants:

      Students taking part in their clinical placement in Psychiatry West in Slagelse. Primarily
      including students from Nursing, in their 3rd year clinical placement, graduate medical
      students 4th term, clinical placement in psychiatry and nursing assistants in their 2nd year
      clinical placement. Students from the intervention group are similar to the control group in
      terms of stage of education and duration of clinical training.

      Allocation and recruitment:

      Students in both groups are allocated by program coordinators and supervisors from the
      involved university and colleges (University of Copenhagen, University College Zealand and
      Social and Healthcare College Zealand). The supervisors are responsible for the two groups of
      students and provided lists of names and current e-mail addresses that we entered into the
      web-based survey system EasyTrial. We use EasyTrial to send personal e-mails to all students
      inviting them to participate with a link to their personal questionnaire.

      Intervention:

      In 2015, Psychiatry in Slagelse established an interprofessional clinical study unit. The aim
      was to create a new environment for learning, where students could learn from each other and
      develop competence in interprofessional collaboration. In the study unit there are more
      students than in the other standard psychiatric wards and several professions are included.

      A facilitator team is responsible for the interprofessional training. In autumn 2016 seven
      professionals participate in course of facilitating interprofessional collaboration and
      training. The intervention involved the total staff participation in an initial eight-hour
      interactive workshop on the subject.

      The study unit is based on two educational interventions: Student participation in clinical
      care teams and interprofessional group tuition sessions.

      Clinical care team:

      The interprofessional clinical care team ensures that the patient pathways are well-planned
      and well-coordinated. Professionals included in the patient's care are part of the team
      alongside with the patient and their relatives. In the study unit the students are also part
      of the team. The team meets weekly. The team conference is an important interdisciplinary
      element in support of patient care during hospitalization. This is very important as
      patients' needs are often complex.

      Interprofessional group tuition:

      Interprofessional group tuition is a method to improve professional reflection on clinical
      practice. Patients in the study unit and their treatment and care are in focus. The group
      tuition takes an entire day with a mixture of theory and patient cases, in which all
      professional groups of students participate. The supervisors are responsible for planning the
      sessions.

      Ethical considerations:

      The study is licensed by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2008-58-0020) and needed no
      further ethical approval according to Danish legislation (16-000014). Data is anonymized and
      stored in a secure server. Students will be informed about the project and its purpose
      immediately before participation. The return of questionnaires will be considered consent to
      participation.

      Time schedule:

      Data collection is started October 2016 and will run for 18 months. Data analysis will start
      January 2018. Publications are planned for 2018. The PhD study is scheduled for 3 years and
      will end on 31 March 2019.
