  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An early phase I study to evaluate the uptake of [68Ga]P16-093 in known or suspected
      metastatic prostate or renal cancer to establish the feasibility of using [68Ga]P16-093 to
      image PSMA expressing cancer. Measurement of the whole body biodistribution of [68Ga]P16-093
      in man to generate human radiation dosimetry data.

        DYNAMIC GROUP:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of histologically confirmed cancer that meets criteria for either a) or b)

               1. Prostate cancer with known or suspected recurrent or metastatic disease based on
                  clinical imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT) within 3
                  months of screening. If subject is post curative-intent local treatment (e.g.
                  radical prostatectomy, local radiotherapy, brachytherapy) they must meet one of
                  the following criteria:

                    -  Post-Prostatectomy (with or without adjuvant RT):

                  detectable or rising PSA level that is ≥ 0.2 ng/mL with a second confirmatory
                  level of ≥ 0.2 ng/mL measured at least 2 weeks apart OR

                    -  Post-Radiotherapy: detectable or rising PSA level that has risen from nadir
                       in at least 3 consecutive tests measured at least 2 weeks apart OR

               2. Renal Cell cancer with known or suspected metastatic disease based on clinical
                  imaging (e.g. CT, bone scan, MRI, ultrasound, FDG PET/CT)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Estimated creatinine clearance (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min (calculated from serum creatinine
             result within 30 days of screening)

          2. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months prior to screening

          3. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of screening

          4. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          5. Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record
             review and/or self-reported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a
             condition that could compromise participant safety or successful completion of the
             study

        BIODISTRIBUTION GROUP:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prostate cancer that is post curative-intent local treatment (e.g.radical
             prostatectomy, local radiotherapy, brachytherapy) with clinical PSA levels that meet
             one of the following criteria

               1. Post-Prostatectomy (with or without adjuvant RT): PSA level that is &lt; 0.2 ng/mL
                  measured over at least 2 consecutive tests OR

               2. Post-Radiotherapy: PSA level that has not risen from nadir measured over at least
                  2 consecutive tests

          -  If clinical imaging (e.g. bone scan, CT, MRI, ultrasound, PET/CT) has been done within
             3 months of screening as part of standard clinical surveillance it must be negative or
             equivocal for sites of recurrent or metastatic disease (clinical imaging is not
             required for enrollment)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Estimated creatinine clearance (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min (calculated from serum creatinine
             result within 30 days of screening)

          2. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 3 months prior to screening

          3. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of screening

          4. Inability to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician

          5. Any current medical condition, illness, or disorder as assessed by medical record
             review and/or self-reported that is considered by a physician investigator to be a
             condition that could compromise participant safety or successful completion of the
             study
