  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of Americans seek emergency care for acute shortness of breath, and many undergo
      computerized tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) testing that is negative for acute
      disease. Management of patients with persistent shortness of breath despite normal testing
      continues to pose a challenge for clinicians. Right ventricular (RV) failure is a common
      cause of dyspnea that brings patients to the emergency department (ED), however, it is often
      not considered in the differential diagnosis, remains unrecognized, or patients are not
      properly followed up once diagnosed. Delays in diagnosis and management of RV failure are
      associated with poor outcomes. The investigators propose a novel clinical pathway, which
      entails identifying and enrolling patients with RV failure in the ED, then referring them to
      a specialized cardiovascular clinic where they will receive a standardized evaluation and
      management plan. Our hypothesis is that management of RV failure, through this pathway, will
      improve patient outcomes when compared to standard care. The primary outcome will assess
      1-year unscheduled healthcare visits.

          -  adult patients &gt; 18 years old,

          -  with a non-significant CTPA scan (i.e. no acute disease), dyspnea PLUS an emergency
             physician performed echocardiogram with isolated RV failure OR CTPA scan with evidence
             of pulmonary hypertension OR comprehensive echocardiogram within 3 months of index
