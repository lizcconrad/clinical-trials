    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether exposure response analysis of the electrocardiographic QTc and
      J-Tpeakc intervals in Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies can be used to confirm that drugs
      that predominantly block the potassium channel encoded by the human ether-à-go-go-related
      gene (hERG) with approximately equipotent late sodium and/or calcium block (&quot;balanced ion
      channel&quot; drugs) do not cause J-Tpeakc prolongation and that drugs that predominantly block
      hERG without late sodium or L-type calcium current block (&quot;predominant hERG&quot; drugs) cause QTc
      prolongation.

      This study will assess whether exposure response analysis of the electrocardiographic QTc and
      J-Tpeakc intervals in Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies can be used to confirm that
      &quot;balanced ion channel&quot; drugs do not cause J-Tpeakc prolongation and that &quot;predominant hERG&quot;
      drugs cause QTc prolongation. This clinical study consists of 2 parts: a 50-subject parallel
      part (Part 1) and a 10-subject crossover part (Part 2). Up to 74 healthy subjects will be
      enrolled (including 14 potential replacement subjects).

      Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 1 period parallel design to
      assess the effect of 4 marketed drugs and 1 placebo on the QTc and J-Tpeakc intervals in 50
      healthy subjects. A parallel design similar to a single or multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD)
      Phase 1 study will be used that will result in each study drug being administered to 10
      subjects, and placebo to 10 subjects, in 1 period of 3 consecutive days to achieve low and
      high drug exposure.

      Part 2 will be a double-blind, randomized, 2-period crossover design to assess the effect of
      hERG block (dofetilide) versus calcium block (diltiazem) on the QTc and J-Tpeakc intervals in
      10 healthy subjects on Days 1, 2, and 3 (Period 1) and Days 8, 9, and 10 (Period 2).

    <intervention_model_description>This clinical study consists of 2 parts:
50 subjects in Part 1 will be randomized to receive one of four drugs (ranolazine, verapamil, lopinavir / ritonavir, chloroquine) or placebo over 3 days.
10 subjects in Part 2 will be randomized to receive one of two treatment sequences (1. dofetilide or 2. diltiazem combined with dofetilide) over 3 days, then after washout, the subjects will receive the other treatment sequence over 3 days. Thus, Part 2 will have a cross-over component.
A maximum of 14 additional replacement subjects may be enrolled.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure for the &quot;balanced ion channel&quot; drugs (ranolazine, verapamil, lopinavir / ritonavir) is for the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) to be &lt;10 msec for the projected J-Tpeakc effect at the peak plasma level on Day 3 using a linear mixed-effects exposure response model</description>

    <description>The primary outcome measure for the &quot;predominant hERG&quot; drug (chloroquine) is for the upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CI to be ≥10 msec for the projected QTc effect at the peak plasma level on Day 1 using a linear mixed-effects exposure response model</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>QTc and J-Tpeakc shortening from calcium block (diltiazem) in the presence of hERG block (dofetilide)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed whether the projected QTc effect of dofetilide alone is significantly greater (i.e., p&lt;0.05) than the projected QTc effect of the combination of dofetilide + diltiazem. This will be assessed at the dofetilide peak plasma level on Day 3 (computed from the combination of dofetilide + diltiazem) on the pooled dofetilide alone, diltiazem alone, and dofetilide + diltiazem data using a linear mixed effects model.
Subsequently, and if the test is significant for QTc, the same test will be performed to assess calcium block (diltiazem) effects on J-Tpeakc.</description>
