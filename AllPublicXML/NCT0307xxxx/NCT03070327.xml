  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I clinical trial is to test the safety of these CAR T cells in
      patients with myeloma.

      There are two parts of this study. Part 1 of the study consists of screening for BCMA,
      Lenalidomide assignment and cell collection. Part 2 of the study is treatment with modified
      CAR T cells.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open-label, dose escalating, nonrandomized, single-center, phase I study of EGFRt/BCMA-41BBz CAR T cells in patients with a diagnosis of MM. Dose escalation will follow a standard 3-by-3 escalation design. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will be infused with escalating doses of EGFRt/BCMA-41BBz CAR T cells to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). After a dose level has been determined safe to escalate (DLT in 0/3 or 1/6 patients), a parallel cohort at that dose level will be conducted while patients are taking Lenalidomide.</intervention_model_description>
