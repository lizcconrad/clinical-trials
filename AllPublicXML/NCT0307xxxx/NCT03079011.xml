  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, multicentric, phase III trial conducted in patients
      receiving aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib as first line therapy for estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and which aims to evaluate, at the onset
      of ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA, the efficacy of a change of the hormone therapy
      (aromatase inhibitor changed to fulvestrant) combined to palbociclib, together with the
      safety of hormone therapy and palbociclib combination in the overall population.

    <intervention_model_description>Step 1: 800 patients screened for circulating blood ESR1 mutation detection at regular intervals will be treated with palbociclib 125 mg once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off (28-day cycle) + AI (letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane) administered once daily in a continuous scheme (EoT if RECIST tumor progression or ESR1 mutation detection)
Step 2: 160 Patients with a rising circulating ESR1 mutation and without tumor progression will be randomized (1:1):
ARM A: no change in therapy. EoT if tumor progression or possibility of a cross-over (step 3)
ARM B: palbociclib 125 mg + fulvestrant 500 mg administered intramuscularly on D1,15 and 29 and once monthly thereafter. EoT if RECIST tumor progression
Step 3 (cross over): 80 patients who have been randomized in arm A will be offered to be treated by fulvestrant + palbociclib, after having progressed under AI + palbociclib. The EoT will occur at the tumor progression under fulvestrant + palbociclib</intervention_model_description>
