  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the further need to improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) post autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) for DLBCL, the hematopoietic profile of
      patients following auto-SCT, the activity of blinatumomab in DLBCL and its favorable toxicity
      profile, the investigators propose a pilot study to test blinatumomab as consolidation
      therapy post auto-SCT for patients with DLBCL.

      The investigators hypothesize the blinatumomab consolidation will optimize the effector to
      target (E-T) ratio and aid in the eradication of remaining tumor cells, leading to decreased
      relapse and increased overall survival. In addition, since tumor burden will be at a minimum,
      infusional toxicities including neurologic toxicities may also be limited. The purpose of
      this pilot study is to study the feasibility and tolerability of blinatumomab consolidation
      post auto-SCT for patients with chemo-sensitive DLBCL undergoing auto-SCT.

    <description>Standard of care ASCT with BEAM conditioning (carmustine/etoposide/cytarabine/melphalan) - guidelines below:
carmustine is typically given intravenously (IV) at a dose of 300 mg/m^2 on Day -7
etoposide is typically given IV at a dose of 100 mg/m^2 twice per day (BID) on Days -6, -5, -4, and -3 (8 doses)
cytarabine is typically given IV at a dose of 100 mg/m^2 BID on Days -6, -5, -4, and -3 (8 doses)
melphalan is typically given IV at a dose of 140 mg/m*2 on Day -2
Auto-SCT will take place on Day 0 as per institutional guidelines
Consolidation with blinatumomab will start 6 weeks following auto-SCT. Patients with CR based on pre-transplant PET/CT will receive blinatumomab as a continuous IV infusion (CIVI) at 9μg/day for 1 week, then 28μg/day for 3 weeks (total of 4 weeks). Patients with PR based on pre-transplant PET/CT will receive blinatumomab CIVI 9μg/day for 1 week, then 28μg/day for 1week, then 112μg/day for 6 weeks (total of 8 weeks)</description>
