  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how the cardiovascular system interacts with mechanical hearts to
      provide blood flow to the body during exercise. Two aims are proposed: 1) to determine the
      impact of a mechanical heart on exercise pressor reflexes in heart failure patients; and 2)
      to define the primary determinant(s) of exercise capacity in heart failure patients before
      and after device implantation.

             will typically undergo a Park stitch at time of CF-LVAD insertion to permanently close
             the aortic valve and prevent worsening aortic insufficiency; and

        attack) and are not taking any cardiac-related medications (e.g. antihypertensive
        medications)
