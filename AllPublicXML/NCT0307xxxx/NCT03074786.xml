  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized (1:1) to one of two sequences of a vaginal ring (VR)
      containing 25mg of dapivirine to be inserted monthly for 24 weeks and 200 mg FTC/300 mg TDF
      oral tablets taken daily for 24 weeks. After completing the randomized sequence of two study
      product use periods, participants will then select between the two study products to use in
      the final 24 weeks of the trial. Participants will be able to choose either or neither study
      product every 4 weeks during the third product use period.

      The MTN-034/IPM 045 trial is a multi-site, randomized, two-sequence, three-period,
      open-label, crossover Phase 2a trial. Young adult (18-21 years old) and adolescent (16-17
      years old) female participants will be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio. All the enrolled participants
      will use both treatment regimens in sequence. All participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of two treatment regimen sequences to use for the first two study product use periods,
      and will be able to choose between treatment regimens during the third study product use
      period. The total length of follow-up is approximately one and a half years which includes up
      to 72 weeks of product use (two 24-week periods on randomized treatment regimen and one
      24-week period on freely chosen treatment regimen) plus an additional week beyond the Period
      3 end visit to collect data on any new or worsening AEs.
