    <textblock>
      Several studies have been showed that rifaximin can improve cognitive functions, driving
      simulator performance and health-related quality of life in patients with minimal hepatic
      encephalopathy. The aim of this prospective randomized open controlled study was to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of rifaximin at different doses for the treatment of covert hepatic
      encephalopathy.
