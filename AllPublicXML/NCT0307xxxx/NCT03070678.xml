      Primary Objective:

      To assess the effect of multiple dose mefenamic acid on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      sotagliflozin and its metabolite in healthy male and female subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess total 24 hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after 400 mg sotagliflozin alone
           and in combination with mefenamic acid in healthy male and female subjects.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin alone and in combination with
           mefenamic acid in healthy male and female subjects.

      The expected duration of the study is approximately 59 days per subject, including 2-28 days
      of screening, treatment period 1 of 7 days, treatment period 2 of 8 days, at least 7 days of
      wash-out period, and an end of study visit, which is between 14-21 days after the last dose
      of sotagliflozin.
