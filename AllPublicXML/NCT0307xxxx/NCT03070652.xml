      Key research question This project addresses the following key research question: What are
      the short and long term effects on child and family outcomes of a universal intervention
      delivered by a Health Visitor addressing the newborn´s behavior in a shared observation with
      the parents (NBO)? The aim is to enhance the parent's sensitivity to their infants' unique
      capacities and thereby create an early parental understanding for the individual infant's
      strengths as well as its needs.

      Hypothesis concerning main outcomes

      Universal Health Visiting with facilitation of the early relationship building introduced by
      the NBO to an intervention group of new families will- when compared to a control group of
      new families who receive health visitor support as usual:

        -  Improve sensitive responsive parenting to the infant's behavior, needs for feeding and
           comfort, and rise understanding of parental influence on the infants' self-regulatory
           capacities

        -  Increase parental confidence and reduce experiences of stress and symptoms of depression
           among new mothers and fathers

        -  Improve the infant's self-regulatory capacities regarding sleep, crying, feeding and
           engaging in social interactions, being more cooperative

        -  Enhance the sensitive early parent/infant relationship

        -  Improve exclusive breastfeeding duration and delay introduction to solid food

      Method The project is formed as a community based randomized trial. The complexity in
      community based intervention research is the existence of two target groups, in this case: 1)
      the primary study population of new parents that receive the supportive intervention and 2)
      the secondary study population of Health Visitors that deliver the supportive intervention.
      The complication of catching the effects in a universal approach will be addressed through a
      variety of outcomes that capture both the aspect and the development of the infant, the
      mother and the father and the interactions.

      Recruitment and randomization Four medium-sized municipalities will join in the trial. To
      avoid side-effects the districts of the Health Visitors in the participating municipalities
      will be regarded as clusters. Because of differences in size and social status of the
      inhabitants in the districts alias the clusters, the clusters will be stratified before they
      are randomized to intervention or comparison group. The randomization procedure will be
      computer based and conducted by an independent person not involved in the study.

      Study population The primary study population is formed by new families, mothers and fathers
      and their infant/s. Substantiated in that we are operating with a community based universal
      intervention with no side effects and we seek to measure the effect in a natural population
      we will have no exclusion criteria except parents or infants affiliated to special treatment
      elsewhere.

      In the study population of new parents there will be subgroups: First time parents will
      represent around 40 %, around 6 % will have given premature birth, 2% twin birth, 10-14% of
      the mothers and 7-8% of the fathers will suffer from birth depression in the postnatal
      period, and 7-20% will have a cultural background other than Danish depending on geographical
      area.

      A random sample of 100 mothers who have received the intervention will be drawn for video
      recording in the middle of the project period after specified characteristic criteria with
      regard to first-time-, depressed- and given premature birth. Afterwards a matched group of
      100 mothers will be selected in the comparison group.

      Data and data-collection Data will be collected from two sources: (1) self-reported data from
      the new parents collected via questionnaire; (2) observational data from video recordings,
      Infant CARE-Index. Questionnaire data will be delivered and collected though an internet
      based system. Participating mothers and fathers will receive separate questionnaires at 1-2
      weeks postpartum (baseline data), 3 months postpartum, 9 months follow-up, 18 months
      follow-up. Videos are recorded at 3 months post-partum (corrected age for premature infants)
      with 3 minutes of unstructured time together; (Infant CARE Index). All data will be linked
      via the Danish Personal Register (CPR) identifier. To minimize bias introduced by data
      collection, data will be collected in the same way and with the same timing in the
      intervention and comparison groups.

      Data Analysis Intention to treat analysis will be used to detect the effect of the community
      based intervention where motivation and participation may vary in both the primary and
      secondary study population. Supplemental analysis will be performed to identify an
      intervention effect for subgroups and marginal groups of parents according to parity, preterm
      delivery, and depression symptoms.
