  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, phase 2 extension study of participants previously enrolled in
      NTMT-01 and of participants enrolled in NTMT-02. This study is designed to evaluate long term
      safety and efficacy of the NT-501 implant in participants previously enrolled in the NTMT-01
      and NTMT-02 protocols.
