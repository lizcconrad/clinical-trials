      EPO staining on esophageal sponge samples had a strong association with peak esophageal
      eosinophil counts on endoscopic biopsy specimens in a small study of 26 patients Using a
      cut-off of 1.1 absorbance units in a colorimetric assay at a wavelength of 492nm the EPO
      stain had sensitivity and specificity of 1105 and 83% respectively for a peak eosinophil
      count of 15 eos/hpf on histologic endoscopic obtained biopsy specimens. The technique of EPO
      staining is standardized and can be completed in 45 minutes time. Currently, we have found
      esophageal sponge cytology sensitive and specific for assessment of esophageal eosinophilia.
      It allows disease activity assessment without endoscopy is much preferred by patients over
      the standard endoscopic technique of disease assessment. The process of specimen preparation
      in fairly tedious and interpretation takes significant experience. If EPO staining on
      non-endoscopic esophageal sponge studies was accurate at assessing disease activity, this is
      a tool that could be easily performed and interpreted with a rapid turnaround time.

Patients diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) &gt; than 15 Eosinophils per high power field (phf) and failed to respond to Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) therapy. Will be asked to swallow a sponge, this is a 10 minute procedure done in the office prior to their clinical upper endoscopy. This will be sent for histology, &gt;15 Eos phf would be considered active disease. We will compare the results of the sponge using the EPO staining technique compared to histologic response.</description>
