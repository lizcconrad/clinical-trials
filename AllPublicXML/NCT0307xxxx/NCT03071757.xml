  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase 1, open-label study is to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-368 as a monotherapy and in combination
      with nivolumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study
      will consist of 2 parts: ABBV-368 dose escalation and ABBV-368 tumor-specific dose expansion
      (non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] cohort and head and neck cancer cohort) .

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assessed the relationship of each event to the use of study drug as either reasonable possibility or no reasonable possibility. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug. For more details on adverse events please see the Adverse Event section.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologic or cytology diagnosis of a known immunogenic solid
             tumor, as described for Part 1 Dose Escalation and Part 2 Cohort Expansion:

          -  Parts 1A and 1B Dose Escalation:

             therapies. Tumor progression or recurrence must have occurred within 6 months of last
             dose of platinum therapy. Participants must be treatment- naÃ¯ve to a PD-1/PD-L1

          -  Prior treatment with an OX40 targeting agent.

          -  has known uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system (CNS).

          -  History of or active autoimmune disorders and other conditions that compromise or
             impair the immune system.
