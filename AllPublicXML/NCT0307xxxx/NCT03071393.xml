  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if acute intermittent hypoxia (brief episodes of breathing lower
      oxygen), which has been shown to enhance plasticity and motor output, can enhance functional
      outcomes and muscle activation in individuals with spinal cord injury. Our aim is to assess
      breathing, sitting, standing and walking functional ability before and after acute
      intermittent hypoxia, compared to a sham treatment. This information may be useful in
      advancing rehabilitation for people with spinal cord injuries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has shown that acute intermittent hypoxia can strengthen motor pathways after
      spinal cord injury, and enhance walking outcomes after walking rehabilitation compared to
      walking rehabilitation alone. A single session of acute intermittent hypoxia has also been
      shown to temporarily enhance breathing and limb strength in people with spinal cord injury.
      Further evidence supports the hypothesis that acute intermittent hypoxia acts on all motor
      pathways, and thus can enhance the strength of most muscles in the body.

      Spinal cord injury affects the trunk muscles that control respiration and posture. Decreased
      respiratory muscle function can lead to diseases of the respiratory system, which are the
      primary cause of death and significant cause of re-hospitalization after spinal cord injury.
      Deficits in postural muscle function affect one's ability to balance, safely maintain a
      seated position, or ambulate after spinal cord injury, severely impacting daily activities
      such as self-care and feeding skills.

      This study will test the hypothesis that a single session of acute intermittent hypoxia will
      increase strength and activation of the trunk muscles that control respiration and posture,
      leading to improved scores on functional assessments in individuals with chronic spinal cord
      injury. Our long term goal is to better understand the therapeutic potential of acute
      intermittent hypoxia combined with physical rehabilitation for individuals with chronic
      spinal cord injury.

    <masking_description>Subjects will be asked to participate in two visits at least 7 days apart. Subjects will be assessed on various clinical outcomes before and after an exposure to one of two treatments. In one visit, subjects will be assessed before and after acute intermittent hypoxia, consisting of brief exposures of breathing low oxygen air, alternated with brief exposures to room air. In the other visit, subjects will be assessed before and after an exposure to a sham treatment, consisting of breathing brief exposures of normal oxygen air, alternated with brief exposures to room air. Subjects will undergo acute intermittent hypoxia or a sham treatment in a randomized order.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Change between baseline- and 30 minutes post-intermittent hypoxia or sham.</time_frame>
    <description>The degree to which subjects can independently perform certain tasks that require trunk muscles will be assessed with the Neuromuscular Recovery Scale. Four components of this standard, reliable and responsive clinical test of functional ability for people with SCI will be used. Standardized instructions will be provided to the subjects for each component. These components include:
Sit - testing the subject's ability to sit tall with proper posture when the feet are flat on the floor.
Reverse Sit-up - subjects will be asked to lower themselves from sitting up to lying supine on a mat as slowly and controlled as possible.
Sit-up - the subject's ability to sit up from lying supine on a table while the feet are on the ground will be assessed.
Trunk extension in sitting - while seated on a table with feet on the floor, subjects will be asked to lean forward with their arms hanging down, and then return to a seated position without using their hands.</description>
