    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well metformin hydrochloride and doxycycline work
      in treating patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that can be removed by
      surgery. Metformin hydrochloride may reduce the metabolic activity of cancer cells and of
      surrounding supportive tissue. Doxycycline may minimize toxic side effects of anti-cancer
      therapy. Giving metformin hydrochloride and doxycycline may work better in treating patients
      with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if treatment with metformin hydrochloride (metformin), doxycycline, or a
      combination of metformin and doxycycline can increase the percentage of stromal cells that
      express CAV1 in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of metformin, doxycycline, or metformin and doxycycline treatment
      on the percentage of tumor cells that are apoptotic as determined by the TdT-Mediated dUTP
      Nick End Labeling Assay (TUNEL) assay, and express MCT4, MCT1, BGAL, and TOMM20 in squamous
      carcinoma of head and neck region tumor cells.

      II. To assess safety and tolerability of metformin, doxycycline, or metformin and doxycycline
      treatment in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of metformin, doxycycline, or metformin and doxycycline therapy on
      the metabolic profile of cancer cells and stroma using mass spectroscopy imaging (MSI) on
      paired samples, comparing metabolite profiles in the pre-treatment and post-treatment tumor
      samples.

      II. To assess the effect of metformin, doxycycline, or metformin and doxycycline therapy on
      the metabolic state of the patient as characterized serologically by: erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate, exosome evaluation, metabolomics profile, and micro ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) expression profiles and physiologically by performing a nutritional assessment via a
      nutritionist-mediated 3-day dietary recall and comparing a patient's estimated dietary intake
      against their estimated caloric needs.
