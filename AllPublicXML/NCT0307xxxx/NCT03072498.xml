  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information and bone marrow, blood, saliva, cheek
      cells and skin to be used in the laboratory to assist the sponsor in identifying a new way of
      treating MDS.

      Goals of the study:

      The purpose of this study is to collect the blood and marrow samples, and non-involved
      fibroblasts, that are required to identify the unique, personalized array of mutation-driven
      neoantigens that are expressed by the subject's MDS cells and to assess the feasibility of
      immunizing and expanding one or more of the patient's T cells ex vivo for investigation of
      their use as adoptive cellular immunotherapy.
