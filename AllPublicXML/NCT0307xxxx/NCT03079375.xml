      Background

      It is well known that the transfer of a patient from hospital to the general practitioner is
      related with mistakes in the medication of the patient. A report from 2006 measure the number
      of drug related admissions in Denmark to be 69.000 to 162.000 per year. To reduce these
      mistakes, more and better communication between the health professionals are suggested.
      Furthermore medication reviews made by pharmacist seems to reduce the number of drug related
      readmissions and other drug related issues, which can lead to an economic cost reduction.

      Objective

      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of medication review and better
      communication between the health professionals after discharge of a patient from hospital to
      the general practitioner. The effect is measured as reducing the number of readmissions and
      number of visits at the emergency department 30 days and 6 month after inclusion of the
      patient.

      Method

      This study was estimated to include 1500 participants. The patients were randomized to one of
      three groups; usual care, basic intervention or extended intervention. The usual care
      received the normal care following the Danish standard procedure. The basic intervention had
      a medication review by a clinical pharmacist during admission.

      The extended interventions group was similar to the basic intervention group plus follow-up
      with the patient, the general practitioner and if relevant the nursing home and pharmacy 1
      week and 6 month after discharge by interview with the clinical pharmacist.

      The aim of this study is to determine if a multifaceted pharmacist intervention based on
      medication review, medication interview and follow up with patient, general practitioner and
      pharmacy can reduce the number of readmissions and death and or if the time to next admission
      can be postponed. The combination of the full pharmacist intervention is compared with
      medication review alone in comparison to non-intervention.

      Pharmacist intervention:

      Usual care group: the patients received no intervention by the clinical pharmacist.

      Basic intervention group: A structured, patient centered medication review (MR) was conducted
      by the clinical pharmacist. The following was considered during MR: Were there untreated
      diagnoses, has the goal of treatment been reached, was the treatment compliant with current
      national guidelines regarding dose, choice of drug and time of treatment. Focus was at
      certain drugs most commonly implicated in causing admission. Furthermore, all drugs on the
      medication list were assessed according to the following: Indication for treatment, drug
      dose, considering i.e. kidney insufficiency, age, etc., adverse drug events, therapeutic
      duplication, dosage time and interval, drug formulation and strength, interactions,
      contraindications, precautions and specific patient characteristics.

      Advice on drug selection, dosages, monitoring needs and possibly side effects were given to
      the physician in charge of the patient, and written in the electronic patient journal (EPJ).

      Extended intervention group: MR was conducted according to the same terms and conditions as
      for the basic intervention group. Upon discharge medication reconciliation was conducted. The
      pharmacist provided a motivational interview, MI-based patient interview including a
      comprehensive summary of changes in the drug therapy during the hospitalization.

      Post discharge any drug related problem not dealt with during hospitalization was mailed or
      faxed to the GP. When needed, the GP, care giver and primary care pharmacy were contacted by
      phone (approximately 5 working days after discharge).

      Follow-up interview by phone was performed twice. The first was conducted one week post
      discharge and the second 6 months after discharge. When needed additional follow-ups could be
      made. The follow-up interviews had an MI-approach.

      All interventions were conducted according to a defined standard operating procedure and all
      interventions were performed by qualified clinical pharmacists from the involved sites. In
      order to minimize the risk of cultural differences and variations in routine's the regions in
      between, all data pharmacists were trained prior to entering the study.

      Data was analysed after the intention-to-treat method. Data was analyzed after a proportional
      hazard cox regression with the randomization group as the only variable.

    <masking_description>the study is dobbelblinded. The pharmacist do not know, whether the patient is randomized to the basic og to the extended intervention before they conduct the medication review.
