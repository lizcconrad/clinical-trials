    <textblock>
      A prospective multicentre study which aims to examine the relationship between intratumour
      heterogeneity (ITH) and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
      histological confirmation of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who are eligible for
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

    <description>the time from neoadjuvant treatment initiation until the date of the first occurrence of one of the following events: invasive ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (same breast), local /regional invasive recurrence, invasive contra lateral breast cancer, appearance of metastasis, second primary invasive cancer (non-breast cancer), ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ, contralateral ductal carcinoma in situ, death attributable to any cause.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo a biopsy and provide a blood sample prior to initiating standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Additional tissue samples will be collected at the following time points:
(optional) biopsy of primary tumour after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
At the time of surgery (samples of the primary tumour and lymph nodes which are surplus to diagnostic requirements).
Biopsy of a metastatic site in the event of disease recurrence.
Blood samples will be obtained during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, prior to surgery and at 6-month intervals for up to 5 years post-surgery. In the event of recurrent disease, blood samples will be collected i) at the time of recurrence, ii) at the first CT scan on treatment and iii) at each subsequent relapse for up to 5 years post-surgery.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-years or older

          2. Patients with histological confirmation of invasive breast cancer with known receptor
             status suitable for neoadjuvant chemotherapy as assessed by the local investigator

          3. Estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative as defined by ≤1% of positive
             staining on immunohistochemistry

          4. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- negative as defined by American
             Society of Clinical Oncology / College of American Pathologists guidelines

          5. T1c-4 tumours (including inflammatory cancers), with any nodal status non candidate
             for conservative surgery upfront. Bilateral or multifocal cancer is permitted provided
             that all sites are HER2-negative and at least one site is ER- and PR-negative.

          6. Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures, sampling and analyses

          7. Patient with social insurance coverage

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed metastatic disease at initial presentation

          2. Any contraindication to the biopsy procedure

          3. Previous or current malignancies of other origin within the last 5 years, with the
             exception of in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

          4. Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the subject
             to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol

          5. Individuals deprived of liberty or placed under the authority of a tutor
