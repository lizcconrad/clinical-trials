  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third of American children are overweight or obese, leading to an increased risk for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), early mortality, and other risks throughout their lifespan
      relative to normal weight children. In our pilot work, we found that 67-83% of parents
      underestimate a child's long-term risk of developing cardiovascular disease in adulthood and
      that parents thought their own child's risks were 13-15% lower than those of a typical child
      in their community, even controlling for family health and demographic characteristics.
      Parents were 40 times less likely to predict that their child, rather than a typical child in
      their community, would be overweight or obese in adulthood. These findings suggest that
      parents suffer from optimism bias, the tendency to overestimate one's chances of experiencing
      unlikely positive events. Belief that a child is at increased risk for adverse health
      outcomes in adulthood could be an important motivator for a family to initiate behavior
      changes and vice versa.

      The overall goal of this research is to develop provider-based risk communication approaches
      to motivate parents of obese children to engage in behavior change to protect their children
      from CVD and other obesity-related co-morbidities later in life. Specifically, the
      investigators will:

        1. Develop risk communication methods that providers can use to better convey accurate
           information about a child's health behaviors, obesity status, and future health risks to
           parents.

        2. Using an online experiment, we will evaluate the impact of new risk communication
           methods on parental engagement in behavior change.

        3. Pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of new risk communication
           approaches in pediatric primary care clinics.

      This work will give pediatricians novel tools to effectively discuss the long-term
      consequences of childhood obesity with parents. The findings from this work will inform an
      interventional trial that will assess the impact of improved risk communication techniques on
      child behavior change and health outcomes.

    <description>The investigators will develop novel risk communication messages to communicate the risks of childhood obesity to parents of children with obesity. The investigators will consider several novel approaches around message content and framing, but primarily, we propose using microsimulation models to forecast a child's long-term health risks, based on his age, race, gender, BMI, and family history of CVD.</description>
