  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to employ genomic detection methodologies to measure the relative
      amount of tumor-derived nucleic acids in the blood of patients diagnosed with an early stage
      solid tumor who are either commencing, currently undergoing or have completed treatment. This
      approach will allow the investigators to develop a quantitative measure of therapy efficacy
      via the counting of the relative changes in tumor molecules over the course of treatment.

      The aim of this study is to employ genomic detection methodologies to measure the relative
      amount of tumor-derived nucleic acids in the blood of patients diagnosed with an early stage
      solid tumor who are either commencing, currently undergoing or have completed treatment. This
      approach will allow the investigators to develop a quantitative measure of therapy efficacy
      via the counting of the relative changes in tumor molecules over the course of treatment.

      The presence of circulating tumor-derived cfDNA in the plasma of patients can potentially
      enable a non-invasive means of detecting the presence or absence of tumor, assessing tumor
      burden and characterizing tumor biology in patients with cancer. The ability to measure the
      distribution of circulating tumor DNA may allow determination of a quantitative tumor load
      score in plasma that correlates to clinical tumor load. Clinical tumor load is a measure of
      disease burden, and the investigators propose to test in this study whether the tumor load
      score can measure this disease burden. A simple, reliable measure of disease burden would
      have diverse utility during patient therapy.

        Up to 200 patients from multiple clinical sites will be enrolled in this study. Patients
        are eligible for this study if they are diagnosed with a solid tumor and undergoing
        curative resection. In addition, up to 200 participants with no prior or current diagnosis
        of cancer will be enrolled as a control group, i.e. &quot;healthy control,&quot; for assay
        development.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. For all participants:

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Able to understand and grant informed consent

          -  Able to have their blood drawn at enrollment before surgery and 7 to 28 days after
             surgery

        For participants with early stage solid tumors:

          -  Diagnosed with an early stage (I-III) solid tumor with curative intent surgery without
             neoadjuvant therapy planned

        For &quot;healthy control&quot; subgroup:

          -  No prior or current diagnosis of any cancer. Participants with prior in situ cancer or
             non-melanoma skin cancer will be allowed to participate but will not be included in
             the &quot;healthy control&quot; cohort and will be analyzed separately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to grant informed consent or comply with all study procedures

          -  Diagnosed with a hematological malignancy (acute or chronic leukemia, myelodysplastic
             syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myeloma or lymphoma).
