  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD) is a prominent minimally invasive operation technique
      for treating early gastrointestinal tumor. But promoting ESD is uneasy because of its
      complications such as postoperative bleeding, perforation and so on. So if we decrease the
      rate of postoperative bleeding, ESD might be better popularized. Some study indicated that
      hypertension was the independent risk factor of postoperative bleeding. Endoscopic center of
      Fudan University Zhongshan Hospital is a rich experienced medical unit in doing ESD operation
      in China. Referring to our experience, if we can use some special methods to find the
      potential bleeding spot which is not obvious during ESD operation and we coagulate it
      precisely, then we may control the risk of postoperative bleeding.

      Based on the above hypothesis, our team designed this study to examine whether increasing
      blood pressure during gastric ESD could help to control the risk of postoperative bleeding.
