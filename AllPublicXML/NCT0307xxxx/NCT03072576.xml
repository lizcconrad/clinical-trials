  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consenting adults presenting with signs and symptoms compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis
      will be interviewed for demographic and medical information, and then will be asked to
      provide 3-4 expectorated sputum specimens. In the study laboratory, sputa will be tested
      using conventional and investigational diagnostic tests for tuberculosis and rifampin
      resistance.
