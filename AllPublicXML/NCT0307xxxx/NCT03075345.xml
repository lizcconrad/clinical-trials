  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an 'epidemic' within the UK. Individuals living with obseity are at risk of
      developing cancer, heart problems and dieing. Furthermore, obesity impacts on psychological
      wellbeing via lowered self-efficacy, self-esteem, body image and overall quality of life
      (QoL). A pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) is proposed to investigate the additional
      benefit of a psychological intervention alongside treatment as usual (TAU) in a weight
      management service. Patients routinely attending an outpatient clinic will be randomised into
      TAU with or without additional acceptance and commitment Therapy (ACT) group based-input and
      their outcomes monitored over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity is reported as an 'epidemic' problem within the UK as well as the
      world. Individuals living with this may be at higher risk of developing co-morbidities, such
      as cancers, heart problems or diabetes, and higher mortality rates are reported in this
      group. Furthermore, overweight and obesity can also impact on a person's psychological
      wellbeing, such as their self-efficacy, self-esteem and body image as well as have a negative
      effect on their overall quality of life (QoL). Therefore, a pilot randomised controlled trial
      (RCT) is proposed to investigate the additional benefit of a psychological intervention
      alongside treatment as usual (TAU) in a weight management service. Patients routinely
      attending an outpatient clinic will be randomised into TAU with or without additional
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) group based-input.
