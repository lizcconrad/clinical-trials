  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3036656 is being developed by GSK for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). This is the FTIH
      study for GSK3036656 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of single ascending and
      repeat oral doses of GSK3036656 in healthy adult subjects. The results of this study are
      intended to be used to identify appropriate and well-tolerated doses of GSK3036656 to be used
      in further studies. A food effect assessment will also be undertaken to investigate the
      influence of food on the PK of GSK3036656. The study will be conducted in two parts: Part A
      (single dose) and Part B (repeat dose). Up to two cohorts will be included in Part A. 9
      healthy adult subjects will be included in each cohort. Each cohort will participate in up to
      4 treatment (dosing) periods including a food effect treatment period. During each treatment
      period, GSK3036656 will be administered to 6 subjects and placebo will be administered to 3
      subjects. The starting dose in Part A will be 5 milligrams (mg), and the maximum dose will be
      1500 mg. The two cohorts in Part A will be dosed sequentially (i.e., dosing in Cohort 2
      starts after dosing in Cohort 1 is completed). Initially, there will be a 14 day wash out
      period for individual subjects between each dose level. Study progression to Part B from Part
      A will be based on an acceptable safety, tolerability and PK profile in Part A. Part B will
      comprise up to 4 cohorts (Cohorts 3, 4, 5, and 6) each containing 10 (8 active: 2 placebo)
      healthy adult subjects to examine the safety, tolerability and PK of a repeated daily dose of
      GSK3036656 over a period of up to 14 days. Appropriate doses and dose regimens for Part B
      will be selected based on available safety, tolerability and PK data from Part A and/or any
      preceding repeat dose cohorts from Part B. Dividing the total daily dose into 2 or 3 smaller
      doses may be done in both Part A and Part B. Up to 18 subjects will be enrolled into Part A
      and up to 40 subjects will be enrolled into Part B. The total duration of the study for each
      subject recruited into Part A and Part B will be approximately 12 weeks and 8 weeks,
      respectively.

    <description>During Part A (Cohort 1), Subjects will receive a single dose of GSK3036656 in the morning on Day 1 in each of the 4 treatment (dosing) periods after an overnight fast of at least 8 hours. Dosing with food may also be done in Part A once results from the food effect analysis are available. The total daily dose for the treatment (dosing) period may also be divided into 2 or 3 smaller doses administered within 24 hours on discretion of the GSK study team and the principal investigator. The starting dose in Part A will be 5 mg and will then be escalated up to a dose no higher than 1500 mg. One of the 4 dosing periods will be food effect group which will be determined based on from previous cohorts. For the food effect assessment, the selected dose will be given with a high fat meal. There will be a 2 week washout between doses initially but the washout period may be modified depending on emerging data from previous cohorts. Subjects will be followed up to 2 weeks from the last dose.</description>

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.
