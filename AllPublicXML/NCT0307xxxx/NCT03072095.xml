      Network (FPCN), a community clinic in Southwest Philadelphia, aimed at providing data on the

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center RCT at the Family Practice &amp; Counseling Network (FPCN), a community
      clinic in Southwest Philadelphia with 320 eligible subjects between the ages of 50-74
      randomized to two study arms:

        1. text messaging outreach (text)

        2. text messaging outreach with lottery for 1/5 chance to win a financial incentive (text +
           lottery).

      Findings will provide data on the feasibility of this mailed FIT approach in a community
      health setting, and how patients respond to text messaging and behavioral economic engagement
      incentives.
