  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover study of Vigil, Atezolizumab and their combination in patients who have
      tumor harvested at surgery and successful manufacturing of Vigil but are ineligible for
      CL-PTL-119 (the VITAL study) or previously randomized to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover study of Vigil, the checkpoint
      inhibitor Atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents, in patients with epithelial
      ovarian cancer, or other gynecological cancers (i.e., cervical, uterine). Eligible patients
      will be randomized to receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles of atezolizumab alone,
      followed by combination treatment with the two agents.

      This study is intended as a companion study to protocol CL-PTL-119, A Randomized, Double
      Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase 3 trial of Vigil Engineered Autologous Tumor Cell
      Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response
      following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy, otherwise known as the VITAL study. Patients who
      have tumor harvested at surgery and Vigil successfully manufactured, but then are ineligible
      for randomization onto the VITAL study or previously randomized to placebo, will be offered
      the opportunity to participate in this protocol.

      Subjects enrolled will either be:

      • Patients with recurrent disease, undergoing a standard surgical procedure (e.g. surgical
      debulking, palliative resection, malignant ascites or others) will have tumor procured for
      manufacture of Vigil.

      OR

        -  Patients with ovarian cancer who failed to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol
           CL-PTL-119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical response following primary
           debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy, OR

        -  Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria for Protocol CL-PTL-119 because of a
           histologic diagnosis of another gynecological cancer (i.e., cervical, uterine) and not
           ovarian cancer.

      OR

      • Patients who were randomized on Protocol CL-PTL 119 and were subsequently unblinded at
      recurrence and were assigned to the placebo arm.
