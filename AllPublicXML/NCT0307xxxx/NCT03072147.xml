  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate teriparatide (TP) as a chondroregenerative therapy
      for human knee osteoarthritis (OA). The central hypothesis to be tested is that TP supports
      structural modification of the joint and improves biomarker, functional and patient-reported
      measures of knee OA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded, crossover study. The
      investigators will identify, recruit and enroll 80 subjects with symptomatic, unilateral
      medial compartment knee OA. Enrolled subjects will be randomized into equal TP (in the FDA
      approved form, Forteo) or placebo arms of 40 subjects each (includes allowance for a 25%
      dropout rate with no replacements). All subjects will be treated for 24 weeks, then followed
      for an additional 24 weeks to assess the durability of any observed effects. The trial
      incorporates a crossover design, based on interim analysis of the 24 week outcome data after
      every subject has completed the 24 week treatment period. If positive effects on structural
      and/or biomarker measures are apparent from the interim analysis, placebo treated subjects
      will be offered TP (in the FDA approved form, Forteo) and followed for an additional 24
      weeks. If the placebo subjects who choose to participate in the crossover treatment have not
      yet completed the 48 week visit, it will not occur. These subjects will begin the crossover
      portion 24 week treatment and monitoring period when they receive the TP pens (in the FDA
      approved form, Forteo).
