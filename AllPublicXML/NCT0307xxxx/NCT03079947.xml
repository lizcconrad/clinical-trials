  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of circulating DNA from peripheral
      blood for predicting the prognosis and relapse in DLBCL and PTCL patients.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators plan to prospectively involve 300 Non-hodgkin Lymphoma patients, including
      both diffuse large B cell lymphomas and peripheral T cell lymphomas without previous
      treatment from Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

      The following parameters were collected: age, sex, subtype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), Ann Arbor stage (I-IV), presence of B symptoms, number
      and type of involved sites, prognostic index including International Prognostic Index (IPI)
      for DLBCLand PIT for PTCL based on medical record review.

      All patients would have regular treatment and follow up in PUMCH. During the follow up,
      treatment response was evaluated by contrast enhanced computed tomography or PET-CT.

      The peripheral blood would be collected and circulating DNA would be tested at the time of
      diagnosis, interim of treatment, end of treatment, 1 year follow-up, 1.5 year of follow-up, 2
      year of follow up, 3 year of follow-up and disease progression or relapse. TCR/BCR domain
      would be sequenced by high-throughput sequencing.
