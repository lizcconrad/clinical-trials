    <textblock>
      Background:

      Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a tumor of the thyroid gland. Surgery is the only current
      treatment to cure it. The drug pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a new type of cancer therapy. It
      works by allowing the immune system to detect and kill tumor cells.

      Objective:

      To test how pembrolizumab affects people with MTC and if it can offer them clinical benefit.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with MTC

      Patients who have recurrent or metastatic MTC, for whom surgery is not a curative option

      Patients with some imaging evidence of MTC

      Patients with minimal symptoms related to MTC

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood, urine, and heart tests

        -  CT scan or MRI: They lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body.

        -  Bone scan

      Participants will be put in a group based on their treatment history:

        -  Group 1 if they have had an immune stimulating cancer vaccine

        -  Group 2 if they have had no vaccine

      Participants will receive the study drug as a 30-minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment
      will continue for up to 2 years as long as they tolerate it and their disease does not get
      worse.

      Participants will have physical exams and blood tests on the day of each infusion. They will
      have CT and bone scans every 3 months.

      Participants may save biopsies before treatment and after starting treatment.

      Participants will have a final visit 3-4 weeks after stopping treatment. This will include a
      physical exam and blood and heart tests.

      After this study, participants will can join a long-term follow-up study.

      Background:

        -  Anti PD1/PDL1 therapies have had clinical success in a minority of unselected patients
           across multiple tumor types

        -  While many questions remain about optimal PD1/PDL1 staining techniques to pre-select
           responders, less focus is being place on how to optimize responses in a broader cohort
           of patients

        -  Emerging preclinical and clinical data supports the hypothesis that a strong immunologic
           response in the tumor microenvironment induces PDL1 expression on the tumor and is
           associated with better clinical response to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapies

        -  Therapeutic cancer vaccines are one strategy to induce an immunologic response to the
           tumor, thereby enhancing PDL1 expression and optimizing clinical responses across all
           patients

        -  Limited clinical data exists about the potential benefit of sequential therapy with a
           therapeutic cancer vaccine followed by PD1/PDL1 inhibition

        -  This study will explore the role of PD1 inhibition in medullary thyroid cancer and
           evaluate the potential differences based on previous vaccine therapy

      Objective:

      -The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether administering a PD1 inhibitor to
      patients with medullary thyroid cancer will permit a modest fraction to be able to experience
      a 50% or greater decline in calcitonin levels or experience a partial/complete response on
      imaging

      Key Eligibility:

        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with evidence of metastatic medullary
           thyroid cancer including disease that is evaluable on bone, CT scan or MRI

        -  Must have elevated calcitonin levels greater than 40 pg/mL

        -  Patients with minimal or no disease related-symptoms (minimal symptoms will include
           those that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require
           regularly schedule narcotics)

        -  ECOG 0-1

        -  Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious
           inter-current medical illness

        -  No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, open label, single center clinical trial where all patients receive
           the anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy pembrolizumab

        -  Patients will enroll in one of two cohorts: patients with previous vaccine therapy or
           patients without previous vaccine therapy

        -  All patients will be TKI -na(SqrRoot) ve, with minimal symptoms (consistent with the
           eligibility for our current study)

        -  Based on our calcitonin findings with our current study of 30 patients, we have
           determined that a confirmed calcitonin decline of 50% would be a rare finding, providing
           compelling preliminary evidence of clinical activity

        -  A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the proposed study (15 patients in each
           cohort). Given that we already have 30 patients on a study with vaccine, we would only
           need to identify and recruit 15 na(SqrRoot) ve patients for the vaccine-naive cohort.
           This accrual could be done in 18 months based on our current accrual rates

        -  Based on these metrics, we could have &gt;6 months of calcitonin data in 30 patients within
           2 years from trial initiation

        -  Additional immune correlative capitalizing on the extensive immune monitoring experience
           of the LTIB will allow for assessments of antigen specific T-cells and 123 immune
           subsets. These findings could provide the basis for biomarker development when taken
           together with biochemical and clinical responses seen in this study

             replacement or local (topical, nasal, eye drops or inhaled) steroid use. Limited doses
             of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease
             or to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known
             contrast allergies) are allowed.

             excluded. In addition patients with prostate cancer who do not require systemic
             therapy will not be excluded. (A secondary, minor pathologic focus of another form of
             thyroid cancer may be coincidentally found in 15-20% of patients with medullary
             thyroid cancer. In such cases, eligibility is based on the discretion of the
             investigator.)
