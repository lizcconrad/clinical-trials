      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on maternal and
      offspring vascular health.

      The study will comprise of a randomised pilot trial to assess the effect of a moderate
      intensity exercise intervention on maternal and offspring vascular health. Participants will
      be recruited in the first trimester (T1, 10-12 weeks' gestation), and will be randomized to
      either a 24-week, structured and partially supervised, gym-based exercise intervention
      beginning in trimester 2 (T2) through to trimester 3 (T3), or a non-exercise control group
      who receive normal clinical care. The inclusion of this non-exercise control group is
      critical in allowing us to create an understanding of the adaptation of the vascular system
      during a normal (non-exercising) pregnancy, and also determining the physical activity and
      sedentary behaviour engaged in during normal healthy pregnancy. All participants will be
      asked to attend the laboratory at Liverpool John Moores University on 4 separate occasions
      synchronised with the end point of each trimester and then within four weeks of delivery.
      Maternal vascular health, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and fitness will be assessed
      during each time point throughout pregnancy while the fourth visit will comprise of an
      offspring vascular assessment. The investigators will also gain information on delivery
      outcomes including pre-term delivery, complications during labour, induction of labour,
      caesarean sections and post-partum haemorrhage via medical notes at the Liverpool Women's NHS
      Foundation Trust.

    <description>Vascular function will be measured via endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial and femoral arteries and reported as percentage change.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sedentary behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at week 24 and 36 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Sedentary behaviour will be measured using an inclinometer at the end of each trimester for a period of 7 days in line with the accelerometer monitoring and will be reported in minutes.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Pregnancy specific outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Following delivery and within 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Following delivery the investigator will obtain information regarding pregnancy specific outcomes including pre-term birth, delivery complications, induction of labour, caesarean section and post-partum haemorrhage via medical notes at the collaborating hospital.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Offspring Vascular Structure</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed within 4 weeks of delivery</time_frame>
    <description>Offspring vascular structure will be assessed at the abdominal aorta site using ultrasound imaging. Wall thickness will be measured at three different angles of an optimised ultrasound image. The image will be adjusted so that artery wall thickness can be clearly seen and a 30 second recording taken at three different angles. The average of the three angles will be calculated for each artery. Results will be reported as change in millimetres at each time point for each artery assessed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cerebrovascular Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at week 24 and 36 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cerebrovascular function will be assessed using transcranial Doppler ultrasound to measure brain blood flow velocity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Vascular Structure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at week 24 and 36 of pregnancy</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular structure will be measured at carotid, femoral and brachial arteries using ultrasound imaging to clearly visualise the artery. The image will be adjusted so that artery wall thickness can be clearly seen and a 30 second recording taken at three different angles. The average of the three angles will be calculated for each artery. Results will be reported as change in millimetres at each time point for each artery assessed.</description>
