    <textblock>
      100 knees with primary osteoarthritis and scheduled for a total knee replacement (TKR) will
      be recruited from our waiting list. The patients will be randomized to become operated with
      the Attune or PFC total knee arthroplasty. Randomisation will be done using envelopes.
      Patients can only participate with one knee.

    <textblock>
      The Attune total knee replacement is a recently developed implant with the intention to
      improve the outcome after this procedure. One of the primary aims is to improve the
      kinematics of the knee in order to more closely mimic the normal knee. Thereby the patients
      are expected to experience improved function, better stability and less pain during activity.
      So far there are no randomized studies which have demonstrated this potential superior
      performance when compared to its predecessor, the PFC Sigma TKR. This study aims to evaluate
      the clinical outcome and the knee kinematics of the Attune knee using recognized clinical
      outcome parameters and dynamic radiostereometry. The PFC sigma knee will be used as control.

      100 knees with primary osteoarthritis and scheduled for a total knee replacement (TKR) will
      be recruited from our waiting list. The patients will be randomized to become operated with
      the Attune or PFC total knee arthroplasty. Randomization will be done using envelopes.
      Patients can only participate with one knee.

      Surgical procedure: The operations will be done according to our routines without use of
      bloodless field. Local analgesia will be infiltrated periarticulary during the operation.
      Cemented fixation will be used in all cases. So-called &quot;fast-track&quot;principles will be applied
      in both Groups.

      Patients will be followed for five years.
