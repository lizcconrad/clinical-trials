  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 29 million people in the US are living with diabetes, many of whom will develop
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) or diabetic eye disease (DED), the leading cause of vision loss and
      blindness in working-age adults. Annual eye screening is recommended for all diabetic
      patients since vision loss can be prevented with laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGF
      injections if DR is diagnosed in its early stages. Currently, the number of clinical
      personnel trained for DR screening is orders of magnitude smaller than that needed to screen
      the large, growing diabetic population. Therefore, to meet this large unmet need for DR
      screening, a fully-automated computerized DR screening system is necessary. This study is
      designed to assess the performance of EyeArt, an automated DR screening tool.

             other than cataract;

          -  Subject has contraindications for mydriatic medications or is unwilling or unable to
             dilate;

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in an interventional study of an investigational
             device/drug; or

          -  Subject has a condition or is in a situation which in the opinion of the Investigator,
             might confound study results, may interfere significantly with the subject's
             participation in the study, or result in ungradable 4-wide field stereoscopic
             mydriatic fundus photographs.
