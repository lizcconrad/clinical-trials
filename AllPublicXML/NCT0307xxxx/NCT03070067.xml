  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical decision support rule/tool for classification of TIA/mimic that will enable rapid
      detection of ACVS in hyper-acute settings is being developed. Also under development is a
      multi-protein test using mass spectrometry (MS). This test will provide TIA results within an
      hour or two for a fraction of the price of neuroimaging. With guidance provided by this test
      at their disposal, physicians can inform patients whether they can go home safely or whether
      they need further testing. The right patients will receive the right treatment, reduce
      unwarranted imaging risks and costs, and reduce the burden of stroke. The Heart and Stroke
      Foundation will work to ensure that physicians, allied healthcare providers, the public and
      other stakeholders are aware of the outcomes and clinical impacts of this project.

      Further, work is being done to establish the mechanisms to develop a strong phenotype for TIA
      that includes medical imaging (MRI), cardiac monitoring, cognitive assessments, and
      surveillance of health outcomes for extended periods of time.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients who fulfill all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria after giving informed
      consent will be enrolled in the Validation study.

      At enrollment, patients will receive a stroke nurse assessment in the Emergency Department
      (ED) and clinical information documented on an ACVS Assessment Form/SpecTRA Case Report Form.
      Patients will provide 6 mL of blood drawn into a purple-top EDTA tube that will be processed
      for proteomic analyses. These blood draws may or may not occur with the standard-of-care
      blood draw in the ED or stroke unit. Clinical orders include medical imaging (MRI +/-
      CT/CTA), cardiac monitoring (24hr +/- extended event monitoring). Patients will be referred
      by the attending ED physician to a stroke clinic for neurological consultation within 48
      hours - 7 days, whereby diagnosis of (i) possible ACVS; (ii) definite ACVS or (iii) mimic
      will be made. At the stroke clinic a cognitive screening test will be administered either as
      part of usual clinical care by treating physicians, nurses, or a study coordinator. A re-
      assessment will be repeated at 90 days by phone. MRI will be reviewed initially for clinical
      interpretation at the neurological consultation for evidence of brain ischemia (DWI+) and
      later by neuro-radiologists for definitive diagnosis in study purposes. Final adjudication of
      TIA and aetiology will be done by the non-blinded principal investigators at each site based
      on diagnostic results plus 90-day and up to 2-year outcomes.

        The study population includes individuals presenting to the hospital ED or stroke clinic
        with symptoms suggesting mild ACVS who would be referred to the outpatient stroke clinic.
        Patients will be recruited primarily from emergency department settings or hospital-based
        stroke units.
