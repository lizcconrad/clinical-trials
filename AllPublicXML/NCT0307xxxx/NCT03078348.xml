      The purpose of this research study is to compare a new educational material to another widely
      available educational brochure. The goal is to see if the new educational material will
      change knowledge and behaviors about colorectal cancer and colorectal screening.

    <intervention_model_description>In this modified &quot;block&quot; random assignment, all individuals recruited from the same geographic unit will receive the intervention assigned to that area in order to reduce intervention contamination. Individuals will not be made aware of their randomization (intervention) condition until after baseline assessment. The research assistants will also be assigned at random to work with one geographic area (i.e., one intervention condition) in order to reduce risk of intervention contamination by study staff.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Community-based recruitment methods will be used including promotional flyers and word
             of mouth at locations such as churches, barber shops, civic/community social service
             centers, senior centers, cultural groups. The flyers will provide brief information
             and advertise a telephone number for potential participants to call the study office
             at Moffitt.

          -  Self identify as Black or African American

          -  Have no symptoms of colorectal cancer (CRC), or personal diagnosis of CRC or bowel
             inflammatory disease or related syndromes

          -  Have not had recent CRC screening per guidelines (never screened or overdue)

          -  Participants must provide at least two forms of contact information (mailing address,
             home telephone or cell phone or email address), and contact information of a secondary
             individual who has a number that is different from the participant (this person may be
             a relative or friend living with the respondent).

          -  Spouse or relatives of respondent are potentially eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have participated in a colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) research in
             the past 1 year will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Additional criteria may apply.
