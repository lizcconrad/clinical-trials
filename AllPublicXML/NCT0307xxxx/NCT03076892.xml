    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy and tolerance of a new photodynamic therapy device
      (PHOS-ISTOS) with the conventional PDT device (Aktilite®) for the treatment of actinic
      keratosis of the scalp
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an intraindividual comparison of two methods. The number of subjects to be
      enrolled is 47. Patients will receive both treatments in a single visit: A first period of
      2.5 hours of illumination with Phos-Istos device followed by a continuous red light spectrum
      (between 7 and 10 minutes) with Aktilite® after an appropriate incubation of MAL (methyl
      aminolevulinate). Patients will complete a pain assessment scale after receiving both
      treatments. 3 follow-up visits will be then scheduled

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of minimum 10 previously untreated not pigmented,
             non-hyperkeratotic AK lesions of Grade I and II of the forehead and/or scalp
             (according to Olsen et Al. JAAD 1991, cf. REF 31) where other therapies are
             unacceptable or considered medically less appropriate with a symmetrical repartition
             on both side of the forehead and/or scalp. The diagnosis of AK will be determined upon
             clinical evaluation (i.e. visual inspection and palpation) by the investigator.

          -  No treatment for the AKs in the previous 30 days.

          -  Symmetrical areas in terms of number and severity of lesions. The axis of symmetry
             between the two areas will be defined by the investigator according to the
             distribution of lesions.

          -  The two areas to be treated should not be coalescing. A minimum distance of 10 mm is
             required between the lesions located on the 2 symmetrical areas. A minimum distance of
             2 mm is required between the lesions on the same side.

          -  Minimum 5 lesions with similar dimensions at both symmetrical areas will be treated.
             If the number of lesions is &gt;7, only 7 lesions on each side will be considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with porphyria.

          -  Patients immunosuppressed for idiopathic, disease specific or therapeutic reasons.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids to lesional areas within 2 weeks before PDT.

          -  Patients receiving local treatment (including cryotherapy and
             curettage-electrocoagulation, any PDT treatment) in face / scalp area within the last
             30 days.

          -  Patients receiving topical treatment (including imiquimod, 5-FU and diclofenac,
             Picato) in face / scalp area within the last 30 days.in

          -  Use of topical retinoids or alpha-hydroxy acids, systemic retinoids, chemotherapy or
             immunotherapy within 30 days of PDT.

          -  Pigmented AK lesion(s).

          -  Known allergy to Metvixia/Metvix, a similar PDT compound or excipients of the cream
             including arachis oil, or to peanut or soya.

          -  Participation in other clinical studies either currently or within the last 30 days.

          -  Female subjects must be of either:

               -  Non-childbearing potential, i.e. post-menopausal or have a confirmed clinical
                  history of sterility (e.g. the subject is without a uterus) or,

               -  Childbearing potential, provided there is a confirmed negative urine pregnancy
                  test or blood analysis prior to study treatment, to rule out pregnancy.

          -  Any condition which may be associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance.

          -  Patients currently receiving regular ultraviolet radiation therapy.
