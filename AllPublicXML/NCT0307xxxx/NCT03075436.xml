  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a two-year evaluation investigating the impacts of an enhanced, demand-side
      sanitation and hygiene intervention on sustainable adoption of improved water, sanitation,
      and hygiene (WASH) practices and mental well-being.

    <textblock>
      This study utilizes a cluster randomized, controlled trial design to examine the impacts of
      an enhanced, demand-side sanitation and hygiene intervention on behavior change and health in
      Amhara, Ethiopia. The study will test hypotheses set out in the investigation team's theory
      of change through the measurement and evaluation of process indicators, intermediate and
      shorter-term behavioral outcomes, and longer-term behavioral and health impacts, including
      mental well-being.

      The study aims to: (1) identify ways in which WASH-related behavior change components
      preventive for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) can be mainstreamed into the government-led
      Health Extension Program; (2) document the effectiveness of an enhanced demand-side
      sanitation and hygiene intervention; (3) investigate whether changes in personal hygiene,
      sanitation, and water behaviors are sustained; (4) document the cost-effectiveness of
      integrated WASH-related NTD-preventive behavior change promotion; and (5) assess whether
      collective efficacy and water security modify intervention effectiveness.
