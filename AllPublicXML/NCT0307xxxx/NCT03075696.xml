  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a novel T-Cell bispecific (TCB), RO7082859,
      administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, following the pretreatment administration of a
      one-time, fixed dose of obinutuzumab. The study is divided in 3 parts: dose escalation (Parts
      I and II) and dose expansion (Part III). Single-participant dose-escalation cohorts will be
      used in Part I, followed by conversion to multiple participant dose-escalation cohorts (Part
      II), in order to define a tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose
      (OBD). The expansion cohorts (Part III) will be initiated when the tentative MTD/OBD is
      defined, to further evaluate the safety, PK and therapeutic activity of RO7082859.
