  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-omics research of Chinese cardiomyopathies patients, aiming to determine
      genetic risk factor and serial biomarkers of cardiomyopathies in diagnosis and prognosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identification of novel biomarkers is needed to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of
      cardiomyopathy. Also,the marked variation of genes which is still unclear, may influence
      clinical outcomes is determined in part by genetic heterogeneity of the systemic response to
      pathological process.

      Specific aim:

        1. Proteomics, microRNA-seq and metabolomics will be to determine the correlation of
           echocardiographic parameters of systolic and diastolic functional entry with circulating
           molecules

        2. Genomics will be to determine the association of clinical outcome

        guidelines when there was clinical evidence of cardiomyopathy together with clinical
