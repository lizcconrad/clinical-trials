  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the gene-activated bone
      substitute consisting of octacalcium phosphate and plasmid DNA encoding vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) for maxillofacial bone regeneration. The patients with congenital and
      acquired maxillofacial bone defects and alveolar ridge atrophy will be enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants of the study will receive standard treatment according to the medical care
      standards for diseases and pathological conditions characterized by maxillofacial bone
      defects and/or alveolar ridge atrophy. Bone grafting procedures as part of the surgical
      treatment will be performed with the use of investigated medical device. The safety and
      efficacy of the implanted gene-activated bone substitute will be evaluated by clinical
      examination, comprehensive laboratory tests, and computer tomography within 6 months after
      surgery.

    <description>To determine the quantity of newly formed bone tissue the following morphometric parameters will be measured on CT scan using special tools (&quot;ROI&quot;, region of interest, etc.):
average density (in HU);
size (length, width, height) and volume.
All together both measurements allow to determine &quot;bone tissue formation&quot; as a value derived from the presence of newly formed bone tissue and its volume correspondence with the quantity of the material implanted.</description>
