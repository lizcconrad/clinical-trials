  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of a curriculum using medical simulators to train
      patients with advanced heart failure and their caregivers to master the self-management of
      ventricular assist devices (a device implanted into the heart to help circulate the blood).
      The investigators expect this training will improve self-management skills, and reduce
      VAD-related infections and re-hospitalizations. In addition to providing innovative training
      to the patients and their caregivers, the study will advance our knowledge of the effects of
      simulation-based training on patient self-management and safety.

    <description>The infection prevention department also tracks all VAD related driveline infections using definitions in the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) database. The investigators will assess patient factors at time of infection and during re- hospitalization such as age, sex, body mass index, and the Charlson comorbidity codes to evaluate differences between the SBML and usual VAD training groups</description>

        Patient Inclusion Criteria:

          -  being a previous or current VAD implantation patient,

          -  age &gt;18,

          -  English-speaking,

          -  receiving implantation and VAD care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH),

          -  meet hospital criteria for VAD implantation.

        Caregiver inclusion criteria:

          -  being a caregiver identified by a previous or current VAD implantation patient,

          -  age &gt;18, and

          -  English-speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable populations of patients will not be included in this study (including
             fetuses, neonates, children, pregnant women, prisoners, mentally retarded or
             incompetent individuals, institutionalized individuals, or individuals unable to give
             consent due to their medical condition). Fetuses and neonates are not the focus of our
             study.

          -  Pregnant women will not be included since pregnancy is a contraindication to VAD
             implantation It is possible that VAD caregivers may be pregnant at the time of the
             study.

          -  Patients with mental retardation, mental incompetence, or patients who are unable to
             give consent due to their medical condition will not be included as they will not be
             able to complete measures.

          -  Lastly, institutionalized individuals will not be included as access will be a
             problem, and these individuals are rarely referred for VAD implantation
