    <textblock>
      The detection of tissue PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has
      an important role in guiding for the treatment of immune detection point. At the same
      time,tissue detection is time-consuming and laborious, liquid biopsy can reflect the
      information of tumor tissue,PD-L1 expression in serum and peripheral blood T cell are
      expected to be simple, rapid, non-invasive means of detection. The project is planned to
      explore the correlation of PD-L1 expression in non-small lung cancer tissue and peripheral
      blood T cell and serum..The investigators have designed to detected the expression levels of
      PD-L1 protein in cancer tissue and detected the expression levels of PD-L1 in peripheral
      blood T cell and serum.By using variance analysis of repeated measures design information.
      Thus exploring the correlation of PD-L1 expression in non-small lung cancer tissue and
      peripheral blood T cell and serum,guiding clinical practice of immunotherapy.
