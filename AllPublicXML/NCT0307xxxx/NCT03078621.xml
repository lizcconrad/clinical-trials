      This study is a single arm, single center trial to study the safety and efficacy of purified
      autologous bone marrow derived stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of
      children with cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a chronic childhood disorder defined by a range of motor and cognitive
      impairments and results in a substantial suffering to the patient and a tremendous
      socio-economic burden to the individual, family, and healthcare system. With no effective
      treatments or interventions, therapies for CP are currently focused on supportive and
      management strategies. Stem cell transplantation has been suggested as a putative
      intervention for neural pathology, as mesenchymal and neural stem cells, as well as olfactory
      ensheathing glia and Schwann cells, which have shown some regenerative and functional
      efficacy in experimental central nervous system disorders.

      In this trial, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the intrathecal
      transplantation of specific populations of purified autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells
      and mesenchymal stem cells in patients with cerebral palsy.
