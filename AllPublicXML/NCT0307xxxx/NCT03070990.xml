  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) when administered intravenously to Japanese subjects with
      locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This study will also assess the
      immunogenicity as defined by the incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) and anti-tumor
      activity of enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22CE) when administered intravenously to Japanese
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a single 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion of enfortumab vedotin
      (ASG-22CE) once weekly for 3 weeks of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is
      28 days.
