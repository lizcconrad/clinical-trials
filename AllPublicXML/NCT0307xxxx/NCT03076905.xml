  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open label evaluation of a single intravenous dose of F901318 to healthy male and female
      subjects with pharmacokinetic and safety and tolerability evaluation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label single intravenous dose, single group study. Eight subjects (ideally 4 male and 4
      female, minimum of two females) will be studied. The drug product will be a F901318 solution
      for infusion (6mg/mL). The dose will be 4 mg/kg delivered in the fasted state (8 hours
      minimum) by intravenous infusion over 2 hours. Each subject will be on study for
      approximately 6 weeks. Each subject will reside at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Day
      -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 4 (72 hours post-dose). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic
      evaluation will be obtained up to and including 120 hours post dose. Safety and tolerability
      will also be assessed.

      Subjects will return to the clinical unit at 96 and 120 hours for pharmacokinetic blood
      sampling.

      All subjects will return for a post-study visit 8 to 10 days after the dose of study
      medication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be males or females of any ethnic origin between 18 and 55 years or age
             and weighing between 50 and 100kg.

          2. Females of child bearing potential must be established on a reliable form of
             contraception and have a negative pregnancy test at screening and Day -1

          3. Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations
             (hepatic transaminases must be within normal limits, congenital non haemolytic
             hyperbilirubinaemia is acceptable)

          4. Subjects will have given their written informed consent to participate in the study
             and to abide by the study restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female and male subjects who are not, or whose partners are not willing to use
             appropriate contraception with two reliable forms of contraception or who are not
             otherwise unable to conceive children (hysterectomy, oophorectomy, tubal ligation or
             post menopausal).

          2. Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14
             days of the dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator and the
             Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise safety

          3. Subjects who have used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             herbal remedies) within 7 days of the dose administration (with the exception of
             vitamin/mineral supplements and paracetamol) unless in the opinion of the Investigator
             and the Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise safety
