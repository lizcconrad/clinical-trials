      There are more than 7 million stroke patients in China , about 2 million new cases of stroke

      Therefore, clerify the advantages and characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine
      comprehensive treatment of sequelae of apoplexy. The formation of the active medical service

      ischemic stroke patients with integrated traditional Chinese medicine therapy for 3 months,
      And 21-month follow-up observation To identify the traditional Chinese medicine comprehensive
