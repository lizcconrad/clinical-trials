  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to investigate the effects of a daily dietary supplement of
      brown seaweed (2 capsules of InSea2®) on body weight, glycemic control and insulin secretion
      in overweight prediabetic men and women in association with a moderate weight loss
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diets that produce lower glucose and insulin responses may reduce diabetes and cardiovascular
      risk. They may also facilitate weight control by promoting satiety, insulin sensitivity and
      optimal insulin secretion after a meal. Food ingredients may indeed reduce postprandial
      glucose and insulin response through an inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase activity
      that may slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. InSea2® is a unique combination of
      polyphenolic extracts of brown algae (Ascophyllum nodosum and Fucus vesiculosus) which has
      been shown to inhibit the action of α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Preliminary data in healthy
      men and women have demonstrated a reducing effect on plasma insulin of a single intake of
      InSea2® consumed with a high-carbohydrate meal.

      The main objective is to evaluate the effects of a daily dietary supplement of 500 mg (2
      capsules) of brown algae extract powder (InSea2®) on blood glucose measured 2 hours after an
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in overweight insulin-resistant men and women.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the contribution of a daily consumption of this
      supplement (InSea2®) on weight loss when associated with a daily caloric restriction of 500
      kcal due to individualized nutritional intervention. More specifically, the investigators aim
      to evaluate the effects of supplementation combined with weight loss on other markers of
      glucose metabolism (fasting plasma glucose, glucose and insulin response during OGTT, insulin
      sensitivity measurement parameters and insulin secretion during OGTT), lipid profile, blood
      pressure and metabolic syndrome criteria.

      The investigators expect that InSea2® lowers the high levels of blood glucose and insulin
      observed 2 hours after a meal in overweight insulin-resistant human subjects.
