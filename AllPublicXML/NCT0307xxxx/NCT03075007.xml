      This study examines the factors that may drive the relationship between vascular disease and
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in a large, longitudinal, multi-ethnic community-based cohort study
      of older adults in northern Manhattan, New York. In past research, the investigators
      demonstrated that accumulation of brain vascular disease is associated with risk for
      development of AD. The study now extends the research to examine how brain vascular disease
      and AD interact. In this pilot study, the investigators will obtain positron emission
      tomography (PET) scans to measure amyloid (one of the protein pathological markers of AD)
      from participants in an ongoing community-based study of aging and dementia (WHICAP). The
      study will include subjects who are already enrolled in the parent project and already
      evaluated at baseline with PET scans. The study plans to obtain 20 amyloid PET scans after a
      5-year interval on the cohort of participants established at baseline. The investigators will
      also conduct transcranial Doppler studies to measure blood flow in the participants with
      amyloid PET scans. The potential benefits to society should be considerable if this study
      reveals new information about risk factors for or contributions to AD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating international public health
      epidemics. There are currently no effective disease-modifying or preventative strategies.
      Current pathogenic models emphasize a single pathway of disease pathogenesis, but
      underestimate the contribution of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, which manifests
      primarily as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). Understanding of the factors that drive the relationship between vascular disease and
      AD remains elusive; vascular factors may be independent sources of dysfunction that
      contribute additively to clinical expression, they may interact mechanistically with AD
      pathology, and/or they may relate to each other because of a shared association with a third
      set of factors. These issues are particularly relevant among ethnic/racial minorities, who
      are at much greater risk for clinical AD, have more severe cerebrovascular disease, but
      appear to have similar levels of AD pathology compared with Whites.

      The proposed research examines these factors in a large, longitudinal, multi-ethnic
      community-based cohort study of older adults in northern Manhattan, New York. The
      investigators demonstrated that accumulation of WMH, particularly in parietal lobes, predicts
      incident AD, and is associated with the presence of cerebral microbleeds, an indicator of
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The investigators extend the research to examine mechanistic
      interactions between cerebrovascular disease and AD. The preliminary data suggest that
      individuals with evidence of fibrillar amyloidosis have increased parietal lobe WMH and that
      hemodynamic markers of autoregulatory dysfunction are associated with both WMH and amyloid
      deposition, which in turn interact to promote the clinical expression of AD. These findings
      are buffered by new data that establish WMH as a core feature in autosomal dominant forms of
      AD. In this pilot study, the investigators propose to obtain longitudinal MRI and amyloid PET
      data from participants in WHICAP.

    <description>Cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) are assessed using TCD. Arterial blood pressure (ABP) is recorded simultaneously using the Finapres on the middle phalanx of the left or right middle finger. The phase shift between the two streaming signals is an indication of the extent to which oscillations in CBFV lead those in ABP and can be interpreted as active early counter-regulation. Lower phase shift reflects increased latency in cerebral vasomotion and thus poorer autoregulation.</description>
