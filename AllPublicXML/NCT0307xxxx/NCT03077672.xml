  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitochondria are organelles (a specialized subunit of a cell) responsible for providing cells
      with energy. For reasons not yet understood, mitochondria will release their DNA into blood
      in response to cellular injury or cell death.

      With a simple blood draw, investigators can measure the amount of mitochondrial DNA in a
      patient's blood.

      The investigators' hypothesis, is that mitochondrial DNA can be used as a surrogate marker of
      cellular injury to predict patient outcomes. The investigators intend to test their
      hypothesis by measuring mitochondrial DNA in adult patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department with sepsis (a life-threatening condition due to an infection) and observing their
      hospital course.

      Despite the advances of modern medicine, sepsis persists as one of the leading causes of
      death in the United States and poses a significant burden on U.S. health care, accounting for
      more than $24 billion of total hospital costs in 2013. The high mortality and cost of
      treating sepsis at least partially stems from the consequences of delayed diagnosis.
      Unfortunately, this delay is attributable to the broad clinical manifestations of the
      syndrome and the absence of a specific test for sepsis.

      Realizing this, The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive
      Care Medicine have released guidelines emphasizing the need for diagnostic approaches aimed
      at the early detection of sepsis. The hope is that early recognition will allow for more
      aggressive upfront management thereby improving patient outcomes.

      In 2013, Nakahira et al showed that circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are
      associated with sepsis and mortality in patients admitted to the ICU. In contrast to that
      study, the purpose here is to determine whether circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA and
      other biomarkers are associated with the severity of sepsis and 28-day mortality in patients
      presenting to the ED with sepsis.

      To accomplish this task, the investigators intend to prospectively collect specimens from
      patients presenting to NYP-Weill Cornell and NYP-Brooklyn Methodist with suspected sepsis.
