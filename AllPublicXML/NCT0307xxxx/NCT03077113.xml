      This is a prospective study of ventilation image comparison for lung functional information
      incorporation in thoracic cancer treatment planning.

    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that a high resolution regional ventilation image (HRVI) based on
      4D-CT imaging will correlate with the current low resolution state-of-the-art (SPECT-CT),
      which is the conventional way of measuring ventilation. HRVI may be a tool that could be
      widely used throughout the radiation therapy community because most radiation oncologists
      routinely employ 4D-CT technology in their own clinics. Investigators plan to test this
      hypothesis by comparing ventilation patterns on SPECT-CT images to HRVIs using a DICE
      analysis. As SPECT ventilation imaging is not included in our standard care, this study thus
      is designed as a pilot study.

      Based on published data, the difference between the two methods for calculating the regional
      ventilation in the lower 50% ventilation volume is expected to have a standard deviation of
      about 0.1. Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the regional
      ventilation between SPECT-CT and 4D-CT pre-treatment would have a width of no more than 0.14
      if 10 patients are enrolled and as small as 0.10 when 20 patients are registered.

    <description>The primary objective is to compare the regional ventilation using SPECT-CT and that as determined from the pre-treatment 4D-CT routinely collected at simulation in lung/abdominal patients (standard of care). 50% of the lower portion lung image will be used for the purpose of determining the regional ventilation for this protocol.</description>

    <description>The 4-D CT scan shows how the tumor moves when patients breathe so that motion can be taken into account when planning the radiation. This is the usual way of planning lung radiation and everyone in this study will be planned using a 4-D CT scan.</description>

    <description>It may be possible to make a more accurate plan by using a SPECT-CT scan for planning that would result in less damage to healthy lung tissue. This is not yet proven. A SPECT-CT scan uses a special camera to detect radioactivity to produce pictures which can lead to more precise information.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have early stage non-small cell lung cancer or clinical suspicion of the
             same in cases where the lesion is not amenable to biopsy but is enlarging and
             PET-positive. All patients are to be treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy
             as a monotherapy.

          -  Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as specific
             subsets of AJCC 7th edition stage I or II based on only one of the following
             combinations of TNM staging:

               -  T1a-b, N0, M0

               -  T2a, N0, M0

               -  T3 (invading the chest wall, &lt;5 cm in diameter) N0 M0
