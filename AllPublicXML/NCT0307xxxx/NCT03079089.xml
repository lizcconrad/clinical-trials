  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is the only treatment option
      with a significant chance of healing in lymphoid hematological refractory or multiple
      relapses after chemotherapy. However, all patients with an indication of allo-HSC can not
      benefit because of two limitations: the toxicity of the treatment and graft shortage
      available.

      For patients refractory or in relapses with an indication of allo-HSC, used the combinaison
      of an SET followed by the reduced-intensity allo-HSC (RIC) has shown some interesting
      results.

      A post-transplant immune modulation with prophylactic injections of donor lymphocytes (PDLI)
      showed its effectiveness to decrease the risk of relapse while having a lower toxicity than
      chemotherapy
