  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Zolpidem and Zoplicone are efective in the
      treatment of sleep disorders in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders (SD) affects 35 to 50 percent of patients with AD. These disorders often make
      caring for patients at home very difficult. Zolpidem and Zoplicone are prescribed drugs for
      sleep disorder in AD patients.
