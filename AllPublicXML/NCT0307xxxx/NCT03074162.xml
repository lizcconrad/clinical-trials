  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the relative systemic bioavailability of
      diclofenac in the presence and absence of capsaicin by comparing the systemic bioavailability
      of diclofenac from a combination product (Diclofenac 2% + Capsaicin 0.075% Topical Gel) with
      two diclofenac only products, Diclofenac Mono Gel 2% and Voltarol® 12 Hour Emulgel 2.32% Gel,
      following topical administration.

      In order to examine potential racial differences in pharmacokinetics (PK), the study
      population will be stratified 50:50, Caucasian versus Black people. With respect to the main
      objective, additionally a supportive analysis will be performed to investigate the influence
      of race on the intra-individual bioavailability ratios.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males and females, 18 to 50 years (inclusive) at time of screening.

          -  Body mass not less than 50 kg for males and females.

          -  Findings for medical history, vital signs, physical examination, standard 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory investigations must be normal or within
             laboratory reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the PI considers
             the deviation to be not clinically significant for the purpose of the study.

             discretion of the PI.
