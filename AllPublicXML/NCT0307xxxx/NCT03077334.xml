  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 18F-FDG-PET scan is currently being used for cancer diagnosis, staging, identifying
      hidden metastasis, and assessment of treatment responses in clinical oncology. Although there
      are important studies suggesting potential associations between PET-based parameters and
      oncologic outcomes, the calculation and official documentation of individual PET-based
      parameters might not be routine in clinical practice because these processes usually require
      time- and labor-consuming processes for the radiologists. In this study, the investigators
      prospectively determined clinical 18F-FDG-PET type according to degree of FDG-uptake in
      pancreatic cancer and compare oncologic outcomes between the types.

Inter-surgeon agreement of clinical PET type will be determined. Clinicopathologic characteristics between K-type and Non-K type will also be analyzed.</description>
