  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a prevalent atherosclerosis vascular disease with high mortality, external counter
      pulsation (ECP) is an approved noninvasive therapy for angina, congestive heart failure,
      myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock that augments blood flow to cardiac and systemic
      circuits, which improves the flow volume in the carotid. Though ECP is Ⅱa recommendation for
      stroke management, no multi-center control clinical study has been reported for prognosis of
      stroke. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of ECP on stoke. To address this
      assumption, investigators enroll subjects with ischemic stroke and randomized into control or
      ECP group, the ECP intervention will be carried out with a standard protocol which involves
      35 one-hour sessions (5 days a week) for continuous 7 weeks. The primary endpoint is mRS
      score in 3 months, secondary endpoints include NIHSS, BI and MMSE score, recurrence of stroke
      in 3 months, glycolipid metabolism, transcranial doppler (TCD) flow velocities and
      endothelial function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 17.5
      million deaths per year; 6.7 million of these deaths are related to stroke. Over 80% of
      strokes are classified as ischemic. External counter pulsation (ECP) is a non-invasive method
      which consists of three sets of pneumatic cuffs attached to each of the patient's legs at the
      calf and lower and upper thigh. The inflation of the cuffs is triggered by a computer, and
      timing of the inflation is based on the R wave of the electrocardiogram. The ECP therapist
      adjusts the inflation and deflation timing to provide optimal blood movement per a finger
      plethysmogram waveform reading. This produces a retrograde flow of blood in the aorta
      resulting in a diastolic augmentation of blood flow and also an increase in venous return,
      which leads to an improved carotid perfusion pressure. Cumulative evidences demonstrate that
      ECP can augment peak diastolic and mean middle cerebral artery flow velocities, accelerate
      rehabilitation after stroke, however, no multi-center study on the effect of ECP on the
      prognosis of stroke has been reported. Thus, this study is designed to enroll 380 subjects
      with ischemic stroke after evaluation of glycolipid metabolism, heart function, transcranial
      doppler (TCD) flow velocities, endothelial function, NIHSS, BI and MMSE score, they will be
      randomized into ECP intervention or control group. All subjects receive Guideline-driven
      standard medical treatment, ECP will be carried out with a standard protocol which involves
      35 one-hour sessions (5 days a week) for continuous 7 weeks. Up to the end of ECP
      intervention, mRS of subjects will be follow up to 3 months, meanwhile, items as above will
      be retested for comparison.
