  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to profile and elucidate the hormonal and neurological system interaction to food
      related behavior. The stimulus used will include visual and taste (gustatory) stimuli. The
      study will profile induced correlations of metabolic parameters, gut hormones and brain
      region (ROI - regions of interest) activation and interaction. In this study we will use fMRI
      (functional MRI) to compare brain responses in obese, normal-weight and reduced weight
      subjects. The food stimuli will be blocked into specific categories to allow for
      investigation of different responses to alternating energy density foods. The response will
      be tested prior to and following a brief low carbohydrate dietary regimen.

      The study will be a longitudinal study where the participants will come back twice on the
      same phase of the period- both visits in the luteal phase with a month between each visit. In
      this part of the study there will be 40 participants with a wider range of BMI. This phase of
      the study will include a nutritional intervention - the participants will be asked to have a
      carbohydrate restricted diet (60 grams of carbohydrate)- for a period of a month with no
      caloric restriction. Food records will be kept and followed and a ketone test (blood test)
      will be done on the morning of the study visits.
