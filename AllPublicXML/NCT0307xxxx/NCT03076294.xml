  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators wondered whether the association between high frequency
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (hf-rTMS) and manual therapy (peripheral and
      central approach) is more effective in reducing pain levels and modulation of cortical
      activity of chronic knee ostearthritis pain subjects than manual therapy alone (usual
      peripheral approach). For this purpose, patients included will be submitted to one session
      with active or sham hf-rTMS followed by a protocol of manual therapy. Besides that another
      active group will have the sequence of interventions exchanged (manual therapy followed by
      hf-rTMS) in order to investigate whether this may influence in the final outcomes.

    <description>Pain will be evaluated by pressure algometry before and after the interventions. It's a evaluation technique which aims to quantify through physical stimulation (pressure in the nociceptors) the capacity of pain perception and toleration. It will be used with the patient lying in supine and will have the purpose of measure the pressure pain threshold (PPT) in eight points around patellar region. Besides that, two control points will be adopted, one in anterior tibial muscle (five centimeters distal of anterior tibial tuberosity) and another in the extensor carpi radialis longus muscle (five centimeters distal to lateral humerus epicondyle). After marking, the algometer will be setted up 90° in contact with the skin and will be applied a 0,3 kgf/cm²/s pressure until the patient report pain by pressing a pen (Model/Brand: Algomed/Medoc). The measure will be done twice in the demarcated points with a two minutes interval between them. Will be considered a mean of the obtained values.</description>

    <measure>Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Until 30 days (before, after the interventions and until the last day with the same value of the first evaluation)</time_frame>
    <description>Is it used to quantify pain level, where 0 means no pain and 10 means worst pain possible. NPRS is recommended as the main endpoint in chronic pain studies and it has been established that a decrease of at least 2 points or 30% represents a minimal clinically important difference. The MDCI consists of the smaller variation in a clinical outcome perceived by the patient and that results in a relevant change in his state of health.</description>

    <description>High frequency TMS will be applied with an eight-shaped coil angled at zero degrees from the sagittal axis and positioned at the C3 or C4 in accordance with the international 10-20 marking system (JASPER, 1958), which corresponds to the right or left primary motor cortex (M1). Twenty four stimulus trains will be provided at 10 Hz for five seconds each. The interval between the trains will be 25 seconds, totaling 1200 pulses for approximately 12 minutes, with 90% of resting motor threshold (RMT). After TMS, patients will be submitted to 45 minutes of manual therapy protocol.</description>

    <description>In this group, the order of interventions will be randomized. Therefore, the volunteer can start with manual therapy or sham TMS. In manual therapy, patients will be submitted to 45 minutes of a protocol. In addition, with regard to sham TMS, the same parameters will be used, however, it will be performed using two coils, one connected to the magnetic stimulator, away from the patient's scalp and another uncoupled from the stimulator and positioned in the same way as in real stimulation.</description>

    <intervention_name>TMS</intervention_name>
    <description>Repetitive TMS involves application of electric currents in the patient's cortex by a magnetic field applied to the scalp of the patient through an eight-coil connected to a magnetic stimulator (MagStim Rapid² magnetic stimulator-UK). In a small percentage of patients, it may cause minimal discomfort with a mild headache sensation, which usually disappears after a few seconds. Depending on the parameters, rTMS can increase or decrease corticomotor excitability and by the connection of the motor cortex with the thalamus, influencing pain control. The patients will respond to an adverse effects questionnaire and will report the perception of real or sham stimulation.</description>
