    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the safety of THR-317 when administered intravitreally
      and to assess the compound's efficacy in improving best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and
      reducing central subfield thickness (CST) in subjects with centre-involved diabetic macular
      oedema (DME).
