  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pharmacodynamic random order cross-over trial investigating the physiological
      effects of intra-arterial infusion of nitrite following a haemolysed autologous blood
      transfusion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a healthy volunteer study.

      Following entry into this cross-over trial, participants will be randomized to undergo
      experiments under either normoxic followed by hypoxic conditions, or hypoxic followed by
      normoxic conditions.

      Subjects will donate whole blood as an autologous unit at a preselected NHSBT donation site.
      The unit will transported back to the NNUH blood bank after a minimum of 30 days (maximum 35
      days) after donation.

      Volunteers will be tested for baseline bloods. Volunteers will be randomised to normoxia or
      hypoxia. The will then undergo a nitrite infusion, followed by an autologous whole blood
      transfusion and a second nitrite infusion (which will co-infuse at the end of the
      transfusion). During the protocol, the participants will undergo repeated FBFR measurements
      using strain-gauge plethysmography.

      After a minimum of 12 weeks rest period after their initial donation, participants will
      cross-over to the opposite oxygen condition (as per initial randomization) and the above
      protocol will be repeated. All interventions will be performed by fully trained and competent
      medical staff.
