      Aim of this trial is to study the effect of Dexmedetomidine on post-operative blood pressure
      in patients undergoing brain arteriovenous malformation embolization. The patients were
      randomized allocated to either Dexmedetomidine group or Control group. Patients in
      Dexmedetomidine group will receive intravenous Dexmedetomidine while the control group will
      receive normal saline. Post-operative anti-hypertensive drug, Visual analogue
      score,post-operative analgesics consumption, Quality of Recovery score, Ramsay score, and
      adverse events were recorded.

      Aim of this trial is to study the effect of Dexmedetomidine on post-operative blood pressure
      in patients undergoing brain arteriovenous malformation embolization. The patients were
      randomized allocated to either Dexmedetomidine group or Control group according to a random
      number. Patients in Dexmedetomidine group will receive intravenous Dexmedetomidine while the
      control group will receive normal saline. Post-operative anti-hypertensive drug, Visual
      analogue score,post-operative analgesics consumption, Quality of Recovery score-15 items,
      Ramsay score, and adverse events were recorded.
