      The aim of this study is to assess benefits of treatment with intravenous Curcumin® (CUC-01)
      vs placebo, in combination with paclitaxel chemotherapy, and to estimate the risk of adverse
      events in patients with locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

      placebo i.v. solution (250 ml, yellow solution for masking/blinding), once weekly for 12
      weeks.

      Primary objective of the study:

      To assess:

        -  Efficacy of combined therapy with Curcumin ®, (CUC-01) and Paclitaxel vs Paclitaxel in
           patients with advanced and metastatic breast cancer in terms of Objective Response Rate

      RATIONALE

      Various preclinical, clinical, and animal studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an
      antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic, as a mediator of chemoresistance,
      chemopreventive, and as a therapeutic agent. However, the main problem associated with the
      use of curcumin in humans is its low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, poor
      solubility in body fluids and low bioavailability. To overcome the pharmacokinetic and
      bioavailability limitations of oral administration, water soluble curcumin, Curcumin®
      (CUC-01) injection, a clear, yellow viscous solution intended for dilution with a suitable
      parenteral fluid prior to intravenous infusion was elaborated. Curcumin® (CUC-01) injection
      is patented pharmacy product and sold per individual prescription in Germany and other
      countries for Cancer Centers. However, clinical efficacy and safety of these formulation have
      to be confirmed in this study.

      Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) against a variety of conventional and novel
      chemotherapeutic agents is a significant challenge in effective cancer therapy. Paclitaxel,
      one of the most prescribed conventional chemotherapeutic agents, acts as microtubule
      stabilizer and blocks cancer cells in the G2/M phase, thus preventing them from mitosis. It
      is also an apoptosis inducer in cancer cells. However, one of the main drawbacks of its use
      is that it is also a substrate of P-gp and treatment with PCL induces the overexpression of
      the efflux pump in the cancer cells. NF-κB is a transcription factor that controls the
      expression of genes involved in a number of physiological responses including
      differentiation, inflammation, apoptosis and upregulation of the P-gp. The PI3K/Akt pathway
      is also another over-activated pathway in a wide range of tumor types and therefore its
      over-activation leads to increased cancer-cell survival, proliferation, and growth and it
      also promotes NF-κB activity, all affects the success of the chemotherapy with Paclitaxel.
      Curcumin is known to downregulate both the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathways independent of each
      other, and thus it can act as a mediator of chemoresistance by sensitizing cancer cells to a
      conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

      It has been suggested that co-administration of Paclitaxel and curcumin will help to overcome
      multidrug resistance in cancer. Synergistic interaction of curcumin and paclitaxel was
      demonstrated in paclitaxel (Taxol)-resistant breast cancer cells, human breast cancer
      xenograft model, in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and many other cancer cell
      lines. In vivo, this combination treatment produced a three-fold tumor inhibition with each
      of these cell lines. Furthermore, the combination of paclitaxel and curcumin exerted
      increased anti-tumor efficacy on mouse models These results clearly indicate combination of
      Curcumin with paclitaxel could have significant clinical advantages for the treatment of
      breast cancer.

      Curcumin exerted in vitro anti-breast cancer activities through regulation of matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1),
      NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) factors, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B
      (Akt) signaling.

      Therefore, and based on this evaluation, we intend examining the effect of Curcumin ®,
      (CUC-01) in advanced and metastatic breast cancer in this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study.
