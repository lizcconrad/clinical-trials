  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An innovative nutritional application (App) entitled &quot;MyNutriCart&quot; was developed to create a
      list of foods and beverages to help individuals make smart and healthy choices when
      purchasing foods at grocery stores based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This App
      was tested in a pilot trial to evaluate its feasibility, usability, and acceptability for
      making smart and healthy choices when purchasing food in grocery stores and test its
      effectiveness in improving food selection, dietary patterns, and weight status compared with
      the traditional nutritional counseling.

      An innovative nutritional application (App) entitled &quot;MyNutriCart&quot; was developed to create a
      list of foods and beverages to help individuals make smart and healthy choices when
      purchasing foods at grocery stores based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. A pilot
      randomized clinical trial was done to test the effectiveness of this App on food selection
      and purchase, dietary patterns, and weight loss during two months of intervention. We also
      assessed feasibility, usability, satisfaction and acceptability of the App. A total of 138
      overweight and obese adults aged 21-45 years old who own a Smartphone were invited to
      participate in this study. Participants were randomized into two groups; (1) the intervention
      group used the App, which generated a healthy grocery list to use when purchasing foods in in
      the supermarket; (2) the control group had a traditional intervention with a nutritionist. To
      assess the impact of the intervention on dietary patterns, participants completed three
      24-hour dietary recalls, a short food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and provided grocery
      receipts at baseline and at the end of the study (8 weeks later). Weight and height were also
      performed before and after the intervention. Feasibility, usability, satisfaction, and
      acceptability of the nutrition App were assessed at the end of the study using a
      questionnaire.

    <description>A Food frequency questionnaire was completed by participants at baseline and end of study. It includes the frequency of consumption of the following food groups: fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, refined and whole grains, legumes, healthy proteins, red meats, cold cuts and cured meats, whole-fat and low-fat dairy products, 100% fruit juices, and sugar-sweetened beverages.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a questionnaire with 3 questions about feasibility, in which they rated each item using a five point Liker scale ranging from strongly agree (5 points) to strongly disagree (1 point): (1) easiness to use the App; (2) easiness to learn how to use the App; and (3) easiness how to find information in the App.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed a questionnaire with 3 questions about their satisfaction with the App, in which they rated each item using a five point Liker scale ranging from strongly agree (5 points) to strongly disagree (1 point). These items were: (1) satisfaction with information provided; (2) likenesses of re-using the app; (3) overall likeness and rating of the App.</description>
