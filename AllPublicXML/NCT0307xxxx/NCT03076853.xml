  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of MATRIX-DPRS is to assess the clinical and organizational impacts of the use of the
      medication record, opened, filled and managed by pharmacists (from private office and
      hospital units) by hospital physicians in private and public healthcare establishments
      (volunteers), for three clinical contexts: anaesthesiology visit before surgery, medications
      abuse and emergency hospitalization, medications and elderly hospitalisations.

    <textblock>
      As part of the national 2012 PREPS call for proposals, a multidisciplinary research team was
      set up to design and develop methods in order to evaluate the efficiency and the performance
      of health data information systems. This team is composed of physicians and researchers in
      medical informatics, hospital information systems, biostatistics, process analysis and
      management in healthcare, ergonomics and usability. This study was aimed to evaluate the
      clinical and organizational impacts of the use of a new source of information brought by the
      pharmaceutical record, promoted by the national committee of pharmacists. This record is
      opened and filled for each patient by the pharmacist. It contains all the medication sold
      (prescribed by physician and OTC) by the patient. This record is used by almost all the
      private pharmacists. The French Health Ministry was looking for an evaluation of this new
      source of information by hospital physicians in order to be applied by any healthcare
      institution or organization wishing to evaluate the added value of its investments or
      recommendations (example: ARS (French Regional Health Agency), DGOS (French Directorate
      General of Health Services), etc.) in the information system.
