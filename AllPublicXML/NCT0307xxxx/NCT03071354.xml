  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, control trial of
      β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation in elderly patients (≥65 years of age) with
      acute respiratory failure, who are identified at high risk for malnutrition by ICU-specific
      nutritional risk scores. Patients will receive either 3g of HMB daily, or control, daily
      until day 28 following randomization (even if discharged).The investigators will measure
      functional outcomes using standard, validated measures prior and after discharge.

      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized, control trial of HMB supplementation in
      elderly patients (≥65 years of age) with acute respiratory failure, who are identified at
      high risk for malnutrition by ICU-specific nutritional risk scores. Patients will receive
      either 3g of HMB daily, or control, daily until day 28 following randomization (even if
      discharged).the investigators will measure functional outcomes using standard, validated
      measures prior and after discharge.

      The investigators hypothesize that this inexpensive nutrient, HMB, along with our supportive
      measures, reduces muscle loss, improves physical muscle function, and improves quality of
      life in the longer term following critical illness.

    <description>HMB 3g/day or iso-nitrogenous control (discussed below) in addition to standard enteral, and parenteral nutritional supplementation and standard nutrition when transferred to the ward. The dose of HMB was chosen based on multiple studies revealing efficacy of 3g/day improving muscle mass and demonstrating an excellent safety profile. Feeding will be initiated as per local practice. Enrolled patients will be randomized to supplementation with HMB (3g) or control will begin within 72 hours of admission to ICU.</description>
