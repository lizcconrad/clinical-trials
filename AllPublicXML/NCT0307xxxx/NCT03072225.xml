    <textblock>
      Vulnerable plaque of carotid artery is the important intervention target for primary
      prevention and secondary prevention of cerebral arterial thrombosis, but there are no
      effective, safe and prevalent treatment measures against it. The development that traditional
      Chinese medicine has achieved in treating plaque of carotid artery shows that great
      accomplishment could be made within this area. Academia should engage in clinical research on
      regulated treatment methods in traditional Chinese medicine with long-term intervention and
      high patient compliance, providing strong evidence for evidence-based medicine and guidance
      to clinical practice.
