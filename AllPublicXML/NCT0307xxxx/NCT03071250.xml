  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The care for patients receiving total hip and knee arthroplasty at the University of Arkansas
      for Medical Sciences has followed a structured care pathway since July 2015. This system of
      perioperative care has focused on preoperative assessment of medical co-morbidities and risks
      to postoperative functional recovery, anesthetic care focused on postoperative nausea and
      vomiting prevention and optimizing immediate postoperative functional ability, and aggressive
      postoperative physical therapy.

      This is an observational study to look at the outcomes of this program at University of
      Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Areas of focus will be hospital length of stay, postoperative
      narcotic consumption, Visual Analog Scale scores, incidence of postoperative nausea and
      vomiting, and 30-day readmission rates, and health literacy rates.
