  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angina and heart attacks are caused by narrowings in the coronary arteries (blood vessels)
      supplying the heart. These narrowings can be opened using a balloon and stent (angioplasty).
      Traditionally, stents are constructed from metal and are permanent. However, newer stents are
      being constructed from carbohydrate polymers (scaffolds), which allow them to reabsorb over
      time leaving no permanent implant. New data has suggested that these scaffolds appear to
      reduce recurrent angina and may alter the blood flow down the artery. However, it is not
      known whether this is due to the scaffolds themselves or the way the scaffolds are inserted.
      In this study we hope to measure the blood flow to the heart and assess changes in that flow
      during stent and scaffold insertion. It is also important to know whether these effects are
      durable and thus, a cohort of patients will return at 3-months to be restudied. These data
      are important to help us understand why blood flow is affected by stent/scaffold selection or
      device implantation technique and whether this results in better long-term outcomes.
