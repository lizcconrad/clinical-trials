  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this bioavailability trial should be shown that the one of the main active constituent in
      alcoholic echinacea extracts, the alkylamide dodeca-2E,4E,8Z,10E/Z-tetraenoic acid
      isobutylamide (short: tetraen) is bioavailable in children of different age groups after
      intake of 5 Echinaforce junior tablets.

      Six capillary blood draws are taken at the following time points: Start (0), after 15, 30,
      60, 90, 270 minutes and thereafter the bioavailability is measured and calculated.
