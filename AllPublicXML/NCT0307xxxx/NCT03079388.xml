  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute malnutrition in pregnancy is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in mothers and their
      unborn children. Undernutrition during pregnancy can result in maternal complications such as
      life-threatening hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and infant complications
      such as intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, pre-term delivery and poor
      cognitive development. Poor women in the developing world are at heightened risk of
      malnutrition due to inadequate dietary intake and are subject to transmission of a number of
      infections including malaria, intestinal helminths, and genitourinary infections. Food
      interventions for malnutrition may be less effective under conditions with excessive
      inflammation and infection, and especially so during pregnancy. Without specifically
      addressing treatment for infections, undernourished mothers may be less responsive to
      nutritional interventions. The benefits of treating both malnutrition and common infections
      simultaneously remain largely unstudied. This study tests the hypothesis that malnourished
      pregnant women receiving 100 grams per day of a specially formulated ready-to-use
      supplementary food in addition to a combination of 5 anti-infective interventions will have
      greater weight gain in pregnancy and deliver larger, longer infants than women receiving the
      standard of care. The outcome of the pregnancy and maternal nutritional status will be
      followed until 6 months after delivery.

    <description>The women randomized to this arm will receive a ready-to-use-supplementary food (RUSF) designed specifically for pregnancy. The RUSF will provide a total of 520 kcal, 18 g protein, and 200% of recommended daily allowance (RDA) for most micronutrients during pregnancy. The supplement is also optimized to provide excellent protein quality and optimal polyunsaturated fatty acid composition. These women will receive 5 anti-infective interventions: 1) insecticide-treated mosquito net, 2) monthly intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) 3) azithromycin at the second and third trimester 4) albendazole given in second trimester, and 5) bacterial vaginosis testing and treatment at enrollment and again at weeks 28-34</description>

    <description>The women randomized to this arm will receive the standard of care for Sierra Leone. The treatment provided to women in this group includes 3.5 kg super cereal with 350 g vegetable oil every two weeks. This provides 250 mg portion/day of the super cereal and 25g oil/day for the mother. Women will receive the food for the duration of their pregnancy. These women will receive the current recommendations of the government of Sierra Leone, which includes standard intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) of 2 doses of sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine, iron and folic acid supplement with a goal of 90 pills/pregnancy, an insecticide-treated mosquito net, and albendazole for deworming in the second trimester.</description>
