  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of femoroacetabular impingement has evolved over the last several years. As the
      number of arthroscopic hip operations has risen over the last few years, so has the level
      controversy in regards to the appropriate initial management. There have been many recent
      advances in clinical diagnosis, advanced imaging techniques, improved indications for surgery
      and improved arthroscopic techniques which have led to improved clinical outcomes, but the
      effectiveness of physical therapy remains unknown.

      The treatment of femoroacetabular impingement has evolved over the last several years. As the
      number of arthroscopic hip operations has risen over the last few years, so has the level
      controversy in regards to the appropriate initial management. There have been many recent
      advances in clinical diagnosis, advanced imaging techniques, improved indications for surgery
      and improved arthroscopic techniques which have led to improved clinical outcomes, but the
      effectiveness of physical therapy remains unknown.

      A paucity of evidence exists in regards to the non-operative treatment of FAI.

      Several insurance companies are now requiring three to six months of physical therapy prior
      to approval for surgery. There is not a single study that has objectively evaluated the
      effectiveness of physical therapy in the avoidance of surgical intervention. The
      investigators plan to evaluate this using an electronic outcomes data collection system. The
      hypothesis is that the majority of patients will not see a significant enough improvement
      with physical therapy to avoid surgery, especially in a subset of patients such as those with
      sub spine impingement. The investigators plan to prospectively collect data for three years
      and monitor the outcome of each hip patient, especially those treated with physical therapy
      as an initial treatment and there potential avoidance of surgery.

    <description>The investigators plan to prospectively collect data and monitor the outcome of each hip patient. Subjects will complete a number of assessments utilizing iPads with an electronic data collection system. The data will be collected during each visit or done remotely via the internet, at which time the adjusted means from this longitudinal model will be compared.</description>

        Subjects will be included if they are 18-65 years old. Patients with hip pain are routinely
        seen in our clinic. Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be offered the
