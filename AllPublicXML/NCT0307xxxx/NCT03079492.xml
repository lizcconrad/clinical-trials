  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate hypothermia has been demonstrated to be the effective treatment for neonates with
      hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). However, few studies reveal the actual alterations in
      physiological parameters (i.e. brain temperature and cerebral blood flow) of neonates
      undergoing cooling, especially for HIE lesions. Therefore, this project aims to utilize the
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), i.e. MR thermal imaging and phase contrast MRI to measure
      the changes of these parameters before and during hypothermia; and then make comparisons with
      the routine nasopharyngeal and rectal temperature. All these would provide in vivo
      quantitative data for therapeutic evaluation and promote the optimization.

      1. Study objects 1.1 Primary object To examine the changes of brain temperature and
           cerebral blood flow in neonates with HIE before and during (i.e. cooling lasting for
           24~36 hr) selective brain cooling.

           1.2 Secondary object To compare the differences in temperature between brain (thalamus
           and HIE lesions) and nasopharynx and rectum of HIE neonates during the cooling.

        2. Methods Prospective observational study; the MR thermal imaging and phase contrast MRI
           will be used to estimate brain temperature and cerebral blood flow.

      Neonates with HIE who fulfilled the moderate hypothermia criteria will be recruited from the
      neonatal intensive care units. MR scans will be performed twice after informed parental
      consent. The first scan will be before the hypothermia and the second scan will be during the
      hypothermia. The first scan will be performed while the neonate is still in the intensive
      care unit. At the time of the second MR scan, the neonate is still in the intensive care
      unit, and the neonate in hypothermia group is receiving the brain selective cooling. Sedation
      would be used if required in these babies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit who fulfill the hypothermia criteria for
             treating the hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and who are scheduled to have an MRI for
             evaluation of the extent of their injury.

          -  Parents, clinicians and physician consent to perform evaluation of MRI before and
