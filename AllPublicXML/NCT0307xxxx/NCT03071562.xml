  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of people living with HIV (and as many as 80% over the age of 50) have
      difficulties with cognitive functions such as memory and thinking that can have a profound
      negative impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Problems with memory and
      thinking are also associated with forgetting to take anti-retroviral drugs and experiencing
      challenges to balance, walking and mental health (anxiety and depression). There is
      increasing evidence that, in the general population, exercise has positive effects on
      cognition, physical functioning and mental health. Despite the recognition of multiple
      therapeutic benefits of exercise, little attention has been paid to its possible effects on
      cognition in people living with HIV. The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to compare
      the effects of a 12-week, randomly assigned, community-based yoga-mindfulness intervention on
      cognition, balance, walking, mental health and quality of life in 30 people &gt;35 years of age
      living with HIV in the Halifax area. Yoga is of particular interest because it encompasses
      not only the physical but also spiritual, emotional, and mental dimensions of life. As such,
      it has tremendous potential to help stave off some of the devastating consequences of HIV
      infection.

    <masking_description>Cognition, motor function (balance, walking speed), and affective (mental health, quality of life, medication adherence) evaluations will be administered at baseline and post-intervention (12 weeks) by a trained physiotherapist, blinded to the group assignment. The rationale for blinding the assessing physiotherapist is to reduce bias in scoring during the outcome assessment sessions.</masking_description>
