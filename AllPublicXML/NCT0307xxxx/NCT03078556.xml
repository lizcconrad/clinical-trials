  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the bioequivalence of two experimental fixed dose combination
      (FDC) tablets versus single entity products of dolutegravir (DTG) and lamivudine (3TC) in
      healthy adult subjects. The study will be carried out in two parts. Part 1 of the study will
      be open label, up to 3 periods design with a wash out period of at least 7 days between
      treatment periods. Subjects will be randomized to receive either single entities or
      formulation 1 FDC of DTG and 3TC in a crossover manner in first 2 periods. The first 16
      subjects who complete the first two treatment periods and consent to continue will receive a
      single dose of FDC formulation 1 tablet administered with a high fat meal for a third
      treatment period. In Part 2 of the study, subjects will be randomized to receive either
      single entities or formulation 2 FDC of DTG and 3TC in a crossover manner in first 2 periods.
      Similarly the first 16 subjects will then receive FDC formulation 2 tablets with high fat
      meal in treatment period 3. Subjects will have a follow-up visit within 7-14 days after the
      last dose of study drug. Approximately 76 healthy subjects will be included in Part 1 of the
      study and if Part 2 of the study is conducted, another 76 healthy subjects will be included.
      The total duration will be approximately 11 weeks.
