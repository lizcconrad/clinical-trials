    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the anatomical distribution of the assessed Electromyogram (EMG)
      responses ensuring after sensory nerve root stimulation and obtained IOM grading during
      selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) with regard to level and, side of the body and gender as
      well as pain management and outcome data.
