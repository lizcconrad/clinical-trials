  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of the decision aid on measures
      of decision-making such as knowledge, screening attitudes, decisional conflict, and screening
      intent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a single group, pre-post design, we aim to assess the effect of the decision aid on
      screening knowledge, screening attitudes, decisional conflict, and screening intent within 3
      months of decision aid viewing.

    <measure>Change in decision-making measures of knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will use descriptive statistics to provide an overview of knowledge at baseline and at follow-up.
Hypothesis 1: Screening specific knowledge will improve after completing the decision aid.
o Statistical tests:
Overall knowledge: Treating knowledge as a continuous variable by adding number correct out of 12 items (0-12 possible points), we will perform a Wilcoxon sign rank test to assess change in knowledge between baseline and follow-up
Individual knowledge items: Using McNemar's test, we will compare the proportion who correctly answered individual knowledge items at baseline and follow-up</description>

    <measure>Change in screening attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will use descriptive statistics to provide an overview of screening attitudes at baseline and at follow-up.
• Exploratory: Using t-tests or chi-squared tests as appropriate, we will assess the change between baseline and follow-up of screening attitudes.</description>

    <description>We will use descriptive statistics to provide an overview of decisional conflict at baseline and at follow-up.
• Exploratory: Using t-tests or chi-squared tests as appropriate, we will assess the change between baseline and follow-up of decisional conflict.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Preliminary estimates on the effect of the decision aid on behavioral outcomes</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 months of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will use descriptive statistics (means and proportions) to provide preliminary estimates on the effect of the decision aid on documentation of shared decision-making in the electronic health record and screening behavior at 3 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of implementing a decision aid intervention in a primary care clinic setting</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>This is a descriptive and qualitative aim. We will describe measures of feasibility related to time needed to complete surveys, participant ability to navigate decision aid website, number of times assistance is needed to complete surveys/navigate the decision aid website, and type of assistance required.</description>

    <description>After completing the baseline survey, the research team member will ask each participant asked to view the lung cancer screening decision aid on a tablet. The following areas regarding lung cancer screening: What is lung cancer?, Why is lung cancer a problem?, What is screening?, What is low-dose CT screening, Recommended frequency of screening, Screening factors, lung cancer risks and benefits (magnitude of benefit, harms, false positive, invasive procedures, radiation, stress/anxiety), Summary, Values Clarification, Screening Choice, and Smoking cessation messaging for current smokers OR positive reinforcement for former smokers.</description>
