  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective external field study of a novel in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay
      (ImmunoXpert™).

      The study will involve reviewing the medical charts of 4500 pediatric patients that were
      tested using ImmunoXpert™ as part of the routine workup for acute febrile illness.

      ImmunoXpert™ uses a computer algorithm to combine immunoassay measurements of three host
      immune proteins (TRAIL, IP-10, and CRP) present in human blood. The test is intended for use
      in conjunction with clinical assessments and other laboratory findings as an aid to
      differentiate bacterial from viral infection.

      Statistical analysis will be performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of ImmunoXpert™
      with that of current practice lab testing e.g., WBC, CRP, and PCT (whichever were taken as
      part of routine care) and clinical suspicion at time of requisition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 3 month to 18 years that were admitted due to acute febrile illness, and
             ImmunoDx test was taken as part of their workup.

        The febrile illness should also fulfill the following criteria:

          -  The patient had a peak temperature ≥38°C (AND)

          -  Symptoms initiated ≤ 7 days before sampling (AND)

          -  A retrospective diagnosis of bacterial or viral or mixed infection was anonymously
             determined by a panel of three independent senior pediatricians.

        The non-infectious disease control group will include:

          -  A retrospective diagnosis of a non-infectious disease was anonymously determined by a
             panel of three independent senior pediatricians physicians.

          -  Patients with a non-infectious disease ( and ImmunoDx test was wrongly taken)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Samples from patients who had one or more of the following criteria will be excluded
             from the study:

          -  Another infection episode during the last 3 weeks before sampling

          -  Congenital immune deficiency (CID)

          -  A proven or suspected HIV-1, HBV, HCV infection

          -  Active hematological malignancy

          -  Current treatment with immune-suppressive or immune-modulating therapies including
             without limitations:

          -  Use of high dose steroids &gt;1 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent in the last two weeks

          -  Monoclonal antibody administration

          -  Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

          -  Other illnesses that affect life expectancy and/or quality of life
