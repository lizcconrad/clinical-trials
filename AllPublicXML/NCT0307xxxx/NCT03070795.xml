  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      study compares the outcomes of feeding mothers early (4 hours ) after cesarean section
      compared to delayed feeding (on post operation day 1) in terms of gastrointestinal function
      and maternal satisfaction with the feeding schedule.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      patients who are scheduled to undergo elective cesarean section are randomised to two groups,
      one group will be allowed to feed 4 hours after cesarean section while the other group will
      be fed traditionally by feeding on the first post op day. gastrointestinal signs and symptoms
      will be measured such as post operative ileus, vomiting, nausea, abdminal distension. other
      parameters to be measured include time to ambulate out of bed after surgery, time to start
      breastfeeding after surgery. satisfaction with both feeding regimes will be assessed after
      surgery and the incedence of wound infecion will be compared between the two groups after two
      weeks durung the post natal review.
