      Multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical study with

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multinational, randomized, 3-arm, double-blind, phase II clinical
      study with 2400mg Mesalamine, 1200mg Mesalamine or placebo in LS patients for a 2-year
      treatment. 540 tumor free carriers of a known genetic mutation in a major MMR gene (including
      patients in which the polyps are endoscopically removed) will be randomized 1:1:1 (180 each)
      to receive 2400mg Mesalamine, 1200mg Mesalamine or placebo. Patients will be identified
      through local or national registries and through collaboration with sites. Tumor free
      patients, assessed by white light high resolution colonoscopy, will be randomized to the
      study. A serum and stool sample will be taken to identify for Mesalamine compliance and
      potential biomarkers. Biopsies of the normal tissue of ascending colon and rectum will be
      taken at the first and the last colonoscopy.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of regular treatment with Mesalamine on the
      occurrence of colonic neoplasia, tumor multiplicity (the number of detected
      adenomas/carcinomas) and tumor progression in LS patients.

      A 50% reduction of the occurrence of neoplasia in Mesalamine-treated patients is expected.
      Tumor multiplicity and tumor progression (severity of the neoplastic lesions) will be
      investigated.
