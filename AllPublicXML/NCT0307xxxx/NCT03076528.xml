  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among patients with diabetes 35% suffer from chronic renal disease and may require dialysis
      or kidney replacement over time. Furthermore, in diabetics with end stage renal disease
      (ESRD) that require dialysis, the risk of foot complications and amputation is even more
      common, expensive, and devastating. Interestingly, even though incidence of foot ulcers in
      patients with dialysis has been reported to be same as with patients with history of foot
      ulcers; dialysis patients have significantly higher rate of foot amputation.

      The goal of this research is to incorporate an innovative virtually supervised non-weight
      bearing exercise in patients undergoing dialysis to reduce risk of fall and foot ulceration
      by enhancing lower extremity blood flow, joint perception and joint mobility.

      Diabetic patients on hemodialysis at Hamad Medical Company will be recruited and will be
      randomized to either intervention (IG) or control (CG) group and followed for 6 months. The
      intervention group will take part in a 4-week non-weight bearing exercise program twice per
      week at the hemodialysis clinic under the supervision of a qualified research staff member.
      This intervention includes interactive game-based exercises including repetitive ankle and
      foot movements. Wearable sensors will provide real-time visual/auditory feedback from foot
      and ankle position and allowed perception of motor-errors during each motor-action. The
      control group will be instructed to complete a supervised foot and ankle exercise without
      using sensor technology. Changes in balance, gait, and physical activity, incidence of foot
      problems will be compared pre- and post-intervention. In addition, the incident of falls,
      foot ulcers, and limb amputation up to 6 months post intervention will be documented.
      Investigators hypothesize that patients receiving sensor-based exercises will benefit more
      compared to group receiving conventional non-technology training in terms of improving
      functional performance and reducing incidence of foot problems, falls, and limb amputation.
