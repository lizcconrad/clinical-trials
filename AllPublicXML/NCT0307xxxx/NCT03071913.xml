    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies blood brain barrier differences in patients with brain
      tumors undergoing surgery. Studying samples of tissue and blood from patients with brain
      tumors in the laboratory may help doctors to understand how well drugs get into different
      parts of a brain tumor. This may help them to determine which types of drugs may be best for
      treating brain tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the heterogeneity of blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability by assessing drug
      distribution in a population of patients with central nervous system (CNS) malignancy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish correlation of BBB permeability with radiographic appearance for study patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To utilize tumor samples to investigate mechanisms for BBB heterogeneity.

      OUTLINE:

      As part of pre-operative standard of care, patients receive levetiracetam by injection and
      cefazolin by injection. Patients are also offered lorazepam in the pre-operative area. At the
      time of surgery, patients undergo approximately 2 tissue biopsies from 3-4 tumor locations.
      This tissue is removed as part of the planned surgery, but it is also tested for research
      purposes. During surgery, a blood sample is collected every 20-30 minutes beginning at the
      time of skin incision until all of the research tumor samples have been removed. A minimum of
      3 blood samples are collected up to a maximum of 12.

    <time_frame>Blood samples taken approximately 20-30 minute intervals during surgery, Tissue sample taken one time during surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio of cefazolin and levetiracetam (or lorazepam) and gadolinium in blood taken every 20-30 minutes during surgery will be correlated with the tissue samples. Inter- and intra-subject variability over all patients will be estimated, within specific imaging features between patients, and within open biopsy specimens.</description>

          -  Clinical and radiographic evidence suggesting CNS malignancy

          -  Suspected newly diagnosed, local, or intracranial recurrence of primary brain tumor OR
             previously untreated or treated brain metastasis

          -  Willing to undergo a neurosurgical resection of CNS lesion at Mayo Clinic Rochester

          -  Able to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging with gadolinium contrast (e.g.
             no cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, renal failure)

          -  Provide written informed consent

          -  Willing to provide tissue and blood samples for research purposes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vulnerable populations: pregnant women, prisoners, mentally handicapped

          -  Unable to undergo a biopsy of CNS lesion

          -  Documented drug allergy to cefazolin or levetiracetam, or other contraindication to
             use these drugs in the pre-operative setting (e.g., patient is already on another
             anti-seizure medication which precludes the clinical indication for pre-operative
             levetiracetam)
