      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of domestic recombinant human
      follicle stimulating hormone (rhFSH) stimulating ovarian to promote follicular development
      before assisted reproductive technology, which was non-inferiority than that of the imported
      rhFSH.
