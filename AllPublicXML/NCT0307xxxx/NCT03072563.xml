  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cerebro-placental ratio (CPR) is a tool for assessment of fetal wellbeing in the
      management of the growth restricted fetus. CPR is the ratio of the fetal middle cerebral
      artery pulsatility index (PI) to the umbilical artery PI. In Gestational Diabetes (GDM), the
      common finding is of accelerated and asymmetric fetal growth. Pregnancies complicated by GDM
      have an increased risk of certain complications such as preeclampsia, intrauterine demise, CS
      due to fetal distress. These complications have a well known association with fetal growth
      restriction leading to the hypothesis that there exists a subset of diabetic fetuses that
      exhibit a growth restriction phenotype despite not being small for gestational age (&lt;10%).The
      objective of this study is to examine whether the CPR can identify GDM fetuses that are not
      growth restricted but are at increased risk of certain adverse neonatal outcomes. Women with
      singleton pregnancies and a diagnosis of GDM at 24 weeks of gestation and beyond will be
      included. Exclusion criteria are Pre-gestational diabetes, hypertensive disease of pregnancy
      at time of recruitment, fetus with a known major anomaly, fetal EFW &lt; 10%(IUGR). Women who
      consent to the study will have a blinded Doppler assessment of CPR. Clinicians will be
      blinded to these Doppler measurements (unless they are indicated clinically for another
      reason (suspected fetal anemia or IUGR development- and the results will be unblinded and
      reported to the clinicians). Obstetric and neonatal outcomes will be collected prospctively
      via the local BORN database and the patient chart. Local BORN is needed for the registered
      outcomes. Newborns will be divided post-hoc into two groups: A) last CPR &lt;10% B) Last CPR &gt;
      10%. The primary outcome will be a composite outcome consisting of one or more of the
      following: Caesarean section due to suspected fetal distress, 5 minute Apgar &lt;7, Cord
      arterial PH &lt; 7, HIE, NICU admission &gt;24 hours.
