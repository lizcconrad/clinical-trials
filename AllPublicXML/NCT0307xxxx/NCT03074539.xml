  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence for a high prevalence of Sleep Disorder Breathing (SDB) in patients with
      Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). Central Sleep Apnea, Cheyne-Stokes
      Breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea appear to occur in CTEPH. However, there is no
      information on the impact of CTEPH treatment modalities on concomitant SDB. Furthermore, the
      use of PAP therapy in CTEPH has not yet been investigated. CTEPH is a rare and serious
      disease and there may be a bidirectional association of SDB and CTEPH.

      This study plans to investigate the prevalence of SDB in CTEPH and compare it to datasets of
      large epidemiological studies on SDB. Furthermore, the impact of CTEPH treatment on SDB will
      be analyzed and CTEPH patients for possible PAP treatment will be defined.

    <description>CTEPH treatment via PEA. This arm includes patients who will receive Pulmonary Endarteriectomy (PEA) according to local CTEPH board recommendation. A standardized polygraphy will be conducted before the PEA - intervention, to obtain information concerning Sleep Disorder Breathing. 6 months after the PEA surgery another polygraphy will be accomplished and the results compared with the first polygraphy and the other arms.
If Sleep Disorder Breathing remains, a personalized recommendation on further specific therapy (e.g. nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ventilation) will be made.</description>

    <description>CTEPH treatment via BPA. Patients who are suitable for Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty (BPA) according to the recommendation of the local CTEPH board (e.g. patients not suitable for Pulmonary Endarteriectomy). A standardized polygraphy will be conducted before the first BPA intervention, to gain information about possible sleep-disordered breathing. 6 months after the first BPA intervention another polygraphy will be accomplished and the results compared with the first polygraphy and the other arms.
If Sleep Disorder Breathing remains, a personalized recommendation on further specific therapy (e.g. nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ventilation) will be made.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>CTEPH treatment via Medical Treatment. Patients who are inoperable (not suitable for Pulmonary Endarteriectomy) and not eligible for BPA according to the recommendation of the local CTEPH board will get medical treatment with Riociguat. The treatment will be assigned according to the currently valid guidelines (2015 European Respiratory Society / European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension). A standardized polygraphy will be conducted before the medical treatment starts, another polygraphy will be conducted after 6 months of treatment if Riociguat. The results will be compared with the first polygraphy and the other arms.
If Sleep Disorder Breathing remains, a personalized recommendation on further specific therapy (e.g. nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure ventilation) will be made.</description>
