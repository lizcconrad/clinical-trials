  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational retrospective study. The primary objective is to investigate the
      expression and potential prognostic role of Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor
      samples from 350 patients with early stage treatment-naive non-small-cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Tissue samples were embedded in a tissue microarray. PD-L1 will be studied by
      immunohistochemistry using the SP263 antibody. Stained samples will be evaluated
      independently by two operators. A tumor will be defined as positive when = or &gt;50% of tumor
      cells express the ligand.

      The investigators will investigate the relationship between PD-L1 protein expression and
      overall survival and other clinical characteristics with appropriate statistical methods.
