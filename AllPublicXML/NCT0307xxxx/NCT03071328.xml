      The purpose of this study is to plan for future clinical trials in patients with Metastatic
      Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). Diluted iodinated contrast will be injected
      intra-tumorally under CT fluoroscopy guidance into bone, lymph node, and liver metastases in
      subjects with mCRPC, and pre and post-injection CT images will be obtained to determine the
      injection parameters needed for optimal distribution throughout metastases of a given size. A
      biopsy of the metastatic site will also be obtained to validate the expression of CD155 in
      prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Small cell or
             neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate are also permitted.

          2. Radiographic evidence of at least one bone, lymph node, or liver metastasis, that is
             amenable to iodinated contrast injection, as judged by the study radiologist

          3. Adequate laboratory values:

               1. Platelets ≥ 100,000

               2. INR ≤ 1.3

          4. Age &gt; 18 years.

          5. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of intercurrent or past medical or psychiatric illness that would make
             participation in a research biopsy protocol difficult or not feasible at the
             discretion of the principal investigator or co-investigator(s).

          2. Cr &gt;2.0

          3. History of iodinated contrast allergy

          4. For patients undergoing research only biopsy: Requirement for anticoagulation with
             heparin, low molecular weight heparin, clopidogrel, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban,
             warfarin, Aggrenox, fondaparux, ticagrelor, etc (aspirin and other NSAIDs are ok but
             should be held prior to biopsy in accordance with institutional standard of care)

          5. Any other contraindication to CT with iodinated contrast, as CT with contrast will be
             used in the study.
