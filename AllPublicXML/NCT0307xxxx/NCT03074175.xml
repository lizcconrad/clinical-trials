  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that causes the highest morbidity and mortality, and the
      main pathological type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most of them present with
      advanced stage at diagnosis. Radiotherapy is an important treatment strategy for advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer. However patients have different responses to radiotherapy due to
      individual differences, thus there is still lacking of sensitive markers to predict treatment
      response at present. Using bioinformatics to process the data and small sample clinical
      trial, our previous study found 5 plasma miRNAs were related to radiosensitivity. The design
      is controlled clinical trial. According to the size of lung lesions, the investigators
      divided the patients into hyperfractionated radiotherapy group（50Gy/11F/2W) with lesion ≤5cm
      in diameter and conventional fractionated radiotherapy group（60Gy/30F/6W）with lesion &gt;5cm in
      diameter.

    <description>Based on the WHO evaluation criteria for the therapeutic effect of solid tumors, the evaluation of the therapeutic effect was divided into complete remission (CR),partial remission (PR), no change (NC) and progression of disease (PD). The CR + PR meant objective response rate (ORR).</description>

    <description>Plasma samples were collected in patients with NSCLC before radiotherapy. qRT- PCR was used to detect miRNAs expression in these plasma samples. The correlation between expression of miRNAs and radiotherapy in patients was analyzed and the value of best cut-off miRNA was calculated though receiver operating characteristic (ROC).</description>
