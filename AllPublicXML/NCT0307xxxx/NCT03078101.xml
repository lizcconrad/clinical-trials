    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective, clinical pilot study in CKD patients to show whether
      Empagliflozin in addition to ACEi treatment significantly increases Ang 1-7 levels compared
      to ACEi treatment alone.

      Null and alternative hypotheses:

      H0: Empagliflozin in addition to ACEi treatment does not increase Ang 1-7 levels more than
      ACEi treatment alone.

      H1: Empagliflozin in addition to ACEi treatment significantly increases Ang 1-7 levels
      compared to ACEi treatment alone

      Methodology:

      Two groups of 24 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, respectively, with and without type 2
      diabetes will be randomized into the study medication or placebo group. The number of
      patients per treatment arms is n = 12. Included and consented patients will be subjected to
      an initial 2-week run-in period for conversion of current RAS blocking medications to ACEi
      therapy with enalapril or ramipril and respective dose titration to 10 mg enalapril 2 x daily
      and 10 mg ramipril 1 x daily. Additional antihypertensive medication will be standardized as
      feasible, with the primary goal of keeping blood pressure as recommended by KDIGO. Following
      the 2-week run-in phase, all study patients will be subjected to blood collection including
      the first RAS quantification (RAS Fingerprint) and assessment of HDL composition, as well as
      urinary analysis and bioimpedance fluid status assessment (BCM measurement). Subsequently,
      patients will be randomized to either receive empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg daily) or
      placebo. Subsequently, biweekly study visits including electrolyte and glucose (plasma and
      urine) monitoring as well as BCM measurement will take place. After 12 weeks of study
      medication intake, a concluding study visit will be scheduled for final RAS quantification
      (RAS Fingerprint) and HDL analyses as well as final blood and urinary analysis and BCM
      measurement. Initially, blood and urine will be collected at the clinical visit as part of
      the routine blood obtainment (no additional effort on patients). From these routine
      measurements we will be able to extract information regarding the patient's current CKD stage
      as well as other relevant laboratory parameters (e.g. HbA1c, UACR, etc.). Furthermore, we
      will document the patient's current medication and significant comorbidities.

      Primary analysis variable/endpoint:

      The difference of Ang 1-7 increase from baseline between a 3-month treatment with
      empagliflozin on top of ACEi treatment compared to ACEi treatment alone

      Most important secondary analysis variables/endpoints:

        1. Simultaneous quantitative changes of multiple RAS effector angiotensin levels determined
           by mass-spectrometry

        2. Recurrence of Ang II levels determined by mass-spectrometry

        3. HDL parameters (protein composition of HDL)

        4. Renal parameters (albuminuria reduction measured by urinary albumin-creatinine ratio
           (UACR), renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), serum-creatinine)

        5. Urinary electrolyte levels

        6. Urinary glucose levels

        7. Urinary RAS metabolites (angiotensinogen, ACE and ACE2 levels, ACE2 activity)

        8. Blood pressure determined by ambulatory blood pressure measurements

        9. Body volume determined by bioimpedance fluid status assessment (BCM measurement)

       10. OCR and ECAR in PBMCs determined by Seahorse Flux Analyzer

       11. Assessment of reduction of salt sensitivity by using salt sensitivity test with
           empagliflozin
