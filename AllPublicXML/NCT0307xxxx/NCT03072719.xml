      A randomised, examiner blind, two treatment arm, stratified, parallel design, single-site
      study in subjects with at least two sensitive teeth to compare the efficacy of a test
      dentifrice against that of a control dentifrice in reducing dentinal hypersensitivity.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff sensitivity score was assessed by examiner as participant's response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of each individual tooth. Response of participant was scored using Schiff sensitivity scale range of 0-3; 0=Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1=Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score indicates improvement in sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile (Yeaple) Pain Threshold on Post First Brushing (After 5 Minutes), Day 3 and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post first brushing (after 5 minutes), Day 3 and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Tactile threshold was assessed by examiner using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe) which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied at which participant do not report any pain or discomfort. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 14</title>
        <description>Schiff sensitivity score was assessed by examiner as participant’s response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of each individual tooth. Response of participant was scored using Schiff sensitivity scale range of 0-3; 0=Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1=Participant responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score indicates improvement in sensitivity.</description>

        <population>Analysis for this outcome was conducted on intent-to-treat (ITT) population which included all randomized participants who had at least one post baseline assessment of efficacy. n is the number of participants evaluated at specific time point for treatment arms respectively.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile (Yeaple) Pain Threshold on Post First Brushing (After 5 Minutes), Day 3 and Day 14</title>
        <description>Tactile threshold was assessed by examiner using a constant pressure probe (Yeaple probe) which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface from 10 g to an upper threshold of 80g in increments of 10 g. The tactile threshold is the maximum pressure applied at which participant do not report any pain or discomfort. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth.</description>
