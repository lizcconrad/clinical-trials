      A randomized, double-blinded controlled trial was conducted from September 2015 to September
      2016 in Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Thailand. Sixty
      patients who underwent craniotomy with insertion of skull pin were randomly allocated into
      group A and B. After patients entered the operative room, blood pressure and heart rate were
      measured (T1) then repeated measurement again (T2) when started induction, intubation and
      infusion dexmedetomidine 1 µg/kg over 10 min infusion in group A whereas group B received
      normal saline. At 3 minutes before skull pin insertion (T3), patient in group B received a
      single bolus of fentanyl 1 µg/kg whereas group A received normal saline. Then hemodynamic
      responses were recorded and repeated again at one minute before skull pin insertion (T4).
      Blood pressure and heart rate were observed at the time of skull pin insertion (T5) then
      repeated every 1 minutes after skull pin application until 5 minutes (T6 - T10).

    <masking_description>After written informed consents were obtained, all participant was blinded from the study drug. The study drugs (dexmedetomidine and fentanyl) were prepared by anesthetist nurse who not involved in the study. Dexmedetomidine was labeled with group A whereas fentanyl was labeled with group B. The study drug was administrated by the blinded anesthiologist. Blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were recorded by same blinded anesthesiologist</masking_description>
