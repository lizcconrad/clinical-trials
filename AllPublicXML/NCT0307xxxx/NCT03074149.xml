      To gain further insight on the characteristics, management, disease progression and the
      outcomes of patients with IPF, as diagnosed and treated under real-world, clinical practice
      conditions in Greece. More specifically, this registry will be used to: Provide a
      comprehensive clinical picture of IPF, Track access to health care and cost of caring for IPF
      patients over time, Examine the implementation of treatment guidelines used on patients
      diagnosed with IPF, according to the existing diagnosis guidelines, Characterization of
      patients on different treatments. To provide information regarding survival and mortality
      causes, IPF exacerbations as well as IPF patient co-morbidities including myocardial
      infarction, CNS infarction, other arterial thromboembolic events, deep vein thrombosis,
      hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation and pulmonary hypertension. Data regarding IPF
      patient hospitalization will be collected and evaluated with regards to potential respiratory
      causes, and there will be documentation of treatment patterns and economic aspects. Patients
      will be followed up for 2 years and information regarding IPF treatment changes since the
      last visit will be collected.

      Purpose: To gain further knowledge on the characteristics, management, progression and
      outcomes of patients with IPF as treated under real-world, clinical practice conditions in
      Greece

      Study Design:

      National, multi-center, observational disease registry based on new data from a significant
      sample size of IPF patients in Greece. Patients will be followed up for 2 years and
      information will be collected during this time period. This is a non-interventional study and
      primary data collected during study visits will be used
