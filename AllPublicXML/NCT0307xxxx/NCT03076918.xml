  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy and tolerance of a new device (FLEXITHERALIGHT) for
      photodynamic therapy in the treatment of keratosis actinic in comparison of classical PDT
      with Aktilite®.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an intraindividual comparison of two methods. The number of subjects to be
      enrolled is 47 patients. All participants will receive both two treatments in a single visit
      : a first period of 2.5 hours of illumination with FLEXITHERALIGHT device followed by a
      continuous red light Spectrum (between 7 and 10 minutes) with Aktilite® after an appropriate
      incubation of methyl aminolevulinate).

      Patients will complete a pain assessment scale after receiving both treatments, then, 3
      follow up visits will be scheduled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of minimum 10 previously untreated not pigmented,
             non-hyperkeratotic AK lesions of Grade I and II of the forehead and/or scalp
             (according to Olsen et Al. JAAD 1991, cf. REF 31) where other therapies are
             unacceptable or considered medically less appropriate with a symmetrical repartition
             on both side of the forehead and/or scalp. The diagnosis of AK will be determined upon
             clinical evaluation (i.e. visual inspection and palpation) by the investigator.

          -  Symmetrical areas in terms of number and severity of lesions. The axis of symmetry
             between the two areas will be defined by the investigator according to the
             distribution of lesions.

          -  The two areas to be treated should not be coalescing. A minimum distance of 10mm is
             required between the lesions located on the 2 symmetrical areas. A minimum distance of
             2 mm is required between the lesions on the same side.

          -  Minimum 5 lesions with similar dimensions at both symmetrical areas will be treated.
             If the number of lesions is &gt;7, only 7 lesions on each side will be considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with porphyria.

          -  Patients immunosuppressed for idiopathic, disease specific or therapeutic reasons.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids to lesional areas within 2 weeks before PDT.

          -  Patients receiving local treatment (including cryotherapy and curettage, any -
             Patients receiving topical treatment (including imiquimod, 5-FU and diclofenac,
             Picato) in face / scalp area within the last 3 months.

          -  Use of topical retinoids or alpha-hydroxy acids, urea or systemic retinoids,
             chemotherapy or immunotherapy within 4 weeks of PDT.

          -  Pigmented AK lesion(s).

          -  Known allergy to Metvixia, a similar PDT compound or excipients of the cream including
             arachis oil, or to peanut or soya.

          -  Participation in other clinical studies either currently or within the last 30 days.

          -  Female subjects must be of either:

        Non-childbearing potential, i.e. post-menopausal or have a confirmed clinical history of
        sterility (e.g. the subject is without a uterus) or, Childbearing potential, provided there
        is a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test prior to study treatment, to rule out
        pregnancy.

          -  Any condition which may be associated with a risk of poor protocol compliance.

          -  Patients currently receiving regular ultraviolet radiation therapy
