  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AGT-181 is a fusion protein containing alpha-L-iduronidase that is intended to deliver the
      enzyme peripherally and to the brain, when administered intravenously.

      This is a long term safety and tolerability study of AGT-181 in patients with MPS I who
      completed the previous 26-week study, AGT-181-101. Information on the biological activity of
      the investigational drug will also be collected.
