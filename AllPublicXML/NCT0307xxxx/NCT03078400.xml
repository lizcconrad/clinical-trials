    <textblock>
      Up to 18 women with ovarian cancer will administer up to two injections of SPL-108 daily in
      combination with weekly doses of Paclitaxel. They will be monitored for safety and efficacy
      for up to 6 months, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      This is an open-label 2-arm trial. Eligible subjects will be screened and enrolled
      sequentially into 1 of 2 Arms:

      Arm I: N=6 to 12 subjects, Safety Phase

        -  Cohort 1 SPL-108 x 1 injection daily + 80 mg/m2 PTX weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28
           day cycles

        -  Cohort 2 SPL-108 BID + 80 mg/m2 PTX weekly on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 28 day cycles

      For Arm I, at least 1 week will elapse between Dose 1 for each subject.

      In Cohort 1, 3 subjects will be enrolled: if 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs, 3
      subjects will be added at this dose level; if 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs occur, Cohort 2 will initiate
      enrolling subjects; if 2 or more DLTs occur at this dose level, subjects will not be enrolled
      in Cohort 2 and the trial will be terminated.

      In Cohort 2, 3 subjects will be enrolled: if 1 DLT occurs, 3 subjects will be added at this
      dose level; if 0/3 or 1/6 DLTs occur, Arm II will initiate enrolling subjects at the SPL-108
      BID dose; if 2 or more DLTs occur, Arm II will initiate enrolling subjects at the SPL-108
      dose one time each day.

      Arm II: N=up to 12, Exploratory Expansion Phase

      • Cohort 3: SPL-108 daily dose (to be determined in Arm I) + 80 mg/m2 PTX weekly on Days 1,
      8, and 15 in 28 day cycles.

      A Safety Committee will meet at the end of each Arm I Cohort as well as periodically to
      review safety data and make recommendations for trial progression. The primary efficacy
      outcome, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Committee (RECIST 1.1) criteria, will
      be assessed on Day 15 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6.

          5. Abnormal clinical laboratory values within 14 days prior to initiation of dosing, as
             indicated by:

               -  Hemoglobin level &lt;9.0 gm/L

               -  Platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3

                  liver is known to be involved with tumor)

          6. Contraindication to the use of PTX

          7. Pregnancy or breast-feeding at time of Screening and throughout the study.

          8. Active, uncontrolled infection

          9. Participation in another investigational drug trial concurrently or within 30 days of
             Cycle 1 Day 1, or a vaccine trial within 90 days of Cycle 1 Day 1

         10. Significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness that, in the judgment of
