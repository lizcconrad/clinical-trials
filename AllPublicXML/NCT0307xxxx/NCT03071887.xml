    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to refine and pilot the Relaxation Response Resiliency (3RP)
      intervention for women age 50 and over who are living with HIV, a group especially burdened
      by stressors related both to aging and living with chronic disease. The investigators will
      adapt the 3RP resiliency intervention to the needs of this population and conduct preliminary
      testing of the group intervention via an open pilot study.

      Overview.

      Participants will be HIV-infected women (N=up to 40) age 50 or over. Women will be recruited
      from the Boston area. Based on the investigators' qualitative work, the investigators will
      deliver an adapted version of the 3RP resiliency intervention to groups of 5-8 HIV-infected
      women age 50 and over. The 3RP intervention will consist of 8-10 weekly sessions of 90
      minutes each focused on skills training to build and enhance resilience. The investigators
      will conduct baseline and post-treatment quantitative assessments, in addition to individual
      exit interviews to solicit feedback on the intervention. These data will be used to inform
      the design of a future randomized pilot study.

      Study procedures.

      Participants (N = up to 40) will be HIV-infected women age 50 or over . Participants will be
      recruited via study flyers (posted in the infectious disease clinics at local hospitals and
      in the waiting areas of Boston area community organizations) and provider referral. Once an
      individual expresses interest in the study, a research assistant will screen that individual
      to assess study eligibility criteria. Individuals who meet inclusion criteria will be invited
      to sign informed consent and complete an in-person baseline assessment. Participants will
      then complete the intervention (described below), a post-treatment assessment, and an
      individual in-depth exit interview to provide feedback on their experience in the study.

      3RP Intervention:

      Once enrolled in the study, participants will complete weekly group sessions of the 3RP
      intervention. Sessions will focus on developing an understanding of stress sources and
      physiology, and on developing a regular practice of eliciting the relaxation response (RR)
      and learning cognitive behavioral and positive psychology skills to enhance resiliency to
      long-term stress. Participants will be encouraged to practice skills (RR practice, thoughts
      records to learn adaptive thinking) between group sessions.

    <description>The 3RP blends stress management principles, cognitive behavioral therapy, and positive psychology. The 3RP focuses on 3 major areas: (1) eliciting the relaxation response; (2) increasing stress awareness; and (3) promoting adaptive strategies. The 3RP intervention currently consists of eight, 90-minute weekly group sessions. The investigators plan to adapt the intervention to address common concerns for older, HIV-infected women, including: stress of managing a chronic long-term, life threatening illness; additional medical comorbidities; pain and fatigue; stigma and social isolation; depression and anxiety; and sexuality concerns.</description>
