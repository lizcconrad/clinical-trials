  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diarrhoea continues to be a major cause of child deaths. Current treatment of acute watery
      diarrhoea includes oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc and continued feeding. The use of
      zinc is based on a number of studies that showed that zinc reduces the duration and severity
      of diarrhoea. The recommended dose of zinc in 6-59 month old children is 20mg/day for 10-14
      days. This dose is associated with an increased risk of vomiting. No dosing studies are
      available to determine the optimal dose of zinc, which while maintaining the benefits also
      has a low risk of vomiting.

      The investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial of three doses of
      zinc (20mg/day, 10mg/day and 5mg/day) in two settings - one in Sub-Saharan Africa and the
      other in South Asia. The study population will be 4500 children with diarrhoea of less than
      72 hours duration who are aged 6-59 months. They will be recruited from outpatient health
      facilities. All enrolled children will receive ORS and continued feeding as recommended by
      the World Health Organization. Those allocated to the standard zinc dose will receive an oral
      dispersible tablet with 20mg zinc daily for 14 days. Those allocated to lower dose zinc will
      receive identical tablets with either 10mg or 5mg zinc daily for 14 days. Enrolled children
      will be followed by until recovery from diarrhoea or 15 days after enrolment, whichever is
      later. In addition, study children will be assessed again at thirty (30), forty-five (45),
      and sixty (60) days to estimate impact on post illness outcomes. Primary outcomes will be
      mean duration of diarrhoea, proportion of episodes that last longer than 5 days, mean number
      of stools and proportion of children with vomiting.

Randomization and tablet package labelling was done in Geneva, and no-one at the trial sites knows the actual zinc content of tablets packaged for each participant number.</masking_description>
