  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 10 years
      following surgery for a cohort of Mobi-C subjects treated on the IDE/Post Approval studies
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, consecutive cohort study. Subjects invited to
      participate in this study will have completed the Mobi-C IDE study (G050212). In this study,
      five hundred and seventy-five subjects were randomized to either the Mobi-C prosthesis or the
      control treatment - conventional anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with anterior
      cervical plating. The study was randomized in a 2 to 1 ratio (two Mobi-C subjects for every
      one subject receiving ACDF with anterior cervical plate). The subject retention rate for
      Mobi-C subjects was 80.1% (1 level)-84.4% (2 level) at 7 years.

      As non-inferiority (1-level) and superiority (2-level) have been well established through 7
      years, the design of this study will focus on the long-term outcomes of a cohort of the
      Mobi-C arm of the study and evaluate the durability of outcomes at 10 years. Study sites
      invited to participate will be those that enrolled at least 10 subjects, and also had the
      highest retention rates at 7 years (≥70%). All subjects at these sites will be contacted to
      participate in an additional 10 year follow up visit. It is estimated that up to 250 subjects
      will be enrolled at 9-12 study sites.

      Certain endpoints are better assessed in comparison to the control ACDF arm, such as adjacent
      segment degeneration and subsequent surgery. This study has been amended to include a subset
      of sites that will also enroll control subjects. Up to 3 sites and 50 subjects will be
      included in this control cohort.
