  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a pair of immunotherapies as a possible treatment for
      malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Durvalumab

        -  Tremelimumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab or tremelimumab
      as a treatment for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying if the study drug can help your cancer
      compared to the usual approach to treating malignant pleural mesothelioma . Durvalumab is a
      drug that blocks a protein often produced by cancer cells or surrounding cells to suppress
      immune cells from attacking cancer cells. Tremelimumab blocks a receptor on immune cells that
      normally suppresses immune attack. These two study drugs have been used alone for
      mesothelioma but the combination has not yet been tested for mesothelioma. These two drugs
      have been used for cancers such as melanoma and have been effective than using either drug
      alone.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any study-specific procedures not
             considered part of routine medical care

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable or medically inoperable
             malignant pleural mesothelioma

          -  Disease progression after treatment with at least one line of chemotherapy that
             included a first-line platinum agent in combination with an anti-folate

          -  Participants must have measurable disease according to modified RECIST for pleural
             malignant mesothelioma. (Bone metastases are not considered measurable.) Prior
             radiation to the only site of measurable disease will make the participant ineligible
             unless the lesion has been demonstrated to grow after completion of radiation therapy.

          -  Participants must be willing and able to undergo a biopsy at the start of this study
             and an on-treatment biopsy if safe and feasible.

          -  Participants must have be at least 28 days from any major surgery.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and organ and marrow function

          -  Age 18 years or older

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non
             sterilized male partner must agree to use at least one highly effective method of
             contraception from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such
             precautions for 180 days after the last dose of investigational product. Male partners
             of a female subject must also agree to use male condom plus spermicide throughout this
             period. Cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a
             responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the
             trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, occasional
             abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of
             contraception. Female patients should refrain from breastfeeding throughout this
             period.

          -  Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or
             post-menopausal (defined as greater than or equal to 12 months with no menses without
             an alternative medical cause)

          -  Non-sterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180
             days after the last dose of investigational product. Not engaging in sexual activity
             for the total duration of the trial and the drug washout period is an acceptable
             practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method
             are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male patients should refrain from sperm
             donation throughout this period. Female partners of a male subject must use a highly
             effective method of contraception throughout this period.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow

             (e.g. CT scan premedication)

          -  Subjects with medical conditions that require the chronic use of systemic
             corticosteroids. Exceptions include: inhaled, intranasal, ophthalmic, and topical
             corticosteroids, local corticosteroid injections (e.g., intra-articular injections),

             30 days of receiving durvalumab or tremelimumab

          -  Participants with a history of a second primary malignancy. Exceptions include:
             patients with a history of malignancies that were treated curatively and have not
             recurred within 5 years prior to study entry; resected basal and squamous cell
             carcinomas of the skin, and completely resected carcinoma in situ of any type.

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or investigational therapy
             within 21 days (including bevizumab) or radiotherapy within 7 days prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered

          -  Any history of a prior immune-related adverse event (irAE) at least or greater than
             grade 3 while receiving any previous immunotherapy agent.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:

          -  Subjects with known acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because tremelimumab and durvalumab have
             unknown effects on the developing fetus. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             tremelimumab or durvalumab, breastfeeding women are also excluded. Female subjects of
             child bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test obtained prior to
             trial registration.

          -  Subjects who are involved in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both
             AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).

             toxicities and heightened risk for complications.
