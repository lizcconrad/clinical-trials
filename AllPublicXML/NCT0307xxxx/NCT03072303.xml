    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about pregnancy outcomes in osteogenesis imperfecta
      (OI). Patients enrolled in the Brittle Bone Disorders (BBD) Contact Registry (CR) will be
      invited via email to participate in this study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Population: The RDCRN BBD Contact Registry helps researchers identify and recruit patients
      who are eligible for participation in future research studies. People eligible for enrollment
      in the RDCRN BBD Contact Registry include patients and parents of patients with Brittle Bone
      Disorders. All patients with BBD from the United States and around the world are encouraged
      to join.

      Survey Administration: The investigators will administer a review of pregnancy outcomes
      survey and delineate the outcomes in pregnancies complicated by varying forms of OI. Patients
      will be sent an email invitation describing the study. If the participant wants to
      participate and is eligible, she will follow the survey link in the email message, which
      directs her to an IRB-approved online consent form. A unique survey link will be generated
      for each participant and included in the survey invitation, which is a customized email
      message. This link will allow the investigators to determine who completed the survey. The
      investigators will send repeat email invitations every two months (total of 3 invitations) to
      those invitees who have not yet participated. The investigators will allow approximately 6
      months for enrollment and survey completion and expect that the study will close soon
      thereafter.

      Data: The survey data will be collected and stored at the Rare Diseases Clinical Research
      Network's Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida.
      All data collected will be sent to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) to be
      stored indefinitely.

    <description>The goal of this survey is to characterize the course and outcome of pregnancy in individuals with OI. This is a self-report survey that will review pregnancy outcomes (maternal and fetal). Measures of pregnancy outcome will include 1) length of gestation, 2) mode of delivery, 3) neonatal outcomes including birth weight and length, 4) history of back pain or hip pain and or fractures during pregnancy or postpartum 5) number of maternal hospital admissions 6) calcium and vitamin D intake, 7) neonatal complications and 8) OI status in the fetus. One survey will be completed for each gestation (pregnancy).</description>
