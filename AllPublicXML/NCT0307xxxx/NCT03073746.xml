  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are large differences in knowledge between patients and healthcare providers (i.e.
      physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and there is a strong interest on
      the part of both industry and academia to reduce the gap in knowledge between patients and
      healthcare providers. Currently, about 1 in 20 searches on Google are health related. Among
      internet users, 72% reported searching for health information, and among persons who use
      mobile phones, 31% of cell phone users and 52% of smartphone users have looked up health or
      medical information. Oftentimes, patients will search on Google or other search engines in
      order to find health conditions that explain their symptoms prior to visiting their
      healthcare provider. With the launch of Google's new health search tools for mobile devices
      (i.e. smartphones, tablets, etc.) it is important to understand how patients use these search
      platforms and what their effects are on clinical encounters. The main objective of this study
      is to understand the accuracy of differential diagnoses generated by Google searching; the
      investigators hypothesize that searching on Google using a tablet or mobile device will be
      more accurate than not using any search tool, and that the new health search experience will
      improve accuracy over the standard search platform.
