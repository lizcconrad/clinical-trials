  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tendons are essential structures for transmitting muscle forces to skeletal structures. A
      stiffer tendon will transmit muscle force faster, and then allow faster movement. Moreover,
      tendons are a living tissue and respond to mechanical forces by changing their metabolism as
      well as their structural and mechanical properties. The aim of the present study is to answer
      essential questions remaining unanswered that are necessary in order to optimize physical
      activity with ageing in humans, and thus improve quality of life in elderly. The main
      questions are: What is the minimal training intensity leading to tendon adaptations? What is
      the time-course of tendon adaptations? Does the same loading protocol lead to similar tendon
      adaptations for different tendons (Achilles vs Patellar) and does the same training program
      lead to identical tendon adaptations with age (25yrs vs 75yrs)? To answer these questions,
      tendon architecture and mechanical properties will be investigated in humans of different age
      and applying different training intensities. The kinematic of the tendon adaptations due to
      these different training characteristics will also be investigated. The training protocol
      will be applied on plantar flexors and knee extensors. MRI and ultrasound techniques as well
      as the use of ankle and knee ergometers will allow the quantification of possible
      modifications in tendon architecture and mechanical properties (tendon stiffness and Young's
      Modulus). This will be assessed in vivo, using ultrasound images to assess tendon
      displacement during an incremental maximal contraction.

      Given the aging population demographics, and the barriers that exist in this population in
      terms of exercise participation, determining the level of exercise intensity required and the
      time-course to induce tendon adaptations is of paramount importance in this population.
      Therefore the purpose of this study is to:

        1. determine whether a low intensity exercise training program (resistance 55% 1RM) affects
           tendon architecture and mechanical properties with aging,

        2. compare these effects to those of a higher intensity exercise training protocol
           (resistance 80% 1RM) with a match training work with regards to the low intensity
           exercise training group,

        3. evaluate the time course of tendon adaptations (architecture and mechanical properties)
           for the two training conditions with aging,

        4. compare the effect of an identical training protocol applied on two different muscle
           groups (triceps surae vs quadriceps muscles) on Patellar and Achilles tendon
           adaptations.

      Every subject recruited (Two groups composed of males aged between 65 and 85 years, and one
      group of young subjects (between 18 and 30 years)) will be asked to take part in a training
      program applied on the calf and quadriceps muscle groups on both legs. All subjects will be
      assessed 4 weeks before starting the intervention program (T-4w), at time zero (T0) and every
      four weeks during 12 weeks (T4w, and T8w). The investigation 4 weeks before starting the
      training program will allow using each subject as its own control. The intervention will
      involve a maximum of forty five (45) minutes training sessions 3 times per week. Subjects
      will be subjected to the same battery of baseline assessments (T-4w, and T0), during the
      training procedure (T4w, and T8w), and following the 12-weeks intervention period (T12w).

      The effect of aging and different loading interventions on Achilles and Patellar tendon will
      be investigated for the following parameters:

        -  Tendon mechanical properties (stiffness and Young's Modulus) using US technique to
           assess Achilles and Patellar tendon displacement during an incremental maximal
           contraction.

        -  Tendon architecture using MRI technique to assess Achilles and Patellar tendon
           cross-sectional area, tendon length and moment arm.

        -  Maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)

        -  Muscle architecture using MRI technique.

      Thus all these data will allow defining an optimal training intensity for physical activity
      of elderly persons.

    <description>Subjects: 20 subjects aged between 65 and 85 years
Training programs:
Frequency: 3 training sessions per week. Duration: 12 weeks. Intensity: 80% of one repetition maximum (1RM). The 1RM of the participants in each of the 3 exercises performed in the training program will be reviewed every 2 weeks during training. If 1RM increase, the training load will be adjusted accordingly.
Training exercises: A Warm‐up will first be performed on a cycle ergometer during 10min. The training intervention will then consist in performing two sets on each one of the two exercises used for Patellar tendon stress: leg extension and leg press. To stress Achilles tendon, the subjects will perform four (4) sets using a calf raise machine. The subjects will perform 4 to 8 repetitions at 80% 1RM.
All training sessions will take place under appropriate supervision in UTC for the duration of the interventions according to the study design.</description>
