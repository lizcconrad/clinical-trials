  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying two different types of radiation as treatment for brain
      metastases (tumors in the brain that spread from a cancer that originated elsewhere in the
      body)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase III clinical trial. Phase III clinical trials examine the
      safety and effectiveness of a treatment, often comparing it to another known treatment. In
      this case, the investigators are specifically looking at differences between two forms of
      radiation treatment in terms of subsequent quality of life.

      In this research study, the investigators are comparing stereotactic (focused, pinpoint)
      radiation (in which each tumor is narrowly targeted) against whole brain radiation (radiation
      targeting the entire brain) in the treatment of brain metastases. Currently whole brain
      radiation is the standard option for patients with 5-20 brain metastases. Stereotactic
      radiation is the standard option for patients with 1-4 brain metastases. Among patients with
      1-4 brain metastases, recently published studies suggest that stereotactic radiation results
      in fewer neurologic side effects than whole brain radiation. It also yields better quality of
      life in this population. It remains unknown whether stereotactic radiation improves quality
      of life in patients with 5-20 brain metastases relative to whole brain radiation. In this
      study, the investigators seek to determine which of the two methods of study treatment
      results in a better subsequent quality of life for patients with 5-20 brain metastases.
