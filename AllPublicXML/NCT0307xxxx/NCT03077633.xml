    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized control trial that will compare cervical cerclage plus vaginal
      progesterone to vaginal progesterone along in twin pregnancies complicate by a short cervix
      (&lt;/= 15.0mm) between 16w0d to 25w6d.

      A prospective Randomized Trial that will test whether treatment with cervical cerclage plus
      vaginal progesterone improves pregnancy outcomes among women with twin pregnancy at 16 0/7 to
      25 6/7 weeks of gestation who have a cervical length (CL) of 0.1 to 15.0 mm on transvaginal
      ultrasound exam, the rate of preterm birth at less than 32 weeks of gestation (PTB&lt;32 wks.)
      and the rate of adverse perinatal outcome will be lower in those treated with cervical
      cerclage plus vaginal progesterone than in those treated with vaginal progesterone alone.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Twin pregnancy (see Exclusion Criterion (a) below re: monochorionic twins)

          -  Gestational age 16 0/7 to 25 6/7 weeks at time of enrollment by best-estimated age.

          -  Cervical length 0.1 to 15.0 mm on transvaginal ultrasound examination. (Cervical
             length is taken to mean the length of the closed portion of the cervical canal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Maternal age less than 18 years

          -  Monochorionic twins (such as monochorionic-diamniotic, monochorionic-monoamniotic, or
             conjoined twins)

          -  Rupture of membranes, either twin

          -  One or both twins has no cardiac activity

          -  One or both twins has known or suspected major malformation, aneuploidy, or
             polyhydramnios

          -  Maternal congenital uterine anomaly (such as bicornuate uterus, unicornuate uterus)

          -  Pregnancy started as triplets or higher-order multifetal gestation and then reduced to
             twins, either spontaneously or via procedure

          -  Symptomatic uterine contractions, 6 or more per hour

          -  Ongoing bleeding from uterus

          -  Patient declines to consider cerclage

          -  Patient declines treatment with vaginal progesterone

          -  Allergy to progesterone or peanuts (because the vaginal progesterone formulation used
             will be a capsule of micronized progesterone in peanut oil.)

          -  Cerclage is already in place

          -  Cerclage placement is judged to be technically impossible

          -  Patient has a history of poor follow-up or poor adherence to physician recommendations

          -  Patient is planning to relocate outside the local area before the end of pregnancy
             such that delivery records will be unavailable

          -  Patient does not give consent to participate in this trial.
