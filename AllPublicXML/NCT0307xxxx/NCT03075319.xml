  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is recognized as a successful procedure for treating
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. One important factor that make the successful surgery is the
      degree of knee flexion. Providing more range of motion after TKA impact on the convenience of
      daily of life such as climbing stairs, sitting on the floor particularly in Asian cultures
      which require a lot of ground activities. Data are limited on the added benefits of
      perioperative photograph as motivation for increasing range of motion after TKA.

      Half of participants received perioperative photograph as motivation, while the other half
      did not after total knee arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants received spinal anesthesia, multimodal local anesthetic infiltration and
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) for 24 hours post surgery. The surgical techniques,
      postoperative medications and rehabilitation protocols were identical in both groups.
      Perioperative knee range of motion (ROM) were measured with long arm goniometer immediately
      after close the wound. Perioperative knee photographs in full flexion and extension positions
      were taken and were given to experimental group in the day after surgery. Postoperative knee
      ROM were recorded at day 3, 6 week, 3 month and 6 month. The outcome assessors were blinded
      to treatment groups during the study period.
