    <textblock>
      GAPcare (Geriatric Acute &amp; Post-acute Care Coordination Program for Fall Prevention) is an
      early stage investigation that surveys older adults who present to the Emergency Department
      for any illness to determine the feasibility of an Emergency Department (ED)-based
      multidisciplinary intervention for preventing recurrent falls in older adults. In this
      observational study, older adults will be approached during routine clinical care in the ED
      and asked about prior falls, prior experiences having falls treated in the inpatient and
      outpatient setting, and the investigators will solicit feedback on potential improvement to
      care in the ED setting for falls.
