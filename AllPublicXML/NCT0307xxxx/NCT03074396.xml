  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed and used the DialysisNet mobile application for physicians and
      Avatar Beans mobile application for haemodialysis patients. Patient-centred data integration
      and exchange were based on the American Society for Testing and Materials Continuity of Care
      Record standard. The investigators enrolled 10 patients and 4 physicians. Questionnaires to
      evaluate user experience and usefulness were administered before and after use.
