  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the color values of the nasal mucosa, which is easily
      assessable by a direct, non-invasive, objective photographic measurement, for the purpose of
      presenting a diagnostic objective parameter of allergic rhinitis (AR).

      All patients and controls were examined by the same 4 mm 0⁰endoscope and light source, and
      all endoscopic photographs of the septum and both inferior turbinates were taken. Adobe
      Photoshop Elements 7.0 program was used to measure the numerical values of the red-green-blue
      (RGB) color components in endoscopic photographs of the nasal mucosa on the septum and
      inferior turbinates.

      This study enrolled 73 patients with AR (Group 1) and 73 normal healthy individuals(Group 2)
      with no nasal pathologies and respiratory tract infection attending to the outpatient clinic
      of the tertiary referral center. Patient's symptoms were questioned and noted by using Lebel
      Symptom Score Scale. Clinical examination was also done to help diagnose and exclude acute
      respiratory tract infection. All of the patients had positive skin prick test results for at
      least one of the most common aeroallergens. All patients and controls were examined by the
      same 4 mm 0⁰endoscope and light source, and all endoscopic photographs of the septum and both
      inferior turbinates were taken. Each image was marked with standardized points at the
      anterior part of the nasal mucosa on both sides (2 points each right and left sides of the
      anterior septum and 2 points each anterior part of the inferior turbinates). These points
      were numbered 1 and 2 over the right inferior turbinate; 3 and 4 over the right side of the
      anterior septum; 4 and 5 over the left inferior turbinate; 6 and 7 over the left side of the
      anterior septum. Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 program was used to measure the numerical
      values of the red-green-blue color components in endoscopic photographs of the nasal mucosa
      on the septum and inferior turbinates.

    <description>Nasal mucosa colors of the groups were measured with the numerical values of the RGB color components. All endoscopic photographs of the septum and both inferior turbinates of the patients and healthy individuals were taken while the examination at the outpatient clinic for three months. Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 program automatically measures the numerical values of the RGB color components in the pointed area. Color discoloration at the nasal mucosa of allergic patients compared with the healthy individuals by using RGB measurements.</description>
