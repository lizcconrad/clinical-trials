  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this research is to create a tool that could reduce suicide rates,
      increase delivery of efficacious suicide interventions, and decrease overall costs associated
      with suicidal behaviors. With this in mind, investigators intend to: (1) develop and
      scientifically validate a relational agent for suicidal patients that delivers Collaborative
      Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), an efficacious and cost-effective
      intervention developed by David Jobes, PhD; and (2) to create an integrated software system
      (CAMS Relational Agent System; CAMS-RAS) that assists medical personnel by synthesizing the
      CAMS intervention findings into an easy-to-interpret report, providing empirically-derived
      clinical decision support; (3) enhances the patient's coping capability by including
      psychoeducational skills training modules for use during and after hospitalization; and (4)
      automates the delivery of caring contacts, an efficacious and brief suicide prevention
      intervention provided after discharge. The focus of participant recruitment will be Emergency
      Departments (EDs), often the initial point of contact and where personnel must make the
      decision whether to hospitalize or discharge the suicidal patient. Investigators will also
      conduct testing in other medical and outpatient mental health settings to ensure public
      health impact and commercial success.

      Phase I project aims include: (1) creating an advisory board to guide the development of
      CAMS-RAS; (2) iteratively design and develop relational agent (&quot;Dr. Dave&quot;) modeled after the
      gestures, expressions, and mannerisms of CAMS treatment developer, David Jobes, PhD; and (3)
      conduct feasibility tests to determine whether CAMS-RAS is acceptable, easy to use, and liked
      by target end-users: acutely suicidal patients admitted to hospital EDs, psychiatric
      inpatient units, and medical floors for treatment of injuries sustained during a suicide
      attempt; hospital medical personnel, administrators, and other stakeholders including peer
      advocates; and outpatient suicidal patients, clinicians and administrators.

    <description>A brief face-valid, self-report measure that the PI derived from the System Usability Scale and has been successfully used in previous studies. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale (1=poor; 3=good; 5=excellent). Includes open-ended questions to better understand what was most and least helpful with respect to each category and also measures users' acceptance.</description>
