  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this quality improvement study is to measure the effectiveness of surveillance
      using optimized statistical process control (SPC) methods and feedback on rates of surgical
      site infection (SSI) compared to traditional surveillance and feedback.

      The primary objective is to determine if hospital clusters randomized to receive feedback
      from optimized SPC surveillance methods collectively have lower rates of SSI compared to
      hospital clusters randomized to receiving feedback from traditional surveillance methods.
      Secondary objectives are 1) to estimate and compare the number of signals identified using
      optimized SPC methods and traditional surveillance methods; 2) to estimate and compare the
      time and effort required to investigate signals generated using optimized SPC methods and
      traditional surveillance methods; and 3) to estimate the number and proportion of
      false-positive signals identified using optimized SPC methods and traditional surveillance
      methods.

      The Early 2RIS study will be a prospective, multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial
      using stepped wedge design. The active component of the quality improvement study will be
      performed in 29 DICON hospitals over three years, from March 2017 through February 2020.
      Clusters randomized to intervention will receive feedback on increasing rates of SSI
      identified through optimized SPC methods. This intervention is expected to decrease the
      subsequent rate of SSIs by closing the feedback loop on SSI outcomes.

      Participating study hospitals will all be members of DICON, a network of 43 community
      hospitals in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Virginia that provides
      community hospitals access to consultative services from infection prevention experts, data
      analyses and benchmarking, and educational materials designed by faculty from Duke. This
      study is considered part of routine quality improvement measures and a part of previously
      established agreements between DICON and the community hospitals. Data flow and communication
      are outlined in detail in approved protocols determined to be exempt research by the DUHS
      IRB. Briefly, existing clinical data are extracted from participating hospitals' electronic
      medical record into discrete files according to DICON specifications. Then a
      de-identification process removes direct patient identifiers into a limited dataset.

      The majority of data collection will occur through methods already developed and utilized by
      study hospitals. In brief, each hospital routinely submits limited datasets to the DICON
      Surgical Surveillance Database, including the following variables: hospital, type of
      procedure, patient identifier, date of procedure, age, sex, surgeon identifier, start/stop
      times, ASA score, wound class, risk index, SSI (Yes/No), date of infection, type of SSI,
      location at diagnosis and organism. No identifiable patient or surgeon data are transmitted
      to the DICON Surgical Database. Data definitions and data collection methods are standardized
      across DICON hospitals. Following signal adjudication, additional data will be collected in a
      REDCap database to document actions and rationale.

    <description>Surgical surveillance data submitted to the DICON Surgical Database will undergo immediate analysis by optimized SPC methods. If a signal is generated, study personnel in DICON will be notified to adjudicate the signal and determine if further action is required.
Optimized SPC methods include the application of two SPC charts. The investigator determined that when either chart identifies a signal, the study will have approximately 90% sensitivity and 65% specificity to identify important increases in rates of SSI.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who undergo one of 13 targeted procedures in 29 DICON study hospitals
             will be eligible for inclusion. The 13 targeted procedures include coronary artery
             bypass graft, cardiac valve replacement, colon surgery, herniorrhapy, knee
             arthroplasty, hip arthroplasty, Cesarean section, abdominal hysterectomy, vaginal
             hysterectomy, spinal fusion, laminectomy, carotid endarterectomy, and peripheral
             venous bypass. These procedures were selected because they are frequently performed in
             community hospitals and/or are associated with particularly adverse outcomes if
             complicated by SSI. Eligible procedures will be categorized by procedure type at each
             hospital using ICD9 codes published by the NHSN, per routine DICON activities. Six
             clusters were constructed from these procedures to ensure that surgeons who perform
             similar types of procedures were grouped together to limit potential bias. These
             clusters are labeled as Spine, GI, OB/GYN, Ortho, Vascular, and Cardiac. These
             clusters are the units for randomization and analysis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  DICON hospitals that did not submit a letter of support for participating in the study
             will be excluded. Patients not undergoing one of these 13 procedure types at the 29
             study hospitals will be excluded from the analysis.
