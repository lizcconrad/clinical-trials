  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cancer diagnosis is extremely stressful, emotionally challenging, and often life-altering
      for both patients and their loved ones. Although more than one-third of patients experience
      distress, doctors are typically at a loss as to how to help patients and their families
      manage these emotional challenges. Mindfulness-based programs, including meditation, are
      offered at major medical centers in the US and have been found to help reduce stress and
      improve quality of life among cancer patients. However, these classes often require 30+ hours
      of in-person instruction over 8 weeks, which is neither practical nor feasible for patients
      undergoing chemotherapy due to side effects and scheduling conflicts.

      This study will test whether an 8-week mobile app-based mindfulness program is accepted and
      useful for patients who have recently received chemotherapy and their loved ones. It will
      also test whether it is feasible to randomize participants into three groups: intervention,
      active control (receiving progressive muscle relaxation through the same app) and a wait list
      control group (will receive the meditation intervention 8 weeks later), so that a future
      study can test whether mindfulness intervention can help reduce stress and improve quality of
      life. Because many Americans own smartphone or tablet, an app that can teach stress reduction
      techniques at home or at infusion clinics has great potential to address emotional needs that
      providers often cannot.

      The study will also include caregivers of patients who have recently received chemotherapy as
      research has shown that caregivers tend to show high levels of stress and depression and
      worse physical health compared to non-caregivers. The negative effects of caregiving are most
      pronounced in caregivers of patients with cancer. However, little support is directed to
      caregivers as most medical attention goes toward the patients. The patient-caregiver
      relationship may serve as a source of mutual support and a surrogate for community, which is
      traditionally considered to be an essential ingredient for sustaining mindfulness practices.

      If this study is successful, it will justify a larger trial to determine if use of a
      mindfulness app is effective in reducing stress and improving quality of life for cancer
      patients and caregivers. If effective, this low-cost stress reduction strategy could be
      distributed and used for all types and stages of cancer patients and their caregivers,
      anywhere, any time, helping to improve the quality of life of the many individuals affected
      by cancer.

    <measure>Change in anxiety and depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used to measure both anxiety and depression. This scale is frequently used to assess psychosocial outcomes in cancer patients. The HADS is a 14-item self-report measurement tool designed for use in medical outpatient settings to assess depression and anxiety. Each subscale is scored from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater distress; 0-7 is generally considered &quot;normal,&quot; 8-10 &quot;mild,&quot; 11-14 &quot;moderate,&quot; and 15-21 &quot;severe&quot; symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fatigue Inventory assesses the severity and impact of cancer-related fatigue, asks about current level of fatigue, average and worst level of fatigue in the past 24 hours, and extent to which fatigue interfered with various aspects of life in the past 24 hours (e.g., mood, walking ability) on a 10-point Likert scale. A global fatigue score is calculated by averaging all items (ranging from 0 to 10). A higher score represents greater severity and impact of fatigue.</description>
