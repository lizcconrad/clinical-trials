      This study will evaluate the maximum safe dose and duration of regadenoson (Lexiscan) that
      can be given to people who are having a lung transplant. Regadenoson will be given as a
      continuous IV infusion. All participants in the study will receive a regadenoson infusion
      beginning in the operating room during the lung transplant procedure. Participants will be
      assigned a certain dose of regadenoson to be given over a 12 or 24 hour period.

    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation currently is one way to treat a variety of serious diseases and
      conditions such as emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and cystic fibrosis. Ischemia Reperfusion
      Injury (IRI) is a known problem that can happen during the first few days after a lung
      transplant. IRI can cause swelling of the lungs and low levels of oxygen. The most serious
      type of IRI can cause the transplanted lung to not work properly, it can even cause death.
      While new treatments and practices have been put into place to lower the chances of IRI, it
      is still a difficult problem to overcome after a lung transplant.

      Medicines called Adenosine 2A receptors (A2AR) have been studied in animals with IRI for many
      years. Some of these studies suggest that with the use of A2AR medicines, the chance of IRI
      may be lowered or prevented. Regadenoson is an A2AR drug.
