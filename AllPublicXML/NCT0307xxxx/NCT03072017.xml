  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia can be a chronic problem that leads to significant daytime fatigue, stress and
      numerous negative health consequences including depression. Advanced Medical Electronics, in
      partnership with researchers are the University of Pennsylvania, propose developing an
      innovative, non-drug, low-risk, intervention that can be implemented on mobile devices for
      the treatment of insomnia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Sleep onset latency &gt; 30 min for at least 3 nights per week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to perform tests due to inability to communicate verbally/blindness, inability
             to write and read in English (the study questionnaires are in English and do not exist
             in validated form for other languages).

          2. Cognitive impairment; cognitively impaired patients may not be able to comply with the
             protocol).

          3. History of a diagnosed non-insomnia sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or circadian
             rhythm disorder

          4. Upper extremity motor impairment that would preclude MBAT therapy (e.g.,
             quadriplegia).
