  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ninety-six patients with diabetes will be randomly assigned to maintain standard treatment or
      participate in the Self-Care Multidisciplinary Workshop for Diabetes. The workshop consists
      of individual meetings, with a multidisciplinary team (nurse, pharmacist, nutritionist,
      physical educator and social worker) in which education and self-care topics will be
      approached aiming at the formation of knowledge and skills necessary for patient self-care.
      The workshop will be offered in 3 different modules with 2 to 4 weeks difference between
      them. The variation of glycated hemoglobin as well as aspects associated with self-care,
      adherence and treatment satisfaction will be evaluated at the study entry, 6 and 12 months
      later.

      Ninety-six patients with type 2 diabetes from our Diabetes Outpatient Clinic will be randomly
      assigned to maintain standard treatment or participate in the Self-Care Multidisciplinary
      Workshop for Diabetes. The workshop consists of 15-minute individual meetings with each
      professional of a multidisciplinary team (nurse, pharmacist, nutritionist, physical educator
      and social worker) in which education and self-care topics will be approached aiming at the
      formation of knowledge and skills necessary for patient self-care. The workshop will be
      offered in 3 different modules with 2 to 4 weeks difference between them.

      Patients will be followed for 12 months. The variation of glycated hemoglobin as well as
      aspects associated with self-care, adherence and treatment satisfaction will be evaluated at
      the study entry, 6 and 12 months later.
