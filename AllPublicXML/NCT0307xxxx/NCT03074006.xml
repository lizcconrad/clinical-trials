          5. Subjects who meet one of the following hematologic criteria within 8 weeks of
             registration (according to the IWG criteria) and as documented in prior transfusion
             logs or weekly hematology evaluations:

               -  Symptomatic anemia untransfused with hemoglobin ≤ 9.0 g/dL or with RBC
                  transfusion-dependence (i.e., ≥ 2 units/month) confirmed for a minimum of 8 weeks
                  before randomization.

               -  Platelet counts of &lt; 100 x109/L

             candidates for standard, accepted treatments.

          8. Subjects who have sufficient hepatic function, defined as bilirubin 2 times the upper
             limit of normal (ULN) and alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)

          9. Subjects who have sufficient renal function, defined as serum creatinine levels 1.5
             ULN.

         10. Subjects who have a performance status of 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale (refer to Appendix 2).

         11. Subjects who have discontinued all previous therapies for MDS or other investigational
             therapy for at least 28 days prior to study enrollment and recovered to less than

         12. Subjects who are able to swallow tablets.

         13. Subject who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans,
             laboratory tests and procedures.

         14. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of the first administration of study drug. For the purpose of this
             study, female subjects of childbearing potential are defined as all female subjects
             after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least 1 year, or are surgically
             sterile (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation).

         15. Female subjects of child bearing potential who are willing to avoid the pregnancy
             during the duration of the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study
             drug. The effects of TEW-7197 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately.

         16. Subjects with QTc interval calculated according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF =
             QT/RR0.33; RR = RR interval) of ≤ 470 ms for males and 450 ms for females on screening
             electrocardiogram (ECG).

         17. Subjects must have ejection fraction more than 50% and no clinically significant
             valvular dysfunction.

         18. Subjects must have discontinued radiotherapy at least 14 days with resolution of any
             toxicity to Grade 1 or better prior to the start of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received treatment within the last 28 days with a drug that has not
             received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          2. Subjects who have moderate or severe cardiac disease:

          3. Subjects who have the presence of cardiac disease, including a myocardial infarction
             within 6 months prior to study entry, unstable angina pectoris, New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class III/IV congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled
             hypertension.

          4. Subjects who have documented major electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities at the
             investigator's discretion (for example, symptomatic or sustained atrial or ventricular
             arrhythmias, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch blocks,
             ventricular hypertrophy, or recent myocardial infarction).

             aneurysms of the ascending aorta or aortic stress (for example, family history of
             aneurysms, Marfan-Syndrome, bicuspid aortic valve, evidence of damage to the large
             vessels of the heart documented by CT scan with contrast).

         12. Subjects with serious pre-existing medical conditions as follows:

               -  History of cardiac or aortic surgery,

               -  Hypertension that is not controlled by standard medication (to 150/90 mmHg or
