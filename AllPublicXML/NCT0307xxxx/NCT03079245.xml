    <textblock>
      To determine if 3 randomly assigned bundles of stewardship interventions would reduce overall
      and inappropriate antimicrobial use in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a pre-post
      study was performed in 4 NICUs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial stewardship can improve the safety and quality of healthcare, reduce
      antimicrobial resistance, and reduce healthcare costs. However, the optimal strategies for
      the NICU population are unknown and few studies have evaluated the impact of stewardship in
      this population. To determine if 3 randomly assigned bundles of stewardship interventions
      would reduce overall and inappropriate antimicrobial use in the NICU. The investigators
      hypothesized that the bundle using all three interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship
      strategies (education, computer decision support and prescriber audit and feedback) would
      more effectively reduce overall and inappropriate antimicrobial use compared to usual care. A
      pre-post intervention study (one baseline year without interventions - May 1, 2009 - April
      30, 2010, followed by two years of interventions - May 1, 2010 - April 30, 2012) was
      performed in 4 academically affiliated, level III NICUs. The sites were randomly assigned to
      usual care, one intervention, two interventions, or three interventions.

    <description>Education Plus was an intervention developed by the study team based on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) 12 Step Campaign to Prevent Antimicrobial Resistance in Healthcare Settings. The study team provided Education Plus quarterly to prescribers at the three sites (NICU A, B, C) randomized to this intervention. Examples of topics presented were an overview of antimicrobial stewardship principles, epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), prevention of surgical site infections, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and pharmacokinetic principles. Educational formats included didactic lectures, participation via the audience response system, case vignettes, and panel discussions.</description>

    <description>The CDS tool was an intervention developed in consultation with neonatologists and pediatric infectious disease physicians from NICU A and B. Algorithms for empiric and targeted antimicrobial therapy for common pathogens and common clinical scenarios using local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were developed. The CDS tool also provided additional components to facilitate antimicrobial prescribing, e.g., patient weight, day of life, previous culture results, antimicrobial orders, and selected laboratory results including white blood cell and platelet count, C-reactive protein, creatinine, and therapeutic drug levels. NICUs A and B also received E+</description>

    <description>The prescriber audit and feedback (PAF) intervention was developed by the study team which held focus groups with neonatologists at NICU A (the site randomized to this intervention) to determine the feedback parameters and feedback format as previously described. Neonatologists at NICU A were provided aggregated prescribing data bimonthly that described inappropriate use as described below and prolonged therapy (&gt;7 days) for culture-negative late onset sepsis. NICU A also received CDS and E+.</description>
