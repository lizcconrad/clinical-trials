  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small-scale study of the effects on microbes in the human gut of adding high-fiber
      snack foods to usual diet. The snack foods are being provided by Mondelez International, Inc.
      Eight pairs of dizygotic twins, discordant or concordant for obesity, will participate in the
      study. They will complete 3 successive experiments in which their regular diet is
      supplemented by consumption, over a 6-week period, of high-fiber snack foods. Each experiment
      will involve (i) two weeks consuming regular diet (fecal sample collected weekly); (ii) one
      week consuming one snack food per day (approximately 7 g fiber, collection of all fecal
      samples), (iii) one week consuming two snack foods per day (approximately 14 g fiber,
      collection of all fecal samples), (iv) four weeks consuming three snack foods per day
      (approximately 20 g fiber, collection of all fecal samples); and (v) two weeks consuming only
      regular diet (weekly collection of fecal sample). For each experiment, participants will also
      provide a fasting blood sample during the free diet phase at the end of the week just before
      initiation of snack consumption, and a fasting blood sample at the end of the last week of
      snack consumption. Participants will also collect one first morning urine sample weekly
      throughout the study. During week 2, participants will also collect first morning urine
      samples for 3 consecutive days. Similarly, they will collect first morning urine samples for
      the last 3 consecutive days of the last week of snack consumption. The study will test the
      effects of the different fiber-rich snacks on the composition and metabolic properties of the
      gut microbial community in lean and obese subjects.
