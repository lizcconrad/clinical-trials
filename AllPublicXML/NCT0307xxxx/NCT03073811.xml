  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will be conducted in two parts. The first part will consist of selecting
      appropriate screening and assessment tools for Veterans undergoing elective surgery and
      identifying the number of Veterans who are malnourished and at risk of malnutrition. The
      second portion of the study will be to determine if a protein-enhanced diet before and after
      surgery will improve function and postoperative outcomes and compare the results to an
      education control group.

    <textblock>
      In year 1 of the two-part research study, an observational, prospective study of 75 Veterans
      preparing for elective surgery will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be to select
      appropriate nutrition screening and assessment tools and to employ them to characterize
      malnutrition prevalence and severity and establish cut-off values associated with
      malnutrition in this population. In years 2-5 of the research two-part research study, a
      pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted. The purpose of this study will be
      evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of a perioperative protein-enhance
      intervention compared to an educational control. Veterans who are malnourished or at risk of
      being malnourished will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to either an education
      (nutritional counseling) control or high-protein perihabilitation arm. Participants in the
      high-protein perihabilitation arm will be provided with high quality protein supplements for
      two of the three meals and counseled to consume 30 grams of high quality protein for the
      third meal. The study will take place two weeks prior to an elective abdominal or GI surgery
      and will continue 4 weeks post surgery.
