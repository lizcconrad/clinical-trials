    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled, double blind exploratory study to explore the effects of two
      different potassium nitrate concentrations and water on exposed dentine in reducing dentinal
      hypersensitivity. Solutions will be applied for either 2, 5 or 10 minutes and assessed by
      visual analogue scale (VAS) scores following evaporative (air) stimulus.

    <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using a 100 millimeter (mm) VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score immediately post treatment.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to efficacy assessment phase of this study, commercially available dental materials were employed to develop a dental stent in 3 participants. The dental stent design created a reservoir capable of holding the test solution at the cervical margin of a study tooth for at least 10 minutes. There was no efficacy data for this development phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Overall</title>
          <description>There were six study treatment regimens- 5% Potassium nitrate (KNO3) 250μl applied to an individual tooth once for 2, 5 or 10 min; 2.5% KNO3 (250μl) applied to an individual tooth once for 2, 5 or 10 mins. Three reference treatment regimens were sterile water (250μl) applied to an individual tooth once for 2, 5 or 10 mins. Each participant received 9 treatment regimens over three treatment visits. Three individual teeth were treated at each treatment visit. Each treatment visit was one day in length. A washout of 4 days was given after each treatment visit. Study duration for each participant during this efficacy analysis phase was approximately 5 weeks</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Evaporative Sensitivity Pain Response of Hypersensitive Tooth on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Immediately Post Application of 5% KNO3 Solution, 2.5% KNO3 Solution and Sterile Water</title>
        <description>Response to a constant jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using a 100 millimeter (mm) VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score immediately post treatment.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Evaporative Sensitivity Pain Response of Hypersensitive Tooth on a VAS, 10 Minutes Post Application of 5% KNO3 Solution, 2.5% KNO3 Solution and Sterile Water</title>
        <description>Response to a constant (duration, pressure, temperature, distance from target) jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score at 10 minutes post treatment.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Evaporative Sensitivity Pain Response of Hypersensitive Tooth on a VAS, 20 Minute Post Application of 5% KNO3 Solution, 2.5% KNO3 Solution and Sterile Water</title>
        <description>Response to a constant (duration, pressure, temperature, distance from target) jet of air applied to a hypersensitive tooth was evaluated using a 100 mm VAS pain response scale. According to this analog scale, pain response for stimulated tooth ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (intense pain). Change from baseline in pain response was calculated using VAS score at 20 minutes post treatment.</description>
