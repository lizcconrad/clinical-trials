      The purpose of this study is to provide sildenafil therapy to subjects who have completed the
      A1481156 study for the treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) in India and are
      judged by the Investigator to derive clinical benefit from continued treatment with
      sildenafil citrate. Sildenafil citrate will be supplied for the treatment of Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension (PAH) until the subject continues to derive benefits from the
      treatment. The treating physicians (and the sponsor) will be responsible for reporting
      serious adverse events.

    <description>The recommended dose is 20 mg TID for subjects with body weight &gt; 20 kg and 10 mg TID for subjects with body weight â‰¤ 20 kg. If subject is 18 years of age or older, the recommended dose is 20 mg TID, regardless of body weight. If a subject was receiving a higher dose in study A1481156 and the investigator believes that the subject requires continued treatment on that dose, or if dose reduction is judged to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) deterioration in a particular subject, the higher dose may be made available, as judged on an individual basis on discussion with the sponsor.</description>
