  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are substantial data demonstrating increased endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and
      oxidative stress in patients with Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the
      association between serum uric acid level and endothelial dysfunction has not been elucidated
      yet in these patients. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to examine the
      relationship between the uric acid level and the ED in normotensive ADPKD patients with
      preserved renal function.
