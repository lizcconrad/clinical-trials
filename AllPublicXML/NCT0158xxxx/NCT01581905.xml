  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 600,000 women undergo hysterectomy each year in the United States, of which 12%
      are laparoscopic. The most common indications for hysterectomy are: symptomatic uterine
      leiomyomas (40.7%), endometriosis (17.7%), and prolapse (14.5%). The first total laparoscopic
      hysterectomy was performed by Reich et al in 1988. Many studies have proven that laparoscopic
      hysterectomy is associated with lower preoperative morbidity, shorter hospital stay, and
      shorter recovery times than abdominal hysterectomy. The literature has also shown the
      complication rates for laparoscopic cases are similar to open procedures in the hands of an
      experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
      Committee on Gynecologic Practice state that laparoscopic hysterectomy is an alternative to
      abdominal hysterectomy for those patients in whom vaginal hysterectomy is not indicated or
      feasible. The ACOG Committee on Gynecologic Practice site multiple advantages of laparoscopic
      hysterectomy to abdominal hysterectomy including faster recovery, shorter hospital stay, less
      blood loss, and fewer abdominal wall/wound infections. Despite the recommendations of ACOG
      for a more minimally invasive approach, 66% of all hysterectomies are performed abdominally.
      Key reasons for the lag in utilization of laparoscopic techniques are the technical obstacles
      of performing minimally invasive hysterectomies. Robotic technology has emerged as a means to
      decrease the learning curve and increase the availability of minimally invasive surgery to
      patients. A current review of the literature reveals no randomized trials evaluating the
      efficacy of conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy vs. robot-assisted laparoscopic
      hysterectomy. The investigator's aim is to address this void.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic
      Hysterectomy is equivalent to Conventional Laparoscopic Hysterectomy with respect to
      operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay. The investigator's secondary objective was to
      assess the cost, morbidity, and mortality of each procedure.
