  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the &quot;Mochudi Prevention Project&quot; is to reduce the number of new HIV infections in
      the village of Mochudi, Botswana by promoting a comprehensive package of interventions that
      have proven to be effective in preventing the spread of HIV. This antiretroviral treatment
      (ART) clinical study is nested within the Mochudi Prevention Project, and is being conducted
      in the north-east segment (NES) of the village of Mochudi. The ART intervention component of
      the Mochudi Project is designed to determine the uptake of, adherence to, and feasibility of
      3-drug combination ART as a component of a package of transmission prevention strategies. The
      hypotheses are 1) that ART (with 3 antiretrovirals from two classes of drugs) among
      participants with CD4 ≥ 250 cells/mm3 and VL ≥ 50,000 cp/mL will be acceptable and safe and
      2) Eighty percent of eligible participants will agree to start 3-drug ART.

    <description>Atripla: one tablet administered orally once daily at bedtime, each tablet comprised of co-formulated: Efavirenz (EFV) 600mg, Emtricitabine (FTC) 200mg, Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300mg(EFV/FTC/TDF). Note: the study will generally provide the fixed-dose combination Atripla, but it will also be permissible for the same drugs to be used at the same doses as individual components (or as Truvada, coformulated TDF/FTC). Other drug substitutions may be made per the protocol.</description>
