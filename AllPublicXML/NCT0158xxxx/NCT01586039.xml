  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The timing and quality of sleep is governed by environmental and physiologic factors.
      Environmental factors, especially ambient lighting can impact the circadian system and alter
      the timing and structure of sleep. Light exposure can also acutely alter neural activation
      state and impair sleep. These effects all demonstrate marked sensitivity to short-wavelength
      blue light with maximal sensitivity in the 460-480 nm range. The alerting effects of blue
      light in the evening persist for at least 3-4 hours after the lights are turned off, and can
      disturb subsequent sleep. Avoiding these deleterious effects of light exposure prior to sleep
      on subsequent sleep would be beneficial to sleep quality and potentially health.

      The investigators will compare the effects of two light sources, equated for visual stimulus
      (lux), on multiple non-visual responses to light. The investigators will compare a 90 lux
      exposure of a commercially available Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) with a novel LED white
      light source that is depleted in the short-wavelength visible range (Biological Illumination
      LCC, FL). In a within-subject design, the investigators will test the hypotheses that
      exposure as compared to a CFL 90 lux exposure 90 lux of the blue-depleted LED will cause
      significantly:

        1. Less melatonin suppression between melatonin onset and bedtime;

        2. Less subjective and objective alerting responses before bedtime;

        3. Less disruption of nocturnal sleep structure and quality.

      Specific Aim 1: to test the hypothesis that exposure to blue-depleted polychromatic light
      will cause significantly less melatonin suppression between melatonin onset and bedtime as
      compared to exposure to an equal intensity polychromatic white (non blue-depleted) light.

      Specific Aim 2: to test the hypothesis that exposure to blue-depleted polychromatic light
      will cause significantly less subjective and objective alerting responses prior to (upto
      3-hours) bedtime as compared to exposure to an equal intensity polychromatic white (non
      blue-depleted) light.

      Specific Aim 3: to test the hypothesis exposure to blue-depleted polychromatic light will
      cause significantly less disruption of nocturnal sleep structure and quality, particularly
      more Slow Wave Sleep in the first NREM-REM sleep cycle, as compared to exposure to an equal
      intensity polychromatic white (non blue-depleted) light.

      Forty (40) subjects (balanced for gender) will be studied in a 4-day inpatient time-isolation
      study. Our recruitment procedures provide all applicants with an equal opportunity to
      participate in our studies regardless of race, color, creed, or national origin. We will use
      online and print advertisements to recruit healthy men and women 18-30 years old. Each
      potential subject will undergo an extensive screening procedure prior to participation in the
      study. The procedure begins with a telephone screening with a subject recruiter, who asks a
      series of questions from a preliminary screening questionnaire and answers any questions
      potential subjects may have about the study. If the original preliminary telephone screening
      questionnaire reveals no grounds for exclusion, then potential subjects come to our office
      for consent for the screening process, an orientation, completion of screening
      questionnaires, and a physical examination. The physical examination includes blood and urine
      tests, an EKG, and a physical exam with a physician. Candidates may also be examined by a
      staff ophthalmologist/optometrist. All candidates who are excluded from study for medical
      and/or psychological reasons are so informed and are given a referral to an appropriate
      health care provider if indicated. Written informed consent for the inpatient study will be
      obtained from each subject before his/her study begins. Phone and/or email screening
      materials of potential subjects, that were not admitted to the study, will be kept for as
      long as until the study is reported closed to the IRB. The information will be stored safe in
      a locked file room. After the study is reported closed to the IRB, materials will be
      destroyed.

      The study length is divided into four segments:

      Segment I (Home Baseline) consists of at least 7 days, during which wrist activity and light
      exposure may be recorded using an ambulatory recording device, while the subjects are living
      at home on their normal routines. During this time, a sleep-log and regular sleep-wake
      schedule will be maintained as outlined above.

      Segment II (Inpatient Baseline) subjects will report to the laboratory approximately four
      hours after the scheduled wake time on the final home baseline day. Upon admission (ADM),
      they will enter a controlled-light single-patient suite (BWH CCI Tower 9B) with a bedroom and
      bathroom. A nurse will conduct an admission interview including assessment of recent and
      current health and vital signs. A urine sample will be collected for toxicology and
      drugs-of-abuse tests and for a pregnancy test in female subjects. Ambient background light
      levels will be maintained at regular indoor levels (~90 lux) to facilitate admission
      procedures however, immediately following admission, at the 8-h post habitual waketime,
      ambient lights will be dimmed to &lt;3 lux. Six-hours prior to habitual sleep subjects will
      start their first constant posture (CP) protocol. The CP protocol restricts movement by
      keeping the subject seated in the same position in order to examine sensitive endocrine
      changes that are otherwise easily confounded by postural alterations. The CP protocol will
      occur on Day 1, 2 and 3 and 4 lasting up to 6-hours each time. Following completion of CP
      subjects will be given an 8-h sleep episode. Light levels during sleep will be ~0 lux. This
      segment of the study will be used for baseline (control) measurement of melatonin, alertness
      and sleep.

      Segment III (Light exposure) will begin on the morning of Day 2. Subjects will be randomized
      to wake on Day 2 into one of the two different lighting conditions for up to the entire
      16-hour waking episode. The two experimental lighting conditions are detailed below. On Day
      3, subjects will complete another pre-bedtime dim light exposure session as on Day 1 and then
      on Day 4 subjects will be exposed to the other light condition for up to the entire 16-hour
      hour waking day.

      Segment IV (Discharge) Upon completion of Segment III, the subject will be discharged from
      the IPM few hours before habitual bedtime.

      Subjects will be exposed first to either (i) polychromatic white light or (ii) blue-depleted
      polychromatic light. The polychromatic white light will be generated using commercially
      available compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) (regular bulbs that are in everyday use) whereas
      the blue-depleted polychromatic light will be generated using light emitting diode (LED)
      lamps. The LED source will be electronically tuned to reduce the relative strength of the
      blue portion of the visible spectrum (blue-depleted) as compared to the polychromatic white
      light generated by the CFL. In comparison to the CFL source, the LED source will be similar
      in intensity (lumen and lux), visible light spectrum and safety. Both types of lamps will be
      housed in identical chambers and the lamps will be covered with opaque material so that
      subjects are blinded to the different types of lamps. Multiple identical light devices may be
      placed in the room to generate ambient light with a uniform corneal illuminance. During the
      first 10-hours of the 16-hour wake episode the subject will be ambulatory in the room whereas
      during the next 6-hours of the 16-hour wake episode the subject will maintain constant
      posture to receive uniform light exposure from a fixed distance and direction.

      Blood sample: Blood samples will be collected through an indwelling intravenous (IV)
      catheter. Serial samples will be collected upto every 30-minutes starting 8-hours prior to
      habitual bedtime on the day of admission until completion of the study (~4 hours before
      discharge). No more than 500 mL of whole blood will be collected over the entire collection
      period. When blood samples are not being drawn, a heparinized saline solution will perfuse
      the catheter to keep the IV patent. Blood will be assayed for melatonin and/or other
      hormones, enzymes, and metabolites associated with metabolic, reproductive and
      immune-response pathways.

      Urine Sample Collection: Urine will be collected approximately every three hours during
      designated portions of the study when the subject is awake. The urine volume will be
      measured, and aliquots may be saved for later hormonal, metabolite, or electrolyte analysis.

      Saliva Sample Collection: Saliva samples will be collected frequently (upto every hour) by
      asking the subject to spit into a small test tube, or to chew on a piece of cotton. These
      samples will be used for measurement of hormone levels.

      Polygraphic Recordings: Polygraphic recording will be carried out during all sleep episodes
      and during wake episodes when the subject is in CP protocol. Surface electrodes are taped to
      specific locations on the subject's face, head and torso in order to allow the recording of
      brain wave activity (EEG), horizontal and vertical eye movements (EOG), heart rate, and
      muscle activity (EMG). The recordings will be collected on an ambulatory digital recorder
      (Vitaport, TEMEC Instruments). The digitized data will be used for both sleep and wake
      spectral analysis and sleep stage scoring. The signals will be sampled at 256 Hz, low-pass
      filtered and stored at 128 Hz on flash RAM card, from which they will be downloaded to
      hard-disk after the end of the recording and archived.

      Color Rendition Test: Subjects will complete the Farnsworth F100 Hue Tests up to three times
      during the study. Once under standard regular indoor fluorescent lighting and once again
      under the CFL and LED light conditions. The Farnsworth 100 Hue test is one the most
      comprehensive color vision and hue discrimination tests. The subject is provided with 93
      color discs in three sets of 23 and one set of 24 and the objective is to select the next
      closest color disc and places each in sequence.

      Neurobehavioral Testing: We have selected a battery of computer-based tests of performance
      and mood that are sensitive to the acute effects of misalignment of circadian phase and sleep
      disruption on performance; and assess whether certain critical behavioral functions are
      disrupted or facilitated by exposure to light. Subjects will perform various batteries of
      cognitive and subjective tasks periodically throughout the course of their daily wake
      episodes. Each battery will range from 3-30 minutes in length. There will be the opportunity
      for breaks between tasks. All tasks during regularly scheduled days and constant routines
      will be administered by computer with subjects seated at work stations or in constant routine
      position.

      2. Study endpoints: Outcome variables will be (i) the area under the curve of plasma
      melatonin during the CP and sleep episode (ii) subjective alertness and auditory performance
      data (iii) sleep EEG and wake EEG and EOG. All outcome measures will be compared between the
      inpatient baseline and light exposure episodes. EEG data will be used to assess power density
      values during wake and sleep and slow eye movements, which will be expressed as a percentage
      of power density during dim light (inpatient baseline phase). These EEG measures are
      validated for providing a highly sensitive, objective measure of sleepiness (the incidence of
      delta/theta/alpha activity in wake EEG power density and incidence of slow eye movements in
      wake EOG) and for staging and spectral analysis of sleep. Spectral analysis of sleep is
      critical for assessing sleep quality.

      The analysis was done based on our primary outcome variable of melatonin suppression induced
      by the two different lighting conditions as compared to baseline condition. Assuming =0.05
      and =0.8 for a one-sided test, 40 subjects will yield sufficient statistical power to detect
      an average difference in melatonin suppression of 28% between the light conditions.
