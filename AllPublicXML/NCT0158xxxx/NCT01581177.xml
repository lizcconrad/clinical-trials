    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, dose-ranging and initial safety
      profiles of A006, an Albuterol dry powder inhaler (DPI), in the dose range of 25 to 180 mcg
      per dosing in comparison to a DPI Placebo Control and an Albuterol metered dose inhaler (MDI)
      Active Control.

      This study will be conducted in male and female adult patients who have mild-to-moderate
      persistent asthma for at least 6 months, but are otherwise generally healthy.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, dose-ranging and initial safety
      profiles of A006, an Albuterol dry powder inhaler (DPI), in the dose range of 25 to 180 mcg
      per dose in comparison to the DPI Placebo Control and the Active (Reference) Control. The
      study results of this study together with that of A006-B study will be utilized to determine
      the optimum final dose range of A006 for further clinical studies.

      The study will be conducted in male and female adult patients who have mild-to-moderate
      persistent asthma but are otherwise generally healthy.
