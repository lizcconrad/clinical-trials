      Design and Procedure:

      The design is a randomised controlled multi-centre pilot study. 18 community pharmacies
      located in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, were randomised to either a control or an
      intervention group. These pharmacies recruited eligible patients out of their clientele and
      invited them to take part in the study. Participants were visited at home by the pharmacist
      and home-based medication reviews were conducted. The survey form has been developed by the
      research team and comprised amongst others items to adherence, adverse effects, drug intake,
      storage and quality of life. Thereafter all data were analysed by the pharmacist with a newly
      developed document called &quot;analysis guide&quot; aiming at the detection of drug related problems.
      Pharmacists of the intervention group discussed the results with the family doctor of the
      patients and the patients and tried to solve the drug related problems. This procedure was
      not undertaken in the control group.

      Six months later a second medication review was carried out in both groups.

      Study hypothesis:

      Pharmaceutical care reduces the overall number of drug-related problems of elderly patients
      with diabetes and impairments in mobility.

      Aim:

      The purpose of this study is to show that pharmaceutical care reduces the overall number of
      drug-related problems of elderly diabetes-patients with impairments in mobility and leads to
      both an improved health status and an improved quality of life.
