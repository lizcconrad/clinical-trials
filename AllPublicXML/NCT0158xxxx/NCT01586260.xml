    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate a new investigational drug to prevent
      reoccurrence of neuroblastoma that is in remission. This study drug is called DFMO. The
      objectives of this study will be to monitor for safety and look at efficacy of DFMO.

      The safety of the proposed dosing regimen in this trial will be tested by an on-going
      risk/benefit assessment during the study. A patient benefiting from treatment, not
      progressing on therapy, and in the absence of any safety issues associated with DFMO may
      continue on treatment up to 27 cycles with the expectation that there will be an overall
      clinical benefit.

      The procedures involved in this study include Medical history, Physical exam, Vital signs
      (blood pressure, pulse, temperature), Blood tests, Urine tests, MRI or CT scan of the
      tumor(s), MIBG scans, and Bone marrow aspirations. All of these tests and procedures are
      considered standard of care for this population. Drug administration is also part of this
      protocol, including an investigational new drug called DFMO.

      The proposed dosing regimen is an oral dose of DFMO tablets two times a day for each day
      while on study. There will be 27 cycles. Each cycle will be 28 days in length.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: 0-21 years at the time of diagnosis.

          -  Diagnosis: histologic verification at either the time of original diagnosis or a
             previous relapse of high risk neuroblastoma.

          -  Disease Status: Neuroblastoma that is in remission

          -  Greater than 30 days from completion of cytotoxic and biologic therapy and less than
             120 days from previous therapy.

          -  A negative urine pregnancy test is required for female subjects of child bearing
             potential (onset of menses or ≥13 years of age).

             effective birth control methods during treatment and for six months after treatment is
             stopped. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives (&quot;the
             pill&quot;), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrol implants (Norplant), or
             medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). If one of these cannot be
             used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended.

             not eligible. Subjects must have fully recovered from the effects of prior
             chemotherapy (hematological and bone marrow suppression effects).

          -  Infection: Subjects who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible until the
             infection is judged to be well controlled in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
