    <textblock>
      This study will test strategies to help people with prehypertension adopt a running program
      to reduce their blood pressure in the long term. This study will be a 12 week intervention of
      about 40 participants randomized to running educational material, group based running
      instruction, or group based running instruction focused on form and all given the option to
      use the supplemental mHealth intervention. The purpose of this study is to collect
      feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy data in preparation for a larger planned
      NIH-R01 study.

      The UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine has increasingly been investigating lifestyle
      interventions and their upstream approach to improving health and well-being. Many such
      lifestyle interventions address health risk nonpharmacologically and present participants
      with the opportunity to change their overall trajectory of health. Exercise interventions are
      of particular interest based on evidence of numerous physical and mental health benefits. Our
      target population in the Running Against Prehypertension Trial (RAPT) was people with upper
      range prehypertension. By adopting and maintaining a running program, these individuals who
      are at a high risk of hypertension can avoid a lifetime of medication and chronic disease.
      The objective of RAPT was to collect feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy data
      over a 12 week period on a running program aimed at teaching a natural running form called
      ChiRunning that used the mindful movement principles of Tai Chi. By using this natural
      running form, participants may increase satisfaction and decrease rates of injury towards
      greater adherence to the program. Participants were randomized to one of three study arms: 1)
      intervention, 8 weeks of group training in form focused ChiRunning; 2) active control, 8
      weeks of group training focused on conventional running excluding form; or 3) usual care, a
      self-directed training with educational materials.

We will consider at least 75% of participants being &quot;satisfied&quot; or higher in the overall study evaluation to indicate acceptability of the study materials. We will consider completing at least 75% of the intended gait analyses and feedback from the lab specialists to indicate feasibility and a &quot;satisfied&quot; or higher score by at least 75% of participants as being acceptable.</description>
