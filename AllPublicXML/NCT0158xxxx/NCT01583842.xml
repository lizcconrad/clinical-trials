  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with the primary purpose to describe organ dosimetry and acute
      toxicities using no carrier added and carrier added 124I-MIBG PET/CT in patients with
      neuroblastoma (NB). Eligible patients are 3 years of age and older with relapsed or
      refractory neuroblastoma who are currently enrolled on a treatment protocol with 131I-MIBG.
      After all eligibility criteria are met, patients will receive a diagnostic imaging dose of
      124I-MIBG followed by sequential PET/CT dosimetry scans on Days 0, 1, 2 and 5. Subsequent,
      planned therapeutic administration of 131I-MIBG will occur between Days 7 to 21, as specified
      by the patient's therapeutic MIBG protocol. An optional single follow up 124I-MIBG PET-CT
      scan will be done to assess tumor sites 6 weeks after the patient has their MIBG therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accurate radiation dose evaluation is important in patients with malignant tumors, and this
      is especially critical in children with NB who will be receiving several dose of therapeutic
      131I. The accurate quantification of the isotope-labeled analog can only be achieved by using
      positron emission compounds, such as 124I. Unlike planar images, which were used to obtain
      kinetic information, and SPECT reconstruction modalities that were aimed to assess the
      spatial distribution of radioactivity, 3D PET imaging-based dosimetry is a method which
      provides a more accurate estimation of the cumulated radioactivity distribution. Because PET
      provides better quantitative accuracy, when compared to SPECT regarding the tissue absorbed
      information, we hypothesize PET would better correspond with tumor response and normal organ
      toxicity. Early studies using I-124 for dosimetry in thyroid cancer have been promising.

      Demonstration of the feasibility and accuracy of this new imaging modality, with the
      excellent prospect for more accurate dosimetry, will improve tumor localization and optimize
      therapeutic dosing with 131I-MIBG. The results of our work may potentially have also
      implications in the study of other neuroendocrine tumors. The Section of Nuclear Medicine and
      the Laboratory of Functional Imaging at the University of California, San Francisco, are
      equipped with state of the art instruments and is run by a highly skilled staff which will
      guarantee the success of the proposed research.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Patients must be &gt;/= 3 years of age and able to cooperate for the PET CT scan
             when registered on study.

          -  Diagnosis: Patients must have a diagnosis of neuroblastoma either by histologic
             verification of neuroblastoma and/or demonstration of tumor cells in the bone marrow
             with increased urinary catecholamine metabolites.

          -  Disease Status - To be eligible for the MIBG pre-therapy dosimetry:

          -  Recurrent/progressive disease at any time. Biopsy is not required, even if there is a
             partial response to intervening therapy.

          -  Refractory disease (i.e. less than a partial response to frontline therapy, including
             a minimum of 4 cycles of chemotherapy). No biopsy is required for eligibility for this
             study.

          -  Imaging only cohort

          -  For patients participating in the imaging cohort only, patients with high-risk
             neuroblastoma are eligible at any time (during initial treatment or during treatment
             of relapsed/refractory disease) as long as they meet the requirements.

          -  123I-MIBG Uptake: Patients must have MIBG evaluable disease which is defined as
             evidence of uptake into tumor at one site within 4 weeks prior to entry on study and
             subsequent to any intervening therapy.

          -  Patients must meet eligibility criteria for 131I-MIBG therapy in order to participate
             in the dosimetry portion.

          -  Reproductive Function: All post-menarchal females must have a negative beta-HCG within
             2 weeks prior to receiving the dose of 124I-MIBG. Males and females of childbearing
             potential must practice an effective method of birth control while participating on
             this study, to avoid possible damage to the fetus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactating with the intent of breast feeding.

          -  Patients who require general anesthesia for MIBG imaging studies.
