  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroids are common in the West Indian population (30-40% of reproductive women).Fibroids are
      benign growth in the womb or uterus and in order to preserve the fertility of women they,
      require an operation called myomectomy or shelling out of the fibroid. This procedure can be
      associated with large blood loss.

      In current practice some obstetricians use a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist prior to
      the operation to reduce blood loss. Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist is used in current
      gynaecological practice to treat women with heavy periods.

      In this study the investigators randomised women to either 2 or 3 doses of the gonadotropin
      agonist prior to their operation and no treatment. The intraoperative blood loss was
      measured. The study hypothesis: To determine whether administration of gonadotropin releasing
      hormone agonist prior to myomectomy reduces intraoperative blood loss.
