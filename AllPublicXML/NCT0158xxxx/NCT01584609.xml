  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single blind, concurrent controlled, multi-center study.
      Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke who have evidence of a large
      vessel (2.5mm or greater in diameter) occlusion in the cerebral circulation will be assigned
      to either the Penumbra System with the Separator 3D or the Penumbra System without the
      Separator 3D. Each treated patient will be followed and assessed for 3 months after
      randomization. Up to 230 evaluable patients at up to 50 centers presenting with acute
      ischemic stroke in vessels accessible to the Penumbra Separator 3D System for
      revascularization within 8 hours of symptom onset. The hypothesis to be tested is that the
      safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the Separator 3D for the
      revascularization of large vessel occlusion is not inferior to the Penumbra System alone.

    <description>The Penumbra System® is a new generation of neuro-embolectomy devices specifically designed to remove thrombus through aspiration.The treatment paradigm of this System involves the introduction of the Reperfusion Catheter through a guide catheter into the intracranial vasculature, and guided over an appropriate guidewire to the site of primary occlusion. The Reperfusion Catheter is used in parallel with the Separator and an aspiration source (Aspiration Pump) to separate the thrombus and aspirate it from the occluded vessel.</description>
