    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency is common globally. Pregnant women, who need an increased supply of
      this vitamin for the proper development of the fetus, are a significant risk group. The
      purpose of this study is to examine which factors - education, knowledge from
      non-professional sources, recommendations from medical staff - influence the use of vitamin D
      among pregnant women in light of the lack of a clear health policy, and to help formulating
      guidelines for a new health policy with specific recommendations for vitamin D dosage in
      pregnancy.
