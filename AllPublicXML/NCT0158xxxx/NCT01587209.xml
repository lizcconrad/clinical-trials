  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that membrane microparticles (MPs) are liberated into the blood
      stream in response to decompression stress and that certain MPs characteristics initiate
      inflammatory responses that contribute to the clinical syndrome the investigators call
      decompression sickness. The research goal is to evaluate the number, type and time-course for
      elevations in MPs in sport SCUBA divers who present for treatment of decompression sickness.
      Blood samples are to be taken from consenting patients before and after they undergo
      treatment for decompression sickness and at a follow-up clinic visit from 1 to 3 weeks later
      (three samples total).

    <textblock>
      Microparticles (MPs) are small membrane bound vesicles shed from the surface of a variety of
      cells by what appear to be well regulated processes. They are elevated in many physiological
      and disease states and in some instances have been associated with organ injury. Shear stress
      - as can be caused by intravascular bubbles - is one of the stimuli known to cause cells to
      release microparticles. Most sport SCUBA dives have been shown to generate intravascular
      bubbles - even safe dives well within limits established by the US Navy and sports
      authorities. The investigators have reported elevations in several sub-types of MPs in a
      group of individuals undergoing a well monitored series of open-water SCUBA dives. There is
      no information of the occurrence of MPs in injured divers. The investigators have published
      results using a murine model which demonstrated that mice subjected to varying decompression
      stresses exhibit progressive elevations in circulating MPs derived from leukocytes,
      erythrocytes, platelets and endothelial cells. Using novel interventions the investigators
      demonstrated that MPs cause intravascular neutrophil activation and inflammatory perivascular
      injuries. Therefore, there is pathophysiological information to suggest that one or more
      element of MPs (number and/or pro-inflammatory subtype) may be proximal elements that
      precipitate the clinical syndrome the investigators call decompression sickness.
