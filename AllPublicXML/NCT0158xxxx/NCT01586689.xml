  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining the relative effects of alternative aftercare models for ex-offenders
      who are recovering from substance abuse/addiction. The study is a longitudinal, randomized
      field trial that assigns participants to one of three conditions: Oxford House, a
      professionally-run residential treatment facility, or a control condition that involves usual
      aftercare chosen by participants (which may include no treatment at all). Oxford Houses are
      self-run residential recovery homes based on the premise of mutual support. These homes do
      not involve professional treatment staff and the expenses (e.g. rent, utilities) are paid for
      by the residents. The hypothesis of this study is that Oxford House participants will have as
      good or better outcomes in terms of substance recovery, recidivism, and health in comparison
      to the participants who were assigned to the residential treatment facility, and better
      outcomes in comparison to the control group. In addition, the cost to government/tax payers
      will be substantially lower given that participants pay their own way.
