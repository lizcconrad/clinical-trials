    <textblock>
      Stair negotiation is an important activity of daily living. Patients with cruciate ligament
      injury may have difficulty in stair negotiation because of the proprioception deficit and
      neuromuscular deficit caused by ligament injury. However, the influence of knee cruciate
      ligament injury on the control of movement is still unclear. Since inter-joint coordination
      can provide the information of relationship between angle position and angle velocity, it may
      be useful to analysis the change of movement pattern.This current study aimed to investigate
      the change of inter-joint coordination and muscle activation in patients with cruciate
      ligament injury during stair negotiation.
