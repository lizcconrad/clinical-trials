  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to compare the rate of reported anxiety / depression
      (HADS &gt;= 8) among spouses and other family members in ICU patients.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  to assess symptoms of anxiety (HADS ≥ 8) and depression (HADS ≥ 8) among relatives of
           ICU patients three months after discharge

        -  to assess what relatives felt vis-à-vis the information process

        -  describe the number and duration of interviews with participants

        -  to compare variables between the groups &quot;spouses&quot; and &quot;other relatives&quot;.

             -  satisfaction

             -  number and duration of interviews

             -  HADS questionnaire

             -  The scale Edmunton

             -  an internal questionnaire

             -  IES-R score

             -  level of mental well-being: WEMWBS

        -  to describe the completeness of the study

        -  to test the hypothesis that the development of symptoms related to physical
           manifestations of anxiety and depression predicts the development of post-traumatic
           stress at 3 months.

        -  to assess the impact of the various forms of stress during hospitalization.
