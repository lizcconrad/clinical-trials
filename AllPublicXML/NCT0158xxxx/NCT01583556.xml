  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many common arm fractures have an excellent prognosis with little more than symptomatic
      treatment. When studying these fractures, investigators find that a substantial number of
      patients do not attend follow-up appointments. The difficulty of maneuvering in big cities,
      the cost of parking, the co-pay for the visit and the wait times for x-ray and doctor are all
      inconveniences that some patients might prefer to avoid. Building on prior research, it is
      appropriate to offer patients with common minor upper extremity fractures that have an
      excellent prognosis optional follow-up after the first visit. The plan would be to be
      available by phone, email and subsequent appointment at the patient's discretion if they felt
      that the recovery was off course. Benefit to individual participants is unlikely. The study
      will benefit the society as a whole, by providing a better understanding of these common
      fractures. It can also affect the economics of our health system by avoiding further
      follow-up appointments.

      Primary null hypothesis: There is no difference in patient outcome 2-6 months after injury
      between patients that return for a second visit, and patients that do not.

      Secondary null hypothesis: There is no difference in patient satisfaction 2-6 months after
      injury between patients that return for a second visit, and patients that do not.

      This study will employ a prospective, non-randomized design. After the questionnaires are
      filled the patients choose whether or not to schedule a second appointment for evaluation of
      their fracture: The first group will be scheduled for a second visit (standard treatment).
      The alternative (Optional follow-up) will be to take a handout describing the recovery and
      providing instructions for how to contact us should they get off course.

      Since it is up to the subject to decide whether or not he or she wants a second appointment
      or the brochure, it is observational rather than interventional.

      Evaluation: 2-6 months after injury all patients (independent of group) will be contacted by
      either phone or email by a blinded research assistant and asked to provide the following:
      pain with NRS (scale 0-10); three satisfaction questions; disability with use of Quick DASH;
      and if they returned to modified and regular work.

      Patients in the standard group A will return to the Hand and Upper Extremity Service for
      their usual practice follow-up examination 1-3 months after treatment.
