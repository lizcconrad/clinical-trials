  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate antibiotic therapy is very important in the treatment of infections. Spectrum and
      dosing of the antibiotics are two factors of the therapy: the spectrum of an antibiotic can't
      be changed, but the dosing scheme can be optimized. Recent studies proved that an optimized
      dosing scheme can improve the efficacy of the treatment. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have
      unpredictable pharmacokinetics in patients on intensive care units. This is due to the
      pathophysiologic processes in the patients on intensive care units: increased distribution
      volume, hypoproteinemia, organ failureâ€¦ The investigators guess that similar processes
      influence the pharmacokinetics of small spectrum antibiotics (like amoxicillin and
      cefuroxime), but data lacks. Because the pharmacokinetics of broad spectrum antibiotics in
      seriously ill patients are better known, physicians are more confident prescribing these
      drugs. Studying the pharmacokinetic interactions of small spectrum antibiotics in seriously
      ill patients, can help to give the physician the confidence to prescribe these small-spectrum
      antibiotics.

      In this study, the investigators will study the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin/clavulanic
      acid and cefuroxime, in 60 patients on intensive care. 8 blood samples will be drawn via a
      central catheter on different moments after one administration of the antibiotic in the
      steady state phase. All the patients are prescribed the antibiotics for the treatment of
      their infections: they get the antibiotic therapy anyway. By measuring the concentrations on
      different moments after one administration, the investigators can reconstruct the
      pharmacokinetic function.
