  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the primary objective of this study to show safety and tolerability for administration
      of the cell based immunotherapy ALECSAT to patients with Glioblastoma brain cancer. It is a
      secondary objective to establish if any indications of positive therapeutic or palliative
      effects may be observed.

      The primary objective for this study is to establish if any side effects or toxicity issues
      occur, that will prevent further clinical development of the autologous cell based
      immunotherapy ALECSAT in Glioblastoma (GBM) or to establish if there are side effects or
      toxicity issues, that will suggest that the further clinical development planned, has to
      change course significantly. It is a primary objective to show safety and tolerability for
      administration of ALECSAT, thus not meeting this endpoint, may stop further clinical
      development of ALECSAT.

      The secondary objective for this study is to establish if any indications of a positive
      therapeutic or palliative effect may be observed. As this is a secondary objective, no
      observed significant positive clinical effect, will not prevent further clinical development
      or in itself, trigger changes in the further clinical development planned.

      The overall endpoint of the study is to develop a new therapeutic approach that may slow down
      or stop disease progression in late stage GBM patients.

      ALECSAT is an autologous cell based immunotherapy based on the patient's own Natural Killer
      cells and CytoToxic T cells. The cells are isolated from the patient's own blood - activated
      and expanded in number before re administering i. v.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Recurrence of GBM tumour documented by MRI and PET in patients having received all
             available standard treatment.

          2. Be over the age of 18 and capable of understanding the information and giving informed
             consent.

          3. Adequate performance status &gt; 50% (see below*).

               -  Performance is monitored according to the Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS)

                    -  100% - normal, no complaints, no signs of disease

                    -  90% - capable of normal activity, few symptoms or signs of disease

                    -  80% - normal activity with some difficulty, some symptoms or signs

                    -  70% - caring for self, not capable of normal activity or work

                    -  60% - requiring some help, can take care of most personal requirements

                    -  50% - requires help often, requires frequent medical care

                    -  40% - disabled, requires special care and help

                    -  30% - severely disabled, hospital admission indicated but no risk of death

                    -  20% - very ill, urgently requiring admission, requires supportive measures
                       or treatment

                    -  10% - moribund, rapidly progressive fatal disease processes

                    -  0% - death.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A low blood count (haemoglobin &lt; 6.0 mmol/l).
