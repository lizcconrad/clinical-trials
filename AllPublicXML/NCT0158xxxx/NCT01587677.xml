  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection causing 1.1 million deaths annually worldwide.
      Diagnosis of the disease is often time consuming or challenging. Many cases of tuberculosis
      require advanced and expensive diagnostic methods that restrict their availability in
      resource limited countries where the burden of tuberculosis is highest. The development of
      rapid point of care diagnostics is required.

      Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) is part of the bacterial cell wall in M. tuberculosis. It is released
      when bacteria are multiplying or dying. LAM can be detected in the urine since it is filtered
      from the blood in the kidneys. The detection of LAM in the urine by conventional enzyme
      linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) techniques was hampered in the past by a low sensitivity
      and multiple processing steps. Recently, fluorescence linked immuno-sorbent assay (FLISA) has
      been shown to detect LAM in concentrations that are several magnitudes lower that with ELISA
      based methods. Furthermore the procedure requires less separate steps for processing the
      sample.

      This study aims to validate the new diagnostic test by comparing patients with (a) confirmed
      tuberculosis (n=25), (b) infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (n=25), (c) bronchial
      carcinoma (n=25), (d) suspected tuberculosis but confirmed alternative diagnosis (estimated
      n=20). Single blood and urine samples of these groups will be used to evaluate the
      sensitivity and specificity of the test.

      In patients with confirmed tuberculosis the LAM FLISA will also be assessed as a biomarker
      for the monitoring of tuberculosis treatment success. Initially, 2-5 samples blood and urine
      are required during the first week, followed by twice weekly and weekly sampling intervals
      over a period of 12 weeks maximum. The study participation ends when the patient is
      discharged from hospital.

      As a substudy, the blood samples will be used to evaluate an enzyme linked immuno-sorbent
      assay (ELISA) for the detection of lipid antigens that are specific for Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis.
