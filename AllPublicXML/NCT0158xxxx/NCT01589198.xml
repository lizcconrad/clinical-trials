    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about asthma in people who are not well-controlled
      with current asthma medication (refractory asthma). The investigators will compare data from
      refractory asthmatic patients here at National Jewish Health to mild asthmatics subjects and
      to people without asthma. Study experiments involve looking at samples from all 3 groups and
      comparing them at a molecular level. These laboratory experiments may help identify subtypes
      of refractory asthmatics that require different treatments.
