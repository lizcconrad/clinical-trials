  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sensory retraining exercise could improve
      lip numbness caused by bilateral sagittal split of mandible.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients receiving bilateral
      sagittal split osteotomy and having lip numbness or paraesthesia will be included in this
      study. 80 patients will be included and randomized into two groups and there are 40 patients
      in each group. The control group is to maintain follow up in clinic and do not receive any
      sensory retraining exercise. The experimental group is requested to perform sensory
      retraining at home by themselves.
