    <textblock>
      According to published literature, treatment with pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) is
      associated with end of treatment response in treatment naive patients with chronic hepatitis
      B (CHB). It has antiviral as well as anti-fibrotic properties and treatment with Peg-IFN
      results in improvement of liver histology and down regulation of progression to cirrhosis of
      liver. Peg-IFN is administered for a finite duration. The major limitation of Peg-IFN is that
      only 30-49% patients are benefited by this anti-viral drug. Another potent anti-viral drug,
      entecavir (ETV), on the other hand, reduces HBV replication in most patients, but causes
      improvement of liver histology in only 30%, possibly because of its lack of immune modulatory
      ability like Peg-IFN. Also, ETV treatment is associated with several complications like
      emergence of HBV mutant. The aim of this study is to assess whether the combination of these
      two 'unique' anti-viral drugs offer the best possible outcome to treatment-naïve CHB
      patients, in terms of treatment response (virological and biochemical), treatment cost and
      duration and adverse events.

      Aims &amp; Objectives:

      Peg-IFN has five unique features, namely (i) finite duration of administration, (ii)
      anti-viral effect, (iii) immune-modulation, (iv) anti-fibrotic effect and (v) delayed
      virologic response off-treatment. However these benefits come at a cost i.e. the drug is
      expensive and there are several known adverse events.

      ETV is a potent nucleoside analogue (Nuc), which has minimal resistance compared to most
      other Nucs. It is efficient for inducing rapid decline of HBV DNA. However ETV has no known
      immune modulatory or anti-fibrotic effect and therefore off-treatment response or improvement
      of hepatic histology is not expected with ETV. Similar to other NUCs, there is no defined
      duration of administration of ETV.

      It has been hypothesized that if lower-dose of Peg-IFN can be given in combination with ETV
      in treatment-naïve CHB patients, they are likely to benefit most from the 'best of both the
      drugs' in terms of viral and biochemical responses, treatment cost and duration and adverse
      events.

      The project aims to evaluate the outcome of first-line combination treatment with 'lower-dose
      Peg-IFN plus ETV' in treatment-naïve CHB patients to see whether this combination may be
      further evaluated and eventually recommended as first-line management for HBV related chronic
      liver diseases (CLD).

      Research Question:

      Although the best treatment option for CHB is not clarified yet, certain therapeutic concepts
      can be derived from the experience of treating patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. A major advancement in treating CHC and HIV
      infections has been the development of first-line combination therapy.

      The research question of this study is whether the first-line combination treatment with
      'lower-dose Peg-IFN plus ETV' is effective and beneficial in treatment-naïve CHB patients and
      whether this combination may be evaluated further and eventually recommended as the preferred
      first-line management for HBV related CLD.

      Methodology:

      Ethical consideration

      Ethical approval for the study has been obtained from the Ethical Committee at Bangabandhu
      Sheikh Mujib Medical University. The study will be performed according to principle of the
      'Declaration of Helsinki' of 1975 maintaining all the requisites and norms of 'good clinical
      practice' (GCP).

      This will be a prospective, open label, interventional clinical study. The first 20 (twenty)
      treatment-naive hepatitis B virus 'e' antigen (HBeAg) positive CHB patients with treatment
      indication, presenting from July 2011 onwards, who can afford the treatment with Peg-IFN and
      who voluntarily agree to be part of the study will be recruited. Signed voluntary consent in
      Bengali will be obtained from each participant.

      Patients will receive peg-IFN (90 µgms) sub-cutaneously once weekly for 24 weeks in
      combination with ETV (0.5 mg) once daily orally for the same duration. Administration of
      Peg-IFN will be supervised and patients will be evaluated regularly both clinically and with
      biochemical and haematological parameters for early detection and management of adverse
      event(s) if any.

      Virologic and biochemical parameters will be tested (i) at baseline, (ii) at end of treatment
      (i.e. at 24 weeks) and (iii) at 12 weeks off-treatment.

      These will include HBeAg, HBV DNA and serum alaninetransaminase (ALT). Besides for assessment
      of liver status, patients will undergo ultrasonography (USG) of hepato-biliary system (HBS),
      endoscopy of upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) and if possible liver biopsy or fibroscan of
      liver at baseline.

      Data analysis All data will be collected using pre-designed questionnaire and preserved in a
      safe place. Data will be analysed using SPSS programme.
