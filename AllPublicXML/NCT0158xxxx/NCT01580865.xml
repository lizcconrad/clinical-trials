    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, trial to compare tacrolimus with
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for induces complete remission in lupus nephritis patients. The
      study duration is one year.

      Research hypothesis

        -  The proportion of patients who have achieved complete remission between regimen of
           tacrolimus plus prednisolone is greater than MMF plus prednisolone as an induction
           therapy in lupus nephritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with a pathological diagnosis of active lupus nephritis whom are currently
      followed up or referred to outpatient department (OPD) of 7 participating medical centers in
      Thailand. Patients who come to attend will be selected according to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.

      Outcome measurements

        -  The patients will be follow-up for 1 year and will be evaluated for clinical
           manifestations and laboratory investigations of lupus nephritis and any adverse effects
           of therapy on each visit.

        -  Blood pressure and laboratory assessments, including complete blood cell count,
           urinalysis, urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR), and kidney and liver function, will
           be performed at each visit for 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks).

        -  Serum anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and serum C3 will be measured every 8 weeks
           after treatment until 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks).

        -  A fasting lipid profile will be also measured every 8 weeks until 24 weeks and at the
           end of study (48 weeks).

        -  Renal and extrarenal disease activity of SLE was measured using the SLEDAI2K. The
           SLEDAI2K will be evaluated at the time of entry into the study and every 8 weeks after
           treatment until 24 weeks and at the end of study (48 weeks).

        -  SLICC damage index, SF-36, EQ5D, and SLEQOL will be evaluated at the time of entry, at
           24 weeks, and at the end of the study.

        -  Patients' serum and urine (blood 3ml and urine 50 ml) will be collected at baseline, 2nd
           week, 4th week, 12th week, and 48th week for further analysis of biomarkers in the
           future.
