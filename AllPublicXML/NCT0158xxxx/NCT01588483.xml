  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most frequent vasculitis in patients above 50 years of age.
      The disease has limited mortality, mostly due to the development of aortic aneurysms, leading
      to dissection and rupture. The probability to develop this complication is 17 x higher at the
      level of the thoracic aorta and 2,4 x at the level of the abdominal aorta in patients with
      GCA when compared with a control group. Therefore, follow-up of the aortic diameter in
      patients with GCA is part of good clinical practice. Previous retrospective research showed a
      link between FDG-uptake at the level of the thoracic aorta, on positron-emission-tomography
      (PET) at the time of diagnosis, and the increase of diameter and volume of the thoracic aorta
      during follow-up (on computed tomography (CT)).

      The purpose of this prospective study is to follow-up on the aortic diameter, and to
      correlate these measures with FDG-PET uptake at diagnosis. Ideally, this would allow us to
      define a group of patients at high risk to develop an aortic aneurysm, already at the time of
      diagnosis.

      As standard care, all patients with a suspicion of GCA undergo a biopsy of the temporal
      artery and a PET scintigraphy to evaluate the presence of large vessel vasculitis. Patients
      with proven GCA on biopsy and/or scintigraphy undergo a computed tomography (CT) of the aorta
      without the administration of contrast, at diagnosis and yearly thereafter (every 12 +/- 3
      months) for 10 years.

      Measurements include the diameter of the ascending aorta, aortic arch, descending aorta,
      suprarenal, juxtarenal and infrarenal aorta, and the volume of the thoracic and the abdominal
      aorta. These measurements are correlated with FDG-uptake at the level of the aorta on
      PET-scintigraphy at the time of diagnosis. All patients will be treated according to accepted
      guidelines and standard care in our center (methylprednisolone started at 32 mg/day, with
      slowly declining doses until stop after 1 to 1,5 years of treatment).
