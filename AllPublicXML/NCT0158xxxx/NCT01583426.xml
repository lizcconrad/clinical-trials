      Current guidelines as those from the AGO-Breast commission recommend for neoadjuvant breast
      cancer patients either a sequence of 4 cycles EC followed by 4 cycles of a taxane or 6 cycles
      of TAC based on previous large scale studies.

      Treatment of patients with HER2-positive disease should include also simultaneous application
      of trastuzumab.

      Solvent-based taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel) cause severe toxicities not only by the active
      agents itself but also by the solvents like cremophor. Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) is a
      solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel encapsulated in albumin. It does not require
      premedication with corticosteroids or antihistamines to prevent the risk of solvent-mediated
      hypersensitivity reactions. This new formulation improves safety profile, allows higher
      dosing with shorter infusion duration, and produces higher tumor drug concentration.

      As neoadjuvant treatment does not only allow to compare competing treatment approaches with a
      very high quality (homogenous treatment population, precise assessment of response by
      histological assessment), but also to identify predictive markers, this trial will compare
      weekly nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel at their currently optimal doses.

      In case of HER2-positive tumor status patients receive Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab
      additionally.

      Primary Objectives:

      To compare the pathological complete response (pCR=ypT0 ypN0) rates of neoadjuvant treatment
      of nab-paclitaxel with solvent-based paclitaxel as part of neoadjuvant treatment of operable
      or locally advanced primary breast cancer

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations.

        -  To determine the rates of ypT0/is ypN0; ypT0 ypN0/+; ypT0/is ypN0/+; ypT(any) ypN0; and
           regression grades.

        -  To determine the response rates of the breast tumor and axillary nodes based on physical
           examination and imaging tests (sonography, mammography, or MRI) after treatment in both
           arms.

        -  To assess clinical response rate after taxane in both groups

        -  To determine the breast conservation rate after each treatment.

        -  To assess the toxicity and compliance.

        -  To assess the time of onset of grade 3 neuropathy

        -  To assess the time of resolution of grade 3/4 neuropathy to at least grade 1

        -  To determine loco-regional invasive recurrence free survival (LRRFS),
           distant-disease-free survival (DDFS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall
           survival (OS) in both arms and according to stratified subpopulations.

        -  To assess regional recurrence free survival (RRFS) in patients with initial
           node-positive axilla converted to negative at surgery and treated with sentinel node
           biopsy alone.

        -  To determine the pCR rate and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients with a
           clinical complete response (cCR) and a negative core biopsy before surgery.

        -  To examine and compare pre-specified molecular markers such as SPARC, gp60, calveoline 1
           and other markers potentially differentially predicting efficacy of nab-paclitaxel and
           solvent-based paclitaxel on core biopsies before, during and after chemotherapy.

      Objectives of Substudies:

        -  To assess, characterize, and correlate circulating tumor cells and proteins with the
           effect of treatment (CTC Substudy).

        -  To correlate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes with the associated
           toxicity and histologically assessed treatment effect (Pharmacogenetic substudy)

        -  To assess ovarian function measured by amenorrhea rate in correlation with changes in
           E2, FSH, LH , Anti-Müller Hormone, ultrasound-follicle count in patients aged &lt; 45
           years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible for study participation only if they comply with the following
        criteria:

          -  Written informed consent for all study according to local regulatory requirements
             prior to beginning specific protocol procedures.

          -  Complete baseline documentation must be sent to GBG Forschungs GmbH.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not
             allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively
             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.

          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt;= 2 cm or a sonographical size of
             &gt;= 1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions,
             preferably by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation
             can be used as measurable lesion.

          -  Patients must be in the following stages of disease:

               -  - cT2 - cT4a-d or

               -  cT1c and cN+ or

               -  - cT1c and pNSLN+ or

               -  - cT1c and ER-neg and PR-neg or

               -  - cT1c and HER2-pos

               -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion
                  should be measured.

          -  Centrally confirmed ER/PR/HER-2, Ki-67 and SPARC status detected on core biopsy. ER/PR
             positive is defined as &gt;1% stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as IHC 3+ or
             in-situ hybridisation (ISH) ratio &gt;2.0. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
             breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of Pathology at
             the Charité, Berlin prior to randomization.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all
             women of childbearing potential.

             performed as clinically indicated.

          -  Patients must be available and compliant for central diagnostics, treatment and
