  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a condition often seen in children. Constipation is often associated with
      impaired quality of life of the child and of great concern among parents. Despite the fact
      that both diagnosis and treatment is a simple task, it is often seen that the treatment
      fails, and many children are referred to a pediatric ward for specialized treatment.

      There is currently little research on the subject and treatment is therefore based on expert
      knowledge rather than scientific research.

      The study objective is to identify the most effective and least stressful treatment of
      children with constipation for both families and the health care system.

      The following will be tested:

      Does treatment of constipation in children require specialized knowledge and extensive
      resources or can the treatment be simplified?

      The results from this study are expected to form the basis for a evidence based treatment of
      children with constipation.
