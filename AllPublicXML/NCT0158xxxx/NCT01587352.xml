    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well vorinostat works in treating patients with melanoma of
      the eye that has spread to other parts of the body. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall objective response rate (RR) to vorinostat in patients with
      metastatic uveal melanoma harboring a guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), q
      polypeptide (GNAQ) or guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), alpha 11 (Gq class)
      (GNA11) mutation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Progression free survival (PFS). III. To determine the
      tolerability of vorinostat in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

      IV. To correlate overall objective RR with GNAQ, GNA11 and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) associated
      protein-1 (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase) (BAP1) mutational status.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in histone acetylation status by
      immunohistochemistry.

      II. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in known proliferation and apoptotic markers
      including Ki67 by immunohistochemistry and BCL2-like 11 (apoptosis facilitator) (BIM),
      baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5 (survivin), v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene
      homolog (c-myc), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
      (PARP), gamma-H2A histone family, member X (gamma-H2AX) and RAD51 recombinase (RAD51) by
      western blot.

      III. To assess for changes in pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      pathway with treatment.

      IV. To describe the evolution of circulating cell-free, tumor-derived deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) levels measured by pyrophosphorolysis activated polymerization (PAP) in plasma of
      patients under treatment for metastatic uveal melanoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 3 days weekly for 4 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks.
