    <textblock>
      Background:

      Renal transplant recipients have a greater risk of morbidity and mortality primarily due to
      cardiovascular disease when compared to the general population. Cardiovascular disease is
      responsible for 50% to 60% percent of deaths amongst renal transplant population and death
      from cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of functioning graft loss.

      Physical activity is an effective form of secondary prevention in existing cardiovascular
      disease reducing all-cause mortality by 25%-30% and has demonstrated positive effects overall
      on quality of life and well-being. Transplant patients who participated in regular
      cardiovascular exercise have significant more positive scores on the SF-36 Health Status
      Questionnaire in comparison to inactive transplant recipients.

      Active video gaming is evolving as an innovative method to increase physical activity. Active
      video gaming has supported physical activity in children and youth. There is however a
      paucity of literature examining interactive games as a means to facilitate physical activity
      and its impact on CVD and quality of life in the adult population nor any literature
      examining AVG and its impact on an adult surgical population.

      This pilot study is designed to determine if Active Video Gaming is feasible and is able to
      lead to behavioral modifications and Quality of Life improvement.

      Subject Selection:

      This is a pilot study during which 10 patients who have undergone renal transplant will be
      selected to exercise with Active Video Gaming for a duration of 3 months. The program
      activity will begin 6 months post surgery.
