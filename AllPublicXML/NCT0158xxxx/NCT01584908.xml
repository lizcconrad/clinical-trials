  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an important public health problem. Organ transplant patients are particularly
      susceptible to severe disease. Also, they shed higher quantities of virus for longer
      durations, leading to greater contagious potential, thereby potentially serving as nodes of
      spread in the community. Therefore, improved strategies to prevent influenza in this
      population is an important public health concern. Standard vaccination is poorly immunogenic
      post-transplant and new vaccine strategies are needed. Adjuvanted vaccines contain molecules
      that create a strong local inflammatory response and they attract immune cells to the site of
      injection, increasing the immunogenicity of the vaccine antigen. Recently seasonal influenza
      vaccines containing adjuvants have become available in Canada but have only limited
      information in transplant patients. This randomized trial is designed to assess the
      immunogenicity of an adjuvanted vaccination strategy compared to a standard vaccine for
      seasonal influenza in a cohort of adult organ transplant recipients.
