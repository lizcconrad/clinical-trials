  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we sought to explore brain activity in nicotine-dependent men in response to
      acute intravenous nicotine using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      phMRI was used to evaluate brain activity in response to 1.5 mg/70 kg intravenous nicotine or
      saline. The nicotine and saline were administered on different visits. The time courses of
      individual subjects' nicotine levels were used as regressors to assess neural activity
      relating to the infusions. The influence of Smoking history and physiological measures on the
      response to nicotine were also investigated.

    <description>PhMRI analysis of the differential response of nicotine compared to the saline condition when analyzed with the nicotine time course.
The main dependent variable in this study, Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) measures of brain activity (via fMRI) data does not exist in a vacuum—it is always relative to another measure of brain activity, typically collected at rest or after a placebo injection. So we collected the data after the IV placebo injection alone and the IV nicotine injection alone, but then need applied mathematical CONTRASTS to the data. This procedure results in the brain activity maps.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15 cigarettes
             every day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence will be
             eligible for participation.

          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and
             physical examination by a qualified physician.

          -  Absence of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders other than nicotine dependence (305.10) as measured
             by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID).

          -  Routine laboratory blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN and
             creatinine, liver function tests, hepatitis panel and urinalysis will be performed.
             Laboratory parameters must be within the normal range. HBsAg must be negative but
             subjects who have hepatitis serology consistent with previous exposure to Hepatitis A,
             Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C, but who do not have clinical and biochemical evidence of
             acute infection, will be acceptable.

          -  Hematocrit levels ≥ 39% for males and ≥ 35% for females.

          -  Serum pregnancy test (hCG beta subunit) results must be negative within 24 hrs of the
             study day.

          -  Normal ECG.

          -  A Body Mass Index (BMI—ratio of weight (W) to height (H) squared; W/H2=kg/m2) of

             range 21.4-29.0.

          -  Participants with ferromagnetic implants or other contraindications to fMRI

        <title>Number of Brain Regions With a Change in Brain Activity Relative to Saline</title>
        <description>PhMRI analysis of the differential response of nicotine compared to the saline condition when analyzed with the nicotine time course.
The main dependent variable in this study, Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) measures of brain activity (via fMRI) data does not exist in a vacuum—it is always relative to another measure of brain activity, typically collected at rest or after a placebo injection. So we collected the data after the IV placebo injection alone and the IV nicotine injection alone, but then need applied mathematical CONTRASTS to the data. This procedure results in the brain activity maps.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Small number of subjects completed due to a large shortage of Nicotine Bitartrate (the chemical used to create our IV Nicotine). We were unable to receive new nicotine shipments from 4/14 -2/15.Without this nicotine it was impossible to run subjects.</limitations_and_caveats>
