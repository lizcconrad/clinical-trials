  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine if excimer laser smoothing of the cornea
      before Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK)improves postoperative
      Best Spectacle Corrected Visual Acuity (BSCVA).

    <textblock>
      Many surgeons are moving away from full thickness corneal transplantation (because of risks
      involving rejection, irregular astigmatism, and wound dehiscence) to partial thickness
      transplantations of either the anterior or posterior (endothelial) layers. However this
      technique is not without its drawbacks. DSAEK uses a mechanical microkeratome to cut the
      graft, but vision is limited by the roughness of the cut surface.

      DSAEK can lead to significant refractive error due to the non-uniform shape of the
      microkeratome cut graft, and the roughness of the microkeratome cut surface limits vision to
      an average of 20/31. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided laser shaping and smoothing
      may improve the refractive and visual outcome.

    <description>A 5mm incision will be made in the sclera (white portion) of the eye, approximately 1mm from the edge of the cornea
The tissue on the underside of the cornea (endothelium) will be scraped away
The graft from the donor cornea (previously smoothed with a laser) will be inserted through the incision and placed against the endothelium of the host cornea.</description>
