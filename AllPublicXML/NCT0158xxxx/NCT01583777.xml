  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study the mass balance, pharmacokinetics (PK), and safety of
      belinostat following IV administration in patients with a recurrent or progressive
      malignancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose study of 14C-labeled belinostat to determine
      routes of elimination of belinostat. A single dose of 14C-labeled belinostat (approximately
      94.3 to 105 µCi, 1500 mg) will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion to the patient.
      Routes of elimination of belinostat and its metabolites will be assessed by estimating the
      recovery of total radioactivity and parent belinostat over a period of 7 days. Plasma samples
      will be taken for 3 days at specified intervals for PK assessments. Total radioactivity in
      plasma, urine, and feces will be determined by liquid scintillation counting. Concentrations
      of belinostat in plasma and urine will be determined using a validated liquid chromatography
      - tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) method. Selected plasma, urine, and feces samples will
      be retained for use in the metabolism investigation. Samples will be initially analyzed using
      radio-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the number and relative
      proportion of belinostat and metabolites present. Selected samples will be subsequently
      analyzed using LC-MS to identify the major metabolites (&gt; 10% of parent area under the curve
      [AUC]). If it is in the interest of the patient, treatment with non-radiolabeled belinostat
      may be continued with 21-day cycles until disease progression, initiation of new anticancer
      therapy, or an adverse event (AE) that may affect patient participation.

    <description>The route of elimination of belinostat will be determined by the recovery of total radioactivity (parent drug and metabolites) and unmetabolized belinostat in urine and feces following single IV administration of 14C-labeled belinostat in patients with recurrent or progressive malignancy.</description>

    <description>Secondary objectives are to determine the PK of 14C-labeled belinostat in plasma, urine, and feces following IV administration; to determine the relative proportion of 14C-labeled belinostat and its radiolabeled metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces; and to assess the safety of belinostat.</description>

    <description>On Day 1, a single dose of 14C-labeled belinostat (approximately 94 to 105 µCi, 1500 mg) will be administered to the patient as a 30-minute IV infusion.
After Cycle 1 evaluations are completed, and if it is in the best interest of the patient, patients may receive additional cycles of non-radiolabeled belinostat until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or initiation of new anticancer therapy. After Cycle 1, Day 21, non radiolabeled belinostat will be administered IV as a 30 -45 minute infusion of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 through 5 every 21 days.</description>
