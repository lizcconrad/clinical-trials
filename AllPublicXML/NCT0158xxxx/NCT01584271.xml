      Phase II 3 arm double blinded clinical study, to evaluate pain killing and healing time of
      Botanical Ear Drops, Ear Comfort™, in Severe External Ear Infection (AOE) patients in
      comparison to Dex-Otic® and Otidin®.

      Study Outcome (hypothesis): if Ear Comfort™ proves to perform as well as Dex-Otic, then ENT's
      and family doctors will have a botanical non-antibiotic product that does not promote the
      formation of antibiotic-resistant infections and may be given to anti-biotics sensitive
      patients.

      Ear comfort™ is pharmacologically stable for at least 3 years on the shelves.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe External Ear Infection (AOE) also known as Swimmer's ear, is an abundant
      microbiological contamination disease of the outer ear canal. It causes severe pains and
      accumulation of fluids in the ear. In some cases it may compromise the hearing. Swimming in
      contaminated water or cleaning the ear with a hard subject are only two examples of what may
      cause AOE. The main Pathogenes causing the disease are Gram negative of which Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa is the most abundant. Occasionally it is a fungoid contamination with Aspergillus
      Niger being the most abundant.
