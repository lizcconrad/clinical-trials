  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of hLL1-DOX, and to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) regimen (in terms of a dose and its associated
      dosing schedule). The secondary objectives are to obtain information on efficacy,
      pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity, and to determine the optimal dose for
      subsequent studies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive hLL1-DOX at one of 4 dose levels administered on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of
      21-day treatment cycles which are continued in the absence of progression or unacceptable
      toxicity up to a total of 8 cycles. After treatment, follow-up will be done at 4, 8 and 12
      weeks post-treatment and will continue to be done every 3 months for up to 2 years.

    <time_frame>during treatment and the change at 4, 8 &amp; 12 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by physical examinations and hematology and chemistry blood tests. Cardiac safety will be done using MUGA scans or echocardiograms. These assessments will be done routinely during treatment and again 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment. Long term safety will be assessed every 3 months after that for up to 2 years.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>During treatment and the changes at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be assessed using CT scans for NHL patients and CT scans and hematology labs for CLL patients. At the beginning of a complete response a repeat bone marrow biopsy may be required. These assessments will be done 8 weeks after the start of treatment and again 10-12 weeks later at the end of treatment. The tests will be repeated at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.</description>
