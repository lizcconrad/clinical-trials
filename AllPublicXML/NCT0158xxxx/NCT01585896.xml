    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to investigate the efficacy of a facilitated self-help group for the
      treatment of hoarding disorder. Eligible participants will take part in a facilitated
      self-help group. The investigators aim to investigate the effects of a self-help group on
      hoarding symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that participants will demonstrate decreased
      hoarding symptoms over time.
