    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that exercise in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors will
      result in an increase in the plasma concentrations of angiostatic factors and a decrease in
      the plasma concentrations of angiogenic factors. Exercise is expected to result in a
      circulating angiostatic phenotype that inhibits adipose tissue mass, growth of breast cancer
      tumor, growth of microscopic residual disease after breast cancer resection, decreases rates
      of local-regional recurrence, decreases rates of distant recurrence, and increases survival.
