      The purpose of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of
      mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) versus Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
      therapy in patients with moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS).

      Study design: In a randomized parallel controlled study 86 patients will be randomly assigned
      to either MRA therapy or CPAP therapy. Group A receives MRA. Group B receives CPAP. The total
      duration of the study is 12 months. Measurements will be done at baseline, after 3, 6 and 12
      months.

      Intervention: Group A will be treated with a bibloc MRA (Somnodent). The mandible will be set
      at 70% of the patient's maximum advancement and will be adjusted to the convenience of the
      patient. Titration will be continued until symptoms abate or until further advancement causes
      discomfort.

      Group B will be treated with CPAP. Proper CPAP-pressure will be set for each patient
      separately. Patients are fitted with a comfortable CPAP mask before titration of the
      CPAP-pressure. For CPAP-titration, patients are instructed to adopt their own typical
      sleeping habits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals who have been subjected to polysomnography and are diagnosed as having
             moderate (AHI 15-30) OSAS;

        Exclusion Criteria:

             pituitary adenoma); Reported or documented severe cardiovascular- or pulmonary
             co-morbidity

          -  Clinically concurrent cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart
             failure,cardiac arrhythmias)

        Whether the patient has unstable endocrine dysfunction, severe cardiovascular- or pulmonary

        evaluating the patient's medical record.

        Dental exclusion criteria:

          -  Extensive periodontal disease or tooth decay;

          -  Active temporomandibular joint disease (including severe bruxism);
