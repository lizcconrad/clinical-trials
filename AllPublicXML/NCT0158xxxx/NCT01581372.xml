  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the cause of one-third of all deaths in Canada. One important
      risk factor for CVD is dyslipidemia. The Canadian Health Measures survey, which was conducted
      from 2007-2009, found that roughly 36% of Canadians had unhealthy levels of LDL. Despite
      strong evidence and clear practice guidelines for the management of this risk factor, it
      remains poorly treated.

      Pharmacists are front-line primary care professionals who see patients at risk for
      cardiovascular disease more frequently than other healthcare professionals. As such,
      pharmacists have the opportunity to systematically and proactively identify patients with
      undertreated dyslipidemia, as one public health approach to chronic disease management.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of enhanced pharmacist care (i.e.,
      participant identification, assessment, care plan development, education/counseling,
      prescribing/titration of lipid-lowering medications and close follow-up) on the proportion of
      participants achieving target LDL-cholesterol levels.

      Hypothesis: Enhanced pharmacist care will result in a more significant decrease in LDL-c
      levels, than that observed in the usual care patients.

      Design:

      This is a randomized controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care. The study will be
      conducted in twelve community pharmacies in Alberta, including several Safeway Pharmacies.
      The participant population will be composed of adults with uncontrolled dyslipidemia as
      defined by the 2009 Canadian Dyslipidemia Guidelines. The primary intervention will be
      pharmacist directed dyslipidemia care. Participants randomized to usual care will receive
      usual care from their pharmacist and physician.

      Study Implications:

      To the investigators knowledge, this study is the first randomized trial of pharmacist
      prescribing in dyslipidemia. This study will have important implications for improving
      patients' access to care, especially as most provinces are proceeding with granting
      additional prescribing authority to pharmacists. The ability to conduct this study in a
      province where pharmacists already have the ability to prescribe is unique. The results will
      also encourage more pharmacists to get involved in cardiovascular prevention and will
      increase the number of prescribers in the area of dyslipidemia.
