      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Philips Sonalleve Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) device for treating
      painful bone metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is a
      non-invasive outpatient modality. In MR-HIFU, a specially designed ultrasound transducer is
      used to focus a beam of ultrasound energy into a small volume at a specific target site in
      the body. The focused beam is intended to produce therapeutic hyperthermia in the target
      field while only harmlessly warming the immediately surrounding tissue. Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging is used during the ultrasound treatment, both to focus the ultrasound beam on the
      target field and to perform real-time thermal mapping at and around the target.

      The Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU system is expected to be efficacious in reducing pain scores in
      patients with painful bone metastases and in reducing their pain medication usage.

    <description>Pain is measured using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire. Patients are categorized into:
Complete response (CR): Pain score 0 without analgesic increase
Partial response (PR): Pain reduction of 2 or more without analgesic increase; or analgesic reduction of 25% without pain increase
Pain Progression (PP): Pain increase of 2 or more with stable analgesic use; or increase of 25% or more in analgesic use, with pain score stable or 1 point above baseline
No response corresponds to all other cases
Patients with PR or CR at 30 days are considered responders to therapy.</description>
