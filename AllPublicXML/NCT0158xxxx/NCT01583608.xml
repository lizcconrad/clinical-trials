  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The registry aims to evaluate the safety, performance and efficacy of the Everolimus-eluting
      bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) system in patients with de novo native coronary artery
      lesions in all-day clinical practice.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bioresorbable scaffolds are transient implants. They act like drug-eluting metallic stents
      (DES) during the first 3 months by supporting the vessel wall thereby keeping the artery
      patent. Subsequently, resorption of the scaffold begins and its structure loosens. As a
      result of everolimus release, neointimal growth is inhibited similar to DES. Finally the
      implant is reabsorbed completely in about 2-3 years. BVS in terms of late stent thrombosis
      may be safer than DES. Transiently scaffolded vessels may regain their natural curvature and
      angulation as well as response to nitroglycerine and endothelial function.

        The recommendation to implant BVS in an individual patient is purely based on clinical
        grounds. These are determined by the instructions for use (IFU) of the BVS and by the
        clinical experience accumulated so far from clinical studies.These studies suggest that the
        BVS should be implanted under certain conditions, which are determined by the patient and
        the coronary lesion treated:
