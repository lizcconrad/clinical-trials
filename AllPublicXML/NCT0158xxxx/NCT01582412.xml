        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a body weight of at least 45 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) of
             18.0 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Results for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) must

             spermicide and condom) to prevent pregnancy and agrees to continue using this method
             from Screening until 3 weeks after the follow-up visit at the end of the study; and is

             months prior to Screening

          -  The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs or complementary and alternative
