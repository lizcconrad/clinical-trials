  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical studies will analyze the interactions between progesterone, nicotine,
      fMRI measures of patterns of brain activity, covariance with endocrine hormones, mood and
      cardiovascular measures. It is hypothesized that the administration of progesterone at a dose
      that mimics luteal phase levels in normal cycling women will diminish the positive subjective
      effects of nicotine, as has been consistently observed for cocaine. This novel approach could
      have direct implications for facilitating smoking cessation treatment in women of
      reproductive age

      These clinical studies will examine the effects of progesterone on the acute effects of IV
      nicotine and on patterns of brain activation in areas of the brain with high levels of
      nicotine receptors. This will be correlated with serum nicotine levels, nicotine-induced
      changes in subjective states, and endocrine measures of the HPA and HPG axes. The temporal
      covariance of progesterone's effects on serum nicotine levels and nicotine-induced changes in
      subjective states and cardiovascular measures will be analyzed.

      The covariance between the effects of progesterone on nicotine-induced changes in BOLD fMRI,
      endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with increases
      in serum nicotine and cotinine levels will be determined.

    <description>We are examining the effects of progesterone on the acute effects of IV nicotine and BOLD signal active in areas of the brain with high levels of nicotine receptors. Correlational analyses between brain activation patterns, serum nicotine levels, serum/plasma hormone levels, and nicotine-induced changes in subjective statues, as measured by a visual analog scale, are being evaluated.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be given an IV challenge dose of nicotine or placebo in a constant volume of 2 mL on any study day. The nicotine solution (1.0 mg/70kg or 1.5 mg/70kg or 2.0 mg/70kg) will be administered over 1 min. This rate of drug delivery (2 mL over one minute) has been safe in our IRB-approved studies of nicotine. Most investigators have administered nicotine over 10 seconds without any adverse reactions. We concur with the IRB recommendation that the lower doses (1.0 mg/70kg and 1.5 mg/70 kg) will be administered first and the higher dose (2.0 mg/70kg) will be administered last.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15 cigarettes
             every day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence will be
             eligible for participation.

          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and
             physical examination by a qualified physician.

          -  Absence of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders other than nicotine dependence (305.10) as measured
             by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID).

          -  Routine laboratory blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN and
             creatinine, liver function tests, hepatitis panel and urinalysis will be performed.
             Laboratory parameters must be within the normal range. HBsAg must be negative but
