    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to learn more about the dosing and safety of ertapenem
      in women with suspected serious infections less than 42 days from the delivery of their
      infant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ertapenem has received FDA approval for the indication of acute pelvic infection, though
      there is no pharmacokinetic data to guide dosing of ertapenem in postpartum women. The
      physiologic changes of the postpartum period make it likely that this special population
      requires dosing modification to achieve desired therapeutic targets. The objective of this
      study is to obtain a detailed knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of ertapenem during the
      postpartum period that will result in improved guidelines on maternal dosing and neonatal
      exposure. This is a prospective, open-label, single center, pharmacokinetic study of
      ertapenem in women diagnosed with postpartum endometritis. Subjects will include up to 24
      women receiving treatment for a diagnosis of postpartum endometritis with ertapenem in the
      Duke University Hospital Labor &amp; Delivery Unit. Each patient will participate in the study
      for approximately 7 days, though the total study duration is expected to be approximately 12
      months. Descriptive statistics for the subjects will be calculated. The appropriate
      non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed, including AUC24, AUCss, Cmax,
      CL, Vss, t1/2. All subjects who receive one dose of study drug will be followed for safety,
      with planned internal review of safety data following the completion of 12 patients. Nursing
      infants of study subjects will also be followed for safety due to the potential for exposure
      to study drug through breastmilk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older at the time of enrollment.

          -  Postpartum period &lt; 42 days at the time of enrollment.

          -  Sufficient venous access to permit administration of study medication.

          -  2 clinical signs of postpartum endometritis:

               -  Oral body temperature of &gt; 101oF at any time, or a temperature of 100.4 on two
                  occasions 6 hours apart.

               -  Maternal tachycardia that parallels the temperature.

               -  Uterine tenderness

               -  Purulent vaginal discharge

          -  Findings of advanced endometritis: dynamic ileus, pelvic peritonitis, pelvic abscess,
             bowel obstruction, necrosis of the lower uterine segment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of previous hypersensitivity reactions to beta lactams.

          -  Receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium.

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min as calculated by the Cockroft-Gault equation.

          -  Subject with a medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with the pharmacokinetic evaluation of the medication, place the subject at
             an unacceptable risk of injury, or render the subject unable to meet the requirements
             of the protocol.

          -  Previous participation in the study.

          -  Exposure to ertapenem in the week prior to the study
