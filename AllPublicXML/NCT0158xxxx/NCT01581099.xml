      Introduction- Primary prevention is the main strategy to control the global burden of
      cardiovascular disease. In clinical practice, food restriction represents a valuable
      preventive resource. However, low adhesion rates and diet abandonment are considered
      important obstacles in treatment. Considering the discovery of new markers and mechanisms
      that relate food restriction and to all other cardiovascular risk factors, it is possible and
      necessary to seek for efficient alternatives to increase adherence and effectiveness of the
      preventive dietetic treatment. Surgical procedures can be used as a mechanism to promote food
      restriction. The bariatric surgery have gained importance not only for its potential
      application in obesity treatment but also in the control of cardiovascular risk factors
      refractory to medical treatment. Among bariatric operations, there is a group called
      digestive adaptations III that has specific characteristics.This surgical intervention
      modifies intestinal tract by reducing gastric volume and performing an anastomosis between
      ileum and stomach, creating a bipartition in the gut. This structural modification promotes
      satiety and increased insulin sensitivity more intensely than other surgical strategies. The
      effects of Digestive Adaptation III surgery on cardiovascular risk factors and on markers
      related to the development of atherosclerosis are not yet established.

      Objectives - To investigate the effect of Digestive Adaptation III surgery on clinical and
      laboratory parameters and cardiovascular risk factors.

      Methods - Twenty diabetics volunteers refractory to medical treatment and who have abdominal
      obesity will be included in the study. Of this group, half will be randomly selected to
      perform the Digestive Adaptations III surgery. All participants will undergo clinical and
      biochemical tests on the same occasions, up to thirty days before surgery, three twenty-four
      months after surgery. On these occasions besides the lipid profile and glucose, we will
      determine incretin hormones, adipokines and assess the amount of epicardial fat.
