      This study is an international multicentre randomised study of organ confined low and
      intermediate risk prostate cancer and is composed of two parallel randomisation schemes based
      on applicability of surgery as a treatment for the patient. Patients for whom surgery is a
      consideration are randomised to either laparoscopic prostatectomy or prostate SBRT. Patients
      for whom surgery is not a consideration are randomised to either conventionally fractionated
      radiation therapy or prostate SBRT. Efficacy, toxicity and quality of life outcomes will be
      compared across the pairs in each randomisation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: All of the following criteria are mandatory for inclusion:

          -  Histological confirmation of prostate adenocarcinoma with a minimum of 10 biopsy cores
             taken within 18 months of randomisation.

          -  Gleason score ≤ 3+4

          -  Men aged ≥18

          -  Clinical and MRI stage T1c -T2c, N0-X, M0-X (TNM 6th Edition [72], See Appendix 1)

          -  PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml

          -  Pre-enrollment PSA must be completed within 60 days of randomisation

          -  Patients belonging in one of the following risk groups according to the National
             Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org):

               -  Low risk: Clinical stage T1-T2a and Gleason ≤ 6 and PSA &lt; 10 ng/ml, or

               -  Intermediate risk includes any one of the following:

               -  Clinical stage T2b orT2c

               -  PSA 10-20 ng/ml or

               -  Gleason 3+4

          -  WHO performance status 0 - 2

          -  Prostate volume ≤ 90 cc measured within 6 months of randomisation (height*width*length
             *π/6)

          -  Ability of the research subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

        Exclusion criteria: One of the following criteria is sufficient for exclusion:

          -  Clinical stage T3 or greater

          -  Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3

          -  High risk disease defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org)

          -  Previous malignancy within the last 2 years (except basal cell carcinoma or squamous
             cell carcinoma of the skin), or if previous malignancy is expected to significantly
             compromise 5 year survival

          -  Prior pelvic radiotherapy

          -  Prior androgen deprivation therapy (including LHRH agonists and antagonists and
             anti-androgens)

          -  Any prior active treatment for prostate cancer. Patients previously on active
             surveillance are eligible if they continue to meet all other eligibility criteria.

          -  Life expectancy &lt;5 years

          -  Bilateral hip prostheses or any other implants/hardware that would introduce
             substantial CT artifacts

          -  Medical conditions likely to make radiotherapy inadvisable eg inflammatory bowel
             disease, significant urinary symptoms

          -  Anticoagulation with warfarin/ bleeding tendency making fiducial placement or surgery
             unsafe in the opinion of the clinician (see section 11, Treatment).

          -  Participation in another concurrent treatment protocol for prostate cancer
