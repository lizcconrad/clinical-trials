      Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of WF10 infusions in the treatment of subjects
      with persistent allergic rhinitis.

      Study Design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-centre
      trial.

      Subjects 50 subjects (25 per treatment group) with history of persistent allergic rhinitis
      for at least 2 years prior to enrolment and a positive allergen skin test. Subjects will be
      required to have a minimum mean score ≥6 for the baseline Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)
      (mean score of morning and evening reflective TNSS assessments for the 3 days prior to
      randomization and treatment.

      Treatments At the first treatment visit (T1), subjects that comply with the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: WF10, or placebo.

      Each individual treatment dose of study drug solution is 0.5 mL/kg body weight, diluted into
      500 mL saline solution. Treatment will be administered once daily for 5 consecutive days
      (Visits T1-T5) via intravenous infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. History of persistent allergic rhinitis for at least 2 years prior to enrolment.
             Concurrent history of asthma is permitted.

          2. Positive allergen skin test to the relevant allergen(s), performed within the previous
             2 years prior to enrolment.

          3. Mean score ≥6 for the baseline Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS)

          4. Screening laboratory values within normal range, except those related to the primary
             disease, including eosinophil count, and elevated glucose is allowed.

          5. Age between 18 and 70 years, inclusive.

          6. The subject must be able to read and understand German well enough to answer the
             questions in the TNSS and Mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire
             (MiniRQLQ), without any translation or explanation.

          7. If female, the subject:

               1. Cannot become pregnant because she is surgically sterile (hysterectomy or tubal
                  ligation), or is postmenopausal for at least 6 months prior to the screening
                  visit.
