  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder joint, specially the rotator cuff, is one of the most complicated joints of the
      human body. If the tendon has to be fixed at the bone during surgery, the weak point in
      obtaining a successful surgery is the fixation of the tendon at the bone insertion site.
      Tendon belongs to the bradytrophic tissue conditional on the reduced blood flow, deep mitosis
      rate and lowered healing potential.

      The patients in this study have 60 years or more. The tissue of these patients isn't as good
      as in young patients. The patch will be used to improve the strength of the tendon at the
      insertion site and the ingrowth process of the new tissue at this area. Additionally the
      investigators can boost the healing process with a selective use of PRP (PRP = platelet rich
      plasma). In this process, the healing site is delivered with an elevated concentration of
      thrombocytes and also growth factors which are constituent parts of them.

    <measure>Oxford Shoulder Score (Questionnaire)</measure>

    <measure>QuickDASH Questionnaire (Short version of Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>3/6/24mo</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Outcome Measure is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire designed to measure physical function and symptoms in patients with any or several musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.
The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH Outcome Measure. Instead of 30 items, the QuickDASH uses 11 items to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3/6/24 mo</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal.Applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care as well as in population health surveys.</description>

    <measure>ASES Score (American Shoulder And Elbow Surgeons Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>3/6/24mo</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES was developed to measure functional limitations and shoulder pain in people with musculoskeletal pathologies. Pain score was calculated from a single pain question on a visual analog scale (pain symptoms) and a function score from the sum of 10 questions addressing function using a 4-point ordinal scale (physical function). Pain and function are weighted equally and the total score ranges from 0 to 100 points, where 0 = worst and 100 = best.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant Murley Score (CMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3/6/24 mo</time_frame>
    <description>The CMS is a 100-point scoring system that is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), range of motion (40 points) and strength (25 points).Pain and activities of daily living are self-reported by the patient using visual analog scales and ordinal categories. Range of motion is obtained during active painfree elevation in flexion and abduction (using a goniometer), and functional internal and external rotation of the shoulder (using ordinal scale). Strength testing was performed at 90° of abduction in the scapular plane.</description>
