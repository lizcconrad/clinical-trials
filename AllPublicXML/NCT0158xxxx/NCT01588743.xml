  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that Long-term hyperglycemia (also known as glucose toxicity) contribute to
      impairment in islet β-cell function and development of insulin resistance. A growing body of
      evidence also indicates that this impairment inβ-cell function and insulin action could be
      restored after hyperglycemia is corrected by short-term intensive insulin therapy. In this
      study, we are determined to use the golden standard of insulin sensitivity evaluation in
      vivo—hyperinsulinemia euglycemic glucose clamp—to estimate insulin resistance improvement in
      patients before and after intensive insulin therapy, investigate first phase insulin
      secretion to evaluate β-cell function, examine the changes in insulin resistance and insulin
      secretion resulting from normalization of plasma glucose levels in both lean and obese
      patients by insulin pump therapy.

    <description>Insulin Aspart will be administrated by insulin pump with an initial dose of 0.4-0.6u/kg body weight, of which 50% basal rate and the other 50% bolus dose. Time interval for administration will be as follows: 0-3Am-9Am-12Am-5Pm-9Pm-0Am. Specific adjustment will be made according to individual difference.</description>
