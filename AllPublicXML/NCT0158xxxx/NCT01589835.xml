  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly six million Canadians are living with an increased risk of diabetes (prediabetes) and
      approximately 50% of these will develop type 2 diabetes within five years. The investigators
      wish to help these people change their lifestyle, to prevent them from getting diabetes.
      Trials have shown that by supporting people with prediabetes to be more active and have
      healthier eating habits they can halve their risk. However, these interventions were very
      costly and not performed in Canada. With the help of local Family Physicians and other health
      professionals (e.g. physiotherapy, psychology, endocrinology, nursing) the investigators have
      created a less expensive intervention suitable for the Canadian population and health system.
      The investigators need to perform a study to see whether these modified approaches are
      practical for Canadians and likely to be effective. People at risk will be invited to
      participate from family practices that have helped us in the initial stages of this program.
      Family practices will be randomized to giving either the study intervention or continue with
      the physician's usual care. People receiving the intervention will have an appointment with
      their family doctor to discuss their exercise and eating habits and agree changes that are
      necessary. A prescription detailing these changes will be completed and signed by the family
      physician and participant. Participants will be given the name of a lifestyle change
      facilitator (LCF) who will receive a copy of the prescription and contact the participant to
      help them set achievable goals. The LCF will contact participants once a month for six months
      to help them achieve these goals. The investigators eventual aim is to test this intervention
      in a large-scale randomized control trial. To achieve this it is necessary to pilot all
      aspects of the trial. Information from the pilot study can then be used to design and perform
      a large-scale study effectively. The investigators hope that eventually the numbers of
      Canadians progressing to having diabetes will be reduced.
