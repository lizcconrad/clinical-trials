      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 administered
      intravenously in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin (CDDP)in patients with
      locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer.

    <textblock>
      GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has shown the ability to preferentially locate,
      colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 40 different human tumors. A First-in-Man,
      Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 intravenously
      administered to patients with a variety of advanced solid tumor entities has shown that
      GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of antitumor
      activity. Preclinical studies have further shown synergistic effects with the use of
      chemotherapy (Cisplatin) and viral therapy with GL-ONC, as well as favorable results when
      cancer cells are irradiated and then treated with GL-ONC1 in animal models. This Phase I
      study seeks to evaluate the safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy of GL-ONC1
      administered intravenously in combination with standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy (RT)
      and cisplatin (CDDP)in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients
      will be individually assessed for safety and dose limiting toxicity. Viral colonization in
      tumors, replication and anti-tumoral activity will also be evaluated.
