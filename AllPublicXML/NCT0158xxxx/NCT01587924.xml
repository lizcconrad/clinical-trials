    <textblock>
      This is a four-week, Phase IIa, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center
      study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of switching subjects from stable
      rhEPO to GSK1278863 in approximately 68 hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease. The study consists of a screening phase of 2 weeks, a
      4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values for study
      eligibility is 9.5-12.0 g/dL and the subjects must have received the same rhEPO product with
      total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to the Screening
      visit (Week -1. This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and
      Hgb response in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic
      kidney disease after switching from a stable maintenance dose of recombinant human
      erythropoetin (rhEPO).

      This is a four-week, Phase IIa, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center
      study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of switching subjects from stable
      rhEPO to GSK1278863 in approximately 68 hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia
      associated with chronic kidney disease. The study consists of a screening phase of 2 weeks, a
      4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values for study
      eligibility is 9.5-12.0 g/dL and the subjects must have received the same rhEPO product with
      total weekly doses that varied by no more than 50% during the 4 weeks prior to the Screening
      visit (Week -1. Eligible subjects, stratified by their prior rhEPO dose will be randomized in
      equal proportions to receive double-blind GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg QD (after
      discontinuing their rhEPO), or to continue to receive their existing type and dose of rhEPO
      (epoetins or their biosimilars, or darbepoetin). Study treatment will be stopped if Hgb
      values fall outside of the protocol pre-specified ranges. Subject completion is defined as
      completion of all study phases including the follow-up phase.

      This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and Hgb response in
      hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease
      after switching from a stable maintenance dose of recombinant human erythropoetin (rhEPO). In
      addition, the study will characterize the effect of GSK1278863 on various pharmacokinetic
      (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) markers, and will investigate the safety and tolerability of
      GSK1278863.

      An early interim analysis of the Hgb data is planned after approximately 20 subjects from
      cohort 1 have completed 3 weeks of treatment. Depending upon the interim findings, a second
      cohort of subjects may be added to investigate an additional GSK1278863 dose arm. Recruitment
      to the first cohort will continue during the interim analysis.

      A second interim analysis is planned after approximately 48 subjects from cohort 1 have
      completed 4 weeks treatment. The purpose of this interim is three-fold, to investigate if a
      second cohort of subjects may be added, to facilitate early development of dose-response and
      PK/PD statistical models, and to generate interim results to facilitate design and dosing
      decisions for the next trial.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted in hemodialysis-dependent (HDD) participants from 06 June 2012 till 17 June 2013 across 48 centers in the United States (US), Canada, and European Union. A total of 68 participants were planned to be enrolled.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 103 participants were screened, out of which 83 participants were randomized in the study. The participants were receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) for 2 weeks and had hemoglobin (hgb) range of 9.5 to 12.0 gram per deciliter (g/dL); however, one participant did not receive the study drug.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Modeled Hemoglobin (Hgb) Change From Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) at 4 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Modeled Hgb change from Baseline over 4 weeks of treatment. Change from Baseline is the actual value of Hgb at Week 4 minus the Baseline value. For modeled change at Week 4 participants required a Baseline and two or more non missing post-baseline values. Baseline is the average of Week -2, -1 and Day 1 values. The model included fixed effects for Baseline Hgb, treatment, and treatment by day interaction. Covariate analysis for modeled Hgb change was performed. Random effects were fitted in the intercept and the slope over time.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. An SAE is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above. Only on-treatment data has been presented.</description>

        <description>Each of the plasma concentration-time plot contained one plot on the untransformed scale (i.e. a linear plot) and one plot on the log transformed scale (i.e. log-linear plot). Plasma concentrations were analyzed for the study drug (GSK1278863), and its metabolites namely GSK2391220 (M2), GSK2531403 (M3), GSK2487818A (M4), GSK2506102A (M5), GSK2531398 (M6), and GSK2531401A (M13). Pharmacokinetic analysis was done on Weeks (W) 2 and 4 at a fixed timely interval of 5 hours (h) on W2 and every hour on W4. Only the data for last visit for W2 and last visit of W4 has been presented.</description>

        <description>Vital signs include systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR). Three measurements of SBP, DBP and HR were recorded from the participant in a supine position for at least 5 minutes (allowing enough time between measurement to completely deflate and loosen the inflatable cuff). Data has been presented for vital signs with values high and low from the reference range.</description>

          <description>Vital signs include systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR). Three measurements of SBP, DBP and HR were recorded from the participant in a supine position for at least 5 minutes (allowing enough time between measurement to completely deflate and loosen the inflatable cuff). Data has been presented for vital signs with values high and low from the reference range.</description>
