  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that short term infection-related benefits of human milk feeding are decreased
      by the process of pasteurization. Primary objective of the study is to compare the incidence
      of late-onset sepsis in very low birth weight infants assigned randomly to receive either
      pasteurized or raw expressed mothers'own milk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, all patients born before 32 weeks of
      gestational age and/or with birth weight below 1500 g admitted to the tertiary neonatal
      intensive care unit(NICU) of the University Hospitals Leuven within 24 hours of birth, are
      eligible for inclusion in the study except for infants who died within the first 24 hours.
      Infants whose mothers intend to breastfeed will be randomly assigned, using a digital system,
      to receive either raw or pasteurized mother's own milk. The duration of the study is from
      birth to eight weeks of age or to discharge from the NICU, whichever occurs first. The need
      to ensure proper handling of the milk precludes true blinding of the caregivers. The
      institutional review board approved the study and written informed parental consent iss
      obtained before enrolment.

    <measure>incidence of late-onset sepsis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>the incidence of proven late-onset sepsis, occurring more than 48 hours after birth, with growth of a pathogen or coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) cultured from blood, obtained from a peripheral vein under aseptic conditions, combined with the acute onset of two or more predefined clinical signs and, only in case of growth of a CoNS isolate, at least one laboratory parameter of systemic infection (such as elevated C-reactive protein, left shift or leukopenia).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>necrotizing enterocolitis</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary end points were the incidence of clinical sepsis ; infection site other than bloodstream; the antibiotic utilization rate ; necrotizing enterocolitis stages II and III ; intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leucomalacia; need of respiratory support; chronic lung disease ; severe retinopathy of prematurity; the length of NICU stay for survivors and in-NICU mortality.</description>
