      This is a randomized controlled trial with blinded assessor on the effects of aerobic
      exercise (walking)in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a systemic inflammatory disease that affects mainly the spine
      and compromises globally the physical capacity of the patients. Despite new advances in
      pharmacological therapy, physiotherapy and exercise remain essential in the treatment of AS.
      However, the literature lacks studies showing which types of exercises are more effective in
      patients with AS.

      This is a randomized controlled trial with the objective is to evaluate the effects of
      aerobic training on functional capacity, mobility, disease activity, cardiopulmonary capacity
      and cytokine levels (TNF, IL10, IL6 and IL1) in patients with AS.

      The duration of the trial is 24 weeks with the first 12 weeks reserved to exercise programs.
      The participants will be divided in two groups. The intervention group (IG) will perform
      walking for 50 minutes plus global stretching 3 times a week for 12 weeks. The control group
      (CG) will do only stretching exercises 3 times a week for 12 weeks.

    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a quaestionnaire with 10 questions about functional capacity validated to AS patients. Each question is answered with a visual analogue scale 0-10 cm. Zero means the best, and 10 the worst function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6, 12 and 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (BASDAI) is a instrument with 6 questions about disease activity validated to AS patients. The questions comprise the following areas: back pain, peripheral pain, morning stifness, fatigue and enthesitis.</description>

    <measure>Change in BASMI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, after 6, 12 and 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Mobility Index (BASMI) is an instrument that comprises 5 measures of mobility validated to AS patients. The measurements are: cervical rotation, lumbar flexion (Schober's test modified, intermalleolar distance, lumbar side flexion and tragus to wall. The total score is shown in a 0-10 cm visual analogue scale. The low scores represent better mobility.</description>
