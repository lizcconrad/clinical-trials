    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) of single oral doses of
      ULTRAM Extended Release (ER) at 2 dose levels in adolescents between 12 and 17 years old,
      inclusive (up to 17 years 364 days) with pain due to injury or nonmalignant disease, to the
      PK in adults, with respect to the PK parameter AUC∞ (area under the curve) of racemic
      tramadol. PK explores how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within the body, and
      how it is removed from the body over time.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      2-group, single dose study. Within each group of participants for Parts 1 and 2, at least 1/3
      of the participants will be female, at least 1/3 of the participants will be male, at least
      1/3 of the participants will be below the age of 14 years, and at least 1/3 of the
      participants will be above the age of 16 years. Participants will be assigned to 1 group
      only. Each group of participants will receive a single oral dose of ULTRAM ER on 1 occasion.
      Group 1 will receive a dose of ULTRAM ER that is closest to 2 mg/kg, based on the
      participant's body weight and adjusting the dose in 25 mg increments. Following completion of
      all evaluations of Group 1, the pharmacokinetic data will be evaluated to target a dose for
      Group 2 that will achieve a level of exposure similar to that seen with a single 200 mg
      ULTRAM ER dose in adults. The maximum dose of ULTRAM ER should not exceed 6 mg/kg or 300 mg.
      When the study physician, the investigators, and the medical monitors agree that the PK of
      the drug is well-characterized and that the drug is well tolerated, enrollment will begin for
      Group 2 of the study. The sponsor's responsible Medical Officer will evaluate the safety of
      the calculated dose in Group 2 participants by evaluation of adverse drug events paying
      particular attention to events suggestive of either opioid toxicity or serotonin toxicity.
