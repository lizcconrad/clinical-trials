    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease is a severe medical problem in Taiwan public health issue, which the
      highest incidence and prevalence rate in the world.Proton pump inhibitors may increase the
      risk of pneumonia appearance, which were caused by profound irreversible gastric acid
      suppression. The study purpose was to characterize difference of developing pneumonia in
      chronic kidney disease of prior use proton pump inhibitors.

      The study used data from Taiwan Health Insurance Research Database; the investigators
      conducted a population-based cohort study in Taiwan. Case consisted of all patients who had a
      first diagnosis of chronic kidney disease for the period between 1997 and 2008. The
      investigators utilized the use of Proton pump inhibitor from chronic kidney disease patients.

        Investiators use the longitudinal health insurance database 2008 (LHID 2008) released by
        the Taiwan National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) in 2009. Taiwan implemented its
        National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 1995 to provide affordable health care for all
        the island's residents.
