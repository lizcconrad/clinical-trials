    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the the 1-year rates of ischemic and bleeding
      complications in patients whose dual antiplatelet therapy regimen post-PCI has been
      determined with the use of a clinical algorithm that includes both clinical risks and
      platelet reactivity while on chronic clopidogrel therapy.

      Prospective multicenter registry. Patients already on chronic dual antiplatelet therapy with
      aspirin and clopidogrel will be assessed for (1) clinical risks factors for future bleeding
      and ischemic complications, and (2) on-treatment platelet reactivity as measured by the
      VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (Accumetrics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). These will be considered by
      utilization of a clinical algorithm to determine the dual antiplatelet regimen post-PCI
      (aspirin in combination with 1. clopidogrel, 2. prasugrel 5mg daily, or 3. prasugrel 10mg
      daily).
