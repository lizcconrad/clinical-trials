  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first clinical study of the noval multiple AGC kinase inhibitor, AT13148,
      is to identify the recommended dose for future studies in cancer patients by exploring the
      safety and maximum tolerated dose and biological effects in patients with advanced solid
      tumours.

      AT13148 is a new drug which looks promising in laboratory studies. We now wish to find out if
      it will be useful in treating patients with cancer. AT13148 is a type of drug called a
      protein kinase inhibitor. It blocks several different chemical messengers (enzymes) called
      AGC kinase proteins. These chemical messengers are part of the signaling process within cells
      which can make cells produce chemicals that trigger and control cell growth and cell death.
      In some types of cancer these chemical messengers are 'switched on' or 'switched off'
      permanently due to changes in the genes of cells called &quot;gene mutations&quot; leading to
      uncontrolled cancer cell growth. AT13148 targets multiple protein kinases from three families
      of kinases unlike many of the other protein kinase inhibitors currently being tested which
      target just one or two kinases. This may mean that it will work better and in a wider group
      of cancer patients. Patients will not be selected to take part based on having these gene
      mutations for this first trial because we want to learn more about which mutations are most
      important but this would be the hope for future trials. The patient population anticipated to
      benefit from this drug includes certain types of breast, prostate and ovarian cancer which
      more commonly have these gene mutations.

          3. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          4. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These
             measurements must be performed within 7 days before their first dose of AT13148 taken
             between Day -7 to -4.

             Laboratory Test Value required

             Haemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL

             Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 /L

             Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L

             Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x (ULN)
             unless raised due to tumour in which case up to 5 x ULN is permissible

             a CO-transfer factor &gt; 60%

          6. 18 years or over

          7. Written (signed and dated) informed consent and be capable of co-operating with

             and 4 weeks for investigational medicinal products) before treatment.

          2. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the Drug
             Development Office (DDO) should not exclude the patient.

          4. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female
             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree
             to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal contraception and condom, have a intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm
             with spermicidal gel and condom) during the study and for six months afterwards are

             acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) must be performed in all patients.

         14. Concurrent diabetes requiring treatment (diet-controlled diabetes would be
