  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into two parts; Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to
      select the recommended dose for Part 2 based on the safety, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamic profiles observed after oral administration of GSK525762 in the following
      subjects: NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal
      cancer (CRC), neuroblastoma (NB), castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) breast cancer, and
      MYCN driven solid tumor subjects. Part 2 of the study will explore the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical activity of the recommended dose from Part 1
      in cohorts comprised of NMC, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), and estrogen receptor positive (ER
      positive) breast cancer subjects. Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in the Part 1
      and approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. A sub-study will be opened in Part
      1 to approximately 10-12 subjects in the United States to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of the besylate tablet compared to the amorphous free-base tablet at the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dosing (RP2D), the effect of high-fat
      high-calorie meal on the bioavailability of the besylate tablet at the MTD or RP2D and the
      dose proportionality of two doses of GSK525762 administered as besylate tablet.

             of time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of
             dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects
