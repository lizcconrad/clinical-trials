  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stocking of essential supplies in an emergency department (ED) is crucial in order to
      efficiently and effectively take care of patients. When equipment and supplies are not
      available to patient care providers, an imbalance in the delivery of care is created. The
      amount of time nurses spend away from the bedside obtaining supplies has only been
      superficially studied; however, one study proposed that the majority of nurses spend 5 to 20
      percent or more of their time during a shift. This results in 30 minutes to two-and-a-half
      hours of a twelve hour shift being lost to retrieving supplies that are not available.

      Cabinets and drawers have recently been eliminated in the rooms and stock is kept in &quot;supply
      towers&quot; that contain all the necessary supplies to adequately take care of patients with the
      exception of medications, or stationary supplies. Towers are restocked every morning by a
      stocking technician by taking the towers to the stock room, resupplying them based on
      previously established PAR levels, and utilizing a standard chart that describes exactly what
      supply, and how many to stock within a specified area of the cart.

      During their shift, the stocking technician must also respond to pages concerning low stock
      levels.

      Hypothesis:

      Nurses spend a significant amount of time away from the patient bedside during their shift
      looking for supplies.

      Objectives:

        -  Determine the amount of time nurses spend outside of a patient room obtaining supplies
           to care for the patient.

        -  Determine what supplies are obtained when the room is left.

        -  Determine how many times per shift the nurse leaves to obtain the same item.

        -  Determine if utilizing a &quot;supply tower&quot; located in patient rooms decreases the amount of
           time nurses spend obtaining supplies outside of a patient room to care for patients.

        -  Determine if implementation of a full time stocking technician decreases the amount of
           time that nurses spend outside a patient's room obtaining stock.

        -  Conduct spot checks on carts to determine if PAR levels are over, under, or exactly as
           established.
