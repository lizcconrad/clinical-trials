  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the comparability of the safety and
      efficacy of a generic Butenafine Hydrochloride Cream, 1% (test product) and Lotrimin Ultra®
      (the reference listed drug) in subjects with interdigital tinea pedis. It will also be
      determined whether the efficacy of each of the two active treatments is superior to that of
      the vehicle cream (placebo).
