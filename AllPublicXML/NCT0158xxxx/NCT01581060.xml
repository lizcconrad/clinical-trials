  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of part 1 of this study is to determine the optimal biological dose (OBD) and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) for WX-554 and the recommended dose/dose schedules for the chronic
      treatment in part 2. The aim of part 2 is to further determine the safety and tolerability of
      chronic treatment with WX-554.
