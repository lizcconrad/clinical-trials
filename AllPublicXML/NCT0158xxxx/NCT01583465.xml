  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish whether or not there is a clinical advantage to the
      use of Aquamantys® System from Medtronic Advanced Energy (formerly Salient Surgical
      Technologies) in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty via the anterior supine
      intermuscular surgical approach in terms of blood loss, transfusion and wound healing. Wound
      healing will be assessed by a blinded observer and based upon a simple and subjective
      criteria: a) as expected, b) better than expected or c) worse than expected. The blinded
      observer is experienced in the care of the surgical patient and wound evaluation.

    <textblock>
      To establish in a randomized, blinded study whether or not there is a clinical advantage to
      the use of Aquamantys® System from Medtronic Advanced Energy (formerly Salient Surgical
      Technologies) in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty via the anterior supine
      intermuscular surgical approach in terms of blood loss, transfusion and wound healing based
      on early collected data. Data will be analyzed using StatsDirect in standard fashion to
      elucidate any difference between control and treatment groups. Wound healing will be assessed
      by a blinded observer and based upon a simple and subjective criteria: a) as expected, b)
      better than expected or c) worse than expected. The blinded observer is experienced in the
      care of the surgical patient and wound evaluation.

    <measure>Perioperative Change in Hemoglobin Level</measure>
    <time_frame>From up to 30 days preoperative through postoperative day 1</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will undergo routine lab work perioperatively. No additional studies will be necessary for this protocol. Hemoglobin level will be first measured preoperatively at the time of preadmission testing, which must be performed not more than 30 days prior to surgery, and then measured on postoperative day one. The two levels will be compared to assess the decrease in hemoglobin level resulting from the surgical intervention.</description>

    <measure>Perioperative Blood Transfusion Requirement</measure>
    <time_frame>From the beginning of surgical intervention to hospital discharge, which averages 2 days and may be up to 1 week postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Perioperative blood transfusion requirements will be recorded, including transfusions administered during the surgical intervention and throughout the acute hospital stay.</description>

    <measure>Perioperative Blood Loss</measure>
    <time_frame>From beginning of surgical intervention through hospital discharge, which averages 2 days and may be up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthesia and nursing records will be monitored for blood loss intraoperatively, and postoperatively via drain output. Drains will be pulled daily at 0600 and measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The development of complications in the wound, either as an inpatient or after discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Wound evaluations will occur each postoperative day in hospital (average 2 days and up to 1 week), at 6 weeks, and 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Wound care will be evaluated by a designee who will be blinded to the randomization. Wound will be evaluated for drainage, erythema, and ecchymosis. Additionally, the wound healing will be scored as: Healing better than expected, As expected, or Worse than expected. Wound evaluations will occur each postoperative day in hospital (average 2 days), at 6 weeks, and 1 year.</description>

    <intervention_name>Aquamantys</intervention_name>
    <description>Primary THA via the ASI approach will be performed using the Aquamantys Malleable Bipolar Sealer. The Aquamantys is a bipolar device that combines radio-frequency energy and saline to gently reach targeted tissue and provide a biomechanical seal. The saline acts as a conduit to allow the energy to penetrate the tissue from 1 to 2 mm where the collagen is transformed thus providing the seal. The saline also helps cool the tissue which allows for gentle handling of tissue, eliminating the black char that is a port for infection. The surgeon uses the Aquamantys to assist in tissue dissection, cauterize vessels, and to pre-treat fat pad in front of capsule prior to excision, to treat the entire anterior hip capsule prior to excision, treat oozing bone surfaces not covered by an implant.</description>
