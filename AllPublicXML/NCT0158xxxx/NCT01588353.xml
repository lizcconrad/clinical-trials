    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>104 patients were enrolled, and 102 received AK160. This study proceeded stepwise from Step1 through Step3. First, 6 patients were enrolled in Step1 at the selected study centers, thereafter, 71 and 25 patients were enrolled in Steps2 and3 respectively at all centers. The primary endpoint was determined in 77 participants enrolled in Steps1 and 2.</recruitment_details>
