  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the sodium channel inhibitor, GSK2339345. Cohort 1 will assess the safety,
      tolerability and PK of single ascending doses of GSK2339345 administered via an aqueous
      droplet inhaler in healthy subjects. Cohort 2 will assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of
      repeat doses of GSK2339345 administered four times a day for two consecutive days via an
      aqueous droplet inhaler.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      effects of GSK2339345 in healthy subjects. GSK2339345 is a blocker of neuronal voltage gated
      sodium channels in development for the treatment of chronic cough, excessive cough and
      post-viral and viral (acute) cough. Inhaled pan NaV inhibitors are associated with
      oropharyngeal sensation perturbation and so this study will establish the potential local
      sensate effects of GSK2339345 at multiples of the predicted inhaled therapeutic dose. This
      study also aims to define the maximum tolerated dose of GSK2339345 administered via an
      aqueous droplet inhaler. Cohort 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      cross-over, inhaled single-dose escalating study using an aqueous droplet inhaler. Cohort 1
      will include assessments of sensate changes via a 4 point scale, assessment of taste via an
      11 point scale, and PK assessments to investigate the PK profile of GSK2339345. Cohort 2 of
      this study is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, inhaled repeat
      dose study using a aqueous droplet inhaler. Subjects will be randomised to receive 2000
      microgram of GSK2339345 or placebo four times a day for two consecutive study days. Similar
      assessments of sensations to those used in Cohort 1 will be performed. The potential for
      systemic cardiovascular (CV) or central nervous system (CNS) effects will also be assessed
      throughout the study via observation. Cohort 2 will also include PK assessments to
      investigate the PK profile of GSK2339345. Placebo will be used throughout the study as a
      control.

          -  A 24 hour Holter ECG at screening that demonstrates no clinically significant
             abnormalities or finding that could interfere with interpretation of the study
             results, when assessed by an appropriately trained and experienced reviewer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities

             • An average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. One unit
             is equivalent to 8 g of alcohol: a half-pint (~240 ml) of beer, 1 glass (125 ml) of
             wine or 1 (25 ml) measure of spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

             of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a history of
             drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical Monitor,
             contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Unable to refrain from consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or
             grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit
