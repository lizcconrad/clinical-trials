  <brief_title>Drug Interaction Study of SAR302503 in Patients With Solid Tumor</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Two-treatment Crossover Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study of Repeated Doses of SAR302503 on Pharmacokinetics of a Single Dose Cocktail of Omeprazole, Metoprolol, and Midazolam Used as Probe Substrates for CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Activities, Respectively in Adult Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</official_title>

      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the effect of 15-day repeated oral doses of 500 mg SAR302503 on the cytochrome
           P450 activity using a CYP probe cocktail (2C19, 2D6 and 3A4).

        -  To document pharmacokinetics of SAR302503 after repeated 500 mg oral daily doses.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety profile of 15-day repeated oral doses of 500 mg SAR302503 in
           Segment 1

        -  To characterize the safety and tolerability of 28-day consecutive doses of 500 mg
           SAR302503 in Segment 2

        -  To determine antitumor activity in Segment 2

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess
      eligibility (screening period 21 days), followed by a treatment period of at least 15 days of
      study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last
      administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue if patients are receiving
      benefit and do not have unacceptable toxicity or meet study withdrawal criteria.
