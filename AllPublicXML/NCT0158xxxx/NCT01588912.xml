  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral antiviral drugs which can be given to patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B
      include Lamivudine, Clevudine, Adefovir, Telbivudine, Entecavir and Tenofovir. 2009 American
      Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) Treatment Guidelines and 2009 European
      association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Treatment Guidelines recommend the
      administration of Entecavir or Tenofovir with high potency and low resistance. Lamivudine has
      low antiviral potency and high incidence of mutation in long-term administration compared to
      Entecavir or Tenofovir. Clevudine causes the elevated creatinine kinase (CK), side effects
      including myositis/myopathy and much mutation in the long-term administration. Globe study
      demonstrated Telbivudine had more excellent antiviral potency than Lamivudine, which was also
      comparable to or higher than Entecavir or Tenofovir. Nevertheless, the choice of treatment
      drugs can be limited due to the mutation rate of 25% for 2 years. However, the analysis of
      Globe study results showed that 2-year treatment progress was very good in patient who showed
      virologic response at 24 weeks after the initiation of treatment and that high antiviral
      potency and low mutation rate were observed when the Telbivudine roadmap strategy (in the
      event that virologic response is shown at 24 weeks, telbivudine monotherapy is maintained and
      in the event that virologic response is not shown, tenofovir add-on therapy is done) recently
      implemented and announced in 2011 Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver
      (APASL) was applied. However, the study was single arm study, which restricted the comparison
      between Entecavir and Tenofovir monotherapy groups. Therefore, this study intends to compare
      the anti-viral effect and mutation rate between Entecavir 0.5mg monotherapy group and
      Telbivudine roadmap strategy group in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B
      through a randomized study.

  <detailed_description>

      104 treatment-naïve patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B who fulfill the
      inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Telbivudine 600mg
      monotherapy or Entecavir monotherapy with stratification before randomization according to
      presence of cirrhosis. For Telbivudine group, Telbivudine monotherapy or Tenofovir combined
      therapy will be done according to virologic response at 24 weeks and the primary study will
      be completed at Week 48 and treatment response will be analyzed. The treatment will be
      extended to Week 96 and the secondary analysis will be performed then.
