      Strengthening exercises of Pelvic Floor Muscles (PFM) is the first line treatment for female
      pelvic floor dysfunction. Actually the best position to facilitate PFM force is controversial
      in different studies. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of ankle positions on
      pelvic ﬂoor muscle force during PFM exercises.

      This clinical trial study was carried out on 58 women aged 25-55 years with relaxation of
      pelvic floor muscles who referred to women's clinic of educational hospitals of Mashhad
      University of Medical Sciences in 1389. After clinical examination and confirmation of pelvic
      floor muscle relaxation, women were randomize divided into 3 groups, doing strengthening
      exercises of PFM in standing position with passive ankle dorsi ﬂexion (on wooden surface with
      15 degree angle)(n=20), active ankle plantar ﬂexion with arm up (standing on toe)(n=20) and
      horizontal standing position (n=19) for 8 weeks. PFM exercises were instructed to women by
      using a pamphlet and face to face education. They were followed up every two week by
      telephone call and were asked to refer to women's clinic after 4 &amp; 8 weeks. Pelvic floor
      muscles strength was assessed with brink score before and after intervention. Data analyzed
      by using analytic-descriptive statistics.
