  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea is known to be a significant source of morbidity in the general
      population. It has been proposed to be associated with the development of preeclampsia and
      fetal growth restriction. As these are conditions that have long term maternal and neonatal
      implications, further information may help improve maternal/fetal outcome. One reason why
      women and in particular pregnant women are under diagnosed is the lack of an effective,
      reliable screening tool. Validated questionnaires used in the general population may not be
      effective in screening pregnant women. The investigators hypothesize that sleep apnea will
      have 20% prevalence in the obese pregnant population and that it is associated with increased
      maternal and neonatal morbidity. The investigators will recruit obese pregnant women in their
      prenatal care clinics and they will be screened for OSA using validated sleep questionnaires
      including the Epworth sleepiness scale, the Fatigue Scale and the Berlin Questionnaire. The
      subjects will then perform overnight apnea monitoring utilizing a portable sleep apnea
      detection device. Women who meet clinical criteria for OSA will be referred for overnight
      polysomnogram and management by the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division of the Internal
      Medicine Department. For all enrolled patients the remainder of prenatal care will be per
      routine. Data will be collected regarding the pregnancy course and outcomes.

      The primary outcome of interest is the prevalence of sleep apnea in obese women and the
      associated maternal and neonatal morbidity. The secondary outcome measures will be molecular
      measures of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and angiogenesis associated with sleep
      apnea.
