  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre European double-blind,randomized and controlled trial with 2 parallel
      groups (1 study medication, 1 placebo) in order to analyse the impact of ACE inhibitors
      (ACEi) in subjects who carry a mutation but have not yet developed DCM (dilated
      cardiomyopathy).

      Objective of the trial: Study the impact of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) in subjects who carry a
      mutation (leading to a genetic form of heart failure) but have not yet developed DCM.

      Context. Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of Heart Failure due to
      systolic dysfunction and at least 30% of DCM are of familial/genetic origin, usually with
      autosomal dominant inheritance, and underlying genes and mutations are increasingly
      identified. Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy (fDCM) is characterized by age-related penetrance
      (or delayed-onset), that means that the cardiac expression of the disease (echocardiographic
      abnormalities) is usually absent for a long period and progressively appears with advanced
      age, usually after 20 years of age

      Hypothesis : ACEi may delay or prevent the occurrence of DCM in these subjects (pre-clinical
      stage).

      Expected results: If the hypothesis is confirmed, and as a consequence, the knowledge derived
      from basic research (genes identification in DCM) will be translated into clinical practice
      (early identification of subjects at high risk of developing heart failure through predictive
      genetic testing) with the development of new therapeutic management (early ACEi) that will
      help to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. This will
      constitute a paradigm of the development of preventive medicine thanks to the development of
      genetics in the cardiovascular field.

      Subjects who are concerned are ≥18 years of age and ≤60 years, carry a mutation responsible
      for DCM and are at a preclinical stage of the disease. Total duration of treatment
      (perindopril versus placebo) is 3 years. A total number of 200 participants will be enrolled
      (100 in each group) in 7 centres.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: ≥18 years and ≤60 years

          -  At least one family member should have a clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy
             (LVEF&lt;45% and LVEDD&gt;112%)and should not be considered as the burn-out phase of another
             cardiomyopathy (such as HCM, ARVC). LV noncompaction may co-exist with DCM in this
             patient.NB:in a patient with a mutation in LMNA gene, LVEDD may be normal whereas EF
             is markedly reduced, so that only a reduced LVEF is mandatory(LVEF&lt;45%).

          -  Carriers of the mutation that has been identified in the family as associated with
             DCM, and who have received appropriate genetic counselling before and after the
             announcement of the genetic result. The mutation within the family should be
             considered as disease-causing.

          -  No obvious DCM as assessed by diagnostic criteria indicated elsewhere on
             echocardiography (WHO &amp; Mestroni et al. 1999 and Mahon et al. 2005: references 3 and
             9): LVEF &lt;45% and enlarged LVEDD (&gt;112% of predicted value according to age,BSA).

          -  Presence of minor LV abnormality:

               -  isolated LVEDD &gt; 112% (Henry Formula)

               -  or reduced systolic dysfunction: 45% &lt; LVEF &lt; 55%, as assessed on
                  echocardiography.

          -  Able to understand and accept the study constraints

          -  For some European countries (such as France and Spain): participants (by themselves)
             should have medical health care coverage to be included in a research study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other disease or factor that can cause minor LV abnormalities, such as cardiotoxic

             significant hypertrophy on echocardiography).

          -  Contraindication to ACE inhibitor

          -  Participants who are already treated with ACE inhibitor, sartan or aldosterone
             receptor antagonists (for various reason such as arterial hypertension) can not be
             included in this study, unless they have been off these drugs for a period of 6 weeks
             before inclusion.

          -  Impaired renal function: estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), using MDRD
             formula, &lt; 60 ml/mn/1.73m2.

          -  Baseline serum potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/L.
