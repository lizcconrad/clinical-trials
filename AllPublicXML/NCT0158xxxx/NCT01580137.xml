  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if we can predict the progress of acute upper
      respiratory tract infection to acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in Finnish conscripts by
      symptoms, clinical, endoscopic or radiological findings, middle meatal swab samples or nitric
      oxide measurement.

  <detailed_description>

      We will recruit conscripts with upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) during a two
      month period. We will recruit non-allergic conscripts. These conscripts should either have
      not had history of recurrent ABR or they should have experienced recurrent acute (ABR)
      bacterial rhinosinusitis at least 3 times during the last two years (diagnosed by a doctor
      and at least one time with x-ray or sinus puncture). The recruits will keep a record of their
      symptoms. They will be examined by a doctor soon after the symptoms have started (2-4 days)
      and when the symptoms have lasted about 7-10 days. Clinical examination, nasal endoscopy and
      ultrasonographic examination of the maxillary sinuses are made, middle meatal specimen for
      bacteria and bacteria-pcr are taken, virus-pcr samples are taken from the nostril and
      nasopharynx, Nitric oxide-measurements from both nasal cavities are recorded. Cone beam CT of
      the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses is made during the first examination, 2-4 days later and
      during the last examination. If the last CT-scan shows any other radiological signs than mild
      mucosal oedema in either maxillary sinus, maxillar sinus puncture is made and secretion is
      aspirated for culture and PCR. Biopsy from the mucosa of nasal cavity (middle meatal area) is
      taken to examine the cilia and possible bacteria biofilm.
