      In the present study the investigators will measure the extent of coronary artery disease via
      coronary angiography and the correlating risk factors.

      In the present study the investigators will examine the risk factors determining the
      development, extent and the manifestation of coronary artery disease. The study will recruit
      patients undergoing coronary angiography for clinical purposes.

        Diabetics and non-diabetics with or without known CV disease who are admitted in the
        Department of Cardiology in the University Hospital of Ioannina and undergo coronary
        angiography for clinical purposes will be studied. The study will include subjects who 1)
        have suspected CAD and undergo a scheduled diagnostic angiogram for clinical reasons, and
        2) are hospitalized because of an acute coronary syndrome and thus undergo diagnostic
        angiography (with or without previous history of CAD). Patients revascularized in the past,
        with either coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention, will be
        excluded from the study since it is not possible to describe the extent of CAD in these
        patients.

        We plan to recruit about 1,000 patients in about 2 years in order for valid conclusions to
        be drawn from the studies associating CV risk factors to the presence and extent of CAD as
        well as for the gene polymorphisms studies.
