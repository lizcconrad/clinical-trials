        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female children and adolescents aged 2 to &lt;18 years

          -  Written informed consent provided by parent(s)/legal representative(s) of the
             pediatric patient and patient's assent if appropriate

          -  Able to understand and/or follow study instructions alone or with parental assistance

          -  Diagnosed with the Ewing family of tumors or Rhabdomyosarcoma

          -  Scheduled to receive 1 of the following CTX regimens (inpatient or outpatient)

          -  For the Ewing family of tumors:

               -  vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin/etoposide (VIDE); with concomitant sodium
                  2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA) according to local standards

               -  vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide/etoposide
                  (VDC/IE); with concomitant MESNA treatment according to local standards

          -  For rhabdomyosarcoma:

               -  vincristine/actinomycin/cyclophosphamide (VAC)

               -  vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide/etoposide
                  (VDC/IE); with concomitant MESNA treatment according to local standards

          -  Chemotherapy-naïve

          -  Body weight ≥15 kg

          -  White blood cell (WBC) count &gt;2.5 x 109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x
             109/L, and platelet count ≥100 x 109/L (at screening and prior to CTX)

          -  For patients aged ≥12 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance

             abstinence). For purposes of this study, a fertile female patient is any female
             patient who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone tubal ligation.

          -  Female patients who have attained menarche must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous exposure to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim or other G-CSFs in
             clinical development within 6 months prior to the XM22 administration

          -  Known hypersensitivity to filgrastim, pegfilgrastim or lenograstim or any other G-CSF

          -  Fertile patients who do not agree to use highly reliable contraceptive measures during
             the entire duration of the study

          -  Prior bone marrow or stem cell transplant, or prior radiation to ≥25% of bone marrow
             (e.g. whole pelvic radiation) for any reason, or any therapeutic radiation within the
             3 weeks prior to the XM22 dose

          -  Ongoing active infection or history of infectious disease within 2 weeks prior to the
             screening visit

          -  Treatment with lithium at screening or planned during the study.
