      The purpose of the study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of an &quot;enriched,&quot;
      combined music therapy/physical therapy (MT/PT) rehabilitation intervention that addresses
      physical, psychological, and social well-being simultaneously in a group setting to enhance
      post-stroke recovery. The intervention will be implemented through collaboration between the
      Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at NYU Steinhardt and the Motor Recovery Laboratory
      at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, NYU Medical Center.
