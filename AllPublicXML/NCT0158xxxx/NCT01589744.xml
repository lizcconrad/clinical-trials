  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the major complication of the delivery. In clinical
      practice, if after giving birth, the placenta is not expelled naturally, an active management
      should be triggered. Escalating therapy after obstetric maneuvers (placenta, uterus,
      examination of the birth canal), begins with uterotonic treatments for invasive treatments
      lead to embolization, vessel ligation and hysterectomy. However, the morbidity of these
      techniques and the desire to preserve fertility required to devise new therapeutic solutions,
      which have recently led to the development of an innovative medical device intrauterine
      hemostasis.

      The postpartum haemorrhage are mainly the result of weak and bleeding from the surface
      corresponds to the placental insertion, which is no longer localized. With the innovative
      medical device, our main hypothesis is that the uterine walls will append to the walls of the
      cup after depressurization of the latter. The actuation of the suction cup will lead to
      aspiration of all sides of the uterus (it is mostly the anterior and posterior that are
      important). The suction cup is flexible to adapt to the size of the uterus in order to be
      placed and removed easily from the uterine cavity.

      In this study, as a first pass in Human, innovative medical device not CE marked, we did not
      aim to show control of the bleeding stops in the case of PPH but to prove, in a clinical
      situation with no foreseeable risk to the volunteers included (volunteers who have given
      birth without placental abruption after 30 minutes despite the directed delivery), proof of
      concept of using this system in these women that creates a vacuum in the Intra uterine
      Haemostatic vacuum and thus a joining of the walls of the uterus. This first step seems
      essential in order to effectively implement this medical device with serenity in emergency
      situations of PPH.
