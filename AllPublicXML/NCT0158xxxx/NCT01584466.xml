  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbid substance abuse leads to many deleterious effects such as medical comorbidities and
      nonadherence, which is one of the most problematic issues. People with schizophrenia and
      substance use disorders (SUDs) are at an increased risk nonadherence compared to those who do
      not use alcohol and illicit drugs. The investigators propose that this new marketed
      injectable antipsychotic with many benefits over other available long acting injectable
      agents would be beneficial in the dually diagnosed population and may represent a specific
      schizophrenia subpopulation where long acting agents may be considered an important
      therapeutic option.

    <description>Long acting paliperidone palmitate will improve psychotic, negative and depressive symptoms from baseline to endpoint during six months of treatment. Improvement in psychotic symptoms will be measured by decrease in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) psychosis score. Improvement in negative symptoms will be measured by decrease in the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) total score. Improvement in depressive symptoms will be measured by decrease in Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) total score.</description>

    <description>The starting regimen will be a 'loading dose' strategy whereby the first injection will be 234 mg given on treatment week 0,day 1 and 156 mg (2nd injection) will be given 1 week later (days 5-9). Both are recommended to be administered in the deltoid muscle (PI 2011). Following the second dose, monthly maintenance doses will be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle (PI 2011). The monthly (Â± 7 days) maintenance dose will be 117 mg.
Discontinuation of oral antipsychotics is recommended after the subjects receive paliperidone palmitate injection on Week 0/day 1. Continued oral antipsychotics may be used only if necessary.</description>
