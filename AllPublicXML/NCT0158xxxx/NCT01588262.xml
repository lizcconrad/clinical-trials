  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A life threatening disease such as cancer may lead to post traumatic stress disorder, and
      even when reporting low levels of side-effects from cancer disease and treatment, 80% report
      high levels of stress symptoms. The purpose of the present randomised controlled trial is to
      examine the psychosocial effects of a stress management intervention based on cognitive
      behaviour therapy and with focus on increased physical activity in patients with various
      cancer diagnoses using a stepped-care approach. When using a stepped-care approach it is
      possible to study the level and intensity of stress management intervention required to
      achieve increased well-being. A cost-utility analysis will also be performed. 300 adult
      patients with a recent diagnosis of breast-, colorectal- prostate, testicular cancer or
      lymphoma and scheduled for adjuvant and/or curative oncologic treatment at Haukeland
      University Hospital, will be consecutively included in the prospective intervention study.
      The patients will be randomized to intervention or control. In step 1, all patients in the
      intervention group (I-a) will receive 2 counselling sessions. Patients who report clinically
      significant levels of stress, such as intrusive thoughts/avoidance behaviour (measured by
      Impact of Event Scale) and/or worry and depressions (measured by Hospital and Depression
      Scale) will be included in Step 2 (I-b) and include another 4-7 counselling sessions. There
      will also be a focus on motivating to increase physical activity level. Both the intervention
      (I) and control group (C) are allowed to take part in the common rehabilitation program with
      patient education and physical training. Data will be collected with self-reported
      standardized questionnaires. Objectively measures of physical activity level, sleep and daily
      energy expenditure are recorded with SenseWearâ„¢ Pro3 Armband. Measure point is at inclusion
      and than after 6 week, 4, 8, 12 and 24 month.
