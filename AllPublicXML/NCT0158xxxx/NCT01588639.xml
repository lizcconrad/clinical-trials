      This is a prospective, multi-center, open-label, non-interventional, 12-week study in people
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are treated with recombinant human insulin-SciLin N, SciLin
      R and SciLin M30 (alone or in combination) in routine clinical practice. The term study
      insulins will be used in this protocol for these drugs and combinations.
