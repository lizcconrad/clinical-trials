      Insufficient sleep may be one of the most common, and most preventable, obesity risk factors.
      The investigators wish to determine whether 14 nights of modest sleep restriction results in
      increased energy balance, thus potentially increasing the risk of obesity. The investigators
      hypothesize that sleep restriction will result in increased energy balance.

      Numerous studies have reported that self-reported short sleep duration is associated with
      obesity and weight gain. Insufficient sleep may be one of the most common, and most
      preventable, obesity risk factors. Given that sleep restriction is largely voluntary and
      potentially correctable, understanding the mechanisms that link insufficient sleep to
      positive energy balance and the development of obesity, particularly visceral obesity, is
      crucial to clinical applications, public health policy, and informing future studies. The
      investigators wish to determine whether 14 nights of modest sleep restriction results in
      increased energy balance, thus potentially increasing the risk of obesity. The investigators
      will combine energy balance, biomarker, and imaging data with state-of-the art sleep
      monitoring to provide unambiguous data on the effects of sleep restriction on obesity.
      Together, the investigators findings will help explain whether the reduced sleep duration in
      the general population may be contributing to the current epidemic of obesity, and suggest
      strategies to reduce this risk.
