    <textblock>
      Volunteers with healthy corneas will be measured by different instruments to detect their
      anterior corneal power. Only the right eye of each subject was selected. Measurements were
      repeated in the second session scheduled 1 to 2 weeks later.

        The present study's definitions of reproducibility, repeatability and agreement were based
        on those adopted by the British Standards Institute and the International Organization for
        Standardization.

        Corneal curvature measurement provides crucial information for calculating intraocular lens
        power,screening and managing corneal refractive surgeries and corneal disease.

        Volunteers with healthy corneas will be measured by different instruments to detect their
        anterior corneal power.Only the right eye of each subject was selected.Measurements were
        repeated in the second session scheduled 1 to 2 weeks later, at almost the same time as the
        first session, by the same examiner using the same protocol.
