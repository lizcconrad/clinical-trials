      The objective of this study is to assess levels of ASKP1240 in the blood after a single dose
      given intravenously (IV) or as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. The study will determine how
      the drug behaves inside the body and how it is eliminated from the body by looking at the
      pharmacokinetics of ASP1240.

      In addition, the study will determine the effects of ASKP1240 on the body by looking at its
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and at the safety and tolerability of ASKP1240 when given by IV or as
      SC injection.
