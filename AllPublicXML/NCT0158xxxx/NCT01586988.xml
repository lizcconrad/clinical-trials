  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IMAGE intervention was developed to improve parenting and self-care skills in mothers
      infected with HIV. It is expected that an improvement in these areas will in turn improve the
      mother's physical and mental health as well as the child's mental health and behavioral
      adjustment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, close to half the adults living with HIV are women and a large proportion of these
      women are of child-bearing age. Whereas anyone living with HIV faces the physical challenges
      of living with a chronic disease, as well as the material and social impact of the stigma
      associated with the disease, mothers living with HIV must also meet the demands of
      childrearing while mitigating the negative impact of the disease upon their family. Mothers
      with HIV report that this is their greatest source of stress. Moreover, children of these
      mothers, growing up with a parent with a chronic, stigmatized, and often fatal disease, are
      considered a high-risk group. The IMAGE intervention was designed to improve parenting and
      self-care skills in mothers with HIV in order to improve the mother's physical and mental
      health as well as the child's mental health and behavioral adjustment.
