      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of the CONTOUR Next USB BGMS system with
      AutoLog and Trends features and integrated data management software (Glucofacts ™ DELUXE)
      enables behavioral changes that may lead to improvement in glycemic control, expressed as a
      reduction in HbA1c as primary endpoint.

      Patients will be randomized either to using CONTOUR Next USB or CONTOUR. Patients will be
      trained in using the devices and return every 3 months until month 9 after baseline.
