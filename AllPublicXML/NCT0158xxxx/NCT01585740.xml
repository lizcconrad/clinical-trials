      The objective of this study is to compare the effect on mean maternal and neonatal pH, and
      24-hour postoperative morbidity, following intraoperative infusion of Ringer's Lactated
      versus normal saline in caesarean section at Mulago Hospital.

      The null hypothesis is that intraoperative infusion of Ringer's Lactate in caesarean section
      at Mulago Hospital will not result in 30% less mean maternal and neonatal pH change than
      intraoperative infusion of normal saline.

    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy in caesarean section surgery in Mulago Hospital is done mostly with 0.9% normal
      saline (NS). Several studies have highlighted the complications associated with large
      infusion of normal saline. Few studies have compared the effects of an alternative
      crystalloid, Ringer's Lactate (RL), on perinatal pH and postoperative morbidity in caesarean
      section surgery.

      This trial will be performed in Mulago Hospital Labour Ward theatre on parturients who
      consent and are scheduled for either elective or emergency caesarean section under spinal
      anaesthesia from September 2011 to May 2012. Study fluid will be administered
      intraoperatively only. Preoperative and postoperative venous blood samples will be drawn for
      venous blood gases, serum urea and creatinine. Placental umbilical arterial cord blood will
      also be drawn for neonatal arterial blood gases. Mothers will be followed up for 24 hours for
      incidence of postoperative morbidity.
