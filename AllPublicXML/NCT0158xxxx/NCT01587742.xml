      The studies described in this protocol are all performed within the framework of PROTECT
      (Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European ConsorTium)
      Workpackage 2 (WP2) and Workgroup 1. The primary aim of these studies is to develop, test and
      disseminate methodological standards for the design, conduct and analysis of
      Pharmacoepidemiological (PE) studies applicable to different safety issues and using
      different data sources. To achieve this, results from PE studies on 5 key adverse events
      (AEs) performed in different databases will be evaluated. Therefore, emphasis will be on the
      methodological aspects of the studies in this protocol and not on the clinical consequences
      of the association under investigation. The standards to develop will contribute to
      decreasing the discrepancies in results from different studies in the future and increase the
      usefulness and reliability of these studies for benefit-risk assessment in the EU.

      Within WP2, five possible adverse event - drug pairs have been selected for analyses; one of
      these includes the possible role of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the risk of cancer.
      Analyses will address the hypothesis that CCBs modify the risk of cancer (all forms of cancer
      combined and various groups of cancers).

      This hypothesis will be investigated using two sources of data: the UK General Practice
      Research Database (GPRD) and the Danish national databases. Investigations in the UK may also
      use The Health Improvement Network (THIN).

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the possible association between use of
      CCBs and risk of all forms of cancer combined, among adult patients (18 to 79 years of age
      during the study period, January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2009). The study will be conducted
      using three databases with different study designs (descriptive, cohort, population based
      cohort study and nested case-control) across different databases (GPRD, THIN, Danish
      databases) and to compare the results between databases, across designs to evaluate the
      impact of design/database/population differences on the outcome of the studied association.

      Secondary objectives are to investigate the potential association between use of CCBs and
      risk of all forms of breast cancer in women; all forms of prostate cancer; and all forms of
      colon cancer using the same age groups and databases).

    <textblock>
      Conducting studies on the possible association between CCBs and cancer using a
      pharmaco-epidemiological approach based on data collected in existing databases and cancer
      registries is challenging. The challenge lies in working within the limitations of the
      available data (in terms of quality and completeness) and simultaneously maximizing the value
      of the available data through thoughtful study design and statistical analysis.

      CCBs represent a chemically and pharmacologically diverse group of agents that are widely
      used for the treatment of hypertension and angina. It has been proposed that CCBs may
      interfere with apoptosis, leading to an increased potential for abnormal cell proliferation
      and tumor growth. The underlying biological mechanism for this effect is thought to be linked
      to the role of transmembrane Ca2+. This hypothesis has been critically reviewed and results
      have shown that the action of CCBs on apoptosis are complex with both increases and decreases
      in intracellular Ca2+ linked to this form of programmed cell death (2). CCBs have also been
      shown to inhibit apoptosis in certain non-transformed cell lines but promote apoptosis in
      other non-transformed and transformed cell lines. The results from non-human genotoxicity
      studies have shown no link between CCB use and tumor development

      Epidemiologic studies have also provided inconsistent results. While only a few follow-up
      analyses reported an increased risk for all cancer or breast cancer, further observational
      studies have so far provided no evidence to support the hypothesis that long-term use of CCBs
      might be carcinogenic. As a whole, these studies have been limited by lack of statistical
      power and/or inadequate methods for defining the exposure window of antihypertensive
      treatment in relation to the index date (cancer outcome), making the establishment of a
      causal relationship between CCBs use and risk of cancer problematical. Studies often assumed
      a relatively short period of CCB use (usually between 2 months and 1 year) before entering
      the study as users. In other cases, information on the use of CCBs was only available at
      study entry or during follow-up. Overall, most studies were limited by follow-up periods that
      could be considered too brief to measure a carcinogenic effect. The vast majority of studies
      collected information from electronic medical or administrative databases.

      The current study aims to learn from the experience, strengths and limitations of previous
      research to present a best-practice approach to addressing the hypothesis in question.
      Combined with the objectives of the PROTECT program, we hope that this study will help to
      provide a framework for guiding methodological choices in future research and contribute to
      increasing the usefulness and reliability of pharmacoepidemiological studies for benefit-risk
      assessment and decision making.
