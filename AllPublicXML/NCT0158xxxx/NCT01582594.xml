      To evaluate the accuracy of the CHIRON® RIBA® HCV 3.0 (RIBA, Investigational Product) test
      using known anti-HCV seropositive and seronegative specimens.

      To evaluate the effect and applicability of different sample types on RIBA test results
      through the tests of the investigational product on serum and plasma collected from the same
      donors.

      The specimens with HAV IgG positive, or HBsAg positive, or HEV IgG positive, or anti-HIV
      positive will be collected and tested for potential interference in the investigational
      product when used for testing the specimens infected by viruses other than HCV.

      This clinical trial is for registration purpose, the study data will be submitted to
      Regulatory Authority (SFDA) for license application for CHIRON®RIBA®HCV 3.0 SIA reagent.

      A minimum of 1000 qualified specimens shall be collected, including at least 350 anti-HCV
      seropositive specimens.

      To further evaluate RIBA test specificity in HAV IgG positive, HBsAg positive, HEV IgG
      positive and anti-HIV positive specimens, approximately 30 specimens of each viral infection
      will be included in the study.

      A minimum of 60 matched plasma and serum specimens will be collected to evaluate the
      applicability of the investigational product on different types of samples, including at
      least 30% of anti-HCV seropositive specimens.

        The specimens used for this study will be pre-tested by licensed anti-HCV screening methods
        and / or Nucleic acid test (NAT) in combination with the past history and will be
        classified as either seronegative or seropositive.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Residual serum or plasma specimens after routine clinical testing; fresh specimens or
             frozen specimens stored at -20°C or lower within 2 years after collection, with
             sufficient volume (≥0.5 mL) to complete all the study tests ; 2) Residual serum or
             plasma specimen is acceptable; matched serum and plasma with EDTA, heparin or citrate
             used as the anticoagulant. The collection and preparation of the specimens should
             comply with the standard laboratory operation procedures and the instruction for use
             (IFU).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severely hemolytic or turbid specimens; 2) Bacterial contaminated specimens; 3)
             Specimens that are improperly collected, prepared, or stored or not in accordance with
             package insert instructions.

        Elimination criteria:

          1. Errors arising during testing in which the specimen cannot be repeated shall be
             excluded;

          2. Test results that do not pass routine quality control will not be used
