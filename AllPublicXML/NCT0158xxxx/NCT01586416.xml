    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a behavioral intervention for elderly
      adults in treatment for colon cancer, to enhance their skills for managing the challenges of
      completing chemotherapy regimens. The investigators will assess feasibility and acceptability
      of the intervention, and explore preliminary efficacy of the intervention for reducing
      psychological distress and improving rates of optimal chemotherapy adherence.
