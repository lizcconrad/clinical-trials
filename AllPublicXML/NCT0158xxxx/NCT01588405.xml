    <measure>Change From Baseline in Six-minute Walk Distance at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of daily living. Patients were instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage for six minutes, resting whenever they needed. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality of Life (QoL) Assessment: Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning) and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemodynamics Parameters: Mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAPm), Mean Right Atrial Pressure (RAPm) and Mean Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWPm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in pressure in the pulmonary vasculature defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) greater than 25 mmHg at rest or greater than 30 mmHg with exercise, as measured by right heart catheterization. Right Atrial Pressure (RAP) is the pressure of blood in the right atrium of the heart. Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) is used to calculated pulmonary vascular resistance and can help guide therapeutic efficacy. The PAPm, RAPm and PCWPm values and their respective changes from Baseline to Week 24 at peak exercise were measured by Swan-Ganz right heart catheterization.</description>

        <description>The purpose of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of daily living. Patients were instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage for six minutes, resting whenever they needed. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation.</description>

        <description>The CAMPHOR is a health related quality of life instrument validated for pulmonary hypertension that assesses impairment (symptoms), disability (activities) and quality of life. The questionnaire is divided into three sections; Symptoms (Scores 0-25; high scores indicate more symptoms), Activity (Score 0-30; low score indicates good functioning) and Quality of Life (0-25; high scores indicate poor QoL). The sum of these scores equates to the Total score (0-80). In the CAMPHOR scores, lower scores indicate improvements.</description>

        <description>The dyspnea-fatigue index has three components, each rated on a scale of 0 to 4, for the magnitude of the task that evokes dyspnea or fatigue, the magnitude of the pace (or effort) with which the task is performed and the associated functional impairment in general activities. The ratings for each component were added to form an aggregate score, which could range from 0, for the worst condition, to 12, for the best.</description>

The dose of Remodulin will be decreased as the dose of UT-15C SR is increased over the 5 days. Once subjects have been transitioned from Remodulin, the dose of UT-15C SR will continue to be modified / titrated to the appropriate optimal dose for that subject throughout the rest of the study.</description>

        <description>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in pressure in the pulmonary vasculature defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) greater than 25 mmHg at rest or greater than 30 mmHg with exercise, as measured by right heart catheterization. Right Atrial Pressure (RAP) is the pressure of blood in the right atrium of the heart. Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) is used to calculated pulmonary vascular resistance and can help guide therapeutic efficacy. The PAPm, RAPm and PCWPm values and their respective changes from Baseline to Week 24 at peak exercise were measured by Swan-Ganz right heart catheterization.</description>

            <description>UT-15C SR: Subjects will transition in the hospital from Remodulin to UT-15C SR within 5 days of the start of the transition. The dose of Remodulin will be decreased as the dose of UT-15C SR is increased over the 5 days. Once subjects have been transitioned from Remodulin, the dose of UT-15C SR will continue to be modified / titrated to the appropriate optimal dose for that subject throughout the rest of the study.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Hemodynamics Parameters: Mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAPm), Mean Right Atrial Pressure (RAPm) and Mean Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWPm)</title>
          <description>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is an increase in pressure in the pulmonary vasculature defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm) greater than 25 mmHg at rest or greater than 30 mmHg with exercise, as measured by right heart catheterization. Right Atrial Pressure (RAP) is the pressure of blood in the right atrium of the heart. Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) is used to calculated pulmonary vascular resistance and can help guide therapeutic efficacy. The PAPm, RAPm and PCWPm values and their respective changes from Baseline to Week 24 at peak exercise were measured by Swan-Ganz right heart catheterization.</description>
          <population>One subject completed the Week 24 visit but was unable to undergo these assessments. As such, the evaluable data at Week 24 was summarized using an N of 30 subjects, which is why the number of participants analyzed is inconsistent with the participant flow module.</population>
