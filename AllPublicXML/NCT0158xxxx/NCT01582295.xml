  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I clinical trials test the safety of
      an investigational drug. Phase I studies also try to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational drug to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is
      still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also
      means the FDA has not approved the drug for your type of cancer.

      Cabozantanib (XL184) is a new drug that is being developed to treat cancer. The study drug
      cabozantinib works by inhibiting several different proteins which are believed to be involved
      in multiple myeloma growth, its ability to spread, and its ability to form new blood vessels.
      This drug has been used in other research studies and information from those other research
      studies suggests that this drug may help to slow or stop disease growth to bones and prevent
      cancer growth.

      In this research study, we are looking to see how effective cabozantanib is in slowing or
      stopping disease growth to the bones as well as preventing your cancer from worsening. We are
      also looking for the highest dose of cabozantinib that can be given safely to patients who
      have multiple myeloma with bone disease.

    <textblock>
      Since we are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered safely
      without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple myeloma, not
      everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of study drug.
      The dose you get will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the
      study before you and how well they have tolerated their doses.

      The study drug, cabozantinib, comes in the form of tablets which you will take by mouth. You
      will take your dose of cabozantinib once a day during each 28 day cycle.

      Detailed instructions on how to take the study drug and which foods and drinks you will be
      prohibited from taking during the research study can be found in your study drug diary.

      During Cycle 1, you will come into the clinic weekly (Day 1, 8, 15 and 22). For all other
      cycles, you will come into the clinic on Day 1 and 15.

      A visit will be scheduled 30 days after you have finished or stopped taking the study drug so
      your doctor will be able to check your well being.
