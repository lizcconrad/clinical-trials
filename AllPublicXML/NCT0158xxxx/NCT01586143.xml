  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study that aims to investigate and compare the efficacy of transbuccal
      paracetamol 125 mg with that of paracetamol 1g administered intravenously in patients with
      acute pain of moderate intensity accepted to emergency room following a minor trauma of the
      lower limbs and/or superiors. To this end, several pain scoring will be performed using a
      visual analogue scale (VAS) at various times after drug administration.
