      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the Philips Sonalleve
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) for treatment
      of uterine fibroids in a Chinese population.

      This study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided
      High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) in ablating uterine tissue associated with
      symptomatic leiomyomas. The importance of this therapy is that it offers a non-invasive,
      uterine sparing procedure for the treatment of uterine fibroids in pre- and peri- menopausal
      women.

      MR-HIFU uses ultrasound to heat and thermally ablate fibroid tissue. The MRI system
      identifies the ultrasound path and monitors heat rise in the fibroid tissue. The goal of the
      study is to show treatment safety and effectiveness of the Philips Sonalleve MR-HIFU device
      for uterine fibroids marketing approval in the Chinese market. MR-HIFU will be performed in
      100 patients who pass inclusion/exclusion criteria. Safety, quality of life, and imaging
      endpoints will be evaluated in all study patients at baseline and at 6 months post-treatment.
      All patients will be followed up for 12 months post-treatment for safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, age between 18 and 55 years

          -  Weight &lt; 140 kg

          -  Pre- or peri-menopausal

          -  Uterine size &lt; 24 weeks

          -  Cervical cell assessment by Pap smear/Thin-prep Cytologic Test (TCT): Normal, Low
             Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (SIL), Low risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) or
             Atypical Squamous Cells of Uncertain Significance (ASCUS) subtypes of cervical tissue

          -  Fibroids selected for treatment meeting the following criteria:

               1. Total planned ablation volume of all fibroids should not exceed 250 ml, and

               2. No more than 5 fibroids should be planned for ablation, and

               3. Dominant fibroid (diameter) is greater than or equal to 3 cm, and

               4. Fibroids which are completely non-enhancing under Magnetic Resonance (MR)
                  contrast agent should not be treated as the identification of treated volume
                  becomes ambiguous

               5. Highly perfused or brighter than myometrium in T2-weighted MRI (according to the
                  T2 contrast obtained using the Philips MR-HIFU protocol) fibroids should not be
                  treated

          -  MR-HIFU device accessibility to fibroids such that at least 50% of the total fibroid
             volume can be treated

          -  Willing and able to attend all study visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other pelvic disease (Other mass, endometriosis, ovarian tumor, acute pelvic disease,
             significant adenomyosis)

          -  Desire for future pregnancy

          -  Significant systemic disease, even if controlled

          -  Positive pregnancy test

          -  Hematocrit &lt; 25%

          -  Extensive scarring along anterior lower abdominal wall (&gt; 50% of area)

          -  MRI contrast agent contraindicated

          -  Fibroids not quantifiable on MRI (e.g. multi-fibroid cases where volume measurements
             are not feasible)

          -  Calcifications around or throughout uterine tissues

          -  Communication barrier

          -  Suspected malignancy
