    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard in the diagnosis of colorectal disease. The success of
      colonoscopy depends on high-quality bowel preparation by patients. Inadequate bowel cleansing
      reduces the speed, the cecal intubation rate, and the number of polyps detected. It also
      increases costs, mostly due to repeated procedures. The quality of bowel cleansing has
      remained suboptimal even though numerous different products and regimens have been tested and
      compared in no fewer than six meta-analyses. Therefore, a completely different approach to
      improve precolonoscopy bowel cleansing is welcome.

      There are many factors effect the bowel preparation such as age, cirrhosis diabetes, drug
      compliance, cerebral infarction, dementia, history of major surgery. 20% of patients with
      poor bowel preparation were due to bad compliance. Studies found that addressing patient
      perceptions with an inexpensive and simple booklet based on the Health Belief Model improved
      preparation quality. We assume that doctor retelling the instruction of bowel preparation by
      cell phone on the day before colonoscopy would help patient to prepare for colonoscopy and
      improve the quality of the bowel preparation.
