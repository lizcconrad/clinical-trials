  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if standard chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin)
      given on a dose-dense treatment schedule (with less time between treatments) can help shrink
      the tumor better than standard chemotherapy given on a standard treatment schedule before the
      patient undergoes surgery for bladder cancer.

    <description>This is a Multicenter Phase II study of dose-dense (DD) gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are candidates for radical cystectomy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Gemcitabine and Cisplatin (DD GC)</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will receive six cycles of GC administered every 14 days. Gemcitabine 2,500 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously on day 1 and cisplatin 35 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously on days 1 and 2 of a 14 days cycle (with Peg GCSF). A total of six cycles of therapy will be administered followed by radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND)</description>
