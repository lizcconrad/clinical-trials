    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve stimulation for the treatment of sequelae due to traumatic brain injury.
      This study will specifically examine patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have
      persistent cognitive impairments lasting one year or longer. Neuropsychological testing will
      occur to confirm the diagnosis.

      The subject will complete participation in three groups evaluating different programming
      parameters. After surgery, each subject will be randomized to Group A or Group B. Group C
      will be completed in the middle followed by the alternate A/B Group. Crossover will occur at
      3 week intervals until subjects complete all three groups. During this period, all subjects
      will receive a subject programmer that will only enable them to activate the &quot;on and off&quot;
      positions and adjust amplitude within the prescribed range.

      After subjects have completed the three pre-defined groups they will select the most
      effective and comfortable setting continuation of the study. The pulse width and frequency
      parameters will be set to the optimal settings identified by the subject. Amplitude will be
      set at a level that produces comfortable paresthesia for the subject.

      Subjects will return to the clinic for programming changes post system internalization at 3
      weeks, 6 weeks, and 9 weeks. Subjects will receive a PET scan at the 3 and 9 week visit.
      Additional follow-up evaluations will occur at 12 weeks, 18 weeks, and 24 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects able to provide informed consent to participate in the study;

          2. Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65;

          3. Subjects with clear evidence and/or documentation of mild traumatic brain injury as
             defined by the American Congress on Rehabilitation Medicine (1993):

               -  Closed head injury/trauma

               -  Score of 13-15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale
