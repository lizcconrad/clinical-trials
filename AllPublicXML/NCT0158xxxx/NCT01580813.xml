  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People who are overweight or who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have higher levels of
      certain fats in their blood. The blood vessels and heart of most of these individuals do not
      work normally and people with T2DM also have an impaired ability to perform exercise. The
      purpose of this study is to use the free fatty acid lowering drug, acipimox, to temporarily
      decrease the level of fat in the bloodstream of people with T2DM and observe the
      physiological changes to blood vessel function and exercise capacity and insulin sensitivity.
      This will help the investigators to understand ways of improving blood vessel function and
      the ability to exercise effectively in people who are overweight or have T2DM.
