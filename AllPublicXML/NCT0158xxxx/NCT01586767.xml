  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that 1)intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      (IMRT) or proton radiation therapy would result in improved local control rate and lowered
      toxicity compared to conventional radiotherapy, and 2) proton radiation therapy would result
      in equivalent or improved local control rate with similar or lower toxicity compared to IMRT,
      in the treatment of locally advanced sinonasal malignancy.

      Data from retrospective studies suggest that IMRT or proton radiation therapy resulted in
      promising outcome in patients with sinonasal malignancy. To this date, no prospective study
      has been conducted to evaluate the outcome of sinonasal cancer treated with IMRT or proton
      radiation therapy. This Phase II trial is the first prospective study conducted to determine
      the treatment outcome and toxicity of IMRT or proton in the treatment of sinonasal cancer.

      IMRT and proton radiation therapy are the two most established and most commonly employed
      advanced radiotherapy techniques for the treatment of sinonasal cancer. It is highly
      controversial whether one is superior to the other in terms of local control and toxicity
      outcome. It is also not clear if a subset of patients would benefit more from one treatment
      technology versus the other.

      Due to the rarity and heterogeneity of sinonasal malignancies and the fact that proton beam
      is only available at a few centers in the United States, it is not feasible at present to do
      a Phase III study randomizing patients between IMRT and proton radiation therapy. In this
      study, a planned secondary analysis will be performed, comparing the treatment and toxicity
      outcome between IMRT and proton. The data on the IMRT and proton comparison from this trial
      will be used to design future multi-center prospective trials and to determine if randomized
      trial is necessary.

      In this study, the treatment technique employed for an individual case will not be determined
      by the treating physician(s), but rather by the most advanced technology available at the
      treating institution for the treatment of the sinonasal cancer. At the Massachusetts General
      Hospital (MGH), proton beam therapy will be used for patients who meet the eligibility
      criteria. For institutions where protons are not available or institutions where the proton
      planning systems have not been optimized, IMRT exclusively will be used for the treatment of
      sinonasal cancer. Patient and tumor characteristics are expected to be comparable between
      IMRT- and proton- institutions

      Subjects will receive daily proton radiation treatment as outpatients at the Francis H. Burr
      Proton Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. The subjects may also receive concurrent
      standard chemotherapy every week during their radiation therapy. This chemotherapy is
      considered standard treatment for their cancer and is not being done for research purposes.

      In addition to daily radiation treatments, subjects will have the following tests every week:
      review of side effects; physical exam, including weight, height, neurological exam and vital
      signs; and blood tests, only for those subjects also receiving chemotherapy.

      Subjects will be followed for 5 years after the completion of study treatment. The first
      follow-up visit will be 6-8 weeks after completion of study treatment. Additional follow-up
      visits will be performed every 3 months during the first 2 years following completion of
      radiation then every 6 month during years 3-5. At each follow-up visit, subjects will receive
      a physical exam, chest CT scan (at 1st follow-up visit then at least every 6 months), a CT or
      MRI tumor assessment (at 1st follow-up visit then at least every 6 months), quality-of-life
      questionnaire, hearing test, neuro-ophthalmology test, and neurocognitive test.
