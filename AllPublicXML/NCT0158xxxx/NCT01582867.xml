    <textblock>
      Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a dialysis technique that allows the removal of high molecular
      weight toxic solutes exploiting the convective transport through the dialyzer membrane: at
      the same time, the HDF has a positive impact on the systemic hemodynamic, ameliorating in
      this way the tolerance of the treatment. Unfortunately, also the HDF therapy can be not well
      tolerated, introducing in the patients serious hypovolemia during the removal of the body
      water accumulated in the interdialytic period.

      The HemoControl system, automatically controlling the relative blood volume change of the
      patient, avoids the onset of the hypovolemia. Today the HemoControl system can be used only
      during conventional hemodialysis treatments; the objective of this study is to combine the
      advantages of the intradialytic hemodynamic stabilization achievable by means of HemoControl
      with the inherent advantages, both of depurative and cardiovascular kind, typical of the
      Hemodiafiltration technique.

    <description>During one part of the study (study phase A) patients will undergo hemodialysis (HD) treatments with Hemoscan over 2 weeks (Run-In period), followed by 12 HD sessions with HemoControl during the following 4 to 6 weeks. Separated by a one week wash out period, the same patients will be switched to On-Line Hemodiafiltration (HDF) treatments (study phase B), for a Run-In period of 2 weeks with Hemoscan, followed by 12 On-Line HDF sessions with HemoControl over the last 4 to 6 weeks of the study period.</description>
