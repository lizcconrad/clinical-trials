  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to develop a clinical registry of Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
      patients undergoing lower extremity revascularization to describe the population and assess
      comparative effectiveness of endovascular therapy versus surgery. In addition, this study
      will conduct a prospective cohort study of patients treated medically or undergoing lower
      extremity revascularization at the VA and Kaiser Colorado to compare changes in health
      status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using electronic medical records, a registry of patients undergoing lower extremity
      revascularization therapy will be identified. Chart reviews with be done by an expert panel.

      The prospective cohort study will ask participants to complete health status surveys before
      they begin therapy for PAD and again 6 months later.
