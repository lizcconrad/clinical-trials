      The primary objective of step 1 is the rate of adverse events of minocycline and bevacizumab
      during reirradiation and of step 2 is the response rate to bevacizumab, reirradiation, and
      minocycline. The secondary objectives are the response rate, PFS-3, PFS-6, and effects on
      quality of life and cognition from repeat radiation and bevacizumab.

      After providing informed consent, patients will undergo screening for eligibility to
      participate in the study. Screening will start within 21 days prior to dosing.

      Subjects will have an MRI within 21 days of starting radiation. QOL and cognition measures
      will be performed within 21 days of starting radiation. Radiation will be given with
      parameters determined on an individual basis by the radiation oncologist. Bevacizumab will be
      continued at 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Minocycline will be given twice a day starting at
      100mg PO BID. MRI, QOL, and cognitive tests will be obtained 1, 3 and 6 months after the end
      of radiation.

    <description>This is an open-label, multi-agent design. Bevacizumab will be administered in accordance with the FDA-approved dose for gliomas, 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Bevacizumab will be continued every two weeks as long as tolerated. One cycle of bevacizumab will be 28 days, with treatments on day1 and day 15. Blood pressure, CBC, CMP, and urine protein level, either by UA or urine protein/creatinine ratio will be checked at the beginning of each cycle.</description>

    <description>Minocycline will be given by mouth twice a day starting at about half of the monotherapy maximal tolerated dose, 100 mg PO BID. Minocycline will be started on the day prior to radiation and continued until progression or intolerance. During the combined radiation, minocycline, and bevacizumab treatment, patients will be seen weekly with a CBC, CMP, and adverse event monitoring.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients ≥18 years old with a life expectancy of at least 8 weeks
