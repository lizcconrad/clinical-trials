    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-3078a to assess safety and tolerability, identify
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and tentative recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and assess
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in subjects with advanced solid tumor
      malignancies or lymphomas. The study will include 2 parts: Dose Escalation and Dose
      Expansion.

    <description>Part 1 - Dose escalation of DS-3078a to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be guided by the modified continuous reassessment method (mCRM) using a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) following escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle.
Before starting mCRM, initial dose escalation will proceed following an accelerated titration in which single subjects will be enrolled into sequential dose levels with a dose increment of up to 100% from the previous dose.
Upon completion of Part 1 with established MTD and tentative recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), the Dose Expansion (Part 2) will begin with the intention of further assessing the safety and tolerability of DS-3078a, confirming the RP2D, determining the Pharmacodynamic response in tumor samples, and evaluating preliminary efficacy of DS-3078a in subjects.</description>
