  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, prospective, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the relationship of
      the markers of inflammation and progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with
      previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer. The study consists of two phases: Phase A
      treatment: oral capecitabine plus infusional oxaliplatin (XELOX) plus bevacizumab, or
      modified infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin (LV) and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) plus
      bevacizmab administered until first disease progression. Participants will then continue with
      Phase B treatment: infusional 5-FU, LV and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab until second
      disease progression. The anticipated time on study treatment is 4 years.
