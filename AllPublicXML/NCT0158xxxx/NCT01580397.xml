  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable pancreatic ductal carcinomas
      (PDA) who have failed prior chemotherapy with gemcitabine regimens have an extremely poor
      prognosis with progression-free survival of around 13 weeks and median overall survival of
      approximately 20 weeks after second line chemotherapy. Recent studies suggest that albumin
      may be preferentially concentrated in pancreatic cancers that appear to be starved for this
      protein. Thus, any molecule attached to albumin would also collect inside the tumor. Based on
      its postulated mechanism of action, INNO-206 may improve the activity of doxorubicin without
      increasing its toxicity, as has been demonstrated in animal studies, and induce enhanced
      anti-tumor efficacy.
