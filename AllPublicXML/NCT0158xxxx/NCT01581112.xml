    <textblock>
      The malodour generation of a person's armpit/foot is caused by the bacteria thriving on that
      armpit/foot. In order to alter or reduce once bad body odour or foot odour, the living
      microbial community on the foot/armpit of a non-malodorous person will be transmitted (or up
      scaled and transmitted) to the foot/armpit of a malodorous person. The odour is evaluated by
      a trained smelling panel, the bacteria living on the armpit/foot is examined by means of
      molecular techniques. The microbial transplantation and its follow-up happens under the
      supervision of a doctor.
