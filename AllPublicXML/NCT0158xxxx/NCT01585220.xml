    <textblock>
      This study design is a randomized, multi-center, double Masked, matched Pairs,
      active-controlled clinical trial. Subjects who voluntarily signed the informed consent and
      are judged to be eligible for this study will be intradermally injected both of study device
      and comparator device. Subjects will be randomized to receive injection of study device and
      comparator device on their each nasolabial fold. Efficacy is evaluated based on the change in
      Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) from baseline. Safety will be assessed based on 24 weeks
      follow up visits and subject diary which will be given to subjects during the first 2 weeks
      after the injection. Any uncomfortable things and adverse events will be investigated from
      subeject diary and follow up visits.
