    <textblock>
      Insufficient nutritional intake, with or without concomitant morbidity, leads to weight loss
      or insufficient weight gain, is related to an increase in morbidity and mortality and exposes
      the child to medical complications. In addition, obesity is also related to complications
      during hospitalization and complications in general, and therefore early identification of
      these children is extremely important. Studies show that malnutrition is frequent among
      children upon hospitalization, where the risk of pediatric nutritional deterioration
      increases, even in the presence of mild stress factors. This risk is frequent mainly among
      children that arrive at the hospital with an initial poor nutritional status. Improving the
      nutritional status as part of the standard of care already at the ambulatory setting might
      improve the prognosis of children when ill. In Israel, nutritional screening in not conducted
      among children since there is no proper validated screening tool. Study objectives: To test
      the accuracy of the STAMP Screening Tool for pediatric nutritional risk which is designed to
      be used by nurses, and to compare it to a complete nutritional assessment conducted by a
      dietician in Clalit Health Care Services clinics. In addition, the investigators wish to
      examine the effects of using a screening tool for nutritional risk on the medical staff's
      attention to the nutritional status; this is measured by the collection of nutritional
      status-related data and their recording in the patient file.

      Methods: 100 boys and girls aged 1 to 6, attending Clalit Health Care Services Pediatric
      Centers, will undergo an assessment using the STAMP Tool; a questionnaire including 3
      questions with a summary score, according to which the nutritional risk level shall be
      determined. These children shall also undergo a complete dietician assessment in order to
      examine the validity of the STAMP Tool. In addition, 150 files shall be reviewed in the
      beginning of the research and after 6 months in order to estimate the change in medical
      staff's attention to nutritional status, by way of noting relevant diagnoses, reference to
      nutritional status- related tests and recording of anthropometric measurements.

      A statistical analysis to examine the validity of the STAMP Tool shall be carried out using
      the kappa test (K) (30). The effect of the STAMP Tool use shall be calculated using the chi
      square test.

    <description>The height / weight tables accepted in England, CDC (Centers for Disease Control) and WHO (World Health Organization) will be used in order to compare weight and height. The children will be divided into 3 nutritional risk groups: low, moderate and high according to the STAMP toll assessment and the results will be compared to the dietician's complete assessment.Nutritional assessment will include: demographic and medical data, daily nutritional intake, blood tests, anthropometric measurements, patient's ability to comply with the nutritional requirements related to his age etc.</description>

    <description>Methods for testing the effect of STAMP tool use on the attitude of the medical staff to the nutritional status, measured by collection of data related to the nutritional status and recording them in the patient's file. In order to examine questionnaire acceptance by the medical staff, time period required to complete the questionnaire will be measured and in addition, the staff will be required to express their opinion regarding the speed and ease of using the questionnaire using the 4-point Likert scale. The staff will be asked about their subjective opinion about using the questionnaire.</description>
