    <textblock>
      This is a four-week Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 in
      approximately 68 subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who are not
      taking rhEPO and are not undergoing dialysis. The range of Hgb values for study eligibility
      is 8.5-11.0 g/dL. Eligible subjects will be randomized in equal proportions to receive once
      daily (QD) placebo or GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg in a double-blind fashion.

      This is a four-week Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      multi-center study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of GSK1278863 in
      approximately 68 subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who are not
      taking rhEPO and are not undergoing dialysis. The study consists of a screening phase of up
      to 2 weeks, a 4-week treatment phase and a 2-week follow-up phase. The range of Hgb values
      for study eligibility is 8.5-11.0 g/dL. Eligible subjects will be randomized in equal
      proportions to receive once daily (QD) placebo or GSK1278863 0.5 mg, 2 mg or 5 mg in a
      double-blind fashion. Study treatment will be stopped if Hgb values fall outside of the range
      pre-specified in the protocol.

      This study aims to estimate the relationship between dose of GSK1278863 and Hgb response for
      correcting anemia in non-dialysis subjects with CKD who are not taking rhEPO (NDD). In
      addition, the study will characterize the effect of GSK1278863 on various
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) markers, and will investigate the safety and
      tolerability of GSK1278863.

      An early interim analysis of the Hgb data is planned after approximately 20 subjects from
      cohort 1 have completed 3 weeks of treatment. Depending upon the interim findings, a second
      cohort of subjects may be added to investigate an additional GSK1278863 dose arm. Recruitment
      to the first cohort will continue during the interim analysis.

      A second interim analysis is planned after approximately 48 subjects from cohort 1 have
      completed 4 weeks treatment. The purpose of this interim is three-fold, to investigate
      whether a second cohort of subjects may be added, to facilitate early development of
      dose-response and PK/PD statistical models, and to generate interim results to facilitate
      design and dosing decisions for the next trial.

      Subject completion is defined as completion of all study phases including the follow-up
      phase.

    <description>Three measurements of heart rate were recorded from the participant in a supine position for at least 5 minutes (allowed enough time between measurement to completely deflate and loosen the inflatable cuff). Baseline values were recorded on Day 1. If the Day 1 value was missing, the last non-missing value from week -1 or week-2 was represented as the baseline value. The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values. change from baseline in heart rate at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 were reported.</description>

         10. Iron replacement therapy: Stable maintenance dose of oral iron replacement therapy, if
             required, that will be maintained throughout the study. NOTE: IV iron replacement
             therapy is not allowed the two weeks prior to Screening through the end of the study
             (Week 6).

         11. QTc: QTcB &lt;470 msec or QTcB &lt;480 msec in subjects with bundle branch block obtained at
             Screening Visit, based on Central Reader's interpretation.

         12. Females: Eligible to participate if she is of childbearing potential, and must agree
             to use approved contraception methods from Screening until completion of the Follow-up
             Visit OR of non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a

             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most types of HRT, at least 2
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal

        <title>Modeled Hgb Change From Baseline Over 4 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Modeled Hgb change from baseline over 4 weeks was derived using a random coefficient mixed effects linear regression model. The model included fixed effects for baseline Hgb, treatment and a treatment by day interaction. Random effects was fitted in the intercept and the slope over time. All data up until investigational product discontinuation was included for Hgb efficacy evaluable participants; where efficacy evaluable was defined as having a baseline and at least 2 on-treatment Hgb assessments. Baseline was the average of Week -2 , Week -1 and Day 1 visits. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values.</description>

        <description>Maximum Hgb change over 4 weeks was analyzed using an ANCOVA model with terms included for treatment and baseline Hgb value. Least square mean estimates and 95% CI for each treatment group were reported. Baseline was the average of Week -2 , Week -1 and Day 1 visits. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hepcidin at Week 2 and Week 4</title>
        <description>Blood samples for hepcidin were collected at Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 2 (approximately between 4 to 8 h) and Week 4 (pre-dose). Hepcidin is a regulator of iron metabolism. Baseline was the last pre-dose value on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values. Where hepcidin values were missing because the value was below the quantification limit (BQL), the BQL value was imputed.</description>

        <description>Baseline values were recorded on Day 1. If the Day 1 value was missing, the last non-missing value from week -1 or week-2 was represented as the baseline value. The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values. Change from Baseline values of calcium, chloride, cholesterol, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, sodium at Week 2, 4, and 6 were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Values of Creatinine, Direct Bilirubin, Indirect Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin at Week 2, 4, and 6</title>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure and Diastolic Blood Pressure at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6</title>
        <description>Three measurements of SBP and DBP were recorded from the participant in a supine position for at least 5 minutes (allowed enough time between measurement to completely deflate and loosen the inflatable cuff). Baseline values were recorded on Day 1. If the Day 1 value was missing, the last non-missing value from week -1 or week-2 was represented as the baseline value. The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values. Change from Baseline in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 were reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in ECG Parameters at Week 2, 4 and 6</title>
        <description>Full 12-lead ECGs were recorded in participants who were rested supine or seated for at least 10 minutes before each reading. All ECGs were transmitted to a central reviewer for blinded assessment. Full 12-lead ECGs were recorded on the provided ECG machine that automatically calculates heart rate, PR, QRS, QT and QTc intervals. Baseline ECG values were defined as measurements taken at screening. The change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-dose visit values.</description>
