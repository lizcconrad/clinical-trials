    <textblock>
      This is a study that involves multiple doses of study drug (60 mg of LY2409021, 15 mg of
      LY2409021 or placebo) taken as capsules by mouth on a daily basis for 28 days. This study
      will image the liver using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) in healthy participants and in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      when they take LY2409021 to see if liver changes happen at the same time as changes in blood
      tests. This study is approximately 11 weeks long, not including screening. A screening
      appointment is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.
