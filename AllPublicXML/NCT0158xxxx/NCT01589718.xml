  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether preoperative pegaptanib sodium safely improves
      vitreous hemorrhage prior to surgical intervention and to evaluate the stability of
      pre-existing tractional retinal detachment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for active PDR with TRD will receive a single
      intravitreal pre-operative 0.3mg Macugen™ prior to surgery versus sham injection.

      Specific timing of the injection will be at no sooner than 7 days and no longer than 14 days
      prior to surgery.

      Patients will receive a preinjection fundus photo and another post injection photo the day of
      surgery as dictated by the operative schedule.

      Some photos may be limited secondary to vitreous hemorrhage. Follow up visits after surgery
      will be one day, one week, one month, and three months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 20/30 and light perception (LP)

             Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  For sexually active women of childbearing potential, agreement to the use of an
             appropriate form of contraception (or abstinence) for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of anti-VEGF treatment in the study eye

          -  History of previous pars plana vitrectomy in the study eye

          -  Intraocular surgery in the study eye within one month of the study

          -  Patients with extensive vitreous hemorrhage in conjunction with a rhegmatogenous
             retinal detachment

          -  Tractional retinal detachment from causes inconsistent with PDR, such as inflammation
             or trauma

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye that could either require
             medical or surgical intervention during the study period to prevent or treat visual
             loss that might result from that condition or if allowed to progress untreated could
             likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of BCVA over the
             study period.

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as IOP≥ 35 mmHg despite treatment with
             anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  History of glaucoma-filtering surgery in the study eye

          -  History of corneal transplant in the study eye
