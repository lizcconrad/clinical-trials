    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to study health related quality of life (HQoL)after resection of
      colorectal liver metastases combined with perioperative chemotherapy. The investigators want
      to study if an aggressive, life prolonging and multimodal treatment can be defended from a
      quality of life perspective.

      Background: Hepatic resection is the only treatment with potential curative intent for
      patients having colorectal liver metastases. Combined with chemotherapy, the overall 5-year
      survival is 40-50%. The disease free 5-year survival is about 20%, and about 70% of resected
      patients experience recurrence from their disease. Even if surgery is superior all other
      treatments, most patients will finally die from their cancer. However; surgery contributes by
      adding years of life, and for a minority, a disease free life. There has been much effort to
      study predictors for outcome after surgery, but little has been focused on quality of life
      following this treatment.

      Method: EORTC Validated questionnaire (European Organisation Research of Treatment of Cancer)
      version QLQ-C30 (3.0) and QLQ LMC21. The patients fill out the questionnaire before surgery
      as a baseline, and then after 3,6 and 12 months after surgery. The investigators also
      register important clinicopathological data about each patient prospectively.
