      The purpose of this research study is to develop, implement, and evaluate a multi-component
      obesity prevention program in a workplace setting. A quasi-experimental design will be
      utilized, with hospital employees receiving the intervention and clinic employees serving as
      the comparison group. It is hypothesized that the intervention group will see greater changes
      in healthier eating, increased participation in physical activity, and reduced risk for
      obesity (weight, BMI, waist circumference).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over one-third of Americans are now considered obese. Efforts to prevent obesity involve
      changing the individual behaviors that contribute to obesity, mainly healthful eating and
      physical activity, as well as the social and physical context in which those behaviors take
      place. Due to their existing networks and available resources, worksites are a logical place
      to help individuals make healthy choices through health promotion efforts. The purpose of
      this project is to partner with a community hospital to plan, implement, and evaluate a
      multi-component obesity prevention program in their workplace. The prevention program will
      target individual and interpersonal determinants of eating behavior and physical activity, as
      well as the context in which these behaviors take place. This intervention will include four
      integrated components: (1) nutrition labeling (using stoplights, calories, and step
      equivalents) in the worksite cafeteria, and modifying the cafeteria environment, (2)
      distributing pedometers to employees, (3) persuasive media messaging, and (4) the use of
      &quot;influentials&quot; to address social norms around eating and physical activity behaviors. A
      quasi-experimental design will examine the effectiveness of this multi-component worksite
      obesity prevention program.
