      This is a single center, open-label, two-period study. There will be nine healthy human
      volunteers arbitrarily assigned to one of four groups. The study objective is to compare the
      action of various combinations of BiDil extended-release capsules and commercial BiDil
      Tablets in the body over a period of time.
