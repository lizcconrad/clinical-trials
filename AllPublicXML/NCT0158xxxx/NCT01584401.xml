      Main study objectives:

        1. To compare the temperature measured using Medisim's thermometers to the temperature
           measured using mercury or equivalent reference thermometers.

        2. To develop more accurate algorithms for measuring on the forehead as well as behind the
           ear.

        3. To test the difference between various forehead measurement locations in order to allow
           more convenient measuring that is not depended on the exact location.
