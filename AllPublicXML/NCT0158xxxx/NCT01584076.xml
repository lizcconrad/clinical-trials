  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is the leading cause of monocular visual impairment in children and adults. Despite
      conventional treatment with patching or eye drops, many older children and adults do not
      achieve normal vision in the amblyopic eye.

      Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases levels of the neurotransmitter
      acetylcholine in the brain. Use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors has been demonstrated by
      the Hensch lab (Department of Neurology, FM Kirby Neurobiology Center) at Boston Children's
      Hospital to improve vision and reverse amblyopia in animal models.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral donepezil as treatment for
      residual amblyopia (20/50 - 20/400) in patients 8 years of age and older.
