  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, phase IV study will evaluate the relationship between the drop
      in hemoglobin levels and sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C
      genotype 1 treated with Copegus (ribavirin) and Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a). Patients
      will receive Copegus 1000 mg or 1200 mg orally daily and Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously
      weekly. Anticipated time on study treatment, depending on virological response, will be 48 or
      72 weeks.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>This clinical trial was originally planned to be conducted in 4 clinical trial centers in the Czech Republic. However, due to failure in manufacturing of the drug Pegasys, 3 of the previously approved study centers withdrew from participation. Consequently, the sponsor decided to conduct the clinical trial in 1 of the 4 originally planned centers.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants infected with HCV genotype 1, who were either treatment naïve or failed to respond to previous combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin, were included in the study. These participants were treated with a combination therapy of peginterferon alpha-2a injection at a dose of 180 mcg subcutaneously once a week and ribavirin tablet, 1000-1200 mg by body weight (1000 mg if weight &lt;75 kg; 1200 mg if weight ≥75 kg) orally split into 2 daily doses, for a total of 48 weeks.</description>
