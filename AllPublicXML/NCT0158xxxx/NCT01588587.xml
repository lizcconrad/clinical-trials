  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, DPP-IV inhibitors are used as a novel way to augment the incretin system and one of
      the newest classes of medications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Since
      the DPP-IV inhibitor was first used, about 5 years have passed in USA. However, there were no
      major side effects including occurrence of cancers. The main mechanism for DPP-IV inhibitors
      is due to suppress the function of DPP-IV activity. As it is known that the suppressed DPP-IV
      activity is a marker for early diagnosis of cancers, the reason of disassociation is not
      clear.

      Activation of receptor for advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) is related to sideration of
      cancers. Meanwhile, the DPP-IV inhibitors may be related to inhibit the activation of
      receptor for AGE (RAGE). Therefore, DPP-IV inhibitors may work as a cancer protective agent
      in diabetes by blocking the AGE-RAGE axis.

      However, it is not demonstrated why DPP-IV inhibitors have no side effect of occurrence of
      cancer via blocking the activation of AGE-RAGE.

      The investigators examined effect of DPP-IV inhibitors on frequency of cancers and the
      underlying mechanism using AGE and RAGE before and 5 years after administration of DPP-IV
      inhibitors in Japanese patients with T2DM.

      The AGE and RAGE are measured using ELISA method in the laboratory of Department of
      Pathophysiology and Therapeutics of Diabetes Vascular Complications, Kurume University,
      School of Medicine, Japan before and for 5 years after administration of DPP-IV inhibitors.
