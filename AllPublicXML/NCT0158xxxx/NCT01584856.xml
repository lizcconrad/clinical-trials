  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that small dense LDL particles are associated with an increased cardiovascular
      risk. LDL particles can be separated by gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) according to their
      size. The risk to suffer from coronary heart disease is 3-7 fold elevated in subjects with
      small dense LDL particles compared to subjects with large LDL particles. This study aims at
      evaluating the predictive value of small dense LDL particles in patients with prediabetes and
      type 2 diabetes mellitus concerning future changes in intima media thickness, flow-mediated
      dilation and other risk factors of atherosclerosis (e.g. insulin resistance). 60 patients
      with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes will be recruited for the study. Assessment will include
      medical history (risk factors), physical examination (blood pressure, BMI, waist-to-hip
      ratio), collection of serum, oral glucose tolerance test, measurement of intima media
      thickness and endothelial dysfunction by ultrasound. All measurements will be repeated after
      2 years. Data will be analysed to assess whether the amount of small dense LDL particles can
      predict further structural and functional changes of the cardiovascular system or changes in
      the severity of the disease (insulin resistance).
