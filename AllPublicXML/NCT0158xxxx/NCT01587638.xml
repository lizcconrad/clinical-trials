  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study used an observational, retrospective cohort design to compare the presence and
      timing of new-onset diabetes (NOD) between hypertensive patients initiating therapy with
      carvedilol immediate-release (IR) and carvedilol controlled-release (CR) vs the following
      cardioselective beta blockers (BBs): atenolol, metoprolol succinate, and metoprolol tartrate
      (referred to hereafter as 'other BB').

      The aim of the study was to investigate the likelihood of developing NOD among hypertensive
      patients initiating carvedilol therapy vs other BB therapy in a real world setting derived
      from data contained in a large United States (US) managed care database.

        This retrospective database study identified patients aged ≥18 years with at least one
        pharmacy claim for a beta-blocker of interest (carvedilol immediate-release
        [IR]/controlled-release [CR], atenolol, metoprolol succinate, or metoprolol tartrate)
        identified in the IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database. Index date was the first
        chronologically occurring prescription for any beta-blocker during the enrollment period
        (July 1, 2000-December 31, 2007). Patients were identified if they were continuously
        eligible to receive healthcare services 6 months prior to and 3 months after the index date
        and at least 1 diagnosis of hypertension (ICD-9-CM: 401.xx-405.xx) during this time frame.
