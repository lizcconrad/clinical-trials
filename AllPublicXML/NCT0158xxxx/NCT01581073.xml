  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to ask whether treating non-diabetic chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) patients with GFR 8-20mL/min/1.73m2 by darbepoetin Alfa targeting Hb between 11.0 and
      13.0g/dL preserves renal function better than targeting Hb between 9.0 and11.0g/dL. The
      investigators also ask whether the higher Hb targeting 11 to 13g/dL will not cause higher
      adverse events regarding cardiovascular diseases compared with lower Hb targeting 9 to
      11g/dL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is common among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is associated with an
      increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events. Although erythropoiesis stimulating agent
      (ESA) has been used to correct anemia, use of ESA (hemoglobin level at approximately 13 g/dL)
      did not reduce cardiovascular or renal events in diabetic CKD patients. Subgroup analysis of
      a recent randomized study suggested that use of darbepoetin alfa targeting Hb between 11 and
      13 g/dL may preserve renal function better than targeting Hb between 9 and 11g/dL in
      non-diabetic CKD patients.

    <description>Darbepoetin alfa is given to the patients. Target Hb level is 12.0g/dL and it should be maintained greater than or equal to 11.0g/dL and less than 13.0g/dL. If the patients do not have medical history of myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, unstable angina, or peripheral artery disease, the target Hb level will be greater than or equal to 12.0g/dL and less than 13.0g/dL. Maximum dose of darbepoetin alfa is 240 microgram per 4 weeks.</description>
