  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DERENEDIAB study is a proof-of-concept, multi-center, prospective, open, randomized,
      controlled study of the effectiveness of renal denervation in addition to standardized
      medical treatment compared to medical treatment alone in diabetic subjects with diabetic
      nephropathy and resistant proteinuria. Bilateral renal denervation will be performed using
      the Symplicity Catheter - a percutaneous system that delivers radiofrequency (RF) energy
      through the luminal surface of the renal artery.
