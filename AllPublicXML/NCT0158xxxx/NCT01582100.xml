  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a highly prevalent condition that is frequently
      encountered in the health care setting. It affects roughly 40% of Americans monthly and 10%
      weekly. Of those with GERD, there exists a cohort that experience nausea with or without
      vomiting that is unresponsive to PPI's and anti-emetics. For these patients, treatment
      options are limited and these symptoms may substantially alter their quality of life. New and
      novel therapies emerging include neuromodulation devices that may affect the central pathways
      leading to these symptoms. Of these, the Reletex band has been tested and proven efficacious
      in the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, chemotherapy, and surgery,
      in addition to standard anti-nausea medications. The investigators propose that through a
      similar mechanism, this device as an adjunct to PPI's and anti-emetics will reduce
      GERD-associated the nausea with or without vomiting, and by so doing, improve the quality of
      lives in this patient population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient over the age of 18 with clinically diagnosed GERD as evidenced by the
             GerdQ assessment tool and/or ambulatory pH/ pH- impedance monitoring with a component
             of nausea with or without vomiting.

          -  Continued symptoms despite a stable dose of FDA approved daily PPI therapy in addition
             to or without supportive anti-emetics. We will include patients with twice a day PPI
             dosing, as this is a standard treatment for PPI non-responders.

          -  Previous gastric emptying study performed as part of the standard care work-up of
             nausea and vomiting. Patients will be recruited regardless of the results and this
             information will only be used as a potential predictor for symptom response.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently participating in a concurrent clinical trial or completed another trial
             within past 8 weeks.

          -  Prior gastrointestinal surgery of the esophagus and stomach.

          -  Severe esophagitis (Los Angeles esophagitis Grade C and above), Barrett's metaplasia
             or eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia or spastic motor disorder

          -  Unstable medical illness with ongoing diagnostic work-up and treatment. Patients with
             well-controlled hypertension, diabetes and a remote history of ischemic heart disease
             that is deemed stable, as judged by the physician-investigator can be included.
             Current drug or alcohol abuse or dependency.

          -  Current neurologic or cognitive illness or impairment which would make the patient an
             unsuitable candidate for hypnosis. This will be determined by the investigators before
             randomization using the Mini Mental Status Exam in patients with suspected impairment.

          -  Severe mental illness, e.g., uncontrolled major depression with suicidal ideation,
             active psychosis, diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder.

          -  Those with nickel, gold, or other metal allergies.

          -  Those with other neuromodulators or implanted electrical devices such as cardiac
             pacemakers, AICD's, neurostimulators or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
             devices (TENS units).

          -  Females who are or might become pregnant during the study.
