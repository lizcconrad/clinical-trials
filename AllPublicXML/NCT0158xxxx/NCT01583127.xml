      To conduct a group randomized controlled trial of School-Wide Positive Behavioral
      Interventions and Supports. PBIS is a popular school-based prevention program aimed at
      reducing behavior problems in children. Staff are trained to implement behavioral focused
      prevention programs to address issues related to student conduct and discipline problems.
