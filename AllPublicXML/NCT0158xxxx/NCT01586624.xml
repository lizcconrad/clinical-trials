  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using two drugs together called vandetanib
      and selumetinib is effective in the treatment of cancer. The first part of this study will
      include patients with any solid tumour and the second part of this study will include only
      patients with non small cell lung cancer. The four main aims of this clinical study are to
      find out:

        -  If the two drugs can be given safely to patients when given together.

        -  The maximum dose that can be given safely to patients.

        -  More about the potential side effects of the drugs and how they can be managed.

        -  What happens to vandetanib and selumetinib inside the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I study is to establish a safety and toxicity profile of combining
      two study drugs; vandetanib, a VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor) and EGFR
      (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) inhibitor, with selumetinib a MEK (Mitogen Activated
      Kinase)inhibitor.

      This is the first time the drugs have been used together. These types of drugs have shown an
      effect in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) therefore the aim is to see if combining these
      drugs has an increased anti-tumour effect for this group of patients for which treatment
      options are limited.

      The study is in two parts; the dose escalation phase and the expansion cohort.

      In the dose escalation phase, 9-50 patients will receive vandetanib and increasing doses of
      selumetinib to establish a safe dose to recommend for the next stage of the study. Patients
      with any solid tumour will be eligible.

      In the expansion cohort, approximately 30 patients will receive the dose recommended in the
      previous phase. Only patients with NSCLC will be eligible for this part of the study.

      The expansion cohort will look at further evaluating the safety of the drug combination and
      the anti-tumour activity. Patients in this cohort will be requested to also consent to have
      additional imaging assessments and optional tumour biopsies.

      Study treatment is administered orally; vandetanib tablets once daily and selumetinib
      capsules twice daily. Cycle 1 is 42 days long. Subsequent cycles are 28 days in length.
      Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles of the combination treatment. If the patient has
      not progressed after six cycles, they may be treated for further cycles following approval
      from the sponsor.

    <description>Dose escalation phase This phase consists of various cohorts, each investigating an increasing dose level of vandetanib and/or selumetinib. Vandetanib steady state dose levels investigated include 100, 200 or 300mg OD. Selumetinib dose levels are 25mg bd, 50mg bd and 75mg bd or 100 and 125mg OD.
All patients in this phase will take the study treatment as follows:
Cycle 1
Vandetanib higher (lead in) dose once daily (2 or 4 days) followed by vandetanib steady state dose once daily (10 or 12 days) followed by vandetanib steady state dose once daily in combination with selumetinib once/twice daily (28 days).
Cycle 1 is 42 days in length.</description>
