  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal irrigation techniques have been used for many years and been shown to improve symptoms
      of rhinosinusitis. Although there is a wealth of literature available, establishing treatment
      protocols can be difficult because of the great variability in recommended composition
      (seawater or hypertonic or isotonic saline with or without additives) and irrigation
      technique (variations in pressure and volume). Nasal irrigation is also used in many centers
      as part of postoperative treatment protocols and in particular has been recommended following
      endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Nasal crusting and thick nasal discharge have a negative
      impact on these patients quality of life (QOL). At the time of our study, there are no
      studies comparing irrigation with mucolysis with saline irrigation following ESS. The
      investigators aimed to assess whether mucolysis is effective at improving patients QOL and
      reducing postoperative signs as assessed endoscopically.

      The study will take place at Tel Aviv Sourasky medical center, otolaryngology outpatient
      clinic, a tertiary care academic hospital, for two years. It will be double-arm, open label,
      randomized controlled trial comparing two different methods of medical therapy following ESS.
      The allocation ratio is intended to be approximately equal for each arm. The two arms
      consisted of: a control arm (group A) of generic saline irrigation alone, irrigating with 20
      mL per nostril tid for a total of 120 mL daily irrigation; and intervention arm (group B),
      which included generic N-Acetylcystine of 200 mg dissolved in 200 mL saline irrigated as per
      group A, 20 mL per nostril given tid daily (for a total of 120 mg). All medications will be
      used daily for the 3 months duration of the post-operative follow up. Patients will be
      instructed as to correct irrigation technique prior to discharge home from the hospital, and
      will be reminded of this technique at each postoperative clinic visit.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is change in QOL based on the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores.(5) SNOT-22 scores were chosen as the primary outcome due to the importance of studying patient QOL outcomes as opposed to imaging or endoscopy scores that often do not correlate with patients' subjective perceptions of disease severity.</description>
