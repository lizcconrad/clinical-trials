      In this work we will try to monitor the patients for a longer period, starting from their
      hospitalization period through their rehabilitation period up to 18 months post their
      discharge from the hospital.

      Many studies tried to evaluate different ways to predict postoperative complications
      following cardiac surgery, patient's survival, rehabilitation rate and duration. Today,
      following these studies doctors use different methods to evaluate these parameters. The
      Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score (STS) and the European System for Cardiac
      Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) scoring system are the two most frequently used risk
      profile systems within the United States and Europe. The STS score is comprised of over 40
      clinical parameters, whereas the EuroSCORE involves 18 clinical characteristics that
      comprises three categories, each weighted accordingly. Studies published recently suggest
      that a combination of a new frailty score and the traditional scoring systems may facilitate
      a more accurate risk scoring in elderly high-risk patients scheduled for conventional cardiac
      surgery or trans-catheter aortic valve replacement.

      In this study we will try to evaluate the contribution of using a frailty score index in
      addition to the EuroSCORE evaluation in patients≥50 years of age, in prediction of
      postoperative complications following cardiac surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery in the Cardiothoracic Surgery Department at
             Carmel Medical center, Haifa, Israel, between: 1.5.12-28.2.14.

          2. Patients ≥ 50 years of age

             consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Emergent surgery, defined as a surgery for which there should be no delay due to
             ongoing refractory cardiac compromise.

          2. Clinical instability, defined as active coronary ischemia, decompensated heart failure
             not yet stabilized, or any acute process causing significant symptoms or abnormal
             vital signs.

          3. Severe neuropsychiatric condition causing inability to cooperate with the study
             procedures.
