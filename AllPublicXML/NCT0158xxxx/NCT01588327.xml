  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ability to explain bleeding or clotting complications in patients treated with dabigatran
      remains challenging. In addition, there is limited data on how coagulation tests perform in
      patients treated with therapeutic doses of dabigatran. Predicted responses of coagulation
      tests to therapeutic doses of dabigatran may be helpful in better understanding abnormal
      responses to dabigatran. The purpose of the study is to define a therapeutic reference range
      for peak and trough coagulation tests in patients taking FDA approved doses of dabigatran and
      to determine which tests may be most clinically useful for monitoring dabigatran.
