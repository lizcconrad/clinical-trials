      The primary purpose of the Adenovirus Vaccine Pregnancy Registry is to prospectively collect
      data concerning:

        1. Pregnant women exposed to Adenovirus Type 4 and Type 7 Vaccine, Live, Oral,

        2. Potential confounding factors, and

        3. The outcome of these pregnancies.

      The secondary purpose of the Adenovirus Vaccine Pregnancy Registry is to evaluate the
      frequency of birth defects in prospectively enrolled pregnant women. This Registry is also
      designed to detect any unusual patterns of birth defects.
