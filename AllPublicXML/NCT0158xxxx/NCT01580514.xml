  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental evidence suggests exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor analogue, has
      significant cardiovascular protective effects in various conditions. The investigators
      examined whether conventional use of exenatide at the time of primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention would reduce the infarct size in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-concept trial, we assessed the effects of acute-phase adjunctive exenatide
      therapy in patients with STEMI.

      Infarct size after STEMI was evaluated by both cardiac magnetic resonance image and cardiac
      biomarkers compared with standard treatment.

      LV function was assessed by conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography. During
      6-month follow up, the safety/tolerability of exenatide and clinical outcomes were also
      assessed.
