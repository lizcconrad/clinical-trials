  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single institution open-label, non-randomized monotherapy study to
      evaluate the clinical efficacy and durable disease control of PCI-32765 administered to
      patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL/PLL of all risk categories with patients having
      deletion 17p13 independently evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial, a type of research study, involving treatment with an
      investigational (experimental) drug called PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib), a &quot;kinase inhibitor&quot;.
      &quot;Kinases&quot; are proteins that are inside of cells and help them to live and grow. The specific
      kinase inhibited or blocked by this study drug is believed to help blood cancer cells grow
      and live. By inhibiting or &quot;blocking&quot; the activity of this kinase, it is possible that the
      study drug may be able to kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing. This study will
      involve treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma
      (SLL), or B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) that has not responded to or has relapsed
      after standard treatment. This trial is studying how effective PCI-32765 is at treating CLL,
      SLL, or B-PLL and all the effects, good and/or bad, treatment with this drug has on patients
      and their cancers.

    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>We will summarize our findings for this endpoint independently as well within each cohort (del17p vs other cytogenetic groups). We will evaluate the proportion of patients who are progression-free and alive at two years or have gone on to transplant (treatment successes) over the total number of evaluable patients; eligible patients who received at least one dose of therapy are considered evaluable. Assuming that the number of treatment successes as defined above is binomially distributed, we will also include 95% binomial confidence intervals for the estimates corresponding to each cohort.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with PCI-32765 capsules administered orally once daily at a dose of 420 mg for 28 day cycles. Weekly monitoring during the first month will occur followed by monthly evaluations for 2 additional months. Monitoring for patients at this point would be every 3 months with monthly CBC(complete blood count)and phone follow-up with a co-investigator on the study. A standard questionnaire will be used in this monthly phone assessment. Patients will continue to receive the study drug indefinitely as long as they are deriving clinical benefit (Complete Response or Partial Response or Stable Disease) and not experiencing any unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with disease progression will be removed from the study. Correlative laboratory samples, quality of life assessment, and immunologic data would be collected over time of therapy.</description>
