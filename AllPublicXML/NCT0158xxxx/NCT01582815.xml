  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and overall safety and tolerability of
      treatment with adjunctive JNJ-40411813 compared to placebo in patients with MDD with anxiety
      symptoms being treated with an antidepressant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the treatment that
      the patient receives), placebo-controlled study in adult patients with Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD) with anxiety symptoms of relevant severity. The study will consist of 3
      phases: a screening phase of up to 2 weeks, an 8-week double-blind treatment phase, and a
      2-week post-treatment (follow up) phase. Patients will continue to take the same daily dose
      of their antidepressant (as directed by the investigator) at the same time of day, from
      screening through the end of the study, including the post-treatment phase. The total study
      duration for each patient will be approximately 12 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS17 is a clinician-administered rating scale designed to assess the severity of symptoms in patients diagnosed with depression with a score range of 0 to 52. Questions are related to symptoms such as depressed mood, guilt feelings, suicide, sleep disturbances, anxiety levels and weight loss.

    <measure>The change from baseline to endpoint in the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Clinician-Rated (IDS-C30) anxiety subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The IDS-C30 is a clinician administered 30 item depression specific severity rating scale designed to measure specific signs and symptoms of depression including melancholic, atypical and anxious features. The anxiety subscale includes five anxiety symptoms: anxious mood, somatic complaints, sympathetic arousal, panic, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The WLQ is a 25-item questionnaire self-report rating scale developed to measure the on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment (&quot;work limitations&quot;), with a recall period of the previous 2 weeks. It comprises four dimensions of limitations: handling time, physical, mental-interpersonal, and output demands. Patients respond to each item with options ranging from &quot;Almost all of the time&quot; to &quot;none of the time&quot;, or &quot;Does not apply to my job&quot;. The global score ranges from 0 to 100 with lower score indicating low level of work limitations.</description>
