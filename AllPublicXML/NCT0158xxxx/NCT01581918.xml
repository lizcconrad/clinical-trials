  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nausea and vomiting are common problems for cancer patients. Half of them will experience
      these symptoms during the course of their disease, either because of the cancer itself or
      because of their treatment1. They are ranked by patients as two of the worst adverse effects
      of cancer chemotherapy and cause a negative impact on patient's functional, emotional, social
      and nutritional status and quality of life2,3.

      Nowadays, a wide variety of antiemetic agents are available for the prevention and treatment
      of CINV. In this scenario, three classes play a critical role: Selective 5-HT3-receptor
      antagonists - approved for clinical practice in early 1990s, revolutionized the management of
      CINV representing the most effective agents in the treatment of acute emesis -,
      Corticosteroids - with unknown mechanism of action, effective when administered as single
      agents in patients receiving chemotherapy of low emetic potential but are most beneficial
      when used in combination with other antiemetic agents, potentiating their anti-emetic
      efficacy in both acute and delayed symptoms - and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist - also
      effective against both acute and delayed emesis, but restricted utility in daily clinical
      practice because of its high cost.

      Meanwhile there are a lot of studies with these three classes of drugs, some efforts are
      being done to reach higher control rates of CINV with different drugs. In this scenario, in a
      randomized phase II placebo-controlled trial Cruz et. al. demonstrated that Gabapentin raises
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting control when associated with Dexametason and
      Ondasetron, suggesting that it could be a cost-effective alternative to neurokinin 1 receptor
      antagonists9, although, as we know, there aren`t comparative studies with gabapentin and
      aprepitant. Guttuso et al demonstrated in an open clinical study the antiemetic effect of
      gabapentin in chemotherapy-induced acute (within 24hs) and delayed onset (days 2-5) nausea
      and vomiting in breast cancer patients with refractory emesis10.

      Tan e cols showed higher complete and delayed nausea and vomiting control rates for
      olanzapine vs. aprepitant, in association with palonosetron and dexametason in highly and
      moderately emetogenic potential chemotherapy11. Navari e cols haven't found similar results
      although this comparison may not be done, since maintenance anti-emetic treatment was
      different between these studies12.

      In a case report, Strohscheer I. &amp; Borasio GD showed complete control of refractory nausea
      and vomiting in one patient with meningeal carcinomatosis treated with Carbamazepine13.

      Carbamazepine is an available anticonvulsant largely used in Brazil. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the role of Carbamazepine for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by
      moderate and highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
