  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple births in the United States are rapidly increasing in large part due to assisted
      reproductive technologies. Recent data indicate that multiple births now comprise 3-4.5% of
      all births in the United States. Pregnant women are at risk for iron (Fe) deficiency anemia
      yet there are virtually no data on Fe status in women carrying multiples and current
      recommendations do not necessitate Fe screening among this high risk group. Maternal anemia
      is known to increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth and low birth
      weight. Moreover, the developing brain is increasingly recognized to be susceptible to Fe
      insufficiency in utero and growing data support that suboptimal Fe stores at birth are
      associated with long-term irreversible cognitive deficits in the offspring. To address these
      gaps in knowledge the investigators will monitor weight gain, hematological measures, Fe
      status indicators and serum hepcidin across pregnancy in approximately 120 women carrying
      twins and triplets. Determinants of maternal anemia will be identified. Neonatal
      hematological measures will be assessed in cord blood from each neonate at birth for
      assessment of hematological measures, Fe status and hepcidin. Determinants of neonatal anemia
      will be identified. Inflammatory markers will be measured in all blood samples and related to
      outcomes. Stable iron isotopes will be given to a subset of women to assess maternal Fe
      absorption and fetal Fe uptake.

      Pregnant women (n=100-125) carrying multiples (twins and triplets) will be identified when
      entering prenatal care. Women will be invited to participate in a longitudinal study of Fe
      homeostasis across pregnancy and at delivery in the maternal / neonatal dyad. In all maternal
      and cord blood samples obtained, whole blood will be analyzed for hemoglobin, hematocrit,
      reticulocyte count, erythrocyte count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular Hb
      concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and red cell distribution width using standard
      procedures. Circulating Fe status indicators (serum iron, ferritin, C-reactive protein, IL-6,
      erythropoietin, transferrin receptor and hepcidin) and serum folate and vitamin B12 will be
      measured. Distributions of each variable will be examined and associations among variables
      will be explored. Multiple linear regression models will be constructed to examine specific
      relations between a) determinants of Fe deficiency anemia in the mother; b) Fe status
      indicators in the mother vs. those in the neonate; c) Fe status indicators in the mother and
      neonate with placental Fe binding proteins; and d) neonatal Fe status between siblings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators anticipate that the majority of these women will be recruited early
             in gestation because many of these pregnancies are a result of assisted reproductive
             technology.

          -  Eligible volunteers will be otherwise healthy and have no diagnosed, preexisting
             medical conditions known to impact iron homeostasis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hemoglobinopathies,

          -  Preexisting diabetes,

          -  Malabsorption diseases
