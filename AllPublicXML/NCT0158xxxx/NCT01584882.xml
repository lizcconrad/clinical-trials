  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic dental records (EDR) are a potentially powerful tool to incorporate current
      scientific evidence into clinical practice by providing key information at the point of
      patient care. The investigators know that disseminating evidence-based guidelines is not
      sufficient to change clinical practice so innovative approaches need to be tested in
      dentistry. The composite expertise of the investigators and consultants on this project and a
      large group practice with multiple clinics utilizing one EDR are essential to address the
      aims of this study. This project will examine whether dentists and hygienists will assess
      interest in quitting and deliver a tobacco intervention more frequently when provided with
      computer assisted guidance compared to a control group. Specifically the investigators will
      measure the delivery of questions assessing willingness to change and appropriate
      interventions based on willingness to change by measuring the recording of these activities
      in the EDR and patient receipt of these recommendations through a phone survey. In addition,
      the study will do a qualitative assessment of the patient perceived value of the
      provider-patient encounter to further inform us about patient perception of this interaction.
      The investigators want to know if dental providers will utilize these tools during the dental
      encounter. If they are used, the investigators would propose further studies examining
      smoking cessation rates. The investigators were not able to measure cessation rates due to
      the short two year timeline of this funding mechanism. This tool has potential application
      for other clinical topics, which makes this approach very innovative when considering the
      translation of evidence into the unique clinical practice of dentistry.

    <description>Using Screening for drug use, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) as a model, a 'CATI'[Computer Assisted Tobacco Intervention] tool was designed for the Electronic Dental Record which required assessment of 4 variables for patients reporting cigarettes use: 1) number of cigarettes daily, 2) how soon upon waking the first cigarette was smoked, 3) interest in quitting, and 4) previous quit attempts. Level of dependency was calculated and displayed in the health history using the Heavy Smoking Index. Pop-up provider scripts were generated using rule-based algorithms. Links to printable patient education materials on the quit line and on medications to help quit smoking were embedded in the scripts window. The tool automatically recorded tobacco-cessation details.</description>
