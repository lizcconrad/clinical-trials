      The intervention included biweekly access to group fitness classes, with (Group 1) or without
      (Group 2) weekly nutrition and physical activity education sessions. Outcome measures were
      assessed at baseline and immediately post intervention and included BMI, waist circumference,
      blood pressure, physical activity and dietary behaviors, and psychosocial variables.

    <textblock>
      This 15-week randomized controlled pilot study consisted of two groups. All participants
      received access to two group fitness classes per week, which were offered free of charge at
      the Caswell County Parks and Recreation Building. Zumba classes were offered one night a
      week, and the other evening was a 'potluck night' designed to increase participants exposure
      to a variety of other fitness classes such as floor aerobics, kickboxing, line dancing, and
      African dancing. Participants in the intervention group (Group 1) were enrolled in Eat Smart,
      Move More, Weigh Less (ESMMWL) where they received on hour weekly education classes on
      healthy eating and physical activity. The ESMMWL curriculum is a 15-week weight-management
      program that is delivered by local educators. Published research data were used to identify
      strategies that would lead to weight loss and/or weight maintenance. The program uses the
      Theory of Planned Behavior, and as such informs, empowers, and motivates participants to live
      mindfully as they make choices about eating and physical activity. The program provides
      opportunities for participants to keep a journal of healthy eating and physical activity
      behaviors.
