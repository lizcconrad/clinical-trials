  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands a 2 center investigator-driven phase I/II clinical trial is initiated in
      June 2010 testing the oncolytic adenovirus Delta24-RGD to treat glioblastoma patients. The
      virus is administrated using convection-enhanced delivery by 4 catheters as delivery
      technique, targeting solid tumor as well as infiltrated tumor cells within the peri-tumoral
      brain. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 per dose-level. The dose levels to be
      explored are: 10^7, 10^8, 10^9, 10^10, 3*10^10 and 10^11 viral particles (vp). Once the MTD
      has been determined, or the study has reached the highest dose cohort, a further 6 or 9
      patients will be enrolled at the MTD and evaluated for safety and preliminary signs of
      efficacy, such that in total at least 12 patients have received the MTD.

      The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of Delta-24-RGD
      administered by CED to the tumor and the surrounding infiltrated brain in patients with
      recurrent GBM. Secondary objectives are to determine the Progression Free Survival (PFS),
      Overall Survival (OS), and tumor response rate in patients with recurring tumors amenable for
      surgical resection and treated at the MTD.

      Cerebrospinal fluid as well as brain interstitial fluid by microdialysis next to the
      routinely collected samples of blood at various timepoints before, during and after virus
      infusion. Various neurodegenerative biomarkers as well as markers of immune response will be
      assessed in these samples.

      Furthermore extensive sampling and PCR analyses will be performed to evaluate distribution
      and shedding of the virus.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven primary Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) will be
             eligible for this protocol.

          2. Patients must show unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by MRI
             scan within 3 weeks prior to registration after failing prior resection (surgery or
             biopsy) and/ or chemo- and/or radiation therapy.

          3. Recurring tumors must either be accessible for surgery, or , when not accessible for
             surgery meet the following criteria:

               1. unifocal

               2. midline shift &lt; 0.5 cm

               3. no radiological signs of uncal herniation

          4. All recurring tumors must be restricted to one hemisphere, without signs of
             subependymal spreading.

          5. Before start of virus treatment histological analysis of the resected, or biopsied
             tumor recurrence must confirm the diagnosis of GBM (based on frozen section).

          6. Patients may or may not have had prior chemotherapy.

          7. Patients must be able to read and understand the informed consent document and must
             sign and date the informed consent. Procedures to obtain such informed consent should
             be according to ICH-GCP, the local regulatory requirement and the rules followed at
             the institute.

          8. Patients must be &gt; 18 and &lt; 75 years old.

          9. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status rating &gt; 70 (Appendix 2).

         10. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy. For example,
             they must be at least two weeks after vincristine, 6 weeks after nitrosoureas, 3 weeks
             after procarbazine or temozolomide administration, and 6 weeks after radiation
             therapy.

         11. If sexually active, patients must be willing to use barrier contraception for the
             duration of the study.

         12. Patients must have adequate hepatic, renal and bone marrow function, defined as

          2. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or use of anticoagulant medication.

          3. Patients with systemic diseases or other unstable conditions which may be associated
             with unacceptable anesthetic/ operative risk and/or which would not allow safe
             completion of this study protocol, e.g. uncontrolled seizures.

          4. Because of the potential risk of a recombinant virus containing a gene involved in
             cellular growth regulation and differentiation which could potentially affect a
             developing fetus or growing infant, females who are pregnant, at risk of pregnancy, or
             breast feeding a baby during the study period are excluded.

          5. Because of the potential risk of serious infection in immune-compromised individuals,
             patients known to have HIV infection are excluded.

          6. Patients with a known germline deficit in the retinoblastoma gene or its related
             pathways.

          7. Patients with other primary malignancy than GBM. However, patients with curatively
             treated carcinoma-in situ or basal cell carcinoma or patients who have been disease
             free for at least 2 years and not using any anti-cancer therapy, are eligible.
