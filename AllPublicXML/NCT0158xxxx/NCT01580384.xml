    <textblock>
      This non-drug, longitudinal, multi-center, multi-national study will evaluate the suitability
      of neurocognitive tests and functioning scales for the measurement of cognitive and
      functioning changes in individuals with Down Syndrome. Tests will be administered at clinic
      visits in Weeks 1, (4) and 24. The duration of the study for each individual will be between
      24 and 27 weeks.
