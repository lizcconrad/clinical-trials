  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin 50mg bid
      add-on therapy to improve overall glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      inadequately controlled on insulin with or without metformin treatment.

    <description>HbA1c analysis will be performed on a blood sample obtained by study personnel at every visit and measured by ion exchange HPLC.

    <description>Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appears to worsen. Serious adverse events are any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require (or prolong) hospitalization, cause persistent or significant disability/incapacity, result in congenital anomalies or birth defects, or are other conditions which in judgment of investigators represent significant hazards.</description>

Endpoint HbA1c ≤ 6.5%
Endpoint HbA1c &lt; 7%
Endpoint HbA1c &lt;7% in patients with baseline HbA1c ≤ 8% The percentage of patients meeting each of the responder criteria as described, as well as the percentage of patients meeting any of these criteria in each treatment group will be computed</description>
