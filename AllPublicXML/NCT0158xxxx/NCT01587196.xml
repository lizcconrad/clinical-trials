  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will use fMRI and specific probes of reward and inhibition as biomarkers
      predicting drug use during and after treatment in 72 subjects addicted to prescription
      opioids/medications. Subjects will be scanned before, during, and after 12 weeks of active
      medication. The brain fMRI measures will be correlated with the primary clinical outcome of
      drug use (by urine drug screen) during the treatment and follow-up phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sign an informed consent form;

          2. Be between the ages of 18 and 60;

          3. Have a diagnosis of opioid dependence according to DSM IV-TR criteria (as assessed by
             the MINI);

          4. Be in good general health as determined by complete physical examination and
             laboratory tests;

          5. Have a negative result for urinary opioids and must self report being at least 3 days
             opioid free. Participants may have a diagnosis of alcohol dependence so long as they
             do not have severe alcohol dependence that requires medical supervision for alcohol
             withdrawal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current severe alcohol dependence that requires medical supervision for alcohol
             withdrawal;

          2. Current psychosis, dementia, mental retardation, or history of schizophrenia;

          3. Significant clinical abnormalities in hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis;

          4. Significant clinical cardiovascular, neurological, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,
             metabolic, endocrine, or gastrointestinal disorders;

          5. Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating, or female subjects of childbearing
             potential who are not using birth control (oral contraceptives, barrier (diaphragm or
             condom) plus spermicide, or levonorgestrel implant); (Pregnancy testing will be done
             on all females of child bearing age); and

          6. Current diagnosis of chronic pain disorder.
