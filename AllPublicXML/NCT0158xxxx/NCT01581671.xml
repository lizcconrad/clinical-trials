  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the non-invasive, Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT)
      testing as another way of predicting potential coronary artery blockages in the heart.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are conducting a 16 minute, non-invasive EndoPAT test on patients coming to our cath lab
      for a first-time angiogram. The angiogram results will be compared to the EndoPAT results to
      determine if the EndoPAT test, which generates a score, is successful in predicting who may
      have blockages in their coronary arteries.
