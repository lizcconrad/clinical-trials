    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive value of a single serum
      determination of activin A and inhibin A for the prognosis of ectopic pregnancy after in
      Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycles, in both native and donated oocytes.

      Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is one of the most common pathologies seen in emergency gynaecology
      practice. Early diagnostic of this situation is a clinical objective because it remains an
      important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Currently, transvaginal
      ultrasound scan (TVS) allow ascertain the location of the pregnancy. However, the diagnosis
      of EP is complicated by a nonspecific clinical presentation and the inconclusive results in
      some cases of transvaginal ultrasound at first presentation. For this reason several
      biomarkers have been investigated to accurately detect the establishment of pregnancy and
      predict its outcome as early as possible.

      These biomarkers include: markers of abnormal embryo/trophoblast growth (β-subunit of HCG,
      Activin A, etc), markers of abnormal corpus luteum function (progesterone, inhibin A, etc),
      markers of a growing pregnancy in the Fallopian tube (creatine kinase, vascular endothelial
      growth factor, etc), markers of inflammation and peritoneal irritation (cancer antigen 125,
      interleukin-6, etc), and uterine markers of normal implantation (leukaemia inhibitory factor
      and glycodelin). Β-HCG and progesterone are usually used in clinical practice and activin A
      and inhibin A have recently shown promising results.

      Blood samples are to be taken at the time of the first ultrasound examination and stored at
      -20ºC. Inhibin A and activin A to be determined by ELISA. β-hCG and P were also determined
      using Microparticle Enzyme Inmunoassay (MEIA).

        In the first control, made 22-27 days after oocyte retrieval, all women underwent a
        transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) examination using a 6.5-MHz transducer (Voluson 730 Pro V;
        General Electric, Madrid, Spain). They were diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy (EP) or an
        intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) on the basis of this examination and where there was no clear
        ultrasound evidence of pregnancy were classified as pregnancy of unknown location (PUL).
        Women were followed up until the final pregnancy outcome was known.
