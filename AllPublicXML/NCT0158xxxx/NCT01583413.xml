  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of mechanical ventilation
      associated with significant morbidity, including prolongation of mechanical ventilation and
      increased ICU and hospital length-of-stay. Numerous strategies have been proposed to decrease
      the occurrence of VAP among ventilated patients. Most notably, optimizing the use of daily
      sedative interruptions and daily spontaneous breathing trials can improve sedative
      management, decrease ventilator time, improve outcomes for mechanically ventilated
      patients,and possibly decrease VAP.Combining daily sedative interruption with daily
      spontaneous breathing trials confers additive improvement in ventilator days, intensive care
      days, and possibly mortality compared to daily spontaneous breathing trials alone.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of an opt-out protocol for paired
      daily sedative interruptions and spontaneous breathing trials on VAP rates using a new
      streamlined VAP definition. The investigators will evaluate the responsiveness of CDC's
      proposed new surveillance definitions for ventilator-associated events to this quality
      improvement initiative. The study will be nested within the Epicenters Streamlined versus
      Conventional VAP Surveillance Study. Nine of the 18 hospitals in the larger study will be
      participating in this intervention arm.

    <description>A new definition for VAP is the primary focus of this study. This new definition (referred to as &quot;streamlined VAP&quot; or &quot;sVAP&quot;) is under consideration by the CDC as a potential replacement for the current NHSN VAP definition and, as such, will be closely evaluated to determine if it can reflect meaningful changes in patient care. Thus, we will assess the change in monthly sVAP rates from study start to study end using an interrupted time series analysis.
Note that CDC released new surveillance definitions for ventilator-associated events in late 2012. Given that CDC definitions are the defacto surveillance standard, we switched the primary study outcome from sVAP to ventilator-associated conditions (&quot;VAC&quot;). All data elements required to assess for VAC were included in this study from the outset hence we did not have to collect any additional historical data in order to apply CDC's VAC definition.</description>
