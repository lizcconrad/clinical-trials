      Primary objective:

      The comparative efficacy of levocetirizine 5 mg once daily with that of fexofenadine 60 mg
      twice daily against histamine induced wheal, flare and itch responses measured at 0
      (baseline), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. The areas under the curves (0 , 12 hours, 12 - 24 hours and 0 - 24 hours) for inhibition
           of histamine induced wheal, flare and itch responses for levocetirizine 5 mg once daily
           and fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily.

        2. The number of individuals with peak responses in each 10 percentile (Because of the
           variable absorption of fexofenadine, it is predicted that fexofenadine will have a
           variable response between individuals).

        3. The mean plasma levels of levocetirizine and fexofenadine at 0 (baseline), 0.5, 1, 2, 3,
           4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours.
