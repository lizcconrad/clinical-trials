  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an algorithm for embryo selection based on amino acid
      profiling (AAP) of spent culture medium. Development of the algorithm will be based on the
      ongoing implantation rate of the individual embryos transferred. As evaluated by ultrasound
      scan in gestational week 7.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IVF/ICSI treatment has permitted many thousands of couples to conceive worldwide yet is
      limited by low success rates (in UK, approx. 25% live birth rate/treatment cycle for women up
      to 42 years of age; HFEA Annual Report, 2006) and a confounding high multiple birth rate
      (23%) due to the transfer of more than a single pre-implantation embryo. Multiple births are
      associated with prematurity, increased neonatal and maternal mortality and child handicap as
      well as being a major burden for health care systems. These problems have been highlighted in
      the data published by the HFEA (2009), which has called for &quot;a professionally-led,
      coordinated national strategy to reduce the number of multiple births&quot;. This challenge could
      be met if single embryos of known developmental competence could be selected for transfer,
      thereby making the embryo selection process even more crucial. However, current non-invasive
      embryo selection criteria using light microscope analysis have limited predictive value for
      ongoing pregnancy.
