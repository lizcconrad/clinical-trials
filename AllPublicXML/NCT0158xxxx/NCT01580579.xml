  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer [LC] is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard treatment of
      locally advanced lung cancer unresectable or marginally resectable is combination therapy
      with radical or preoperative chemoradiation. The local control rates and survival with this
      treatment modality have increased by more than 30%. Radiotherapy [RT] with technical molded
      3D [3D-CRT, Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy] or IMRT [intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy] has allowed that the total dose of radiation has increased which leads to
      a direct benefit on the results treatment.

      Between 17-30% of patients are susceptible to pneumonitis due to radiation [NR]. This
      complication may appear at the end of the RT or up to 6 months after the treatment. In severe
      cases, mortality can reach 50%.

      It's well known that in various diseases, functional abnormalities precede the clinical
      manifestations. The degree of pulmonary failure secondary to RT is measured following the
      standards of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group who ranks in degrees [0 to 4].

      Not precisely known factors that influence the development of NR.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the effect of chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy on pulmonary function and
      identify predictors of radiation pneumonitis in locally advanced lung cancer [stages IIIA and
      IIIB].

      Hypothesis:

      Respiratory function tests may predict the development of radiation pneumonitis in patients
      with locally advanced lung cancer who receive radical treatment with chemoradiation.

      Methods Prospective cohort study with patients with locally advanced lung cancer of the Lung
      Cancer Clinic of the National Cancer Institute [INCAN]. Patients will receive weekly
      paclitaxel 50 mg and carboplatin AUC 2 with concomitant radiotherapy 44-63 Gy (22-33
      fractions). Followup of lung function tests at baseline, during treatment with radiotherapy
      and will be carried out on 4 more occasions.
