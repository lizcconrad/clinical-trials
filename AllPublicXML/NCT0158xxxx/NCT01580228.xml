    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to demonstrate the superiority in progression-free survival
      (PFS) of dinaciclib compared to ofatumumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) participants
      with del 17p or in the overall population who are refractory to either fludarabine treatment
      or chemoimmunotherapy.
