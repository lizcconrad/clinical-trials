  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usually, doctors monitor kidney cancer with CT scans to measure the size of tumors.
      Sometimes, even when a drug is working, it can take several months before the effects are
      seen on a regular CT scan. The purpose of this study is to see if a new kind of scan, called
      124I-cG250 PET/CT, can determine response to sunitinib or pazopanib earlier than a regular CT
      scan.

      Research has shown that certain proteins in the blood, called antibodies, can attach
      themselves to cancer cells without binding to normal cells. In this study, an antibody is
      used called chimeric G250 (cG250) that is attached to a radioactive isotope. The radioactive
      isotope in this study is Iodine-124 (124I). If cG250 has attached to tumors in the body, 124I
      shows up on the PET scan.

    <description>This is a pilot study of 124I-cG250-PET/CT in 25 evaluable patients with advanced and/or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who are scheduled to begin treatment with sunitinib or pazopanib. 124I-cG250-PET/CT will be assessed for its ability to predict response in comparison to standard CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>124IcG250</intervention_name>
    <description>Pts will undergo baseline disease assessment with CT scans (chest, abd &amp; pelvis), 124I-cG250-PET/CT &amp; Tc99mMDP bone scan. W/I 7 days of their lst 124I-cG250 PET/CT, pts will start tx with sunitinib or pazopanib, dosed in successive 6-week cycles. At selected time points during the sunitinib or pazopanib cycle 1, repeat imaging with CT scan &amp; 124I-cG250 PET/CT will be performed. After cycle 2, pts will be followed per standard of care, i.e., pts will have a standard CT scan of the chest, abd, &amp; pelvis with contrast after cycles 2, 3, 4 &amp; 6 (or at the time of disease progression if prior to cycle 6) for determination of best response using RECIST 1.1. Each pt will have 2 124I-cG250-PET/CT scans: baseline &amp; week 4 (during sunitinib or pazopanib tx). All experimental imaging will take place during tx cycle 1. There will be a dosimetry sub-study for pts willing to undergo 3 additional PET/CT scans, whole body counts, &amp; serial blood sampling, following the lst inj of 124I-cG250.</description>
