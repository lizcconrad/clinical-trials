  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the period 2006-2012 the ICBS-Israeli Center for Bariatric Surgery in Assuta Hospital has
      performed about 1500 bariatric surgeries including Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding,
      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy, Laparoscopic Roux en Y Gastric Bypass, and Duodenal switch.
      In addition, Pose and BPD procedures were performed.The ICBS team is comprised of a team of
      expert senior professionals in the obesity field, made up of the best bariatric surgeons, an
      expert endocrinologist who specializes in obesity and diabetes, a team of senior
      nutritionists and a supportive psychology team. During that period patients data were
      collected as part of the medical practice in the Center and included BMI, co-morbidities,
      weight loss programs the patients were involved in, pervious bariatric surgery and quality of
      life. During the entire 6 years of follow up data were collected which included weight loss,
      resolution of co-morbidity, changes in quality of life etc combined with training for healthy
      lifestyle.

      The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the key factors for surgery success
      that includes over 50% of original weight loss, resolution of co-morbidities. Factors that
      could affect surgical outcome such as age, repeated surgery, early side effects such as
      bleeding, leakage, thrombosis and lung emboli were recorded as well as later side effects
      such as herniation of the surgical area, production of gallbladder stones, vitamine
      deficiency and requirement of a revision surgery.

        The study includes about 1500 patients, 70% female and 30% male. All patients that had
        bariatric surgery and were in the follow-up group for longer than one month will take part
        in the study. A special emphasis will be given to special population groups such as
        adolescents, old patients, patients undergoing revision surgery, and patients that required
        a additional type of surgery in conjunction with the bariatric surgery (e.g., gallbladder
        removal).
