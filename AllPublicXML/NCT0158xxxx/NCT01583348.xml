  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While gold standard in the treatment of symptomatic gall stones is laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy with instruments introduced through multiple abdominal wall incisions,
      transvaginal access to the peritoneal cavity offers an alternative avoiding injury of the
      abdominal wall. Transvaginal hybrid-NOTES cholecystectomy has been demonstrated effective and
      safe. However it has not been demonstrated up-to-date if intraoperative cholangiography is
      feasible during such procedure. This observational case series describes success and
      technical feasibility of intraoperative cholangiography during transvaginal cholecystectomy.
      The investigators hypothesis is that cholangiography is feasible equal to conventional
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

    <description>During transvaginal rigid-hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy a intraoperative cholangiography is performed. After dissection of the Calot's triangle and distal clipping of the cystic duct, the cystic duct is incised and a regular cholangiography catheter is inserted. Contrast is injected and an image is obtained using an image-converter. After extraction of the catheter the cystic duct is clipped proximally. This intervention is performed in all patients included in the study.</description>
