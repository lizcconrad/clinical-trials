  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of an investigational drug called
      lucanthone, when combined with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation in the treatment of
      Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter, randomized, double blind placebo controlled phase II
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lucanthone administered as an adjunct to
      patients receiving primary treatment of GBM with temozolomide and radiation. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to lucanthone or placebo arm in ratio of 1:1. The treatment
      period will be in two phases ; an initial six weeks of concomitant therapy with temozolomide
      and radiation, followed by a maintenance phase of six cycles of temozolomide given on Days 1
      to 5 of a 28- day cycle (+/- 3 days). Lucanthone / placebo will be given as an add on in both
      concomitant and maintenance phases.

Cycles 2-6: At the start of Cycle 2, the dose can be escalated to 200 mg/m2, if the CTC nonhematologic toxicity for Cycle 1 is Grade ≤2 (except for alopecia, nausea, and vomiting), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥1.5 x 109/L, and the platelet count is ≥100 x 109/L. The dose remains at 200 mg/m2 per day for the first 5 days of each subsequent cycle except if toxicity occurs.</description>
