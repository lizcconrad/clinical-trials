  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specifically designed enteral formulations may improve the gastrointestinal tolerance during
      early enteral nutrition in the critically ill patient.

      This pilot trial will permit testing the design of the full-scale study providing valuable
      data on the expected effect of the formulation, the variability, thus helping to better
      estimate the required sample size.
