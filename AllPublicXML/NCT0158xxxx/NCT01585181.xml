  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and immunogenicity of a single dose of the
      PXVX0200 live cholera vaccine versus placebo in volunteers (Vaccinees) and whether PXVX0200,
      which is a live attenuated bacteria, can be transmitted to other adults living in the same
      household.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects and up to 120 household contacts will be enrolled in the United
      States. Vaccinees will be randomly assigned to receive either PXVX0200 or placebo in a 5:1
      ratio and will be followed for 180 days postdose.
