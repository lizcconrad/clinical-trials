    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if the use of botulinum toxin prior to a medium strength
      combination chemical peel (Jessner's peel followed by 35% Trichloroacetic acid peel) will
      improve the appearance of crow's feet wrinkles when compared to a chemical peel alone.
      Botulinum toxin type A is a purified substance, derived from a bacteria that block muscular
      nerve signals. Jessner's Peel, a combination of resorcinol (14g), salicylic acid (14g), and
      lactic acid (85%) in ethanol (95%), is a superficial chemical peel. These two
      products/procedures have been FDA approved to improve the appearance of facial wrinkles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wrinkling in the skin is caused by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking,
      poor hydration, and various other factors. There are two major types of wrinklesâ€”dynamic and
      static. Dynamic wrinkles, which are due to excessive muscle activity, usually of the face,
      tend to disappear when you relax your facial muscles. The most common of these dynamic
      wrinkles are frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and eye wrinkles (or crow's feet). However, if
      the excessive muscle activity is carried on for too long, these do not disappear completely
      on relaxation, and are thus called static wrinkles. Static wrinkles are formed either by
      chronic excessive muscle activity or are due to the effects of age and gravity, with a loss
      of subcutaneous fat. Examples of static wrinkles are the nasolabial folds, which are the deep
      grooves running from the sides of the nose to the corners of the mouth.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine if pre-treating the orbicularis oculi muscles with botulinum toxin A improves the results of medium depth chemical peels when treating lateral canthal rhytides. The primary dependent variable is the four-point Facial Wrinkle Severity Scale (FWSS): Grade 0 = no wrinkles; Grade 1 = mild wrinkles; Grade 2 = moderate wrinkles; and Grade 3 = severe wrinkles.</description>

        <title>Change From Pre- to Post-treatment Scores of Chemical Peel if Botox A is Added as Pre-treatment</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine if there is a significant difference between the change from pre- to post-treatment scores on the facial wrinkle severity scale between the chemical peel control group and the chemical peel plus Botox A treatment group. The primary dependent variable is the four-point Facial Wrinkle Severity Scale (FWSS): Grade 0 = no wrinkles; Grade 1 = mild wrinkles; Grade 2 = moderate wrinkles; and Grade 3 = severe wrinkles.</description>

            <description>After cleansing the face with a pre-treatment cleansed composed of water and alcohol, the Jessner's peel solution [a combination of resorcinol (14g), salicylic acid (14g), and lactic acid (85%) in ethanol (95%)] will be applied to the entire face with a large cotton swab. The mixture will be left in place for a few minutes, and then the face will be wiped clean with water. Next, the TCA peel [35% Trichloroacetic acid] will be applied around the eyes. After leaving in place for a few minutes, cool, iced washcloths will be applied and the face will be wiped clean with water. Wound care regimen will consist of dilute acetic acid and either Aquaphor or petroleum jelly.</description>
