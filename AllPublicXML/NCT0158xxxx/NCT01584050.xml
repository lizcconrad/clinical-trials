  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Folic acid, a form of the vitamin folate, is added to grain products in Canada to help reduce
      birth defects. Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate and is very stable (doesn't break
      down) when added to foods. There are emerging health concerns about chronic folic acid
      consumption. Recently another more natural form of folate, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate
      (L-MTHF) has become available. The investigators plan to conduct a randomized trial in women
      to determine if supplements containing L-MTHF consumed over three months raises blood folate
      levels as much as supplements containing folic acid. The investigators hypothesize that
      L-MTHF will increase red cell folate over 12 weeks to same extent as equimolar folic acid.

      The proposed study is a twelve week, cross-sectional, double blind, randomized controlled
      trial. The sample population will consist of one-hundred fifty healthy adult volunteers. All
      participants will be Malaysian women between eighteen and forty-two years of age. Study
      participants will be recruited by word of mouth and through advertisements placed in
      hospitals and universities starting in January 2011. Study participants will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) 1000ug L-MTHF 2) 1000ug folic acid 3) placebo (methyl
      cellulose). All treatments will be given in capsule form. Blood samples will be collected at
      baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.

      The primary outcome measure is red cell folate. A sample size of 45 subjects per group will
      allow us to detect a minimum difference of 100 nmol/L red cell folate assuming an alpha 0.05,
      a beta of 0.8 a SD of 183 nmol/L. Accounting for a 10% attrition rate we will enroll 50 women
      per group. The study will be analyzed as intent to treat. Baseline characteristics and
      compliance between treatment groups will be compared using a one-way ANOVA for continuous
      variables and chi-square analyses for categorical variables. The difference in measurements
      between the treatment groups at week 12 will be determined by regression analysis,
      controlling for baseline values.
