  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the concentration of fluoride in oral interproximal
      fluids would increase more after using high-viscosity GIC as pit and fissure sealant,
      compared to Resin-Based sealants containing fluoride and RB sealants without fluoride
      content. To validate this hypothesis a randomized clinical trial was designed and performed
      in schoolchildren in order to evaluate fluoride release in inter-proximal fluid in vivo after
      the placement of three types of sealants: high-viscosity GIC, Resin-Based sealants containing
      fluoride and RB sealants without fluoride content.

    <description>Inter-proximal fluid was collected with a paper point in the mesial inter-proximal space of the sealed tooth for 15 seconds. Each sample was prepared for the analysis as follow: added of 0.5 ml TISAB III to reach a pH 5 and shaken with magnetic stirrer thermostated at 25°C for 15 seconds. 100 ml of the solution was then placed on a Petri dish for the analysis. Fluoride concentration was carried out with an Orion model 96.09 fluoride ion selective electrode and an Orion model 900200 double junction plastic body Ag/AgCl reference electrode with an Orion model 290 mV digital meter.</description>

All sealants was applied following these steps: tooth isolation using cotton rolls or rubber dam; tooth cleaning using a rotary brush mounted on a low-speed contrangle with a prophylaxis pasta without fluoride; enamel etching using 37% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) for 30 seconds; rinse thoroughly with water and dry; placement a thin layer of sealant material and cure according to manufacturer's instructions and finally occlusion adjustment, if necessary.</description>
