  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle modification, in particular adopting an appropriate dietary pattern, is generally
      accepted as the cornerstone for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Consumption of low glycaemic index (GI) meals have been shown to improve glycaemic control,
      lipid profile and reduced systemic inflammation. However, these studies and international
      evidence-based nutritional recommendations are principally based on people of European
      ethnicity consuming fairly typical &quot;western&quot; diets. There are few published controlled
      dietary intervention studies which have attempted to determine appropriate dietary patterns
      for the treatment of diabetes amongst populations consuming rice-based diets.

      HYPOTHESIS

        1. The glycaemic response over 6 days as measured by CGMS will have a lower mean glucose
           level and postprandial increase in individuals consuming the LGI compared with the SDI
           meal plan.

        2. A LGI meal plan is acceptable and participants will adhere and comply to the diet to the
           same level as those receiving the SDI meal plan.

        3. Glycaemic and metabolic parameters as measured by integrated area under the curve (IAUC)
           of glucose and insulin are lower after a single meal comprising of LGI than compared
           with an SDI meal.

        4. The effect of a single meal of LGI reduces appetite and increases satiety compared with
           a meal of SDI.

      This study builds on the information collected from phase 1 which involved the documentation
      of clinical and metabolic characteristics and dietary practices of Chinese individuals with
      T2DM. In addition to information from a separate study on GI testing of locally consumed
      carbohydrate containing foods, we have formulated a meal plan comprising of low GI
      carbohydrates. Participants will be randomised into the low GI (LGI) intervention arm or
      standard dietary intervention (SDI) arm and receive counselling and advice from a dietitian,
      embark on a two week protocol to test the recommended diet, be reviewed by the dietitian, and
      undergo a 3 to 6 day continuous glucose monitoring period before and after the LGI or SDI
      diet. In addition, they will undergo 2 separate single day test meals comprising of low GI
      and high GI foods. Participants in both groups will be given resources including detailed
      instructions and meal plans that are comparable between the two arms in terms of contact with
      research personnel, instructions and meal plans which are isocaloric and have similar
      macronutrient composition appropriate for their energy requirements.

      Participants will be advised to continue on the meal plans and diet for a further 22 weeks.
      At the second month, a telephone call will be made to the participant to review compliance.
      At month 3 and month 6, participants will be asked to attend after an overnight fast from
      10pm, for a blood sample, return a food diary/ recall, measurement of anthropometry and blood
      pressure. In addition, they will complete a questionnaire
