  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dramatic increases in antibiotic utilization in hospitals continue to drive antibiotic
      resistance among hospital-acquired pathogens. However, 30-50% of the antibiotic use in
      hospitals is unnecessary or inappropriate. The Infectious Diseases Society of America has
      published guidelines stating that all hospitals should develop an institutional program to
      enhance antimicrobial stewardship. At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, an antibiotic
      stewardship audit-and-feedback intervention for all patients reaching their third or tenth
      day of broadspectrum antibiotic use in intensive care, resulted in a reduction of antibiotic
      use, antibiotic costs, and Clostridium difficile infections in the intensive care unit. The
      investigators hypothesize that this intervention will result in similar benefits outside of
      the intensive care unit, and so expanded the intervention to non-ICU medical and surgical
      wards. To increase the rigor of our program evaluation, the roll-out was conducted in a
      stepped-wedge randomized controlled design.

        All patients admitted to the medical/surgical services will be included in statistical
        analysis of program evaluation. The inclusion/exclusion criteria below, just define who
        receives the antibiotic stewardship intervention on each service.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  admitted to one of these services: general internal medicine, cardiology, nephrology,
             orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, general surgery or trauma surgery

          -  receiving 3rd or 10th day of treatment with one of the following antibiotics:

          -  ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
             meropenem, ertapenem, vancomycin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient being followed by the infectious diseases consult service
