  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease and is diagnosed
      by having findings on a chest x-ray and one of the following: chest pain, fever, or trouble
      breathing. Patients with Acute Chest Syndrome can get very sick and require an exchange
      transfusion (special large blood transfusion) and mechanical ventilation. Bi-level Positive
      Airway Pressure (BLPAP) is a device that blows air into a patients lungs via a mask that
      covers the nose. Our goal is to determine whether giving children BLPAP when they have ACS,
      in addition to providing standard clinical care for ACS alters the clinical course of these
      patients. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving effective BLPAP will have
      milder clinical courses resulting in shorter hospital stays and fewer transfers to the
      intensive care unit and exchange transfusions.

      Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a frequent complication of sickle cell disease and is diagnosed
      by a new infiltrate on chest x-ray and one of the following: chest pain, fever, or
      respiratory signs or symptoms (tachypnea, cough, new onset hypoxemia, or increased work of
      breathing.)The treatment for acute chest syndrome is focused on supportive care with
      hydration, antibiotics, blood transfusions and respiratory support. Unfortunately, despite
      these treatments many patients fail to have improvements in their respiratory status, or have
      respiratory decompensation. These patients require more aggressive treatments, which
      frequently include exchange transfusions, pediatric intensive care unit (PCCU) management,
      and respiratory support.

      Our goal is to perform a prospective double blind randomized control trial to investigate if
      early initiation of effective BLPAP in addition to providing standard clinical care for ACS
      alters the clinical course of these patients vs. sham BLPAP and standard clinical care. We
      hypothesize that patients receiving effective BLPAP will have milder clinical courses
      resulting in shorter hospital stays and fewer transfers to PCCU and exchange transfusions.
