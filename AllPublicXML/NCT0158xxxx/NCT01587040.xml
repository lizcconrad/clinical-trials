      Primary Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the long term safety and tolerability of SAR245408
      and SAR245409 as a monotherapy or as part of a combination regimen in subjects who are
      benefiting from treatment.

      The duration of the study for an individual subject will include:

        1. Baseline assessments: within 7 days prior to the first dose of IMP.

        2. Study treatment period(s):

           Subjects will start study treatment at the beginning of the initiation or extension
           periods based on the length of prior therapy with SAR245408 or SAR245409

             -  if &lt;2 cycles, start with initiation period; subjects must complete all the visits
                in the initiation period before moving to the extension period.

             -  if ≥2 cycles, start with extension period; duration of extension period is
                unlimited.

             -  Subjects who will take a SAR245408 or SAR245409 daily dose higher than their
                established dose of SAR245408 or SAR245409, respectively, in the parental study
                will enter the study on Day 1 of the initiation period.

             -  Subjects who had dose interrupted in the parental study but fulfill parental
                protocol criteria to restart IMP treatment will enter the treatment-extension study
                on Day 1 of the initiation period.

             -  Subjects who fulfill the parental study criteria for IMP treatment continuation but
                have ongoing Grade 2 AE(s) will enter the treatment-extension study on Day 1 of the
                initiation period.

           Subjects may continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
           toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or until commercial supplies of SAR245408 or SAR245409
           are available to them outside of the clinical trial

        3. Follow-up assessments: 23 to 37 days after the last dose of IMP.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

        I 01. Males or females enrolled in Phase 1 or Phase 2 studies of SAR245408 or SAR245409 as
        monotherapy or in combination with other regimens who have complete data collection for the
        primary endpoint(s) of the parental study or who are being treated beyond the parental
        study cut-off and meet all the criteria to continue to be treated per the parental
        protocol.

        I 02. All sexually active subjects (male and female) must agree to continue to use accepted
        methods of barrier contraception (ie, condoms) during the course of the study and for 3
        months after discontinuation of study treatment. For women of childbearing potential and
        for men who can father a child, a second method of contraception in addition to a barrier
        method is recommended. Hormonal contraception should be avoided in subjects taking
        SAR245408 due to possible drug-drug interaction.

        I 03. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
        baseline. Females of childbearing potential are defined as sexually mature women without
        prior hysterectomy or who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months. However,
        women who have been amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of
        childbearing potential if the amenorrhea is possibly due to other causes, including prior
        chemotherapy, anti-estrogens, or ovarian suppression

        Exclusion criteria:

        E 01. The subject discontinued the parental study due to toxicity

        E 02. Ongoing Grade 3 or higher Adverse Event (AE)

        E 03. Ongoing Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

        E 04. Subjects with ongoing dose interruption for any reason unless the subject fulfills
        the criteria in the parental protocol for restarting IMP. In such case subject will start
        the treatment-extension study on Day 1 of the initiation period

        E 05. The subject has any of the following laboratory values ≥ Common Terminology of
        Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC),

          -  Platelet count,

          -  Hemoglobin,

          -  Bilirubin,

          -  Serum creatinine or calculated creatinine clearance,

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST),

          -  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG),

          -  Prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) and activated partial
             thromboplastin time (aPTT)

        E 06. The subject has a baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;481 msec or if a subject has
        had a QTc interval increase of ≥ 60 msec from parental protocol baseline to an absolute
        value of &gt; 470 msec

        E 07. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the study
        treatment formulation(s)

        E 08. The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
