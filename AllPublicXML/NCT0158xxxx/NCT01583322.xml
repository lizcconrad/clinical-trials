  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with extensive and bulky disease are often those whose initial surgery is delayed
      after 3 or 4 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

      In that case, there is, indeed, some concern to administer bevacizumab during the
      chemotherapy surrounding the interval debulking surgery due to the long half life (14- 21
      days) of this monoclonal antibody and the interference of anti angiogenic agents with wound
      healing.

      Vargatef® (Nintedanib) might offer a better alternative to bevacizumab in the neo-adjuvant
      setting. Vargatef® (Nintedanib) has a much shorter half-life of 7 to 19 hours. Preliminary
      experience in cancer did not show a trend for increased incidence of fistula or bowel
      perforation. For more details please refer to the investigator drug brochure for Vargatef®
      (Nintedanib).

      This trial will compare progression-free survival and surgical complications of 188 patients
      with FIGO stage IIIC/IV treated in first line with either neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
      (carboplatin &amp; paclitaxel) and interval debulking surgery or the same treatment + Vargatef®
      (Nintedanib).
