      Background:

      - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an approved surgery for certain movement disorders, like
      Parkinson's disease, that do not respond well to other treatments. DBS uses a battery-powered
      device called a neurostimulator (like a pacemaker) that is placed under the skin in the
      chest. It is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that affect movement. Stimulating these
      areas helps to block the nerve signals that cause abnormal movements. Researchers also want
      to record the brain function of people with movement disorders during the surgery.

      Objectives:

        -  To study how DBS surgery affects Parkinson s disease, dystonia, and tremor.

        -  To obtain information on brain and nerve cell function during DBS surgery.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 18 years of age who have movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease,
      essential tremor, and dystonia.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will screen patients with physical and neurological exams to decide whether
           they can have the surgery. Patients will also have a medical history, blood tests,
           imaging studies, and other tests. Before the surgery, participants will practice
           movement and memory tests.

        -  During surgery, the stimulator will be placed to provide the right amount of stimulation
           for the brain. Patients will perform the movement and memory tests that they practiced
           earlier.

        -  After surgery, participants will recover in the hospital. They will have a followup
           visit within 4 weeks to turn on and adjust the stimulator. The stimulator has to be
           programmed and adjusted over weeks to months to find the best settings.

        -  Participants will return for followup visits at 1, 2, and 3 months after surgery.
           Researchers will test their movement, memory, and general quality of life. Each visit
           will last about 2 hours.

      Objective:

      The objective of this protocol is to provide DBS surgery and to collect physiology and
      efficacy data related to DBS therapy and motor and cognitive function in people with
      medically refractory Parkinson s disease (PD), dystonia, and essential tremor (ET). All
      treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of care for DBS surgery.

      Study Population:

      Patients 18 years and older with medically refractory PD, dystonia and/or ET may participate
      in this study.

      Study Design

      The treatment that is rendered in this protocol is standard of care for PD, dystonia, and ET.
      Patients confirmed to have medically refractory PD, dystonia or ET will be offered DBS. The
      therapeutic goal of this procedure is to implant chronically stimulating macroelectrodes in
      the basal ganglia or thalamic nuclei in order to alleviate the symptoms of PD, dystonia or
      ET. Pre- and post-operative imaging will be used to precisely localize electrode locations
      within the brain and will be correlated with measures of clinical efficacy and recorded
      intra-operative neural activity. Intra-operative microelectrode recordings, as well as micro-
      and macroelectrode electrical stimulation, will be used to confirm positioning of electrode
      leads. Intra-operative electrode recordings will also be used to investigate the
      neurophysiological mechanisms of deep brain stimulation and to explore the neural circuits
      underlying motor and cognitive processing in the basal ganglia. Intraoperative physiology
      will be used for clinical and research purposes. Patients will be followed for 3 months after
      the surgical procedure to determine effectiveness of DBS treatment.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary goal of this protocol is to determine the physiology and efficacy of DBS surgery
      for movement disorders. Efficacy outcome measures include the change in motor symptoms, as
      measured by the UPDRS III scale, the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) dystonia rating scale, and the
      Tremor Rating Scale before and 3 months after treatment. Secondary measures include 1) levels
      of effective drug therapy before and after surgery; 2) change in behavior and performance of
      activities of daily living; 3) complications of therapy as measured by the UPDRS I, II, and
      IV scales before and after surgery and the SF-12 score; 4) radiographic correlation of DBS
      electrode position and clinical changes; and 5) neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS and
      motor and cognitive function in the basal ganglia.

        Be 18 years of age or older.

        Able to provide informed consent.

        Have a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD, primary dystonia, or ET:

          -  The diagnosis of idiopathic PD will be based on the UK Brain Bank Criteria, and
             confirmed by the Movement Disorders Neurologists in the NIH Parkinson Clinic

          -  The diagnosis of primary (generalized or segmental), hemidystonia, or cervical
             dystonia will be confirmed on clinical examination in the NIH Movement Disorders
             Clinic

          -  The diagnosis of ET will be confirmed on clinical examination in the NIH Movement
             Disorders Clinic (the diagnosis of ET will be based on bilateral, largely symmetric
             postural or kinetic tremor involving hands and forearms that is visible and
             persistent. Additional or isolated tremor in head may be present but there should be
             the absence of abnormal posturing).

        History of appropriate response to dopaminergic medication, with at least a 30% improvement
        in motor UPDRS with L-DOPA by history or in-clinic testing, for the PD patients OR:

        Patients with tremor-dominant PD that do not respond to dopaminergic therapy and that
        exhibit a tremor score of at least 2 for tremor severity on at least one side of the body
        on the motor UPDRS examination.

        Unsatisfactory clinical response to maximal medical management (with trials of both higher
        and lower doses of drugs), including:

          -  good benefit from dopaminergic medication but associated with insufficient duration of
             action or unacceptable side-effects OR

          -  intractable disabling motor fluctuations (severe off periods, dyskinesias, or freezing
             spells) OR

          -  intractable symptoms of ET or dystonia impacting at least 2 activities of daily
             living.

        Agree to undergo DBS if indicated to treat medically refractory movement disorder.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Candidates will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:

        postoperative complications, including but not limited to uncontrolled systemic
        hypertension with values above 170/100; active heart disease needing immediate
        intervention; active respiratory disease needing immediate intervention; uncorrected
        coagulation abnormalities or need for therapeutic anticoagulation which cannot be
        interrupted; current or pre-existing life-threatening respiratory disease, such as

          -  History of CVA, exposure to toxins, neuroleptics, or encephalitis

          -  Neurologic signs of upper motor neuron or cerebellar involvement, supranuclear gaze
             palsy, or orthostatic hypotension.

          -  MR-imaging with evidence indicative of secondary disease such as iron deposits in
             putamen, tumor, or stroke, which could cause the movement disorder.

          -  Features atypical of idiopathic Parkinson s disease.

        Dementia as evidenced by formal neuropsychological evaluation, Mattis Dementia Rating Scale
        (DRS-2) score, and clinical evaluations.
