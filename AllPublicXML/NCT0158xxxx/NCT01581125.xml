    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that sleep and performance depend on
      length of time awake, length of time asleep, the amount of sleep over several sleep episodes,
      and circadian phase.

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that sleep and performance depend on
      length of time awake, length of time asleep, the amount of sleep over several sleep episodes,
      and circadian phase. Inpatient sleep and performance data will be collected from healthy
      volunteers.
