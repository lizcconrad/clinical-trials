    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has age in the interval 2 months ≤ age &lt; 5.00 years, signs and symptoms of
             AOM, and moderate to severe pain (current episode ≤ 2 weeks duration). Moderate to
             severe pain is defined as a score of &gt; or = 4 (on a scale of 0 - 10) for the FAECC
             scale as assessed by the primary assessor.

          -  The patient's parent/guardian must have read and signed the written informed consent
             prior to study participation.

          -  The patient is normally active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the basis
             of medical history and limited physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has perforated tympanic membrane, history of a perforated tympanic membrane in
             the last 6 months, or if a perforated tympanic membrane could not be ruled out by
             speculum examination, impedance testing tympanometry, pneumatic otoscopy, or Valsalva
             maneuver. Patients who are subsequently diagnosed with a perforated membrane during
             treatment are to be discontinued immediately. Patients with tympanostomy tubes are not
             allowed.

          -  Patient has acute or chronic otitis externa.

          -  Patient has chronic otitis media (current episode ≥ 2 weeks).

          -  Patient has seborrheic dermatitis involving the affected external ear canal or pinna.

          -  Patient has received any otic topical or systemic antibiotic within 14 days prior to
             study entry (topical or systemic antibiotics for acne will be allowed on a chronic
             basis for subjects who have been on a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to
             entry).

          -  Patient has received any topical drying agent or over-the-counter therapy for otitis
             media within 36 hours prior to enrollment.

          -  Patient has fever ≤ 102.0 F (oral or equivalent).

          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity to the study drug or similar compounds including
             any of the inactive ingredients.

          -  Patient is receiving medication on a chronic basis for pain (including steroidal or
             non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and has not been on a stable dose for at least
             1 month prior to entry into the study.

          -  Patient has clinically significant mental illness (to be determined by the
             Investigator).

          -  Patient has been exposed to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study
             entry.

          -  Patient has been previously enrolled in this study.

          -  Patient or caregiver (parent/guardian) has a condition the Investigator believes will
             interfere with the ability to provide consent or comply with study instructions, or
             that might confound the interpretation of the study results or put the patient at
             undue risk.

          -  Patient has a glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or is taking concomitant
             medications associated with methemoglobinemia (such as nitrates or nitrites; aniline
             dyes; or medications, including lidocaine, prilocaine, phenazopyridine hydrochloride
             [Pyridium], and others).

          -  Patient demonstrates clinical signs of anemia. The absolute amount of deoxygenated or
             abnormal hemoglobin (rather than its percentage) is required for cyanosis to be
             clinically evident. Patients with moderate-to-severe anemia may not appear cyanotic,
             even with elevated percentages of deoxygenated or abnormal hemoglobin.

          -  Patient has congenital (i.e., hereditary) methemoglobinemia.

          -  Patient has a recent history of acute gastroenteritis within 14 days prior to study
             entry. An association between methemoglobinemia and acute gastroenteritis in infants
             has been noted in several studies and may be due to acidosis from stool bicarbonate
             loss impairing the already immature function of the methemoglobin reductase system in
             these young patients.
