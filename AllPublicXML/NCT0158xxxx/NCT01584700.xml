    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a common condition with debilitating symptoms and a poor prognosis. Patients
      with heart failure have a massively overactive sympathetic nervous system which attempts to
      compensate for their poorly functioning heart. This ultimately has only detrimental effects.

      One of the principle mediators for this sympathetic response is found in the nerve cells in
      the kidneys. Whilst a significant proportion of medications used to treat heart failure act
      on these harmful pathways, none target the kidney sympathetic-nerve cells specifically.
      Additionally, because of their multiple sites of action these drugs all have side effects.

      A new procedure that has recently been developed for the treatment of high blood pressure is
      renal denervation. This involves inserting a small catheter through the femoral artery and
      passing it to the kidney artery under x-ray guidance. From there, using radiofrequency waves,
      the sympathetic nerves within the kidney can be destroyed.

      The investigators anticipate that this procedure will have a significant positive effect on
      patients with heart failure and aim to perform a pilot safety study on 7 individuals with
      advanced heart failure to assess its safety and effectiveness. The investigators hypothesise
      that renal artery denervation will lead to significant clinical and biochemical improvements
      in patients with marked heart failure.

      One of the key physiological changes seen in heart failure patients is overactivity of the
      sympathetic nervous system. This is a homeostatic response produced by the body in an attempt
      to compensate for a poorly functioning heart and the resultant underperfused tissues. In
      acute heart failure this has a positive effect but in chronic heart failure, the long
      standing sympathetic overactivity causes multiple undesirable side effects including profound
      vasoconstriction, increased sodium reabsorption by the kidneys, renin release and decreased
      renal blood flow. Afferent and efferent sympathetic chains in the renal artery play an
      important role in the mediation of this response.

      Current management of heart failure principally hinges on drugs that attempt to attenuate or
      interrupt this response via renin angiotensin system, adrenoreceptors or the renal tubules.
      These drugs have multiple side effects, partly because of their multiple sites of action.
      None directly target the sympathetic discharge at its source.

      The development of renal artery denervation opens a unique opportunity for potentially
      longlasting relief of this intense renal sympathetic over-activity. The technique has a
      current role in the management of resistant hypertension where it has shown very favourable
      results with minimal side effects. The investigators envisage that this technique could also
      be highly beneficial to patients with heart failure by directly interrupting this sympathetic
      overactivity. This initial study involving 7 patients is a pilot safety study to assess this
      potential.
