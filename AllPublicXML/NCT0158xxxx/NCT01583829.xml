    <textblock>
      This study examines the efficacy of two computer-based attention training systems, one with
      and one without neurofeedback. The training systems intend to help children learn to focus
      and attend more effectively.

      The current study is examining a neurofeedback (NF) computer attention training system that
      teaches children to alter their brainwave activity with a Cognitive Training attention
      training system (CT). The investigators hypothesize that both treatments will show
      improvement in ADHD symptoms and academic outcomes compared to a control condition.

      104 children with ADHD in grades 2 and 4 are randomly assigned to receive the NF, CT, or a
      Waitlist-Control (WLC) condition that receives NF or CT the following academic year. Children
      receive forty 45-minute sessions three times a week at school for 4 months. A comprehensive
      assessment, consists of data completed by teachers, parents, participants, and double-blind
      classroom observations.

    <description>For the purpose of this study, the BOSS is a double blind classroom observation. Each participant is observed by a trained researcher for 15 minutes three times over the course of two days at each assessment point (before the intervention, after the intervention, and at a 6-month follow up) and is evaluated in the areas of off task behaviors (motor, verbal, and passive) and on task behaviors (active and passive).</description>
