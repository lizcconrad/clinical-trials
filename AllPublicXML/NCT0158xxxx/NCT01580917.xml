  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to compare the dynamic response of microcirculation in the
      skin on the bottom of the big toe after applying controlled plantar stress in 25 diabetic
      subjects with a history of foot ulcer and 25 age-matched healthy controls to better
      understand the role of local hypoxia in neuropathic foot ulceration in subjects with
      diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesize that if they apply a gait simulating load to the plantar foot
      and measure microvascular function, diabetic individuals will demonstrate an increased delay
      in reestablishing microvascular flow compared to healthy individuals.
