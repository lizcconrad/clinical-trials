    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, multicenter, open-label (blinded Pharmacodynamic PD results), randomized,
      3-arm, parallel-design study of subjects with stable Coronary Artery Disease CAD. This study
      will compare the PD effect of prasugrel 10 mg QD (once-daily) maintenance dose with
      ticagrelor 90 mg BID (twice daily) maintenance dose in subjects with stable CAD who have
      previously received ticagrelor loading does (LD) and maintenance dose (MD)..

    <description>P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) measured by VerifyNow P2Y12 assay VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, developed by Accumetrics, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA), has been approved by the FDA to assess clopidogrel response using whole blood in a point-of-care testing fashion. Platelet aggregation with this system is defined by PRU, with a higher PRU indicative of greater platelet aggregation, and a lower PRU indicative of inhibition.</description>

    <description>Platelet Reactivity Index (PRI) by the Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein(VASP) assay 2, 4, 24, 48 hours and 7 days after first randomized study treatment.
The VASP assay is an indirect, but relatively specific measure of inhibition of P2Y12-induced platelet activation. The assay quantifies the level of phosphorylation of the intracellular protein VASP, which undergoes phosphorylation when platelet P2Y12 receptors are blocked. The level of VASP phosphorylation, expressed as the PRI, represents the percentage inhibition relative to an assay baseline/maximal P2Y12-independent platelet aggregation.</description>

    <description>PRU VerifyNow P2Y12 assay device-reported percent inhibition 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours, and 7 days after first randomized study treatment
VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, developed by Accumetrics, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA), has been approved by the FDA to assess clopidogrel response using whole blood in a point-of-care testing fashion. The percent inhibition reported by VerifyNow device represents the percentage inhibition relative to maximal P2Y12-independent platelet aggregation achieved with the same sample in the presence of the iso-thrombin receptor activating peptide.</description>

    <time_frame>2, 4, 24, 48 hours, 7 days after first randomized dose</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of Mean Calculated Percent Inhibition by time point
Calculated percent inhibition at time point t is defined as: 100 × (baseline PRU - PRUt)/baseline PRU where baseline PRU is the VerifyNow PRU value at pre-run-in baseline and PRUt is the VerifyNow PRU value at time t.</description>

    <description>Percentage of subjects with High on-treatment Platelet Reactivity (HPR) defined as a) &gt;= 208 PRU and b) &gt;= 230 PRU by the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay and c) &gt;50% PRI by the VASP assay, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours and 7 days after first randomized study treatment.
A poor response of the platelets to &quot;drug&quot;, called High Residual Platelet Reactivity (HRPR), has been incriminated to account for a recurrence of ischemic events</description>

If the upper limit of the CI for the mean difference was not greater than 45 PRU, then the PD response to prasugrel 10 mg QD MD was deemed noninferior to that achieved by ticagrelor 90 mg BID MD.</groups_desc>

            <non_inferiority_desc>Noninferiority was assessed using a 95% CI of the difference in mean PRU between ticagrelor and prasugrel (2 arms combined). Under the assumption of 0 difference in mean PRU between prasugrel 10 mg QD MD and ticagrelor 90 mg BID MD, a common SD of 60 PRU (based on previous DSI studies and published data), and a drop-out rate not exceeding 15%, a sample size of 105 allows for the 95% CI to stay within ± 45 PRU (non-inferiority margin) with a power of 90%.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <title>Platelet Reactivity Index</title>
        <description>Platelet Reactivity Index (PRI) by the Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein(VASP) assay 2, 4, 24, 48 hours and 7 days after first randomized study treatment.
The VASP assay is an indirect, but relatively specific measure of inhibition of P2Y12-induced platelet activation. The assay quantifies the level of phosphorylation of the intracellular protein VASP, which undergoes phosphorylation when platelet P2Y12 receptors are blocked. The level of VASP phosphorylation, expressed as the PRI, represents the percentage inhibition relative to an assay baseline/maximal P2Y12-independent platelet aggregation.</description>
