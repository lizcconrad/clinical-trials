    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of vandetanib and everolimus that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.
      The effects of the study drugs at different dose levels and the safety of the study drugs
      will also be studied.

      Vandetanib and everolimus are both designed to harm cancer cells, stopping their growth. This
      may stop or slow the growth or spread of cancer cells.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of the combination of vandetanib and everolimus based on when you join this study. Up
      to 5 dose levels of vandetanib and everolimus will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be
      enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose
      level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable
      side effects were seen at the lower dose. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose
      of the combination of vandetanib and everolimus is found.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take the study drugs by mouth 1 time every day. The number of pills you will be
      taking each day will depend on which dose level you are in. The study staff will tell you how
      many pills you will take and will give you detailed directions on how and when to take the
      study drugs.

      Everolimus should be taken with about a cup (8 ounces) of water, with or without food.
      Swallow everolimus whole. Do not chew, break, or crush everolimus, unless you cannot swallow
      it whole. In this case, crush the everolimus tablet and mix it with 2 tablespoons of water if
      you are not able to swallow it whole.

      Vandetanib can be taken with or without food. Do not chew, crush, or break vandetanib.
      Vandetanib can be swallowed whole OR you can mix vandetanib with water. To do this, mix the
      pill(s) with 1/4 cup of water for 10 minutes and then drink; then rinse the cup with ½ cup
      more water and drink.

      You will be asked to fill out a pill diary with the times you take everolimus and vandetanib.

      The pill diary will be given to you for each study cycle. They should be brought with you to
      every clinic visit.

      Study Visits:

      At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had
      any side effects.

      Within 14 days before Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  If it has been more than 3 days since your screening tests, blood (about 2 teaspoons)
           and urine will be collected for routine tests.

      At Weeks 1 and 2 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Urine will be collected at Week 1 only

      Before Cycle 2 and then before every cycle after that for the first 6 months:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 ½ teaspoon) will be drawn to test your blood sugar.

        -  You will have an ECG (every 2 cycles).

      After you have completed 6 months on study and are tolerating treatment well, you will be
      seen once per every other cycle.

      Before Cycle 3, and then before every odd numbered cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, and so on):

        -  Blood (about 2-5 teaspoons) will be drawn to test for fat and sugar levels in the blood.
           °You will need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for at least 4 hours before
           this blood draw.

        -  You will have an x-ray, CT scan, PET scan, or MRI scan to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the doctor no longer
      thinks it is in your best interest, if the disease gets worse, or if intolerable side effects
      occur.

      You may choose to stop taking the study drugs at any time. You should tell the study staff or
      doctor right away if you are thinking about stopping your participation in this study. The
      study staff or doctor will talk to you about how to safely stop taking the study drugs. You
      may be asked to return for a follow up visit to check if any side effects happen to you.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have an end-of-study visit between 14 and 28
      days after your last dose of study drugs. The following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will be asked about any drugs that you may be taking and if you have any side
           effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You may have an electrocardiogram (ECG).

        -  If you are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      This is an investigational study. Vandetanib is FDA-approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Everolimus is FDA-approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, subependymal giant cell
      astrocytoma, and renal cell carcinoma. The use of these drugs in combination for the
      treatment of advanced cancer is investigational.

      Up to 174 patients will take part in this multicenter study. All will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson.
