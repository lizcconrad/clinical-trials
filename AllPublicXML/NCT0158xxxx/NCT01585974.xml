    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, non-interventional, non-controlled, multi-center, observational
      cohort study. The medication is prescribed within the regular practice of the physician.
      Duration and dosage of treatment is solely at the discretion of the attending physician. The
      primary objective of this study is to assess duration of treatment in Turkish renal cell
      carcinoma patients treated with TKIs (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors) who could not tolerate
      prior cytokine treatment within the first month of treatment.
