  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal and human data have supported the notion that administration of large doses of Vitamin
      C has beneficial effects on those subjects suffering from large burns. This effect may be
      due, in part, to the antioxidant and free-radical-scavenging properties of Vitamin C. These
      studies have demonstrated an improvement in urine output during resuscitation and reduced
      need for fluid volumes during resuscitation. In turn, these subjects demonstrated a reduction
      of wound edema, improved respiratory status (demonstrated by improvements in P:F ratios and
      reduced ventilator days), and no differences in terms of the possible complications of
      high-dose vitamin C administration between standard and treatment groups. The purpose of this
      study is to prospectively determine if Vitamin C can be safely used as an adjunctive
      treatment for patients suffering severe thermal injuries. High-dose vitamin C administered at
      a dose of 66mg/kg/hr during the acute phase of severe burn injuries will reduce fluid
      requirements in the first 48 hours after injury.

      Subjects presenting within 6 hours of a severe thermal injury, defined as greater than 20% of
      their total body surface area, or their family members will be approached on admission to
      Parkland Memorial Hospital and informed of the study. Those electing to participate in the
      study will be randomized to receive either high-dose vitamin C (66mg/kg/hr for the first 24
      hours, this dosage is based on prior human studies) in addition to the standard resuscitation
      algorithm (as per the Parkland Formula) or to a control group receiving only the standard
      resuscitation algorithm. These subjects will then be followed during their hospital course
      for fluid requirements, urine output, infectious complication rates, liver/renal failure
      rates, abdominal compartment syndrome rates, and outcomes such as ICU days, total hospital
      days, and mortality. All adverse events will be monitored by a data safety monitoring board.
      Currently this is a planned pilot study with a future multi-center study planned based on the
      results of the pilot. These studies will help determine if high-dose vitamin C can be a safe
      adjunct to acute fluid resuscitation in severely burned patients.
