      women with menstrual pain compared to usual care alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menstrual pain is a common problem in young women and one of the the main reasons of short
      term absence from school or work. There is some evidence that acupuncture and acupressure
      might be successful in treating of menstrual pain. Compared with acupuncture, acupressure
      offers the possibility for women with menstrual pain to do self-care treatment at home.
      However, studies have been small and self-care acupressure had been only investigated in one
      study from Taiwan.
