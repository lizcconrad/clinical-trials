  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine the efficacy and safety of once-weekly LY2189265
      (dulaglutide) in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking an oral antihyperglycemic
      medication (OAM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rescue therapy (defined as alternative antihyperglycemic medication use or dose modification
      of oral antihyperglycemic medication [OAM]) may have been initiated during the planned
      treatment period if the participant discontinued study drug or met prespecified thresholds
      for severe, persistent hyperglycemia. Efficacy data, as well as data for hypoglycemic
      episodes from participants who permanently discontinued study treatment but switched to
      another diabetes medication and remained in the study, were censored from the point of
      initiating new treatment onwards.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 26 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Least squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit, oral antihyperglycemic medication regimen (sulfonylureas only, biguanides only, or both), and baseline body mass index (BMI) group (&lt;25 or &gt;=25 kilograms per meter squared [kg/m^2]) as fixed effects, baseline HbA1c as a covariate, and participant as a random effect.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants achieving HbA1c level less than 7.0% and less than or equal to 6.5% was analyzed with a longitudinal logistic regression model with treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit, oral antihyperglycemic medication regimen (sulfonylureas only, biguanides only, or both), and baseline body mass index (BMI) group (&lt;25 or &gt;=25 kilograms per meter squared [kg/m^2]) as fixed effects, baseline HbA1c as a covariate, and participant as a random effect.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) at 26 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Least squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit, oral antihyperglycemic medication regimen (sulfonylureas only, biguanides only, or both), and baseline body mass index (BMI) group (&lt;25 or &gt;=25 kilograms per meter squared [kg/m^2]) as fixed effects, baseline FBG as a covariate, and participant as a random effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in 8-Point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) at 26 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were to test and record SMBG concentrations in their study diaries before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), approximately 2 hours after the start of each meal, at bedtime, and before breakfast the next morning (second pre-morning meal). Least squares (LS) means were calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, oral antihyperglycemic medication regimen (sulfonylureas only, biguanides only, or both), and baseline body mass index (BMI) group (&lt;25 or &gt;=25 kilograms per meter squared [kg/m^2]) as fixed effects and baseline SMBG as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Body Weight at 26 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Least squares (LS) means were calculated using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis with treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit, oral antihyperglycemic medication regimen (sulfonylureas only, biguanides only, or both), and baseline body mass index (BMI) group (&lt;25 or &gt;=25 kilograms per meter squared [kg/m^2]) as fixed effects, baseline body weight as a covariate, and participant as a random effect.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hypoglycemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with hypoglycemic episodes was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least one hypoglycemic episode over the 26-week treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. All classifications of hypoglycemia (documented symptomatic, asymptomatic, severe, nocturnal, non-nocturnal, probable symptomatic, relative, and unspecified) were included, except for episodes of relative hypoglycemia that were not severe. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

Assuming no difference in HbA1c change from baseline at Week 26 between LY2189265 and IG, this sample size would provide approximately 90% power to confirm non-inferiority of LY2189265 to IG. This computation was based on a non-inferiority margin of 0.4% with a standard deviation of 1.1%, a 1-sided alpha level of 0.025, and an 11% dropout rate between randomization and Week 26.</groups_desc>
