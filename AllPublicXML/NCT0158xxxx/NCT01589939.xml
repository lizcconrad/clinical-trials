  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study evaluates the clinical utility of a novel real-time localization
      system allowing for smaller volumes of normal tissue to be included in radiation field and
      determines dosimetric parameters and adverse effect profiles of radiation therapy using this
      technology. Subjects will have beacon transponders implanted into the prostate to more
      precisely localize the position of the organ during radiation therapy. Hypothesis: 1.
      Treatment with highly targeted radiation therapy can be delivered in a daily treatment time
      consistent with routine clinical practice. 2. Highly targeted radiation therapy with reduced
      PTV margin will result in a significant decrease in rectal and bladder volume treated.

      This study will seek to establish the clinical feasibility of a novel real-time localization
      and tracking system for use of reduced PTV margins during intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT), which will allow treatment of smaller volumes of normal tissue during
      radiation therapy. Such a reduction in the PTV margins and the exposure of healthy tissue
      during treatment may allow for several future improvements in prostate radiotherapy
      including:

        -  decreased acute and chronic adverse effects with similar local tumor control

        -  dose escalation to achieve higher cure rates with similar adverse effects to standard
           dose treatment

        -  hypofractionation to shorten the time of, and lower the expense of, treatment without
           increased adverse effects.
