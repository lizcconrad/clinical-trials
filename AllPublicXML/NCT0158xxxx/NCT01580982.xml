  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to oncogene-targeted therapy can be determined
      from tumor tissue or tumor cell lines derived from available archival samples and/or from
      standard-of-care re-biopsy upon suspected tumor progression.

      To identify baseline and treatment-related somatic changes in the tumor tissue from patients
      with lung and other thoracic cancers. To estimate the proportion of patients that subsequent
      therapy is altered based on the information acquired from such biopsies.

             pleurodesis, lobectomy, adrenalectomy or pleural catheter placement, providing tumor
             specimen appropriate molecular analysis or b) have previously had biopsy/surgical
             intervention with tumor tissue at University of Colorado or an outside institution
             available for medullar analysis.

          4. Patients must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign an informed
