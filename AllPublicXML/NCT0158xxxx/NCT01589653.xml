      This trial is conducted in Africa and Asia. The aim of the trial is to compare
      patient-adjusted versus physician-adjusted titration of BIAsp 30 combined with metformin in
      type 2 diabetes patients uncontrolled on NPH insulin.

        <description>Mean change from baseline in Treatment Related Impact Measure - Diabetes (TRIM-D) scores. The score measured treatment satisfaction which included a subscale score -treatment burden. The scores were transformed to a 0−100 scale with higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>
