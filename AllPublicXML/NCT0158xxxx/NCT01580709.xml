  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differentiating malignant from benign bile duct strictures is a conundrum, since no
      diagnostic test is highly sensitive for diagnosing cancer. While ERCP is effective in
      palliating obstructive jaundice, standard diagnostic tools in ERCP have a low diagnostic
      sensitivity and confirm the stricture's etiology in &lt;50% of cases. During the first ERCP,
      standard practice is to obtain routine cytology (RC) using a single brush sample. If this is
      not diagnostic, patients often undergo repeat ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound or other,
      increasing health care costs. The incremental yield of performing alternate ERCP-based
      diagnostic tools during the first ERCP including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH),
      cholangioscopy w/biopsy and multiple brushes for routine cytology is currently unknown. There
      are no studies quantifying the amount of testing utilized to firmly diagnose the etiology of
      the stricture, or the most efficient combination of diagnostic tools during the first ERCP.
      These are important knowledge deficiencies since a definitive tissue diagnosis during the
      first ERCP could reduce the need for downstream tests and expedite treatment, thereby
      improving patient-centered and economic outcomes. The added costs of using multiple tools
      during the first ERCP may be offset by these benefits.

      Among patients with indeterminate bile duct strictures, the investigators hypothesize that a
      multimodality approach will be more sensitive without a significant reduction in specificity
      compared to multiple brush samples for routine cytology. The investigators will test this
      hypothesis using an experimental trial design by randomizing patients during their first ERCP
      to multiple brushing samples for cytology vs. a single brush sample for cytology + FISH +
      cholangioscopy w/biopsy. To obtain preliminary data for a definitive multi-center trial, the
      investigators propose a pilot and feasibility study to compare the performance
      characteristics of each approach by evaluating the prospective clinical course, including
      treatment delay, quality of life, and life expectancy for each enrolled patient. If our
      hypothesis is validated in a subsequent definitive study, the standard approach to tissue
      sampling during the first ERCP may be altered.

    <description>A definite diagnosis of malignancy (i.e., &quot;true positive&quot;) will be defined as either 1) a cytological or histological interpretation &quot;positive for malignancy&quot; based on brushing for RC or biopsy; 2) subsequent cytological or histological confirmation of malignancy within one year of the index procedure, via repeat ERCP, surgery, other diagnostic test.
If a diagnosis of cancer is not confirmed after one year of follow-up, then the stricture will be classified as non-malignant and the negative cytology, FISH and histology from the index ERCP considered &quot;true negatives.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incremental yield of multiple brushings</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The additive role of each additional brushing will be analyzed for 1) adequacy of cellularity for cytological interpretation and 2) assessment of malignancy. The cytopathologist will be asked to interpret each of these outcomes using the first pass only (control group), first two passes only, first three passes only, and so on until all seven brushings are analyzed. The performance characteristics (see primary outcome) will be compared for each incremental brushing, assuming that a single intraductal brushing for RC is the reference standard.</description>

    <description>Complete data on medical utilization (e.g. hospitalizations, procedures, ambulatory visits) will be collected prospectively using Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC) health information exchange databases (clinical electronic health record (EHR) and claims). Direct costs associated with the diagnostic evaluation of the indeterminate bile duct stricture (BDS) will be measured in both groups, including those costs associated with the index ERCP and all treatment costs associated with each study arm.</description>
