    <textblock>
      Nowadays, stenting is became a standard of care in revascularization for superficial femoral
      artery (SFA) atherosclerotic lesions. However, the Achilles' heel of this technique remains
      in-stent restenosis (ISR). While most of local therapies have failed to demonstrate
      significant benefit, studies for the treatment of SFA ISR are lacking and percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty remains the current standard of care for this indication. Recent
      studies have shown successful results of drug eluting balloon in the treatment of SFA de-novo
      lesions and of coronary ISR. FREERIDE, a French prospective cohort has been set up to
      evaluate the safety and the efficacy of drug eluting balloon (DEB) for the treatment of SFA
      atherosclerotic lesions.

        From December 2011 to December 2012 at 13 hospitals in France, we will include patients
        with symptomatic atherosclerotic lesions related to superficial femoral artery in-stent
        restenosis to undergo endovascular repair by paclitaxel drug eluting balloon. 100 patients
        will be included.
