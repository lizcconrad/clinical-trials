  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to perform a randomized controlled trial among female patients
      with a diagnosis of pelvic floor hypertonus (extreme muscle tension) with associated pain,
      dysfunctional voiding, dyspareunia, and/ or obstructed defecation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the paucity of information and the magnitude of debilitation that can be associated
      with chronic pain syndromes, the potential to ameliorate pain and successfully treat these
      symptoms is an area that merits further exploration. In this study, we hypothesize that the
      addition of vaginal nifedipine to a physical therapy protocol will result in greater
      treatment success than treatment with physical therapy alone.

      The objective is to perform a randomized controlled trial among female participants with a
      diagnosis of pelvic floor hypertonus with associated pain, dysfunctional voiding,
      dyspareunia, and/or obstructed defecation. Group 1 will serve as the control and will undergo
      pelvic floor physical therapy and placebo (lanolin and mineral oil base). Group 2 will also
      undergo pelvic floor physical therapy, but will receive compounded vaginal nifedipine.

      Specific aims include:

        1. Comparison of subjective outcome measures, specifically quality of life metrics scales:
           Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, and validated
           11-point pain scale.

        2. Comparison of objective outcome measures, specifically a validated digital assessment of
           pelvic floor strength: the Oxford scale.

      Group 1 will serve as the control and will undergo pelvic floor physical therapy and placebo
      (lanolin base). Group 2 will also undergo pelvic floor physical therapy, but will receive
      compounded vaginal nifedipine. We will collect data on these patients to determine if the
      treatment of vaginal nifedipine with physical therapy provides a more successful treatment
      for this pelvic floor dysfunction.

    <description>The primary outcome will measure quality of life metrics, as reported by the patient herself. We will use the following validated instruments: Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire, and validated 11-point pain scale. The aim is to measure whether the patient experienced improvement in her symptoms when vaginal nifedipine was administered (in addition to physical therapy).</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome measure will be assessed and reported by the healthcare provider at the above visits. After instructing the patient to voluntarily relax the pelvic floor muscles, the resting tone will be measured using the Oxford scale, which is a validated digital assessment.</description>
