  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ovulation.</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Regular evaluation of follicle diameter will be made with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUS) to determine the time of ovulation or, in the absence of ovulation, the fate of any dominant follicle. A subject will be considered to have ovulated if she has two consecutive progesterone values of ≥10 nmol/L (≥3 ng/mL) preceded by a follicular measurement of &gt;10 mm in the previous 10 days. If the two qualifying progesterone peaks occur in different 30 day intervals, ovulation will be counted as occurring in the 30 day interval during which the first elevated progesterone was noted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The absorption of NES and E2 in subjects receiving 200 µg/day of NES and one of three doses (10, 20, or 40 µg/day) of E2 delivered by CVR continuously for 6 months (180 days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed to measure absorption in a substudy of 18 women (6 in each dose group) at a single center (Oregon Health and Science University) at initiation of each ring use and at final ring removal.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety of administering 200 µg/day of NES and one of three doses (10, 20, or 40 µg/day) of E2 delivered by CVR continuously for 6 months (180 days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical safety will also be evaluated by collection of adverse events (AEs). Blood chemistry and hematologic profile as well as measures of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and lipids will assess safety of the three treatment groups.</description>

               -  History of venous thrombosis or embolism in a first-degree relative &lt;55 years of
                  age suggesting familial defect in blood coagulation system, which in the opinion
                  of the investigator, suggests use of a hormonal contraceptive could pose a
                  significant risk.

               -  History of stroke.

               -  Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast.

                  evaluated by the investigator for inclusion based on risk factors that would
                  increase their risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and thromboembolism, e.g.
                  lipid levels, glucose level, BP, BMI, family history of CVD at a young age.

               -  History of retinal vascular lesions, unexplained partial or complete loss of
                  vision.

          6. Breastfeeding.

          7. Undiagnosed vaginal discharge or vaginal lesions or abnormalities. Subjects diagnosed
             at screening with a Chlamydia or gonococcus infection may be included in the trial
             following treatment; partner treatment is also recommended. Subjects with vaginitis
             (yeast, trichomonas, or bacterial vaginitis) may be enrolled after treatment.
             Investigators should make a determination if subjects are at high risk for
             reinfection, e.g. multiple sex partners, untreated partner, and whether such subjects
             can be included. In accordance with PI/medical designee assessment and local standards
             of practice, women with a history of genital herpes can be included if outbreaks are
             infrequent.

          8. A clinically significant Pap test abnormality, as managed by current local or national
             guidelines. Women with a current abnormal Pap (within the last nine months):

               -  In accordance with the Bethesda system of classification: smear suggestive of
                  high-grade pre-cancerous lesion(s), including high grade squamous intraepithelial
                  lesions (HGSILs), are excluded;

                    -  Women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LGSIL) or atypical
                       squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS)/high-risk human
                       papillomavirus (HPV) positive, or Atypical squamous cells, cannot rule out a
                       high grade lesion (ASC-H) may participate if further evaluated with
                       colposcopy and biopsy determines no evidence of a lesion with a severity
                       greater than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I.

                    -  Women with a biopsy finding of CIN I should have follow-up for this finding
                       per standard of care; women are excluded if treatment is indicated.

               -  In accordance with other Pap class systems:

                    -  Women with high grade dysplasia are excluded.

                    -  Women with low grade dysplasia or CIN I interpretation on Pap test may
                       participate following exclusion of a high grade lesion by colposcopic
                       evaluation based on Investigator discretion and provided there is
                       appropriate follow up in accordance with local standards.

          9. Known benign or malignant liver tumors; known active liver disease.

         10. Invasive cancer (past history of any carcinoma or sarcoma, except non-melanoma skin
             cancer).

         11. Current or past medically diagnosed severe depression, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could be exacerbated by use of a hormonal contraceptive.

         12. Known or suspected current alcoholism or drug abuse.

         13. Elevated serum fasting clinical chemistry values or complete blood count (CBC) values
             designated clinically significant by the investigator or medically qualified
             sub-investigator.

         14. Uncontrolled thyroid disease.

         15. Known impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal reserve.

         16. Body mass index (BMI) &gt;35.

         17. Use of injectable contraceptives (e.g. cyclofem or depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate)
             during the 6 months prior to enrollment or no spontaneous menses since last injection.

         18. Use of oral contraceptives within one month prior to start of control cycle (subjects
             must undergo informed consent process and screening procedures before stopping oral
             contraceptives to participate in the study).

         19. Use of hormonal contraceptives. NOTE: Removal of implanted hormonal contraceptives
             must have been for personal reasons unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this
             study.

         20. Current use of an intrauterine device (IUD). NOTE: Removal of an IUD must have been
             for personal reasons unrelated to the purpose of enrollment in this study.

         21. Known hypersensitivity to silicone rubber.

         22. History of toxic shock syndrome.

         23. Cystoceles or rectoceles or other anatomical abnormality that would preclude use of a
             vaginal ring.

         24. Planning to undergo major surgery during the study.

         25. Severe constipation.

         26. Use of liver enzyme inducers or inhibitors on a regular basis.

         27. Known HIV infection.
