      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine injection in
      treatment of Chinese patients with heart failure.

      A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical
      study was performed.

    <description>The cardiac functional changes between the end of medication (within 24 hrs) and baseline (prior to medication) are evaluated by the three-grade criteria (excellent, effective and no response). And calculate the effective rate.
Excellent: cardiac function improved for 2 grades and above Effective: cardiac function improved for one grade No response: failed to achieve the effective criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject aged ≥ 18 years, men or women.

          2. The subject has a diagnosis of chronic left heart or right heart failure (a past
             medical history of left heart failure caused by coronary heart disease, hypertension
             and dilated cardiomyopathy, or a medical history of right heart failure caused by
             pulmonary artery hypertension (the 1st type of diagnostic classification, WHO
             conference, Venice, 2003) and left heart disease (the 2nd type) ;the case number of
             right heart failure is about 30% of the total case number).

          9. Subject who is receiving other metabolism improving drugs within one month (such as
             trimetazidine dihydrochloride tablets and 1, 6- fructose diphosphate.

         10. Subject with other severe disease and his/her life expectancy ＜12 months.

         11. Subject who has participated in other clinical trial within 3 months or is
             participating in other study.

         12. Subject who has received L-carnitine treatment within 1 month.

         13. Subject who is allergic to L-carnitine and its derivatives.

         14. Subject is receiving other cardiotoxic drugs.

         15. Subjects with medical history of epilepsy.

         16. Subject who is a drug or alcohol abuser.

         17. Subject who has received PCI, CABG or vascular remodeling.

         18. Subject with arrhythmia that the investigator thinks unsuitable to include.
