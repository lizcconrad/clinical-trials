      1. This study is a phase Ib-IIa exploratory study to observe the safety of Antiplatelet
           Thrombolysin for Injection for the treatment of non-ST segment myocardial infarction
           (NSTEMI) patients and preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of different doses, providing
           the theoretical basis of the phase II and III clinical study protocol.

        2. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of different doses.
