  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of several enzymes of the gut mucosa in
      preventing invasion of gastrointestinal bacteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, septic shock and concomitant
      multiorgan failure are major causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units.
      During SIRS and septic shock the role of the gut seems to be uncertain. As it serves as an
      intestinal barrier which allows the symbiotic relationship between man and enteric bacteria,
      increased gut permeability during critical illness is accused to promote sepsis. Brush border
      enzymes have the ability to detoxify lipopolysaccharides and prevent bacterial invasion
      across the gut mucosal barrier. A reduced brush border enzyme function could contribute to
      the gastrointestinal intolerance in critically ill patients, which is frequently observed.
      The aim of this study is to assess the influence of SIRS and septic shock on brush border
      enzyme morphology and function in men.
