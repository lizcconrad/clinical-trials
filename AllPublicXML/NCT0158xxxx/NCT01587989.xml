  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study with a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group phase will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with methotrexate
      versus RoActemra/Actemra monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate rheumatoid arthritis,
      with an inadequate response to methotrexate. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg
      intravenously every 4 weeks plus oral methotrexate 15-25 mg weekly for 12 weeks. Patients
      with a good/moderate EULAR response will then be randomized to receive either
      RoActemra/Actemra plus methotrexate or RoActemra/Actemra plus placebo for the following 12
      weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 6 months.

    <measure>Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in DAS28</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC), both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as acute phase response (APR) determined as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH), both scored 1-100 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity). DAS28 was calculated according to the following formula: DAS28 equals (=) [0.56 multiplied by (*) the square root (√) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28 * √ of SJC] + (0.70 * the natural logarithm (ln) ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/h)] + [0.014 * GH in mm visual analogue assessment (VAS)]. A negative change from randomization indicated improvement.</description>

    <measure>vPercentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Remission at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. CDAI is the sum of TJC and SJC, both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as patient global assessment (PGA) and evaluator global assessment (EGA) of disease activity, both scored 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) as assessed by VAS. CDAI was calculated according to the following formula: CDAI = SJC + TJC + PGA + EGA. CDAI &lt; 2.8 = remission.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The RADAI-5 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. RADAI-5 is comprised of the following 5 questions: how active was your arthritis the last 6 months? (0 = completely inactive to 10 = extremely active); how active is your arthritis today with respect to joint tenderness and swelling? (0 = completely inactive to 10 = extremely active); how severe is your arthritis pain today? (0 = no pain to 10 = unbearable pain); how would you describe your general health today? (0 = very good to 10 = very bad); and did you experience joint (hand) stiffness on awakening yesterday morning? If yes, how long did this stiffness last? (0 = no stiffness to 10 = stiffness the whole day). RADAI was calculated according to the following formula: [question (Q) 1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5]/5. RADAI-5 from 0-1.4 = remission.</description>

    <measure>Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI scores were obtained by scoring participants' responses to a 20-item questionnaire. HAQ-DQ evaluated 8 domains of health: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities from a range of 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The sum of scores was divided by the number of domains for a total score of 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from randomization indicated improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 scores were obtained by scoring participants' responses to a 36-item questionnaire. SF-36 evaluated 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health from a range of 1 (better) to 5 (worst). The score for each section was an average of the individual question scores, which were scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). These 8 aspects were summarized as physical and mental component scores. A negative change from randomization indicated improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in Visual Analog Scales (VAS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scores were obtained by scoring participants' disease activity as assessed on a 0-100 millimeter (mm) horizontal visual scale. The left-hand extreme of the line = 0 mm (no disease activity = symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms), and the right-hand extreme of the line = 100 mm (maximum disease activity). A negative change from randomization indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in DAS28</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen joint counts (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC), both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as acute phase response (APR) determined as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and general health (GH), both scored 1-100 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity). DAS28 was calculated according to the following formula: DAS28 equals (=) [0.56 multiplied by (*) the square root (√) of TJC] plus (+) [0.28 * √ of SJC] + (0.70 * the natural logarithm (ln) ESR in millimeters per hour (mm/h)] + [0.014 * GH in mm visual analogue assessment (VAS)]. A negative change from randomization indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>The CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. CDAI is the sum of TJC and SJC, both scored 0-28 (higher scores indicate higher disease activity), as well as patient global assessment (PGA) and evaluator global assessment (EGA) of disease activity, both scored 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) as assessed by VAS. CDAI was calculated according to the following formula: CDAI = SJC + TJC + PGA + EGA. CDAI &lt; 2.8 = remission.</description>

(0 = completely inactive to 10 = extremely active); how active is your arthritis today with respect to joint tenderness and swelling? (0 = completely inactive to 10 = extremely active); how severe is your arthritis pain today? (0 = no pain to 10 = unbearable pain); how would you describe your general health today? (0 = very good to 10 = very bad); and did you experience joint (hand) stiffness on awakening yesterday morning? If yes, how long did this stiffness last? (0 = no stiffness to 10 = stiffness the whole day). RADAI was calculated according to the following formula: [question (Q) 1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4 + Q5]/5. RADAI-5 from 0-1.4 = remission.</description>

        <title>Change From Week 12 (Randomization) to Week 24 in Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) Score</title>
        <description>SF-36 scores were obtained by scoring participants' responses to a 36-item questionnaire. SF-36 evaluated 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health from a range of 1 (better) to 5 (worst). The score for each section was an average of the individual question scores, which were scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). These 8 aspects were summarized as physical and mental component scores. A negative change from randomization indicated improvement.</description>
