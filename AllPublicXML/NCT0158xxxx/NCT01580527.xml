  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy is a major surgery burdened by important morbidity and mortality
      partially related to the altered nutritional status of the patients. The perioperative
      malnutrition is a major risk factor of postoperative complications and worsens the prognosis
      of the patients. The perioperative artificial nutrition has for objectives to correct the
      preoperative malnutrition, and to maintain the nutritional status in the post-operative
      period. The current guidelines in surgery are in favour of a realisation of a perioperative
      artificial nutrition support that privilege the enteral nutrition. However, after
      pancreaticoduodenectomy, the total parenteral nutrition remains most usually used in the
      early postoperative period, although rare studies suggest a benefit of the enteral nutrition
      in term of reduction of the post-operative complications. Indeed, no recommendation was
      formulated concerning early enteral nutrition after pancreaticoduodenectomy because few
      studies were realized on its profits.

      The data of the literature report rates of complications (essentially major) from 49 % to 59
      % after major digestive surgery (not only pancreatic) on patients having received a total
      parenteral nutrition versus rates from 34 to 43.8 % in patients having received an early
      enteral nutrition.

      A preliminary prospective study realized in the investigators centre showed a rate of 74 %
      complication versus 44 %, respectively in the total parenteral nutrition and early enteral
      nutrition groups (50 patients in every group, with p &lt; 0.01. All the complications were
      listed prospectively).

      Hypothesis :

      The early enteral nutrition will allow, after pancreaticoduodenectomy, a decrease of, at
      least, 19 % complications of any stage according to the classification of Dindo-Clavien (59 %
      versus 40 %).
