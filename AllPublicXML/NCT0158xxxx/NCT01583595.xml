    <textblock>
      Most patients with chronic lung disease underestimate their actual walking ability due to low
      confidence. To better understand the relationships between lung function, self-efficacy for
      walking (confidence in ability to walk a defined distance), actual walking ability for the
      same distance gait speed and physical activity level-PAL- (total energy expenditure/resting
      metabolic rate).

      Quality of life, self efficacy for activity questionnaires, physical activity level
      measurement, 4-meter gait speed and 6-minute walk distance will be measured.
