    <textblock>
      This is a three armed prospective randomized trial that will compare two different surgical
      techniques for reconstruction of the abdominal wall diastasis with a conservative treatment
      procedure.

      The study hypothesis:

      Which surgical approach provides the safest and best long term results for patients with
      abdominal wall diastasis either the insertion of net alternative with a double row suture or
      exercise alone?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conservative control group will receive a special training program for abdominal muscle
      training for 3 months,and all groups wearing girdle for 3 months.

      All patients examined with a CT scan before randomization and then a Biodex measurement of
      abdominal muscle strength.

      All patients must also complete the SF-36 (scientifically tested instruments to measure
      self-reported physical and mental health) and VHPQ (ventral hernia Pain Questionnaire).

      Two-thirds of patients receive surgery and followed up with a 3 month and 1-year control.At 1
      year of control, all go through a CT scan and a Biodex measurement of muscle strength.

      The control group followed up after one and half months and 3 months. In the surgery group,
      patients may not know what reconstruction they received before the final assessment after 1
      year.
