  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if short bouts of structured physical activity
      implemented within the classroom setting as part of designated gross-motor playtime will
      increase preschool-age children during-school physical activity level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most preschool centers provide two 30-minute sessions of gross-motor/outdoor playtime per
      preschool day. Within this time frame, children accumulate most of their activity within the
      first 10 minutes. This study is a cluster randomized controlled study designed to examine the
      effects of short bouts of structured physical activity implemented within the classroom
      setting as part of designated gross-motor playtime on during-school physical activity in
      preschoolers. Results from this intervention could provide evidence that a physical activity
      policy that exposes preschoolers to shorter bouts of structured physical activity throughout
      the preschool day could potentially increase preschooler's physical activity levels.

    <description>Short bouts of structured physical activity preschools will be asked to implement age-appropriate 10 minute structured physical activity routines within the classroom setting followed by 20 minutes of usual unstructured playtime activities. Intervention will be implemented for a total of 30 minutes during both morning and afternoon gross motor playtime 5 days/week for 6 months.</description>
