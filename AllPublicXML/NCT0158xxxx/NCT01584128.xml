  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the investigators study is to determine whether the use of oxidized regenerated
      cellulose reduces the risk of vaginal cuff cellulitis, pelvic abscess, or vaginal cuff
      dehiscence in patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy. The investigators hypothesize
      that the use of oxidized regenerated cellulose will reduce the risk of vaginal cuff
      cellulitis, pelvic abscess, and vaginal cuff dehiscence in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      hysterectomy.

    <textblock>
      Structured non-woven absorbable hemostat (or oxidized regenerated cellulose) was designed and
      marketed for its hemostatic properties. It is used in our practice to achieve hemostasis at
      the site of the vaginal cuff closure during laparoscopic hysterectomy. While the hemostatic
      properties of oxidized regenerated cellulose are well known and documented, there is newer
      research to suggest that oxidized regenerated cellulose may have antimicrobial activity. One
      In vitro study investigated the antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose
      products against multiple antibiotic resistant microorganisms and found that the
      antimicrobial affect of the oxidized regenerated cellulose products was significantly greater
      than that of the controls. There are a limited number of studies investigating the
      antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose products in vivo (and none in
      gynecologic surgery).
