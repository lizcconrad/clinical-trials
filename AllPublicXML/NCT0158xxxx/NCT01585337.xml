      The hypotheses of this study are as follows:

        1. There is no significant muscle activity difference of each muscle in patients between
           pre and post operation.

        2. There is no significant forward reach distance/average velocity difference in patients
           between pre and post operation.

        3. There is no significant standard deviation of center of pressure (COP) along x axis,
           speed of COP along y axis during the task and COP path during the 3-sec holding phase
           difference in patients between pre and post operation.

        4. There is no significant muscle activity difference between muscles on both sides at post
           operation.

      30 healthy adults and 30 patients is going to undergo lumbar fusion surgery will be recruited
      in this study. The assessment will be held before surgery, two months, three months and six
      months after surgery. Visual pain scale and passive range of motion over lumbar, hip, knee,
      ankle joint of each subjects will be recorded. Then the maximum voluntary contraction at
      lower extremity will be measured by electromyography. Finally, the subjects will be asked to
      do forward reach by dominant upper limb/bilateral upper limbs/arm crossed in the front of
      chest for three times in standing and sitting position after five practices. The motion data
      will be collected by 3-dimension video and the muscle activity by electromyography.
