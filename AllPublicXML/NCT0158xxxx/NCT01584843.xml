    <measure>Severity of Duction Limitation at Weeks 1 and 4 of the FTP</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 4 of the FTP</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of duction limitation was calculated for participants with paralytic strabismus. For each evaluable participant, assessment was done by taking a frontal photo of the condition of the affected eye to determine the maximum movement toward the direction to which duction is limited while the non-affected eye was masked with eye-patch. The evaluation was performed in the same eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Based on the photos, the severity of the duction limitation was assessed on a 6-point scale, with scores ranging from 0=no duction limitation to -5=cannot rotate eye to midline.</description>

        <description>The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the alternative prism cover test (APCT). The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 meters [m]) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 centimeters [cm]). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 4 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <description>The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the APCT. The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at Week 1minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Strabismus Angle PD in the Primary Position at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the Second Treatment Period (STP)</title>
        <description>The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the APCT. The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. The absolute values of the strabismus angle in the primary position were summarized for observed cases at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48 (before reinjection of the second treatment period if applicable) after the final injection of the FTP (after randomization in the non-treatment groups).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Strabismus Angle in the Primary Position at Week 1 and Week 4 in Observed Cases (OC) of the FTP</title>
        <description>The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the APCT. The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. The values were summarized for observed cases for the percent change from Baseline in the strabismus angle in the primary position at Week 1and Week 4 after the initial injection in the FTP. Percent change from Baseline in the strabismus angle was calculated as: absolute angle ([strabismus angle at Baseline minus strabismus angle after the final injection] divided by the absolute strabismus angle at Baseline) multiplied by 100.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Strabismus Angle in the Primary Position at Week 1 and Week 4 in Observed Cases (OC) of the FTP</title>
          <description>The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the APCT. The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. The values were summarized for observed cases for the percent change from Baseline in the strabismus angle in the primary position at Week 1and Week 4 after the initial injection in the FTP. Percent change from Baseline in the strabismus angle was calculated as: absolute angle ([strabismus angle at Baseline minus strabismus angle after the final injection] divided by the absolute strabismus angle at Baseline) multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Strabismus Angle in the Primary Position at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the STP</title>
        <description>The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the APCT. The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Every participant’s evaluation was performed in the same affected eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Percent change from Baseline in the strabismus angle was calculated as: (absolute angle [strabismus angle at Baseline minus the strabismus angle after the final injection] divided by the absolute strabismus angle at Baseline) multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Duration of Effect</title>
        <description>Duration of effect is defined as the number of days after the final injection of the FTP (after randomization in the non-treatment groups) until the date of the first recording of a value smaller than 50% in percent correction compared to the maximum change in the strabismus angle in the primary position. The strabismus angle in the primary position was measured using the APCT. The strabismus angle was evaluated as the mean value of the distant-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 5 m) and the near-view strabismus angle (measured at a distance of 33 cm). Percent correction compared to the maximum change in the strabismus angle was calculated as: (absolute angle [strabismus angle at Baseline minus the strabismus angle after injection]/absolute angle [strabismus angle at Baseline minus the strabismus angle at maximum change]) multiplied by 100.</description>

        <title>Severity of Duction Limitation at Weeks 1 and 4 of the FTP</title>
        <description>The severity of duction limitation was calculated for participants with paralytic strabismus. For each evaluable participant, assessment was done by taking a frontal photo of the condition of the affected eye to determine the maximum movement toward the direction to which duction is limited while the non-affected eye was masked with eye-patch. The evaluation was performed in the same eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Based on the photos, the severity of the duction limitation was assessed on a 6-point scale, with scores ranging from 0=no duction limitation to -5=cannot rotate eye to midline.</description>

          <title>Severity of Duction Limitation at Weeks 1 and 4 of the FTP</title>
          <description>The severity of duction limitation was calculated for participants with paralytic strabismus. For each evaluable participant, assessment was done by taking a frontal photo of the condition of the affected eye to determine the maximum movement toward the direction to which duction is limited while the non-affected eye was masked with eye-patch. The evaluation was performed in the same eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Based on the photos, the severity of the duction limitation was assessed on a 6-point scale, with scores ranging from 0=no duction limitation to -5=cannot rotate eye to midline.</description>

        <title>Severity of Duction Limitation at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the STP</title>
        <description>The severity of duction limitation was calculated for participants with paralytic strabismus. For each evaluable participant, assessment was done by taking a frontal photo of the condition of the affected eye to determine the maximum movement toward the direction to which duction was limited while the non-affected eye was masked with eye-patch. The evaluation was performed in the same eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Based on the photos, the severity of the duction limitation was assessed on a 6-point scale, with scores ranging from 0=no duction limitation to -5=cannot rotate eye to midline. All participants with paralytic strabismus did not receive a second injection so there were no participants to analyse for this outcome measure.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Severity of Duction Limitation at Weeks 1 and 4 of the FTP</title>
          <description>The severity of duction limitation was calculated for participants with paralytic strabismus. For each evaluable participant, assessment was done by taking a frontal photo of the condition of the affected eye to determine the maximum movement toward the direction to which duction was limited while the non-affected eye was masked with eye-patch. The evaluation was performed in the same eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Based on the photos, the severity of the duction limitation was assessed on a 6-point scale, with scores ranging from 0=no duction limitation to -5=cannot rotate eye to midline. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Severity of Duction Limitation at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 of the STP</title>
        <description>The severity of duction limitation was calculated for participants with paralytic strabismus. For each evaluable participant, assessment was done by taking a frontal photo of the condition of the affected eye to determine the maximum movement toward the direction to which duction was limited while the non-affected eye was masked with eye-patch. The evaluation was performed in the same eye (left or right) throughout the study period. Based on the photos, the severity of the duction limitation was assessed on a 6-point scale, with scores ranging from 0=no duction limitation to -5=cannot rotate eye to midline. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. All participants with paralytic strabismus did not receive a second injection so there were no participants to analyse for this outcome measure.</description>
