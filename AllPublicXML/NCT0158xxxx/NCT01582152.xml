  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of Part I of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      TPI 287 that can be given with bevacizumab to patients with glioblastoma. The goal of Part II
      is to learn if TPI 287 when given with bevacizumab can help to control glioblastoma better
      than when bevacizumab is given alone. The safety of the drug combination will also be
      studied.

      TPI 287 is similar to a type of chemotherapy drug called a taxane and is designed to block a
      protein (tubulin) that helps the cancer cells divide. By blocking the tubulin, the drug may
      be able to cause the cancer cells to shrink or stop growing.

      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the
      growth of blood vessels.

      Part I and Part II of the Study:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you joined this study. Up to 3 groups of 3-6 participants will be
      enrolled in Part I of the study. After that, up to 90 participants will be enrolled in Part
      II.

      If you are in Part I, you will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 dose levels of TPI 287 based on
      when you join this study. The first 3-6 participants will receive a starting dose level. The
      next 3-6 participants will receive a higher dose if no intolerable side effects were seen or
      a lower dose if intolerable side effects were seen. Your dose may be lowered if you have side
      effects.

      All participants will receive bevacizumab at the same dose level for the entire study.

      If you are in Part II, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2
      groups. If you are one of the first 20 participants in Part II, you will be randomly assigned
      to a group. If you are enrolled after the first 20 participants, you will be more likely to
      be enrolled in the group that is showing better results.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive bevacizumab.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive bevacizumab and TPI 287.

      If the disease gets worse at any time during the treatment with bevacizumab alone, you may
      enroll in the Crossover Group to receive TPI 287 and bevacizumab.

      Other Drugs:

      If you are taking TPI 287, you will be given standard drugs such as Benadryl®
      (diphenhydramine) and cimetidine to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Drug Administration:

      There are 42 days in each study cycle.

      Part I:

        -  On Days 1 and 22 of every cycle, you will receive TPI 287 by vein over 1 hour.

        -  On Days 1, 15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 30-90
           minutes.

      Part II:

      If you are in Group 1:

      ° On Days 1,15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 30-90
      minutes.

      If you are in Group 2 or the Crossover Group:

        -  On Days 1 and 22 of every cycle, you will receive TPI 287 by vein over 1 hour.

        -  On Days 1, 15, and 29 of every cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein over 30-90
           minutes.

      Study Visits for Part I, Group 2, or Crossover Group of Part II:

      Every time you receive the study drug(s), your vital signs will be recorded before and at the
      end of the infusion.

      On Days 1, 15, 22, and 29 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1- 2 teaspoons) will be collected for
      routine tests.

      On Days 1, 15, and 29 of Cycle 1, urine will be collected for kidney function tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Your medical history and performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and if you have had any side
           effects.

        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of your weight.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

      routine tests.

      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are
      needed for your safety. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug(s) for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. If you enroll in the Crossover Group, you may continue taking the study drugs for
      up to 6 additional cycles in the Crossover Group.

      You may no longer be able to receive the study drug(s) if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and
      follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically proven glioblastoma or gliosarcoma to be eligible
             for this protocol. Patients will be eligible if the original histology was low-grade
             glioma or anaplastic glioma (WHO II or III) and a subsequent histological diagnosis of
             glioblastoma or gliosarcoma is made. Only patients with histologically proven or
             imaging proven recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be eligible for this
             protocol.

          2. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by
             MRI scan and should have failed radiation and temozolomide therapy. The scan done
             prior to study entry documenting progression will be reviewed by the treating
             physician to document changes in tumor dimension to confirm recurrence. Patients with
             prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery
             must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis.

          3. For this study, patients may have had up to 2 prior relapses provided the functional
             status and other eligibility criteria for enrollment are met.

          4. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating their awareness of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital.

          5. The baseline on-study MRI should be performed within 14 days (+/- 3 working days)
             prior to registration and on a steroid dosage that has been stable or decreasing for
             at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is increased between the date of imaging and the
             initiation of therapy (or at that time), a new baseline MRI is required. The same type
             of scan, i.e., MRI, must be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor
             measurement.

          6. Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be
             eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply: a) At least 4 weeks have
             elapsed from the date of surgery and the patients have recovered from the effects of
             surgery. b) Evaluable or measurable disease following resection of recurrent tumor is
             not mandated for eligibility into the study. c) To best assess the extent of residual
             measurable disease post-operatively, a MRI should be done no later than 96 hours in
             the immediate post-operative period.

          7. Patients must be 18 years old or older.

          8. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) equal or greater than 60.

          9. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy to &lt; grade 2
             toxicity per CTC version 4 (except deep vein thrombosis) prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1: a)
             at least 12 weeks from completion of radiation therapy except if there is unequivocal
             evidence for tumor recurrence (such as histological confirmation or advanced imaging
             data such as positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan in which case at least 4
             weeks from completion of radiation therapy will suffice (Note: for patients who have
             undergone surgery to confirm recurrence after radiation therapy, guidelines in 5.2.6a
             should be followed). b) 4 weeks from prior cytotoxic therapy. c) 4 weeks from prior
             experimental drug. d) 2 weeks from vincristine.

         10. 9) (continued) e) 6 weeks from nitrosoureas. f) 3 weeks from procarbazine
             administration. g) 1 week for non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen,
             cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does not count). h) Patients who receive
             anticancer agents for non-therapeutic purposes unrelated to this study (such as
             presurgically for obtaining pharmacology data for the agent) will be eligible to enter
             the study provided they have recovered from the toxic effects of the agent if any. i)
             Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to
             the Study Chair.

         11. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC&gt; 1,500/mm3 and platelet count of
             &gt; 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function (SGPT &lt; 3 times upper limit normal and
             alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2 times upper limit normal, total bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dl), and
             adequate renal function (BUN and creatinine &lt;1.5 times institutional normal) prior to
             starting therapy.

         12. Male patients on treatment with TPI 287 must agree to use an adequate method of
             contraception for the duration of the study, and for 30 days after the last dose of
             study medication. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (as evidenced
             by a negative pregnancy test prior to study entry), must not be breast-feeding and
             must practice adequate contraception for the duration of the study, and for 30 days
             after the last dose of study medication. An adequate method of contraception is one
             highly effective method or more than one additional methods. Highly effective methods
             include intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal (birth control pills, injections,
             implants), tubal ligation and partner's vasectomy. Additional effective methods
             include latex condom, diaphragm and cervical cap.

         13. Patient must be able to tolerate the procedures required in this study including
             periodic blood sampling, study related assessments, and management at the treating
             institution for the duration of the study.

         14. Exploratory, Cross-Over Trial Arm: Patients with evidence of clinical or radiographic
             progression on the bevacizumab alone arm are eligible for cross-over into the
             exploratory arm of the trial if KPS is 50 or greater and all other criteria for
             initial enrollment in the trial are still met at time of progression. Patients will be
             excluded if the investigators feel the patient will not tolerate TPI 287 or if an
             alternative treatment approach is deemed necessary by the treating physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures.

          2. Prior treatment with bevacizumab or TPI 287.

          3. Patients who are receiving concurrent Enzyme-Inducing Anti-Epileptic Drugs (EIAEDs)

             drug.

          4. Patients who have received more than one course of radiation therapy or more than a
             total dose of 65 Gy. Patients may have received radiosurgery as part of the initial
             therapy (i.e., in addition to one course of radiation therapy); however, the dose used
             for the radiosurgery counts against the total dose limit listed above.

          5. Patient who have received prior taxane chemotherapy for treatment of GBM or other
             malignancy. GliadelTM as part of the initial therapy is permitted. Patients who have

          6. Any condition, including the presence of clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities, which places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to
             participate in the study or confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.
             These would include: a) Active infection including known AIDS or Hepatitis C or with a
             fever &gt;/= 38.5°C within 3 days prior to the study enrollment. b) Diseases or
             conditions that obscure toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism. c) Serious
