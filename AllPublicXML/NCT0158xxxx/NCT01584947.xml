  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to do a fase two trial, where the effect of a local anesthetic
      lozenge will be tested in regard to oral pain, dryness of the mouth, irregularity of taste as
      well as investigate a potential antiinflammatory effect in patients with burning mouth
      syndrome, Sjögrens syndrome and lichen planus.

    <description>Assessment of oral pain in patients with burning mouth syndrome, Sjögrens syndrome or lichen planus after treatment with a bupivacaine lozenge or a placebo lozenge.
The patient assess their oral pain on the visual analog scale when they attend the four examinations. The patients also fill in a diary for a total of four weeks where they are in treatment where they assess VAS for pain, dryness of the mouth and irregularity of taste</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure the inflammation markers in blood, saliva and tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood- and saliva samples are taken the four times the patient attend the examinations. They are taken over a periode of five weeks. Tissue samples are taken before the first treatment period starts and when the final treatment period is finished.</time_frame>
    <description>The inflammation markers in blood, saliva and tissue will be analyzed to investigate if there are changes in the level in patients with chronic oral pain.</description>
