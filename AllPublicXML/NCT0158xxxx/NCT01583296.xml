  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research plan involves two aims: 1) Cultural adaptation of the Panic-Asthma Treatment and
      2) a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study. Participants will be primarily recruited
      from two major, inner-city hospitals in the Bronx, NY. Diagnosis of Panic Disorder (PD) will
      be based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Diagnosis of asthma will be based
      on national guidelines. The first year of the project will be devoted to approximately 5
      focus groups with Latino (primarily Puerto Rican) participants, pilot treatment and
      participant feedback. The protocol will be adapted based on key cultural issues that are
      systematically observed during Phase 1. During Years 2-3, 40 participants with PD and asthma
      will be randomized into two treatment arms: Panic-Asthma Treatment and an active placebo
      condition involving music therapy and paced breathing at resting respiration rates. Each
      treatment will involve 8 weekly sessions. An interviewer, who will be blind to treatment
      condition, will conduct assessments at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, post-treatment, and
      3-month follow-up. The primary hypotheses are that participants in the Panic-Asthma treatment
      group will have greater decreases than subjects in the placebo condition on the PD severity
      scale and albuterol use (i.e., rescue asthma medication) from pre-test to post-test and
      across 3-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and panic disorder (PD) share strikingly similar phenomenology. Respiratory related
      symptoms, such as dyspnea, dizziness, chest tightness, feelings of choking and sensations of
      smothering are common in both disorders. The overlap in symptoms between asthma and panic may
      lead an individual to mistake a panic attack as an asthma attack. In order to better
      understand this overlap, we hypothesized that participants who received Cognitive Behavioral
      Psychophysiological Therapy (CBPT) would display greater reductions in PD severity and
      improvements in asthma control at post- treatment and 3-month follow-up. We predicted that
      improvements in PD severity in the CBPT group would be mediated by reductions in the
      perceived physical consequences of anxiety. We selected music therapy and paced breathing at
      each participant's average respiration rate for the comparison active treatment. Randomized
      participants will undergo either the CBPT or MRT protocol, be given the same psychological
      assessments, and have their physiological data collected.
