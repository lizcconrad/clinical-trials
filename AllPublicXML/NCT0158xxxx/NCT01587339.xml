  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of anti-epileptic drugs available for the treatment of partial onset
      seizures in patients with epilepsy. This study is a systematic review of the published
      literature on anti-epileptic drugs and is designed to compare the relative effectiveness and
      tolerability of a selection of them with retigabine. The drugs chosen for this comparison
      were lacosamide, pregabalin, tiagabine, zonisamide and eslicarbazepine. They were chosen
      because they belong to the newer generation of drugs for epilepsy (as does retigabine) and
      they have a similar license as well as having published data from studies that were conducted
      in similar patient populations with similar methods. GSK commissioned YHEC (York Health
      Economic Consortium) to carry out this review and analysis. YHEC identified relevant studies
      from international databases. These studies had compared one of the chosen anti-epileptic
      drugs with placebo. The results were pooled and combined in order to summarize the data for
      individual drugs as well to compare the results for different drugs with each other and with
      retigabine. Since none of the individual clinical studies compared one active drug with
      another, this systematic review is an indirect comparison of these drugs, using an
      established and recognised methodology which has well understood limitations.
