      The 'DHANI randomized controlled trial&quot; seeks to examine the effects of prenatal DHA
      supplementation on newborn anthropometry where in healthy pregnant will be assigned to
      receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo daily from ≤20 weeks gestation through delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial would be conducted among pregnant
      women in India to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women with 400 mg/d
      algal DHA compared to placebo from mid-pregnancy through delivery. Eligible participants
      would be randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo baseline measures would be
      taken before the enrollment of the participant in the study. This study would assess the
      effect of maternal DHA supplementation on:

        1. New born anthropometry (birth weight, length and head circumference)

        2. New born APGAR score

             the offspring including anthropometry, dietary assessment, questionnaires and
             biological samples (blood and breast milk).

          -  Willing to provide signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women allergic (if aware) to any of the test products.

          -  Women with high-risk pregnancies (history and prevalence of pregnancy complications,
             including abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, any
             serious bleeding episode in the current pregnancy, and/ or physician referral); and/or
             diagnosed chronic degenerative disease(s) such as diagnosed heart disease, cancer,
             stroke or diabetes (as omega-3 could raise blood sugar and lower insulin production).

             intervention period.

          -  Reported participation in another biomedical trial 3 months before the start of the
             study or during the study (not to get the results of the present study contaminated).
