      Besides the main objective, there are 3 other objectives as follows:

        -  To evaluate the anti-cancer effect of HM61713 in NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of HM61713 and its metabolites after oral
           administration

        -  To investigate biomarkers related to the safety and efficacy of HM61713
