    <textblock>
      This project compares Family History Positive (FHP) for alcoholism subjects to matched Family
      History Negative (FHN) subjects derived from the project Principal Investigator's National
      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-funded longitudinal study of drinking behavior in a
      2000 college freshman population (known as the Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students
      study (BARCS)). The age of these subjects is a valuable one at which to capture the
      transition from harmful use to abuse/dependence. This project explores the effects of
      memantine in a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced manner on alcoholism risk-relevant
      tasks. More specifically, this project studies functional MRI tasks related to different
      aspects of reward and/or impulsivity-related behavior in different contexts, compares the
      underlying neural circuitry across tasks, and uses a pharmacologic probe of the glutamatergic
      system to examine NMDA/DA interactions. The combined measures provide the opportunity to
      advance our understanding of specific aspects of brain function related to familial
      alcoholism vulnerability in an already well-characterized population as some members evolve
      into alcohol abuse. In addition to conventional within-task analyses, functional network
      connectivity and allied approaches will be used to examine brain networks across tasks.

      The investigators will study adult male and female subjects in equal numbers who are either
      offspring of an alcoholic parent or are FHN matched controls. The investigators will recruit
      and assess a total of 84 (42 FHP and 42 matched FHN) subjects between the ages of 18-21 years
      on initial BARCS contact. The investigators will use 4 cognitive tasks during the functional
      MRI (fMRI) which include: 1) a Monetary Incentive Delay Task that distinguishes networks
      engaged in motivational (anticipation) and consummatory (outcome) components of reward
      processing; 2) a Go/No-Go Task that measures the ability to inhibit response to a pre-potent
      stimulus; 3) an Alcohol Cue Reactivity Task that examines Nucleus Accumbens response to
      alcohol-related versus matched soft drink stimuli; and 4) a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental
      Transfer (PIT) Task that dissects a component of the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task, and
      provides an imaging assay of a transfer-like process that can be related to real-world
      drinking behavior, thus informing upon and extending the key findings from CTNA-2.

    <time_frame>4 hours post intervention on each study day, separated by 1 week to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>All participants completed the fMRI Monetary Incentive Delay task on each study day. During the task, participants needed to select the correct response during &quot;win&quot; and &quot;lose&quot; conditions by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI. Participant's BOLD activation response (A measurement of oxygen level that is released to neurons since areas of the brain that are thought to be more &quot;active&quot; or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen to perform the tasks.) was measured while they performed the task in MRI scanner.</description>

    <measure>Change in Impulsive Behavior as Measured on the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) Computerized Task Between Placebo and Study Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours post intervention on each study day, separated by 1 week to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>All participants completed the BART task approximately 3 hours post drug administration on both study visits. Study days were approximately 1 week to 1 month a part. BART is a computer decision-making task that measures risk taking. Participants are presented with a series of &quot;balloons.&quot; The object is to earn as much money as possible by pumping the balloon without popping it. The point of explosion varies from trial to trial and costs participants the money they have earned in that trial.</description>

    <time_frame>3 hours post intervention on each study day, separated by 1 week to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>All participants completed the EDT task approximately 3 hours post drug administration on both study visits. Study days were approximately 1 week to 1 month a part. EDT is a delay-discounting task that exposes participants to choice consequences during test administration. The EDT involves multiple blocks of choices, one for each delay. Choices are made between a standard amount that is delivered immediately and is certain and a probable amount that is delayed and uncertain.</description>

During the task, participants needed to select the correct response during &quot;win&quot; and &quot;lose&quot; conditions by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI. Participant’s BOLD activation response (A measurement of oxygen level that is released to neurons since areas of the brain that are thought to be more &quot;active&quot; or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen to perform the tasks.) was measured while they performed the task in MRI scanner.</description>

        <title>Change in Impulsive Behavior as Measured on the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART) Computerized Task Between Placebo and Study Medication</title>
        <description>All participants completed the BART task approximately 3 hours post drug administration on both study visits. Study days were approximately 1 week to 1 month a part. BART is a computer decision-making task that measures risk taking. Participants are presented with a series of “balloons.” The object is to earn as much money as possible by pumping the balloon without popping it. The point of explosion varies from trial to trial and costs participants the money they have earned in that trial.</description>

        <description>All participants completed the fMRI Monetary Incentive Delay task on each study day. During the task, participants needed to select the correct response during &quot;win&quot; and &quot;lose&quot; conditions by pressing a button on a button box in the MRI. Participant’s BOLD activation response (A measurement of oxygen level that is released to neurons since areas of the brain that are thought to be more &quot;active&quot; or involved in certain tasks require more oxygen to perform the tasks.) was measured while they performed the task in MRI scanner.</description>
