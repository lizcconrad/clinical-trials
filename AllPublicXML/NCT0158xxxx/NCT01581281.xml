      The purpose of this research study is to test two medicines for migraine prevention in
      children and adolescents. The investigators want to see if amitriptyline and/or topiramate
      are better than placebo (sugar pill) in reducing headache frequency in children and
      adolescents ages 8 to 17 with migraines. At this time, there are no FDA approved medicines
      approved in the US for the prevention treatment of migraine headaches in children and
      adolescents.

    <measure>Number (Percentage) of Participants Reporting a ≥ 50% Reduction in Headache Days</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week baseline period and last 4 weeks of the 24-week trial</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency from the 28 days (4 weeks) baseline period prior to randomization to the last 28 days (4 weeks) of the trial. Headache frequency was defined as the number of days with headache for a given four week 28 day (4 week) period. A headache day was defined as any day during which any headache occurs within a 24 hour period, starting and ending at midnight.
For each participant, the primary endpoint involved a determination of whether a 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency was observed during the last 4 weeks of active treatment as compared with the headache frequency during the 4-week baseline period. Results were compared across the three treatment groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Absolute Headache Disability Score on PedMIDAS</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 24 week endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>The PedMIDAS scale which evaluated the impact of headaches in school, home, play, and social activities, is comprised of six items that pertain to days missed in various activities over the past 90 days. Questions were answered by the youth in consultation with their parents and reviewed by study staff. The PedMIDAS scale was administered at baseline (covering the three months prior to enrollment) and at the 24-week endpoint visit (the end of the maintenance period, covering three months of enrollment). A total PedMIDAS score (sum of items 1-6) was used in this trial. Scores range from 0-240; with a score of 0-10 indicating no disability, 11-30 mild disability, 31-50 moderate disability, and more than 50 severe disability in daily activities. The main outcome measure for this comparison will be the difference in the baseline and endpoint (24 week) PedMIDAS total scores for:
Amitriptyline vs. Placebo
Topiramate vs. Placebo
Amitriptyline vs Topiramate</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Number of Headache Days</measure>
    <time_frame>4 week baseline period and last 4 weeks of the 24-week trial</time_frame>
    <description>This outcomes measure examines whether the rate of absolute number of headache days, per 28 day period, differs between treatment groups over time. This was assessed longitudinally based on the actual number of headache days from the 28 days prior to randomization to the last 28 days of this 24 week trial. The change in absolute headache days was compared between:
Amitriptyline vs. placebo
Topiramate vs. placebo
Amitriptyline vs. Topiramate</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Migraine with or without aura (International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd
             Edition (ICHD-II) or chronic migraine (ICHD-II revised)

          -  Migraine frequency based upon prospective headache diary of 28 days must be ≥ 4.
             Migraine frequency defined as any migraine during one day in the 28 day baseline
             period (1)

          -  PedMIDAS Disability Score &gt; 10, indicating at least mild disruption in daily
             activities and &lt; 140, indicating extreme disability that may require more

                  midnight. If painful symptoms last longer than 24 hours, this is considered a new
                  and distinct migraine headache. If painful symptoms recur within 24 hours of
                  initial onset, this is considered part of the initial migraine episode and would
                  be counted as one migraine.

             developmental delays or impairments (e.g., autism, cerebral palsy, or mental
             retardation) that, in the opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with
             adherence to study requirements or safe participation in the trial

          -  Any and all other diagnoses or conditions which in the opinion of the site
             investigator, that would prevent the patient from being a suitable candidate for the
             study or interfere with the medical care needs of the study subject

             (2)&quot;Previously failed an adequate trial of AMI or TPM&quot; is defined as: dosage of
             1mg/kg/day of AMI or 2 mg/kg/day of TPM; trial of at least 3 months duration; efficacy

             (3)Subjects who cannot swallow pills at the time of the screening visit will be given
             a training session using behavioral techniques. Upon return for baseline visit, if the
             subject continues to be unable to swallow pills, the subject will be excluded from the
             study.

      <recruitment_details>From July 16, 2012 through November 24, 2014, 488 patients were assessed for eligibility from 31 sites in the United States. Of those, 361 patients underwent randomization.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of the patients assessed for eligibility, 21 (4%) did not undergo randomization owing to early trial closure and 106 (22%) were excluded. Eighty-one (81) were excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria, 25 declined participation (13 were unwilling, but eligibility was otherwise confirmed and 12 were willing and eligibility was unknown).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency from the 28 days (4 weeks) baseline period prior to randomization to the last 28 days (4 weeks) of the trial. Headache frequency was defined as the number of days with headache for a given four week 28 day (4 week) period. A headache day was defined as any day during which any headache occurs within a 24 hour period, starting and ending at midnight.
For each participant, the primary endpoint involved a determination of whether a 50% or greater reduction in headache frequency was observed during the last 4 weeks of active treatment as compared with the headache frequency during the 4-week baseline period. Results were compared across the three treatment groups.</description>

        <title>Change in Absolute Headache Disability Score on PedMIDAS</title>
        <description>The PedMIDAS scale which evaluated the impact of headaches in school, home, play, and social activities, is comprised of six items that pertain to days missed in various activities over the past 90 days. Questions were answered by the youth in consultation with their parents and reviewed by study staff. The PedMIDAS scale was administered at baseline (covering the three months prior to enrollment) and at the 24-week endpoint visit (the end of the maintenance period, covering three months of enrollment). A total PedMIDAS score (sum of items 1-6) was used in this trial. Scores range from 0-240; with a score of 0-10 indicating no disability, 11-30 mild disability, 31-50 moderate disability, and more than 50 severe disability in daily activities. The main outcome measure for this comparison will be the difference in the baseline and endpoint (24 week) PedMIDAS total scores for:

        <title>Change in Number of Headache Days</title>
        <description>This outcomes measure examines whether the rate of absolute number of headache days, per 28 day period, differs between treatment groups over time. This was assessed longitudinally based on the actual number of headache days from the 28 days prior to randomization to the last 28 days of this 24 week trial. The change in absolute headache days was compared between:
