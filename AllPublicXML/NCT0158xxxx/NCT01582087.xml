    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand mechanisms associated with the development of coma
      during hepatic failure. As of today, those mechanisms are not understood and it is difficult
      to intervene and prevent coma development which is often associated with mortality.
      Understanding the mechanism involved, may allow us to prevent coma and develop new therapies
      to treat this disease.
