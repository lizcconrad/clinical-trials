      Objectives: 1. Determine if mRNA expression could be use as a biomarker to predict and
      monitor the response to omalizumab in patients with difficult control asthma 2. Identify
      which genes are switched on and which are switched off by using Omalizumab.

      Methods: This study is an open label clinical trial, with six patients. The patients will
      receive Omalizumab according to their age and weight (maximum dose: 375 mg every 15 days) for
      4 months. There will be a run-in period of one month, when allergic asthma diagnosis will be
      confirmed and treatment will be optimized. Patients will be evaluated and will have blood
      sample collected on 3 occasions: in the beginning, 2 months after baseline and at the end of
      the study. Blood samples will always be collected one week after the last omalizumab dose.
      Primary outcome will be RNA expression of 20 genes measured by real time-PCR (high-affinity
      IgE receptor, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, gama-IFN, quimokines, Fc epsilon, between others). Secondary
      outcomes will be ACT, ACQ and spirometry.

      Study rational: There is not a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to
      Omalizumab and those who will not respond. Nowadays, the monitoring of therapeutic response
      to Omalizumab is based on clinical and spirometric data.

      On the other hand, when a medication is administered, it has its main expected effect, but
      also acts on other targets with various direct and indirect effects. We do not know all the
      genes that are switched on and those that are switched off by the use of Omalizumab. For
      example, anti-IgE has been developed to block serum total IgE and thereby improve control of
      allergic asthma. However, the studies noted that Omalizumab also reduces the receptors
      FcepsilonRI, which may have implications for the treatment of autoimmune urticaria.
