  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, there was no way of telling how firmly the tip of the catheter was in contact
      with the heart and how this contact was orientated. The electrical signals measured through
      the catheters, known as electrograms, are used to guide the sites and duration of ablation,
      but the effect of catheter contact and orientation on these signals in human heart muscle
      that is fibrillating is not known. New catheters have now been developed which can measure
      the force of contact at their tip: using these, the investigators will examine how contact
      force affects the electrical behaviour of heart muscle tissue in atrial fibrillation. The
      effect the force of contact has on the electrogram recorded will also be investigated. In so
      doing we hope to gain a better understanding of the relationship between tissue contact and
      the electrograms we measure and in so doing improve the safety and effectiveness of ablation
      procedures.

      Hypothesis: Catheter contact force and orientation have a significant impact on the
      characteristics of bipolar electrograms in the fibrillating human atrium.
