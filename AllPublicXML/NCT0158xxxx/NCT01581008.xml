    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the pilot implementation of two palliative care
      interventions in veterans with chronic heart failure at the Denver VA Medical Center. This is
      a study of behavioral and care strategy interventions and involves no investigational drugs
      or devices.

      The investigators will examine the feasibility of two palliative care interventions designed
      to improve different facets of quality of life. Briefly, the two interventions are:

        1. A palliative symptom management and psychosocial care intervention named Collaborative
           Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness (CASA) that includes

             1. evidence-based palliative symptom management of breathlessness, fatigue, and pain,
                provided by a nurse;

             2. a 6-session structured psychosocial care protocol targeting depression and
                adjustment to illness, supplemented by informal (family) caregiver assessment and
                support, provided by a social worker or psychologist; and

             3. brief weekly team meetings with the nurse, social worker/psychologist and a
                palliative care specialist, cardiologist, and primary care provider.

        2. A psychospiritual intervention that is home-based, self-guided, and requires minimal
           resources. It will be delivered in written modular form via US Mail along with brief
           weekly telephone support.

      The specific aims of the study are to:

        1. Examine intervention feasibility and determine preliminary estimates of intervention
           effect

             1. Determine patient participation rates and cohort retention

             2. Conduct a preliminary assessment of outcomes by measuring pre-post changes in
                quality of life, depressive symptoms, health status, life meaning, and
                spirituality.

        2. Obtain qualitative feedback from study participants, the persons providing the
           intervention, and providers/leaders in primary care, mental health, palliative care,
           chaplaincy, and hospital operations.

          <title>Cohort Retention</title>
          <description>Cohort retention will be determined by examining the proportion of patients who complete the final study visit (at 3-month follow-up) over the total number of patients enrolled in the study (including deceased and lost-to-follow-up). Our goal is an 80% retention rate for this pilot study.</description>
