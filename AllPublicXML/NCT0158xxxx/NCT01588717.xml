      The study consists of measurement of antidepressant-induced excessive sweating and its
      treatment with an experimental medication, glycopyrrolate (approved to treat ulcers), which
      will be added to the antidepressant. This is an open-label study (no placebo group or
      concealment of the nature of the treatment) that will last 8 weeks, including two weeks of
      baseline measurement without treatment with the study medication followed by six weeks of
      treatment with the study medication. The study is pilot study by Dr. Rajnish Mago that is
      based on the hypothesis that glycopyrrolate will be effective in reducing the severity of
      excessive sweating caused by antidepressant treatment, and will have minimal side-effects.

      Sweating is a common and bothersome adverse effect of treatment with antidepressants.
      Tricyclics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have both been clearly shown
      to cause sweating. Increased sweating has been reported with venlafaxine (Pierre and Guze,
      2000) and bupropion (Feighner et al. 1984) as well. It is unclear to what extent tolerance
      develops to antidepressant-induced sweating. It may continue to be a problem even after 6 or
      more months on the antidepressant (e.g., Mavissakalian et al., 2002).

      The prevalence of sweating with SSRIs is estimated to be between 7% and 19% depending on the
      drug (Ashton &amp; Weinstein 2002). According to the Physician's Desk Reference, excessive
      sweating occurs in 3-11% patients in clinical trials of SSRIs. Considering the fairly high
      prevalence of excessive sweating during antidepressant use and its consequences of patient
      distress and treatment noncompliance, it is important that more intensive efforts be made to
      understand the phenomenon and to systematically study potential treatments for it.

      The mechanism of antidepressant-induced sweating has not been clearly elucidated and there is
      no generally accepted treatment for it. Initially, a reduction in the dose may be attempted
      to resolve antidepressant-induced sweating. However, a reduction of dose may not always be
      helpful (Leeman, 1990; Ashton &amp; Weinstein 2002) as it has been noted that the presence of
      sweating is not a clear dose-related symptom. As well, reducing the dose of the
      antidepressant may lead to a worsening of depression and therefore be an unrealistic
      alternative.

      Antiadrenergic drugs like clonidine and terazosin (Feder, 1995; Mago and Monti, 2007; Mago et
      al., 2009) may be effective for the treatment of antidepressant-induced excessive sweating
      because the nervous system control of sweating is initially mediated by adrenergic receptors.
      However, antiadrenergic treatment may be associated with a decrease in blood pressure in some
      patients, which may lead to dizziness, especially on standing up. Also, the improvement in
      excessive sweating may not be complete.

      Therefore, additional approaches are needed. Sweat glands are innervated by nerve fibers that
      release acetylcholine. Anticholinergic medications could be used as a potential treatment for
      the excessive sweating. In case reports, the anticholinergic drug benztropine has been
      successfully used to treat antidepressant-induced excessive sweating (Garber and Gregory,
      1997; Feder and Guze, 2000). However, this has not been confirmed in a clinical trial. Also,
      benztropine readily crosses the blood-brain barrier; therefore, in addition to its desired
      effect peripherally on the sweat glands, it tends to cause cognitive side effects through its
      central effects.

      Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic medication that is preferred for a variety of clinical
      uses because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier to a great extent. It has been used
      for many years by anesthesiologists to dry secretions during surgical procedures. In a case
      series based on chart review (Tran et al., 2009), it was found to be effective for
      antidepressant-induced excessive sweating.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 years or older

          2. Presence of excessive sweating by self-report

          3. Within 2 months of initiation of an antidepressant or increase in the dose, there was
             a clear and substantial increase in sweating not explained by undue external warmth,
             exercise, or other reason. If treatment with the antidepressant was interrupted, did
             not persist for more than 6 weeks during that interruption

          4. Treatment with the antidepressant is deemed to be clinically necessary due to
             substantial benefit from the antidepressant that is causing the excessive sweating,
             and failure to respond to or tolerate an alternative antidepressant

          5. Decrease in dose of the antidepressant is either not clinically viable due to the
             benefit obtained at the current dose OR decrease in dose of the antidepressant has
             been tried but was not effective.

          6. Excessive sweating has persisted for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline assessment

          7. The excessive sweating is rated by the patient as at least moderately bothersome.

          8. Episodes of excessive sweating occur at least twice a week for last 4 weeks

          9. Use of effective contraception (e.g., sterilization, oral contraceptives, condom with
             spermicide, etc)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of another known disease that could potentially cause excessive sweating

          2. Failure to respond in the past to anticholinergic treatment for excessive sweating

          3. Previous allergic reaction to glycopyrrolate

          4. Narrow angle glaucoma

          5. Significant cardiac disease including cardiac or heart block

          7. History of urinary retention

          8. History of seizures

          9. Pregnancy or breastfeeding

         10. Other significant medical illness or laboratory abnormalities that, in the judgment of
             the PI, would increase risk to the patient
