  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a clinical syndrome characterized by repetitive closure of
      the airway and frequent awakenings during sleep. Repeated episodes of hypoxia, decrease in
      intrathoracic pressure, increased venous return and venous stasis, damage to vascular wall
      may ensue. An increased tendency for coagulation has also been reported in OSA. Venous
      stasis, vascular endothelial activation and hypercoagulability are also known risk factors
      for thromboembolism. All of these pathophysiologic changes in OSA may predispose patients for
      the development of pulmonary embolism (PE) however there is limited data about role of
      thromboembolic events in OSA.

        All subjects admitted to Department of Pulmonary Medicine of Gaziantep University who were
        diagnosed to have PE were included in the study group. Control group consisted of age and
        sex matched subjects without a clinic consistent with PE referred to the Sleep Clinic. PE
        was diagnosed when one or more of the following was present: compatible physical
        examination findings and multislice CT angiography or presence of deep venous thrombus
        (DVT) in addition to high risk with Wells criteria [5]. Subjects with any
        restrictive/obstructive lung pathology or younger than 18 years old were excluded.
