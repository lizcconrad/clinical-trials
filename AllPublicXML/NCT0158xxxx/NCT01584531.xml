  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine if rigosertib sodium, given orally in
      the form of soft gel capsules, is safe and is associated with a reduction in the number of
      blood transfusion units that are needed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
      classified as Low or Intermediate-1 (Int-1) (any cytogenetics) or trisomy 8 Intermediate 2
      (Int-2) in the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) who are transfusion-dependent.
      Rigosertib will be taken on days 1 to 21 of a 21-day cycle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase II open-label, multicenter (up to 5 centers), single-arm study. Sixty
      transfusion-dependent patients with MDS classified as Low or Int-1 risk (any cytogenetics) or
      trisomy 8 Int-2 by International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) will be enrolled to receive
      rigosertib BID for 21 consecutive days of a 21-day cycle.

      Patients will be stratified on prior treatment with azacitidine and/or decitabine and/or
      lenalidomide and/or erythropoietin.

      Patients will remain treated on study until 2006 Internation Working Group (IWG) progression
      criteria are met or until death from any cause.

      All study participants will be allowed, as medically justified, access to RBC and platelet
      transfusions, and to filgrastim [G-CSF]. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) will not be
      allowed during the initial 3 cycles. Rigosertib dosing adjustment policies are described in
      Protocol.

    <description>Rigosertib sodium will be available as soft gel capsules in strengths of 280 mg and 70 mg. Rigosertib will be administered on an outpatient basis.
Patients will take a 560 mg dose (e.g., 2 x 280 mg capsules) of oral rigosertib in the morning and 280 mg dose (e.g., 1 x 280 mg capsules) of oral rigosertib every day of 21-day cycles. Rigosertib should be taken in a fasting state (defined by at least 30 minutes before next meal) BID at 12 hr intervals (with a window of 2 hr). Any vomited dose will be reported as a missed dose.
The patient will fill a diary indicating the day and time of drug intake.</description>
