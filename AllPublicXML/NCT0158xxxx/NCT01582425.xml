    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole
      on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of methadone after single dose administration. The secondary
      purpose is to assess the safety and tolerability of isavuconazole alone and in combination
      with methadone.

             months prior to Screening

          -  The subject has had treatment with prescription drugs or complementary and alternative
