      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TA-650 using Pediatric Crohn's
      Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and other evaluation indicators in pediatric patients with
      moderate to severe Crohn's disease after TA-650 administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg at weeks
      0, 2, and 6, then every 8 weeks after week 14 up to week 46, and at a dose of 10 mg/kg if the
      effect is attenuated. The safety and pharmacokinetics are also evaluated.

    <description>TA-650 will be intravenously infused at 5 mg/kg as an induction regimen at Weeks 0, 2, 6. For subjects who meet the responder criteria, TA-650 will be administered at 8-week intervals thereafter until week 46. If the criteria for a dosage escalation are met, TA-650 will be administered at a dosage of 10 mg/kg.</description>
