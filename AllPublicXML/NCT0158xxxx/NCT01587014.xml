      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of the Prima-Temp Thermometer
      Patch in determining baseline temperatures of research subjects in a hospital intensive care
      unit (ICU).

      Primary Objective: Assess safety of the Prima-Temp temperature patch with nursing staff skin
      site assessments.

      Secondary Objective: Establish individual subject baseline temperature using intermittent
      temperature measurements (every 5 minutes) with the Prima-Temp thermometer patch and wireless
      transmission of the data to a receiver box and HIPAA compliant, centrally located personal
      computer (PC) and compare research subject's baseline temperature with temperatures taken in
      the ICU in the normal course of care.

      The manifestation of fever and its characteristics is essential to the care of intensive care
      unit patients. As a marker for infection or other disease process, the presence of a fever
      and its temperature peak must be reliably obtained in ICU patients and must be monitored
      closely to optimize effective therapy. Inherent variability of different temperature
      measurement methods can lead to a difficulty in determining the optimal timing of medical
      interventions. Ideally, nurses and medical staff in acute care hospital facilities could have
      a temperature monitoring system that aids recognition of fever and systemic infection that is
      not labor intensive and provides consistent and reliable temperatures. Automatic transmission
      to a data recorder lessens the chances of manual entry error into the medical record.
      Frequent measurements allow establishment of a patient's individual baseline temperature to
      provide individualized guidelines for medical interventions with an increase of 2°F above
      baseline as documentation of a fever. Finally, the frequent temperature monitoring should be
      minimally invasive and comfortable to the patient.

    <description>The nursing staff will complete a thermometer skin site assessment daily. If the patch is removed or dislodged prior to study day 7 and 14 data points for any reason other than temporary transfer from the floor for a medical study, the nursing staff will be asked to complete an additional comfort skin site assessment. The area evaluated by the nurse will include skin in contact with both the Covidien/Kendall Lifetrace® belt and the thermometer patch.</description>
