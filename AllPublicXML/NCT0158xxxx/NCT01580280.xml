  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: The group of cervicogenic headache patients receiving upper cervical and upper
      thoracic thrust manipulation will demonstrate significant and clinically important changes in
      outcomes when compared to the mobilization and exercise group.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cervicogenic headache will be randomized to receive 6-8 sessions over 2-4 weeks
      of either: (1) upper cervical and upper thoracic thrust manipulation, or (2) upper cervical
      and upper thoracic non-thrust mobilization and range of motion, strength and postural
      exercises.
