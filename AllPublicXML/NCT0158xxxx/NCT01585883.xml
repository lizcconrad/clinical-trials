  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the suitability and practicality of a coaching
      and support intervention in helping patients to use daily strategies for managing
      breathlessness. Also, the investigators will try to understand how useful it is in helping
      patients to reduce intensity of breathlessness and its impact their quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is common worldwide and is a leading cause of death. Breathlessness (dyspnea or
      shortness of breath) is a highly prevalent clinical problem in lung cancer, developing early
      in 25-50% of patients due to advanced stage at presentation. It persists in 60% of survivors'
      post-lung resection and worsens with progressive disease with rates as high as 90% reported
      in the final months of life. Breathlessness is associated with a high degree of
      unpleasantness, negatively impacts on daily functioning, and multiple domains of quality of
      life, triggers fear and anxiety in patients and their family, and contributes to symptom
      specific and psychological distress. It is also costly to the health system as it contributes
      to urgent care use and hospitalization. The purpose of this pilot trial is to evaluate
      feasibility and acceptability of a self-management intervention for breathlessness in lung
      cancer.
