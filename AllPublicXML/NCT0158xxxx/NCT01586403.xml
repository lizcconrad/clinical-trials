      The goal of this study is to establish the recommended phase two dose of autologous T cell
      receptor transduced T cells when administered with low dose IL-2 to stage IV melanoma
      patients following a non-myeloablative and lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen.
      A secondary objective is to evaluate biologic and immunologic parameters associated with the
      adoptively transferred T cell receptor transduced T cells, including auditory and visual
      changes. The investigators believe the infusion of T cell receptor gene modified autologous T
      cells can mediate objective clinical responses in stage IV melanoma patients.
