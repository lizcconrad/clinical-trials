  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are several factors involved in the decision and the retention plan, such as occlusion,
      patient age, etiology of malocclusion, the speed of the correction, the length of the cusps
      and health of the tissues involved, relationships inclined planes, size of the arches,
      harmony of the arches, muscle pressure, interdental proximal contact, cell metabolism and
      atmospheric pressure. Given these concepts, we need to find grounds to enable decision making
      with respect to the retainer that offers the best features of containment and stability.

      This study aims to assess the stability of tooth position and occlusal retention during
      treatment with two types of retainers, Essix type retainer and the retainer plate type Hawley
      in individuals who have completed their growth ending orthodontic treatment at the Faculty of
      Dentistry University of Antioquia and CES University Medellín

    <description>Dental stability will be assessed like this, models: rotation of central and lateral incisor, canine, first and second premolar, first molar on each side and each arch; and cephalometric analysis: SN-upper central incisive, FK-upper central incisive, palate plane-upper central incisive, interincisal angle, mandibular plane-lower central incisive; vertical distances: palate plane-upper central incisive, palate plane-first upper molar, mandibular plane-lower central incisive, mandibular plane-first lower molar; horizontal distances: A-Pogonion upper and lower central incisive.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occlusal stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Occlusal stability will be measured at the beginning and end of study through clinic exam and study models.
Clinic exam: canine relations right and left, molar relations left and right, overjet, overbite, presence of anterior open bite, presence of posterior open bite.
Models: upper and lower arch, upper and lower intercanine distance, upper and lower distance interpremolar, upper and lower intermolar distance.</description>

    <description>Hawley retainer is a device composed of an acrylic base with built-in hooks and a labial arch wire 0.022 &quot;x0.036&quot; and attached to the teeth. Its metal component consists of two adams hooks positioned from the first permanent molar right to left, a labial bow that progresses from lingual superface to distal of canine to integrate with the acrylic base.</description>

    <description>The essix retainer is made in a thermoforming copolyester 0.75mm (0.30 &quot;, it processed gives a thickness of 0.015&quot; approximately. Retainer will be used molar to molar. subjects in this arm will have this retainer for 24 hours a day for 6 months, they won´t have this device for food intake.</description>
