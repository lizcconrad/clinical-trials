  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare the improvement in breathing of single
      administration of CHF 1535 50/6 pMDI (fixed combination of a corticosteroid drug
      beclomethasone 50 µg + formoterol 6 µg/puff, 2 inhalations, total dose 100/12 µg) given with
      spacer versus free combination of beclomethasone 50 µg/puff pMDI (2 inhalations, total dose
      100 µg) given with spacer plus formoterol 6 µg/puff pMDI (2 inhalations, total dose 12 µg)
      given with spacer in terms of FEV1 from 0 to 12 hours in asthmatic children.

      Additionally the study aims to evaluate the effects of doses of CHF 1535 pMDI compared to
      placebo and the effect on other lung function parameters, to assess the safety and
      tolerability of CHF 1535 dosages in children.
