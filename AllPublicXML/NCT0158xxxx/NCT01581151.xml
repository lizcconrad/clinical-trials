    <textblock>
      This study seeks to compare dexamethasone implant with rescue intravitreal ranibizumab to
      monthly intravitreal ranibizumab for the treatment of macular edema secondary to branch or
      central retinal vein occlusion. This is based on the null hypothesis that dexamethasone
      implant with rescue ranibizumab has inferior best corrected visual acuity at six months
      compared to monthly ranibizumab alone.

      Dexamethasone intravitreal implant (DEX implant; OZURDEX, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA) and
      Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) as needed group:

        -  Patients will receive a dexamethasone intravitreal implant injection at day 0. Injection
           procedure will be identical to those previously described.8,19,20 Topical tetracaine
           drops will be given, a lid speculum inserted, and then 5% povidone iodine drops will be
           given. After subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine, the 0.7mg DEX implant will be
           inserted through the pars plana using a customized, single use, 22-gauge applicator.
           Patients will be treated with topical ophthalmic antibiotics four times daily for three
           days after the procedure.

        -  During monthly visits 1,2,3, and 5, patients will receive a ranibizumab intravitreal
           injection if the macula SD-OCT during that visit shows mean central foveal thickness ≥
           250 μm or the best-corrected visual acuity is 20/40 or worse. The injection procedure is
           described in the next section.

        -  During monthly visit 4, patients will receive a dexamethasone intravitreal implant
           injection if the macula SD-OCT during that visit shows mean central foveal thickness ≥
           250 μm or the best-corrected visual acuity is 20/40 or worse.

      Monthly Ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) group:

        -  Patients will receive a ranibizumab intravitreal injection on day 0. During each other
           visit, patients will receive a ranibizumab intravitreal injection. The protocol will use
           the term &quot;monthly&quot; to represent a 30 day interval between treatments. The minimal
           interval between treatments may be 25 days.

        -  Injection procedures will be identical to those previously described.8,19,20 Topical
           tetracaine drops will be given, a lid speculum inserted, and then 5% povidone iodine
           drops will be given. After subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine, a 30-gauge needle
           will be inserted through the pars plana, and 0.5 mg (0.05mL) of drug injected.
