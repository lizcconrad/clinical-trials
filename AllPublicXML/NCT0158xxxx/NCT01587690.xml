      MicroRNAs regulate gene expression. The abnormal expression of microRNAs has been reported in
      many human diseases. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if microRNA expression
      is changed in untreated and interferon-beta-treated patients with multiple sclerosis.

      MicroRNAs regulate gene expression. The abnormal expression of microRNAs has been reported in
      many human diseases. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if microRNA expression
      is changed in untreated and interferon-beta-treated patients with multiple sclerosis. The
      expression of microRNA will be analysed in cell subsets separated from peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells.
