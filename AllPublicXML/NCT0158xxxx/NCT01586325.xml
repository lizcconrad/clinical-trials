  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how a
      drug is absorbed and distributed in the body), and intrinsic antiviral activity of
      JNJ-47910382 after 5 consecutive days of administration in chronic, hepatitis C virus
      (HCV)-genotype-1-infected patients at different doses and dose regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor patient knows the name of the assigned drug),
      randomized (patients are assigned by chance to treatment groups) placebo-controlled study. A
      placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect. The study population will consist of Asian treatment-naive genotype-1, chronic
      HCV-infected patients. The trial will involve a screening period at a maximum of 6 weeks
      before baseline, a 9-day treatment period (with 5 days of actual medication intake) and a
      4-week follow-up period. Patients will be divided into 3 panels of 8 patients (Panel 1) or 5
      patients (Panels 2 and 3). Treatment will be initiated in each panel of patients
      sequentially. In each panel, patients will receive JNJ-47910382 or placebo during 5
      consecutive days. JNJ-47910382, or placebo, will be administered once daily. Treatments will
      be taken by mouth and with standardized meals in all dosing regimens. Patient safety will be
      monitored.
