  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if ipilimumab and nivolumab can help to
      control uveal melanoma.

      Ipilimumab is designed to increase the immune system's ability to fight cancer.

      Nivolumab is an antibody (a protein that attacks foreign cells) that is designed to allow the
      body's immune system to work against tumor cells.

      This is an investigational study.

      Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available to treat metastatic melanoma, including
      uveal melanoma. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available to treat metastatic
      melanoma, including uveal melanoma, that has gotten worse while taking ipilimumab. Combining
      these 2 drugs to treat of uveal melanoma is investigational.

      Up to 39 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive ipilimumab by
      vein over 90 minutes (+/- 15 minutes) each time. You will receive nivolumab by vein over 60
      minutes (+/- 15 minutes) each time.

      You will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab every 3 weeks (+/- 7 days) for a total of 4 doses
      (Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10). You will continue to receive nivolumab every 4 weeks after that,
      starting at Week 13.

      Study Visits:

      At Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. If
           your screening visit occurred within 14 days of your first on-study visit, it will not
           need to be repeated on Day 1 of Cycle 1.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or side effects you may have had and any drugs you
           may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and
           thyroid function.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      At Week 13 and every 4 weeks after that:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or side effects you may have had and any drugs you
           may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and liver function tests.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      Sometime during Cycles 2-4, you will have a core or excisional biopsy of the tumor for
      biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers. Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and
      may be related to your reaction to the study drug. To perform a core biopsy, a sample of
      tissue is removed using a hollow core needle that has a cutting edge. To perform an
      excisional biopsy, the area of abnormal skin, including a portion of normal skin area is
      removed by cutting it out. You may receive stitches after an excisional biopsy.

      At Week 13 and every 12 weeks after that (+/- 7 days):

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon ) will be drawn to check your thyroid function.

        -  You will have a scan such as a CT scan to check the status of the disease. This may
           include imaging of the brain if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive up to 4 doses of ipilimumab and may continue taking nivolumab for up to 2
      years or as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      You may no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment
      visit, and follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you are finished taking the study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or side effects you may have had and any side drugs
           you may be taking.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver and
           thyroid function.

      Follow-Up:

      For at least 60 days after you are finished taking the study drugs, you will have follow-up
      by phone or at the clinic. You will be asked how you are doing.
