  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Canakinumab (ILARIS®) in subjects with
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy secondary to type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ten subjects will be
      enrolled to receive 150 mg Canakinumab (ILARIS®) by subcutaneous injection. Beginning on day
      0, each subject will receive a subcutaneous injection of study drug every 8 weeks for 16
      weeks, a total of 3 injections. All subjects will undergo regular follow-up assessments every
      8 weeks through 24 weeks. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is repeated every 8 weeks. In case of
      progression of retinal neovascularization on FA panretinal laser photocoagulation is
      administered as rescue therapy. The primary outcome is the regression of retinal
      neovascularizations (NVE and NVD) in FA at 24 weeks. In addition to key secondary outcomes
      including regression of diabetic macular edema, change in best-corrected visual acuity,
      change in HbA1c levels and change in markers of systemic inflammation. Safety will be
      assessed by measurements of vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and the recording
      of adverse clinical events.

        American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria for type 1 (TD1) or type 2 (T2D)
        diabetes

        Evidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy with:

          1. Active retinal neovascularization defined by fluorescein angiography as non-high risk
             proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDRP; NVD &lt; 1/3 disc area; NVE &lt; ½ disc area) or

          2. High risk PDRP treated with prior panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP), showing
             persistent, active retinal neovascularization. The last session of PRP should not be
             within 12 weeks prior to enrolment.

        For female subjects of child-bearing age, a negative serum pregnancy test is mandatory. For
        subjects with reproductive potential, a willingness to utilize adequate contraception and
        not become pregnant. Adequate contraceptive measures include oral contraceptives (stable
        use for two or more cycles prior to Screening); IUD; Depo-Provera®; Norplant® System
        implants; condom or diaphragm used in conjunction with contraceptive sponge, foam or jelly;
        and abstinence.
