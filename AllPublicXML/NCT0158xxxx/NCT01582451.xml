    <measure>Change From Baseline to 26-week Endpoint in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a test that measures a participant's average blood glucose level over a 2 to 3 month timeframe. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for stratification factors (country, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C, &lt;100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and ≥100 mg/dL], and sulfonylurea (SU) or meglitinide use), visit, treatment, visit-by-treatment interaction, and baseline HbA1c.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 52 Weeks in HbA1c</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>LS means were calculated using MMRM adjusting for stratification factors (country, baseline LDL-C [&lt;100 mg/dL and ≥100 mg/dL], and SU or meglitinide use), visit, treatment, visit-by-treatment interaction, and baseline HbA1c.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Total and Nocturnal Hypoglycemia Events (Adjusted by 30 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 26 weeks and Baseline through 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hypoglycemic episodes are defined as events which are associated with reported signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and/or documented blood glucose (BG) concentrations of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]). A nocturnal hypoglycemic event occurred between bedtime and waking. Group mean rates of total and nocturnal hypoglycemia (per 30 days) are presented and were calculated from negative binomial regression models (number of episodes = treatment + baseline hypoglycemia rate + baseline SU or meglitinide use, with log [exposure in days/30] as an offset variable). Group Mean is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

    <measure>European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension (EuroQol-5D) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a 3-level scale of 1-3 (no problem, some problems, and extreme problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United States population-based algorithm. Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health. LS means were calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment, stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use), and baseline EuroQol-5D score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ITSQ is a validated instrument containing 22 items that assess treatment satisfaction for participants with diabetes and on insulin. The questionnaire measures satisfaction from the following 5 domains: Inconvenience of Regimen, Lifestyle Flexibility, Glycemic Control, Hypoglycemic Control, Insulin Delivery Device. Data presented are the transformed overall score on a scale of 0-100, where a higher score indicate better treatment satisfaction. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment and stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use) as fixed effects and baseline value of the ITSQ score as a covariate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adult Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>LBSS (also referenced as Hypoglycemia Fear Survey - II [HFS-II]) is a 33-item questionnaire that measures 1) behaviors to avoid hypoglycemia and its negative consequences (15 items) and 2) worries about hypoglycemia and its negative consequences (18 items). Responses are made on a 5-point Likert scale where 0 = Never and 4 = Always. Total score is the sum of all items (range 0-132). Higher total scores reflect greater fear of hypoglycemia. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment and stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use) as fixed effects and baseline value of the LBSS score as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Rate of Total and Nocturnal Hypoglycemia Events (Adjusted by 30 Days)</title>
        <description>Hypoglycemic episodes are defined as events which are associated with reported signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and/or documented blood glucose (BG) concentrations of ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 millimoles per liter [mmol/L]). A nocturnal hypoglycemic event occurred between bedtime and waking. Group mean rates of total and nocturnal hypoglycemia (per 30 days) are presented and were calculated from negative binomial regression models (number of episodes = treatment + baseline hypoglycemia rate + baseline SU or meglitinide use, with log [exposure in days/30] as an offset variable). Group Mean is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

Group Mean is estimated by taking the inverse link function on individual participant covariates first and then averages over all participants.</description>

        <title>European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension (EuroQol-5D) Score</title>
        <description>The EuroQol-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a 3-level scale of 1-3 (no problem, some problems, and extreme problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United States population-based algorithm. Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health. LS means were calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment, stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use), and baseline EuroQol-5D score.</description>

        <population>Participants who were randomized, had at least 1 dose of study medication, and had evaluable EuroQol-5D data at both baseline and post-baseline. Missing endpoints were imputed by applying the LOCF method to the post-baseline data.</population>

          <title>European Quality of Life - 5 Dimension (EuroQol-5D) Score</title>
          <description>The EuroQol-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression using a 3-level scale of 1-3 (no problem, some problems, and extreme problems). These combinations of attributes are converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United States population-based algorithm. Scores range from -0.11 to 1.0, where a score of 1.0 indicates perfect health. LS means were calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment, stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use), and baseline EuroQol-5D score.</description>
          <population>Participants who were randomized, had at least 1 dose of study medication, and had evaluable EuroQol-5D data at both baseline and post-baseline. Missing endpoints were imputed by applying the LOCF method to the post-baseline data.</population>

        <title>Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ) Score</title>
        <description>ITSQ is a validated instrument containing 22 items that assess treatment satisfaction for participants with diabetes and on insulin. The questionnaire measures satisfaction from the following 5 domains: Inconvenience of Regimen, Lifestyle Flexibility, Glycemic Control, Hypoglycemic Control, Insulin Delivery Device. Data presented are the transformed overall score on a scale of 0-100, where a higher score indicate better treatment satisfaction. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment and stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use) as fixed effects and baseline value of the ITSQ score as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Adult Low Blood Sugar Survey (LBSS) Score</title>
        <description>LBSS (also referenced as Hypoglycemia Fear Survey – II [HFS-II]) is a 33-item questionnaire that measures 1) behaviors to avoid hypoglycemia and its negative consequences (15 items) and 2) worries about hypoglycemia and its negative consequences (18 items). Responses are made on a 5-point Likert scale where 0 = Never and 4 = Always. Total score is the sum of all items (range 0-132). Higher total scores reflect greater fear of hypoglycemia. LS means were calculated using ANCOVA with treatment and stratification factors (country, baseline HbA1c [≤8.5% and &gt;8.5%], and SU or meglitinide use) as fixed effects and baseline value of the LBSS score as a covariate.</description>
