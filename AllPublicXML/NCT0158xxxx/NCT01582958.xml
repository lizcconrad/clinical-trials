  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to test the hypothesis that osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT)
      given to patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      enrolled in a 12-week pulmonary rehabilitation program (PRP) will result in improved
      respiratory pump function over and above that seen in sham and control groups. Specifically,
      we will study the effects of three OMT techniques: (a) thoracic inlet indirect myofascial
      release; (b) rib raising with continued stretch of the paraspinal muscle to the L2 level; and
      (c) cervical paraspinal muscle stretch with suboccipital muscle release. The key clinical
      readouts will include: spirometry, P100 (and index of diaphragm and inspiratory muscle
      efficiency), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), as
      well as laser evaluation of chest wall excursion. Supplementing these objective parameters
      will be several more subjective clinical outcome measures: exercise tolerance (6-minute walk
      test), dyspnea (shortness of breath questionnaire), and quality of life questionnaire.
      Finally, an attempt will be made to correlate biochemical alterations that may shed light on
      the biological mechanism underlying the OMT procedures.

      According to the above directions (provide a more extensice description, if desired), I am
      choosing to just submit the brief summary.
