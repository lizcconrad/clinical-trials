    <textblock>
      Coronary MDCT (multi-detector computed tomography) has been useful screening imaging modality
      for the coronary artery disease. Recently, novel adipokines and hepatokines as well as
      various inflammatory markers have been known as direct regulators of atherosclerosis.
      Therefore, the investigators examine the correlation of various metabolic risk factors
      including adipokines and hepatokines with coronary atherosclerosis measured by coronary MDCT
      in apparently healthy people.
