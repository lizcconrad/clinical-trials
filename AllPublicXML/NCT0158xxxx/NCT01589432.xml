        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subject is between the ages of 18 to 75 years with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus
             and must have a diagnosis of painful distal symmetric diabetic polyneuropathy and
             presence of ongoing pain due to diabetic peripheral neuropathy for at least 6 months.

          -  Subject must have an average score of greater than or equal to 4 on the 24 hour
             average pain score (0-10 numerical rating scale) collected over approximately 7 days
             prior to the Baseline Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subject has clinically symptomatic neuropathic pain conditions that can not be
             distinguished from diabetic neuropathic pain or interfere with the pain assessments of
             diabetic neuropathic pain.

          -  A subject has newly diagnosed or clinically significant medical conditions or mental
             disorders that would preclude participation or would interfere with diabetic
             neuropathic pain assessments or other functions.

          -  Subject has clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests.
