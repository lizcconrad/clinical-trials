  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trials of HIV prevention interventions typically include extensive
      baseline assessments of the risk behaviors that interventions target. Such pretests have the
      potential to direct participants' attention to the factors that put them at risk of HIV
      infection. Evidence from intervention study control groups, the motivational enhancement and
      attitude change literature, and our preliminary studies suggest that assessments that lead
      people to think about behaviors with potentially negative outcomes lead to motivation for
      risk behavior reduction. As a consequence, HIV intervention research using baseline
      assessments may not accurately predict the impact of a given HIV prevention intervention
      outside of the research context, in particular when interventions are evaluated among
      high-risk, isolated individuals. However, the actual effects as well as public-health
      consequences and mechanisms of HIV assessment reactivity have never been systematically
      tested.

      The proposed assessment reactivity study will be conducted in South Africa, a country with
      high levels of HIV prevalence, incidence, and stigma. The Republic of South Africa's HIV/AIDS
      epidemic has emerged recently relative to other sub-Saharan countries, and yet 21.5% of South
      Africans aged 15-49 -- more than 1 in 5 people -- are infected with HIV (UNAIDS, 2004).
      Despite the common presence of HIV in South Africa, it remains largely a hidden disease and
      HIV-related stigma interferes with peoples' ability to protect themselves through open
      discussion or spontaneous reflection on personal risk. Under these conditions, it is
      reasonable to expect a sizable effect from directing people's attention to their HIV relevant
      behaviors, an effect that could be incorrectly ascribed to brief interventions used in
      low-resource settings. The conditions in South Africa, therefore, heighten the clinical and
      public health significance of the assessment reactivity issue in that (a) it is vital to
      understand how reactivity may affect the results of behavioral intervention trials, and (b)
      it may be possible to capitalize on assessment reactivity through brief, assessment-based
      interventions.

      This study will allow us to achieve our primary aim:

      1. To separate the effect of a brief HIV-risk reduction intervention from the potential
      effects of two types of baseline assessment commonly applied in HIV intervention research: a
      detailed, calendar-based assessment and a general frequency assessment. The detailed
      calendar-based assessment will potentially lead participants to observe themselves in
      specific risk-behavior situations, providing them with the opportunity to reassess the risk
      involved in those situations in light of their health goals and thus motivating them for
      behavior change. The general frequency assessment will merely prompt participants to estimate
      the overall frequency with which they engaged in several HIV-related behaviors. The effect of
      these assessments on participants' sexual behavior will be examined alone and in combination
      with the HIV-risk reduction intervention.

      In addition, this project has two important secondary aims:

        1. To generate urgently needed additional efficacy data for a promising HIV risk reduction
           intervention culturally tailored for use and found to be effective in South Africa

        2. To determine potential HIV preventive effects of different types of HIV risk behavior
           assessments on risk behavior reduction in South Africa for future intervention
           development

      To achieve the above aims, the investigators will:

        1. Recruit 1500 patients (50% women), age 18-44, from the Spencer Rd. STD Clinic, Cape
           Town, South Africa.

        2. Randomly assign participants within gender to one of 6 study arms in a modified Solomon
           Four-Group (SFG) design. The 2 (intervention: standard of care vs. an efficacious theory
           based HIV prevention intervention) x 3 (baseline face-to-face interview: none vs. basic
           single-item frequency questions vs. detailed partner-by-partner calendar-based
           interview) factorial design is depicted below:

    <description>Using the analytic strategy for the SFG design, we will use the follow-up data point to test our hypotheses that there will be a significant interaction between assessment conditions x intervention conditions.
Analyses will explore the effects of assessment and intervention on the factors presumed to mediate the effect of assessment reactivity (increases in perceived risk and safer sex intentions). Moderator analyses will observe if type of assessment interacts with the level of reported risk behavior (dichotomized as low and high).</description>
