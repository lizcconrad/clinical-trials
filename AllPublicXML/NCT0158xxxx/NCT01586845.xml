  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of voclosporin
      administered orally twice daily for the prevention of acute allograft rejection in recipients
      of a kidney transplant.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase III, randomized, multicentre, open-label, concentration-controlled study
      in subjects undergoing a first or second renal transplant, with induction immunosuppression
      with an IL-2 receptor antibody (basiliximab), mycophenolate mofetil and steroids.

      The primary endpoint to assess non-inferiority will be efficacy failure at the end of Month
      12 after randomization.

    <description>FDA Efficacy Failure is biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR, Banff Grade ≥ 1A as determined by the central pathologist) where subjects who experience death, graft loss (return to dialysis for &gt;30 days, allograft nephrectomy or re-transplantation), or lost to follow-up are included in the analysis as treatment failures. EMA Efficacy Failure includes any subject experiencing any of the following: biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR, Banff Grade ≥ 1A as determined by the central pathologist), death, graft loss or graft dysfunction (Cockcroft-Gault CrCl &lt; 40 mL/min).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females aged 18-65 years inclusive at the time of screening.

          -  Recipients of a first or second deceased donor or living donor renal transplant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presently receiving immunosuppression for a previously failed transplant.

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the course
             of the study, or 3 months after last dose of study medication.

          -  Sexually-active women of child-bearing potential (including those who are &lt; 1 year
             postmenopausal) and sexually-active men who are not practicing a highly effective
             method of birth control.

          -  Subjects receiving a HLA identical living related transplant.

          -  Subjects wth a positive T-cell lymphocytotoxic cross match, or positive flow T and B
             cell cross match.

          -  Subjects undergoing primary transplant with a current PRA (or CPRA) ≥ 25%.

          -  Subjects who experienced graft loss within 1 year of transplant.

          -  Subjects receiving a kidney from a ABO incompatible donor.

          -  Subjects receiving a kidney from a deceased donor positive for HIV, HBV, HCV or
             tuberculosis.

          -  Subjects receiving a a kidney from a non-heart beating donor.

          -  Subjects receiving paired (en bloc or paired) kidney transplants.

          -  Transplantation of multiple grafts (e.g. kidney and pancreas).

          -  Subjects receiving a kidney with a cold ischemia time &gt; 30 hours.

          -  Subjects receiving any transplanted organ other than a kidney.

          -  Recipients of a bone marrow or stem cell transplant.

          -  Any systemic infections requiring continued therapy at the time of entry into this
             study. (Prophylaxis against CMV and/or PCP infection will be permitted).

          -  Subjects with positive results of the following serological tests: HIV I Ab, hepatitis
             B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and the
             anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab). Negative results for these serological tests
             must be documented within 12 months prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects with active tuberculosis (Tb) requiring treatment within the last 3 years.
             Subjects with a known positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test are not eligible
             unless they have completed treatment for latent Tb and have a negative chest X-ray at
             time of enrollment. PPD testing must have been done within the last 12 months, and a
             positive result is defined as ≥ 10 mm induration, a Heaf score of &gt;1 in non-Bacille
