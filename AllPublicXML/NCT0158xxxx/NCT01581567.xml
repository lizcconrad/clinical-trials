      Background:

      - Information and samples collected from participants in medical research studies can be
      useful even after the original study is complete. Researchers can use the information and
      samples to learn more about multiple sclerosis or other immune system disorders. They can
      also be used for research into other disorders. Researchers would like to get permission to
      use samples collected from older studies to launch new lines of research.

      Objectives:

      - To look at information and samples from earlier National Institutes of Health
      Neuroimmunology Branch studies.

      Eligibility:

      - People who provided samples and medical information for earlier studies.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will contact people who took part in earlier studies. Researchers will ask
           if they can study previously collected data and samples.

        -  Data and samples may include physical exam data and psychological test results. Imaging
           study results are included. Preserved samples of body fluids and tissues may be studied.
           These include blood and urine samples.

        -  No new treatment will be provided as part of this research study.

      Purpose

      The purpose of this protocol is to enable prospective IRB review of research using human
      samples and data collected under other Neuroimmunology Branch (NIB) protocols and to enable
      retrospective review of samples and data from the branch s protocols that have been
      terminated prior to full data analysis and publication.

      Subjects

      Subjects who previously participated in NIH protocols for whom we have samples or data whose
      wishes regarding use of their samples/data for research other than that specified in the
      initial protocol is not known, or where we would like to use their samples or data for
      purposes other than those they have consented for may be enrolled in this protocol if they
      are able to be contacted and consent to additional use of their samples or data.

      Study Methods

      Data and Sample Ascension

      Data and samples may include but are not limited to demographic and personal health
      information, psychological or psychiatric testing, blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or
      other body fluids or tissues, results of medical and/or physiological evaluation, and medical
      imaging.

      Data and samples will enter this protocol from the following terminated IRB-approved
      protocols under which all human subject enrollment and participation is complete including:

        -  01-N-0089 (Rolipram): Safety, tolerability and effects of Rolipram on inflammatory
           activity in the central nervous system in multiple sclerosis. A phase II, open label
           crossover trial using MRI as an outcome measure.

        -  98-N-0069 (APL): Double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, baseline vs. treatment trial

           of low vs. high dose CGP 77116 in patients with MS.

        -  97-N-0148 (IFG): A 48 week phase II Pilot study of tolerability and effect/efficacy of

        -  99-N-0169 (Daclizumab/IFN-beta for MS): Effect of the Humanized Monoclonal Antibody
           Against the Interleukin-2 Receptor Alpha Subunit (IL-2Ra; Zenapax ) on Inflammatory
           Activity in the Central Nervous System (CNS) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in a
           Baseline-to-Treatment, Cross-Over, MRI-Controlled Single-Center Phase I/II Trial.

        -  04-N-0019 (Daclizumab monotherapy for MS): ZAP MS Zenapax[R] (daclizumab) Administered
           to Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: Effect of intravenously administered humanized
           monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-2 receptor alpha subunit (daclizumab) on
           inflammatory activity in the central nervous system in multiple sclerosis patients in a
           baseline-to-treatment, cross-over, MRI-controlled single-centre phase II trial.

        -  05-N-0039 (3T Cortical imaging): An Exploratory Study on Detection of Cortical Damage in
           Patients with Multiple Sclerosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

        -  06-N-0154 (7T): An Exploratory Study on Detection of Cortical and White Matter Damage in
           Patients with Multiple Sclerosis Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 7 Tesla.

        -  07-N-0014 (Cognitive MRI): The use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging to investigate cortical
