  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma is a fatal malignant neoplasm originating from biliary tracts and
      constitutes about 5-10% of primary liver cancers, characterized by a poor prognosis. High
      prevalence in southeast and eastern Asia has been observed. At present, the cellular and
      molecular mechanisms leading to oncogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma remain unclear.

      The RAS gene product has a key role in controlling cell growth and differentiation through
      its intrinsic GTPase activity. Point mutations that activate the RAS protein and its
      downstream cascade have been observed in human tumors. Both KRAS and BRAF are members of the
      RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway which mediates cellular response to growth signals.
      Somatic KRAS mutations are found at high rates in leukemia, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer
      and lung cancer. Studies from European and Japanese groups have recently described that
      activating KRAS/ BRAF mutations may play a role in the carcinogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma
      of the biliary tracts, but our preliminary data demonstrated low frequency of KRAS and BRAF
      mutation in the same tumor as well as the results from Thailand. In this study, the
      investigators hypothesize copy number changes rather than genetic mutation of either KRAS or
      BRAF genes may be the key findings of Taiwanese cases of the adenocarcinoma from the biliary
      tracts.
