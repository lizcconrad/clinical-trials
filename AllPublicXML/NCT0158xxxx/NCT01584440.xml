  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AVP-923
      compared to placebo, for the treatment of symptoms of agitation in patients with Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients for this study must have a diagnosis of probable AD and must have
      clinically meaningful agitation secondary to AD.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-dummy, double-blind, placebo-controlled study,
      consisting of 10 weeks of treatment.

      Up to 200 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30-40 centers in the US.

      Study medication will be administered orally twice-daily from Day 1 through Day 70. Screening
      must occur within within approximately 4 weeks prior to randomization. Following screening
      procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible patients will be
      randomized into the study.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

        Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD).

        The patient has clinically significant symptoms of agitation secondary to AD, that
        interfere with daily routine and for which a prescription medication is deemed indicated,
        in the opinion of the investigator.

        Either out-patients or residents of an assisted-living facility or a skilled nursing home.

        CGI-S score is â‰¥ 4 (moderately ill) at screening and baseline.

        Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at screening between 8 and 28 (inclusive).

        Caregiver who is able and willing to comply with all required study procedures, ensuring
        that the patient attends all study visits and takes the study medication as instructed. In
        order to qualify as a caregiver for this study, the individual should spend time with the
        patient for a minimum of 4 hours on 4 separate days per week.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient has other type of dementia (e.g., vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia,
        Parkinson's disease, substance-induced dementia).

        Patients with co-existent clinically significant or unstable systemic diseases that could
        confound the interpretation of the safety results of the study (e.g. malignancy, poorly
        controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, unstable pulmonary, renal or hepatic
        disease, unstable ischemic cardiac disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, certain cardiac
        conduction abnormalities including QTc prolongation, or unstable valvular heart disease).

        Patients with myasthenia gravis.
