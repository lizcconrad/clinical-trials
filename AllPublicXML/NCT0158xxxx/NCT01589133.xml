      The purpose of this study is to assess the consistency of the results of irregular antibody
      screening with Surgiscreen （investigational reagent) and Serascan Diana 3 (control reagent),
      and the consistency of the results of irregular antibody screening with investigational
      reagent on serum and plasma from same patients.
