      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and find biomarkers related to
      cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies genes in samples from younger patients with
      rhabdomyosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To obtain a larger cohort of rhabdomyosarcoma samples (alveolar and embryonal) to
           establish a more accurate estimate of the frequency of particular genetic lesions.

        -  To provide the statistical power to establish an unambiguous connection between focal
           genetic lesions, histological subtype, and outcome for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: DNA samples are analyzed in solid and liquid phase for exons of all genes mutated
      from previous discovery. DNA is then eluted and sequenced by illumina platform.
