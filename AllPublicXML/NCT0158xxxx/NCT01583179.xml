  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients included will be those who have already agreed to have a brachial plexus nerve
      block for surgery. A flip of the coin will decide who gets and additive called buprenorphine
      in their block or not. They will both contain the same amount and type of numbing medicine.
      The goal will be to see if the additive extends the life of the pain control portion of the
      ultrasound guided supraclavicular nerve block.
