    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the feasibility of using treadmill desks (Workstations)
      within a Louisiana office workplace and to determine the effects of walking while working in
      overweight or obese, sedentary individuals.

    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be randomized by chance to the WorkStation Intervention Group or
      to a Usual Working Condition Group.

      The WorkStation Intervention Group will be asked to walk for up to 1.5 hours per day during
      the work week of Monday through Friday on the treadmill. Participants will complete two
      sessions per day for up to 45 minutes per session, tracking time and speed.

      Usual Working Condition Group will be asked to continue working in usual environment and
      accustomed manner.

      Regardless of which group the participants are assigned to, the participants will be asked to
      complete baseline and follow up assessment visits. Months 3 and 6 for approximately 1 hour
      for Body measurements (height, weight and waist circumference), body fat percent, gait speed,
      questionnaires, and accelerometry.

    <description>Participants will be asked to walk for up to 1.5 hours per day on the treadmill. This will be split into two 45 minute sessions per day. Behavioral support will focus on adherence to frequency (attending scheduled sessions). Participants self-select speed of walking and time (they have up to 45 minutes allotted, but may choose less as they like).</description>
