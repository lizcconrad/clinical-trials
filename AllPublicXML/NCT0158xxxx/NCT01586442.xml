  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal,the investigators will examine whether the selectivity of eplerenone for the
      MR will translate into a better glucose and metabolic profile compare to spironolactone in
      patients with HF with glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes. In addition, the investigators
      will also compare the impact of these two agents on changes of concentrations of established
      prognostic biomarkers of neurohormonal activation and extracellular matrix turnover.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female at least 18 years old.

          2. Symptomatic HF corresponding to NYHA class II-IV symptoms for at least 4 weeks prior
             randomization.

          3. A diagnosis of 1) impaired glucose tolerance described as overnight fasting between
             blood glucose 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L on two occasions; or 2) type 2 diabetes defined as
             overnight fasting between blood glucose of 7.0 mmol/L or more on two occasions; a
             HbA1c equal to or higher than 6.5% or more on two occasions; or as a history of type
             II diabetes treated with hypoglycemic agents.

          4. LVEF equal to or lower than 40% documented by, contrast ventriculography, magnetic
             resonance imaging, radionuclide ventriculography or quantitative echocardiography
             within the previous 12 months if no cardiac event occurred since the measurement of
             the LVEF. The most recent measurements should be used.

          5. Treatment with an optimal and stable dose of ACE inhibitor (or ARB) for at least 4
             weeks prior to enrolment in the study. In addition, patients should be treated with a
             stable dose of beta-blockers for at least 4 weeks prior enrolment in the study.
             Patients incapable to tolerate bisoprolol, carvedilol or metoprolol will be allowed
             within the trial.

          6. Informed consent must be obtained before any study specific procedures are performed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current treatment with a combination of an ARB, an ACE or a renin inhibitor.

             with spironolactone.

          4. Estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as calculated using the MDRD equation (Appendix 1).

          5. Current serum potassium higher than 5.0 mmol/L (higher than 5.0 mEq/L).

          8. HF secondary to any of the following conditions: hemodynamically significant primary
             stenotic valvular cardiomyopathy, isolated right sided CHF, non cardiac disease (e.g.
             uncorrected thyroid disease), pericardial disease, complex congenital heart disease,
             myocarditis.

          9. Decompensated heart failure described as hospitalization or I.V. administration of
             medication in emergency room or heart failure clinic within 4 weeks (ex.: diuretics,
             inotropes, vasodilatators)

         10. Current treatment with insulin

         11. Stroke, acute coronary syndrome, PCI within the last 4 weeks before randomization.

         14. Planned cardiac surgery expected to be performed within the next 6 months.

         15. Previous heart transplant or heart transplant expected to be performed within the next
             6 months.

         16. Presence of any non-cardiac diseases likely to significantly shorten life expectancy
             to &lt; 1 year.

         17. Pregnant or lactating women or women of childbearing potential who are not protected
             from pregnancy by an accepted method of contraception, such as the oral contraceptive
             pill, an intrauterine device or surgical sterilization (all women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test before randomization).

         18. Any condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the evaluation
             on efficacy or safety or be associated with poor adherence to the protocol.

         19. Treatment with any investigational agent or device within 4 weeks of randomization.
