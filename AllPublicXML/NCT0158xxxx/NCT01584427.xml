    <textblock>
      Background Life style related disease is an increasing problem all over the world. The
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a condition characterized by abdominal obesity, high blood
      lipids, high blood pressure and slightly elevated blood sugar. Subjects with MetS have high
      risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

      Dietary fibers have been shown to have positive effects on the components of MetS. The
      investigators have special interest in the combination of two types of fiber (Resistant (RS)
      starch and Arabinoxylans (AX)) .

      Hypotheses Increase of RS and AX in the dietary composition has a positive effects on
      components of MetS i.e. decreases blood lipids, improves blood sugar, blood pressure and
      markers of inflammation.

      The subjects undergo two dietary interventions of 4 weeks duration each: A &quot;Healthy
      Carbohydrate Diet&quot; with a high content of RS and AX is compared to a &quot;Western Style Diet&quot;
      with a low content of RS and AX.

      Background Life style related disease is an increasing problem all over the world. The
      Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a condition characterized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia,
      hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. Subjects with MetS have high risk of developing
      Type 2 Diabetes and CVD.

      Resistant Starch (RS) and Arabinoxylans (AX) are dietary fibers that have been shown to have
      positive effects on the components of MetS. The combination of RS and AX has not been tested
      before .

      Hypotheses Increase of RS and AX in the dietary composition has a positive effects on
      components of MetS i.e. decreases postprandial lipaemia, improves glucose tolerance, insulin
      resistance, blood pressure and markers of inflammation.

      Design:

      A nonblinded randomized cross over study Two dietary interventions of 4 weeks duration each.
      A healthy carbohydrate Diet with a high content of RS and AX is compared to a Western Style
      diet with a low content of RS and AX. Between the two interventions, there is a wash out
      period of 4 weeks.

      The primary outcome is postprandial lipaemia estimated by a high fat meal test of 6 hours
      duration. The test is performed before and after each intervention.

      Secondary outcomes are:

        -  Glucose tolerance and insulin resistance estimated by OGTT

        -  24 hours blood pressure

        -  MRI estimation of liver fat content

        -  Postprandial changes in genes of adipose tissue
