      The purpose of this study is to compare a rapid noncontrast MRI protocol not requiring
      sedation to ultrasound in the assessment of hydronephrosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound is the most commonly performed imaging modality used to assess hydronephrosis. The
      average renal ultrasound exam takes about 15-25 minutes to complete, however, it does have
      several disadvantages, including substantial operator dependence, having to rely on an
      adequate &quot;sonographic window&quot; to see the structures of interest and difficulty in
      visualization of portions of the kidney and urinary tracts.

      Recent MRI advances have made rapid imaging possible. Such imaging has minimized motion
      related artifacts and need for sedation.

      This study is to compare traditional ultrasound imaging to a raid noncontrast protocol MRI
      examination of the kidneys and urinary tract that would require no sedation and less than 15
      minutes to perform.
