      Microalbuminuria and homocysteine levels are shown to be markers for endothelial dysfunction
      and subclinical organ damage and predictors of cardiovascular risk in several epidemiologic
      and randomized clinical trials. Carotis intima-media thickness is also found to be elevated
      in early stages of atherosclerosis. Recent studies have shown correlations between
      homocysteine, microalbumin levels and carotis intima-media thickness in type 2 diabetics but
      no data exists for obese or overweight patients who also have metabolic syndrome, in terms of
      markers of subclinical organ damage. Since obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease and since it is known that patients with metabolic syndrome are at higher risk of
      cardiovascular events, the investigators wanted to examine whether there is an association
      between homocysteine, microalbumin levels and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with
      or without metabolic syndrome, who are either overweight or obese.

      Blood will be drawn from patients for routine biochemical analyses for glucose, urea,
      creatinine, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, electrolytes and homocysteine and
      also glucose tolerance test. Spot urine samples will be drawn for assessment of
      microalbuminuria.
