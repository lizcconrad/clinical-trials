  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, single-blind trial is to evaluate the effectiveness and
      tolerability of high frequency or low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) in patients with resistant bipolar depression. Patients will be assigned to receive
      either high or low frequency rTMS for 20 consecutive workdays (4 weeks). 10 Hz (high)
      frequency rTMS and 1 Hz (low) frequency rTMS will be given over the left or right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), respectively. Patients will be assessed with several
      psychometric instruments at baseline, and at weeks 5 and 9.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women aged 18 to 70 years

          -  Current major depressive episode (MDE) in the context of a bipolar disorder type I or
             II (according to the DSM-IV-TR) that has not improved after more than 2 adequate
             pharmacological trial(s) in the current episode (failure is defined as a lack of
             significant clinical improvement after the use of standard mood stabilizers, atypical
             antipsychotics and/or antidepressants given at their minimum effective dosage or
             higher for at least 4 weeks of duration)

          -  Baseline score ≥ 13 on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology -
             Clinician-Administered (QIDS-C), i.e., a MDE of at least moderate intensity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychotic features in the current episode

          -  Lifetime history of a non-mood-related psychotic disorder

          -  Substance or alcohol abuse/dependence in the past 6 months

          -  Unstable medical disease (e.g., cardiovascular, renal)

          -  Presence of mood cycles of &lt; 30 days duration

          -  Pregnancy and/or lactation

          -  Presence of a specific contraindication for rTMS (e.g., personal history of epilepsy
             or convulsion, metallic head implant)

          -  Hearing loss
