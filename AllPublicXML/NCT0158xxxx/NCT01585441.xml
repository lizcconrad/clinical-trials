    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a disease that causes fluid to collect under
           the retina. It affects the macula, which is in the center of the retina and is needed
           for sharp, clear vision. In many cases, CSC resolves on its own and does not need
           treatment. However, in some cases it does not go away or comes back after treatment.
           This is known as chronic CSC.

        -  Chronic CSC may be caused by hormones called androgens. Finasteride is a drug that can
           alter the effects certain of androgens. Researchers want to compare finasteride with a
           placebo to see if it is a safe and effective treatment for chronic CSC.

      Objectives:

      - To see if finasteride is a safe and effective treatment for chronic CSC.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic CSC in one or both eyes.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full eye exam
           will be performed. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.

        -  Some participants may have photodynamic therapy (PDT), the standard treatment for CSC.
           PDT helps to reduce the amount of fluid in the eye. Participants will need to wait for 3
           months after PDT before starting the finasteride study.

        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will take finasteride 5 mg
           (formulated into capsules); the other group will take a placebo capsule. All
           participants will take the capsules for 3 months.

        -  After 3 months on the assigned capsule (finasteride or placebo), all participants will
           have the opportunity to take finasteride for at least another 4 years and 9 months. This
           phase of the study is optional.

        -  Participants will have regular study visits. At each visit, they will have physical
           exams and eye exams. They will also provide blood and urine samples.

        -  During the first 3 months, participants will have 2 study visits. After 3 months, if the
           participant continues in the optional (or as needed) phase of the protocol, visits will
           occur at Month 6, Month 12 and every 12 months thereafter. However, additional visits
           may be needed.

      Objective:

      Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a chorioretinal disorder characterized by an
      accumulation of serous fluid under the retina. Although acute CSC tends to resolve
      spontaneously on its own with minimal sequelae, chronic CSC tends to persist and lead to
      irreversible visual loss. The pathogenesis of CSC is complex. However, systemic androgens
      have been implicated. Finasteride is an anti-androgen medication that is widely used in the
      treatment of various conditions. A previous study performed at the NEI demonstrated a
      reduction in the amount of subretinal fluid among participants treated with 5 mg of
      finasteride. The objective of this study is to further investigate the efficacy of oral
      finasteride as a treatment for chronic CSC.

      Study Population:

      Thirty-eight participants with chronic CSC are eligible. Up to an additional four
      participants may be enrolled to account for participants who withdraw from the study prior to
      Month 3.

      Design:

      In this Phase II, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-masked, randomized trial,
      investigational product will be administered to two different groups. Half of the
      participants will be randomized to 5 mg oral finasteride for the initial three months. The
      other half of the participants will be randomized to placebo for the first three months. At
      the end of three months of treatment, all participants may be followed for at least four
      years and nine months. During this follow-up period, all participants will be able to receive
      finasteride therapy pro re nata (PRN) if subretinal fluid re-emerges. The PRN phase will last
      until the last participant completes the five years of follow-up. Other standard care
      treatments, such as photodynamic therapy, will also be permitted after the primary outcome at
      three months.

      Outcome Measures:

      The primary outcome for regulatory filing is the proportion of participants with an
      improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 15 letters at three months compared to
      baseline in the study eye. The primary outcome for publication of the study results is the
      proportion of participants with a subretinal fluid volume decrease ≥ 50% at three months
      compared to baseline in the study eye. Secondary efficacy outcomes include changes in BCVA,
      changes in the maximum retinal volume as measured on optical coherence tomography (OCT),
      changes in central retinal thickness on OCT, changes in leakage as seen on fluorescein
      angiography (FA), changes in size of existing plaque(s) on indocyanine green (ICG)
      angiography, changes in autofluorescence patterns seen on fundus autofluorescence (FAF)
      imaging, changes in mean macular sensitivity as assessed by microperimetry, changes in serum
      levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), as well as changes in urine levels of
      cortisol during the study period. Safety outcomes include the number and severity of adverse
      reactions from the investigational product and the number of withdrawals.

    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>This is the regulatory filing primary outcome measure. Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Participants With a Reduction in Subretinal Fluid Volume ≥ 50% at 3 Months Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>This is the primary outcome measure for publication of study results. Subretinal fluid volume will be determined by manually moving the segmentation lines of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) image using the &quot;Edit Segmentation&quot; function of the Cirrus™ HD-OCT software. The segmentation lines will be edited to outline the inner and outer borders of the subretinal fluid pocket. This will be done manually for all the individual B-scans of each OCT image, after which the software algorithm automatically calculates the subretinal fluid volume.</description>

        <description>This is the primary outcome measure for publication of study results. Subretinal fluid volume will be determined by manually moving the segmentation lines of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) image using the “Edit Segmentation” function of the Cirrus™ HD-OCT software. The segmentation lines will be edited to outline the inner and outer borders of the subretinal fluid pocket. This will be done manually for all the individual B-scans of each OCT image, after which the software algorithm automatically calculates the subretinal fluid volume.</description>

Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements.

          <title>Changes in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye at Month 3 Compared to Baseline</title>
          <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
A positive change value indicates improvement of the outcome. A negative change value indicates worsening of the outcome.</description>

        <description>Subretinal fluid volume will be determined by manually moving the segmentation lines of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) image using the “Edit Segmentation” function of the Cirrus™ HD-OCT software. The segmentation lines will be edited to outline the inner and outer borders of the subretinal fluid pocket. This will be done manually for all the individual B-scans of each OCT image, after which the software algorithm automatically calculates the subretinal fluid volume.</description>
