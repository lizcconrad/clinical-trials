    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the treatment with midodrine, octreotide and albumin
      during 12 weeks in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Fifteen patients will be enrolled and
      followed during 16 weeks. The effects on renal function will be evaluated 12 and 16 weeks
      after the beginning of the treatment by isotopic evidence and biochemist determinations. Also
      it will be evaluated arterial pressure and determination of vasoactive hormones (plasma
      renin, aldosterone and norepinephrine).
