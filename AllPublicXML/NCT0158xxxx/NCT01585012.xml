  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a human factors usability study designed to validated usability by obtaining feedback
      in a home use environment regarding ease of use of the Focus Touch™ Conception System
      Conceptacle (when used to collect semen) and the instructions for use. The investigators will
      collect data to demonstrate that the usability requirements of the conception system as
      collection device, as determined by Usability Specification: Focus Touch Conception System,
      ER-000001 have been met. The ability of the device to be used during sexual intercourse
      without discomfort or injury to the female participant's vaginal/cervical tissues shall also
      be taken into account. Participating couples will be asked to use the Focus Touch™ Conception
      System Conceptacle (in condom form), using the Instructions For Use, to collect semen during
      sexual intercourse in a home use environment. This study will involve sexual intercourse
      between monogamous, heterosexual couples who are trying to conceive or are on a non-vaginal
      birth control with which they do not normally use condoms. Participants will be asked to
      complete the study and the questionnaire within 3 days of receiving the study packet. Contact
      information shall be collected, but participants will only be contacted if they fail to
      return the questionnaire within the requested timeframe.
