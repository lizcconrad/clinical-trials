      Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is treated with various
      combinations of radiation and chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the rate of complete
      responses with induction therapy (primary endpoint) and progression-free survival, overall
      survival and objective response rates of docetaxel, cisplatin, cetuximab, and bevacizumab
      (TPE-A) followed by radiation therapy, cisplatin, cetuximab, and bevacizumab (XPE-A). Also,
      the investigators plan to investigate a panel of EGFR and angiogenesis biomarkers in pre-and
      post- treatment tumor biopsies. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the associated
      treatment toxicities and the quality of life.

      Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is treated with various
      combinations of radiation and chemotherapy. Docetaxel and cisplatin have been combined in
      Phase II trials in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with very encouraging
      results. Induction therapy with docetaxel/cisplatin followed by chemoradiotherapy was
      investigated in a randomized Phase II study in nasopharyngeal cancer and showed superior PFS
      and OS in comparison with chemoradiation alone. Cetuximab is a chimerized EGFR monoclonal
      antibody that has produced positive results in Phase III trials in combination with either
      radiation for locally advanced disease or chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Upregulation
      of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been associated with cetuximab resistance.
      Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody is currently being investigated in SCCHN with promising
      results. The investigators have previously shown that cisplatin, docetaxel and cetuximab
      (TPE) followed by radiotherapy, cisplatin and cetuximab (XPE) is feasible and highly
      efficacious in locally advanced SCCHN (Argiris, A. et al.JCO 2011). In this Phase II study
      the investigators evaluate the addition of bevacizumab to induction therapy with TPE (TPE-A)
      and to subsequent XPE (XPE-A).

      Specific aims:

      To evaluate the rate of complete responses with induction therapy (primary endpoint) and
      progression-free survival, overall survival and objective response rates. Also, the
      investigators plan to investigate a panel of EGFR and angiogenesis biomarkers in pre- and
      post- treatment tumor biopsies. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the associated
      treatment toxicities and the quality of life.

      Subject population:

      The investigators will enroll patients with previously untreated locally advanced SCCHN (see
      detailed eligibility criteria).

      Treatment plan:

      Induction therapy consists of 3 cycles of bevacizumab 15mg/kg on day 1, docetaxel 75mg/m2 on
      day 1, loading dose of cetuximab 400mg/m2 on cycle 1, day 1, then 250 mg/m2 on all subsequent
      administrations (Day 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and days 1,8,15 of cycles 2 and 3), cisplatin
      75mg/m2 on day 1, docetaxel 75mg/m2 on day 1, repeated every 21 days. After 3 cycles of
      induction therapy, patients will receive standard radiation 70-74 Gy/ 200 cGy/ daily, 5 days/
      week with concurrent weekly cisplatin 30mg/m2, cetuximab 250mg/m2 and bevacizumab 15mg/kg
      every 3 weeks x 3. There is optional surgery for non-responders in the primary (stable
      disease) after TPE-A.

      Statistical design and sample size:

      Phase II, two-stage study with complete response rate after induction therapy as the primary
      endpoint. The sample size is 33 patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with AJCC 7th edition stage III-IVB head and neck cancer, all sites,
             including unknown primary tumors.

          -  Prior to entry in the study the resectability and alternative treatment options for
             each patient will be determined by a team composed of an Ear, Nose, and Throat
             Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist and a Medical Oncologist. Stage determination, optimal
             local treatment, and its timing according to this protocol will be determined at this
             evaluation. The unequivocal demonstration of distant metastasis (M1) confers
             ineligibility.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly
             differentiated carcinomas, or WHO types I-III of the nasopharynx.

          -  Unidimensionally measurable disease is required (RECIST 1.1).

          -  No prior chemotherapy, biologic/molecular targeted therapy (including any prior
             therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway), or radiotherapy for
             head and neck cancer.

          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, and organ
             sparing procedures such as debulking of airway compromising tumors or neck dissection
             in a patient with an existing primary tumor. Any non-biopsy procedure must have taken
             place &gt; 4 weeks but &lt; 3 months of initiating protocol treatment.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1.

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Informed consent must be obtained from all patients prior to beginning therapy.
             Patients should have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

          -  All patients should have their tumor tissue tested for HPV (in situ hybridization
             and/or p16 staining by immunohistochemistry), and results must be known prior to study
             entry, and will consent to have available archival tumor samples, unstained slides or
             blocks from previous diagnostic or therapeutic procedures submitted for correlative
             studies, including assessment of target molecules EGFR, VEGF and related biomarkers.
             Also, patients must agree to submit blood samples for correlative studies at least at
             baseline.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count at or above 1500/µl, Platelet count at or above 100,000/µl

          -  Creatinine clearance 60 ml/min or higher calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:

        Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140-age) X actual body wt (kg)/ 72 X serum creatinine
        Multiply this number by 0.85 if the patient is female

          -  Total bilirubin within normal limits and AST/ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Urine dipstick must be &lt; 0-1+ within 2 weeks (14 days) of randomization. If urine
             dipstick result is &gt; 1+, a calculation of Urine Protein Creatinine (UPC) ratio is
             required. Patients must have a UPC ratio &lt; 1.0 to participate in the study.

        NOTE: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24-urine protein excretion - a UPC
        ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1gm. UPC ratio is calculated
        using one of the following formula:

          -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in
             mg/DI

          -  [(urine protein) × 0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in
             mmol/L

               -  Patients with a prior history of squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or
                  in situ cervical cancer must have been curatively treated. Patients with a
                  history of other prior malignancy must have been treated with curative intent and
                  must have remained disease-free for 3 years post diagnosis.

             polysorbate 80.

          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody or known hypersensitivity to
             any component of bevacizumab

             study requirements.

          -  All patients will have a baseline EKG. If abnormalities consistent with active
             coronary artery disease are detected, the patient will be referred to a cardiologist

          -  No patients with significant baseline sensory or motor neurologic deficits (&gt; grade I
             neuropathy) will be treated on this study.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal Infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded from
             the study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients with HIV and those
             receiving combination anti- retroviral therapies when indicated.
