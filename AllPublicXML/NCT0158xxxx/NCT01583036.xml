    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-centre study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single-dose
      digoxin alone and when administered at various up titration doses of ezogabine/retigabine in
      healthy adult subjects. The pharmacokinetics of ezogabine/retigabine and the n-acetyl
      metabolite of ezogabine/retigabine (NAMR) will also be assessed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40
             MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 147 pmol/L) is confirmatory].
             Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods in the protocol if they wish
             to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood
             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of
             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
             of a contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the
             contraception methods listed in the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as
             determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to
             sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree
             to use contraception until 1 week post-last dose of ezogabine/retigabine.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from
             the time of the first dose of study medication until at least 1 week post-last dose.

          -  BMI of 18 to 30 kg/m2 and total body weight greater than 50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  Normal creatinine clearance assessed by the Cockcroft-Gault Method.

          -  Subject's aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin are
             greater than and equal to 1.5 × ULN (isolated bilirubin greater than 1.5 × ULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin less than 35%).

          -  Subject is a nonsmoker (defined as a nonsmoker during the last 3 months prior to
             Screening and have a negative cotinine test at screening).

          -  Subject has a negative drug screen (amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine metabolites,
             opiates, benzodiazepines, and cannabinoids) at Screening and at check-in at Day -1.

          -  Subject is capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with
             the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen, positive hepatitis
             C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or -2 at Screening

             findings in urinalysis at screening.

          -  Has a history of urinary retention or risk factors for urinary retention that in the
             Investigator's judgment could potentially affect subject safety.

          -  Subject has a history of syncope, clinically significant palpitations, bradyarrhythmia
             or tachyarrhythmia conduction abnormality (e.g., atrioventricular block of any degree,

             syndrome, or any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening medical
             assessment, laboratory examination, ECG, or immunogenicity test

             are consistently greater than and equal to 140/90 mm Hg, then the subject should be
             excluded and advised to consult a physician.
