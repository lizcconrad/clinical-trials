    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the amount of GLPG0187 present in the blood
      (pharmacokinetics) after a single oral dose of the prodrug of GLPG0187 given to healthy
      subjects.

      Two formulations of the GLPG0187 prodrug will be compared, as well as the effect of food and
      dose proportionality of the best formulation.

      Furthermore, during the course of the study, safety and tolerability will be characterized.
