  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies are proposed to analyze the interactions between nicotine, alterations in
      endocrine hormones, mood and cardiovascular measures. The studies are designed to examine the
      contribution of gender and menstrual cycle phase. It is hypothesized that analysis of
      nicotine's rapid hormonal, cardiovascular and subjective effects will be important for
      developing novel biologic approaches to treatment for nicotine abuse and dependence as well
      as advancing understanding of the neurobiology of nicotine reinforcement.

      These clinical studies are designed to examine the acute effects of intravenous nicotine on
      anterior pituitary (ACTH, LH) and adrenal hormones (DHEA and cortisol). We also plan to study
      norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), because nicotine stimulates rapid release of NE and
      E in preclinical and clinical studies. The studies will examine the acute effects of
      intravenous nicotine on the gonadal steroid hormones and the reciprocal feedback regulation
      by LH. The temporal covariance of hormonal changes with serum nicotine levels and
      nicotine-induced changes in subjective states and cardiovascular measures will be measured.
      The covariance between nicotine-induced changes in endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular
      effects and the temporal concordance with increases in serum nicotine and cotinine levels
      will be determined. Gender and menstrual cycle phase influences on the effects of nicotine on
      HPA and HPG hormones and subjective effects will be assessed.

    <description>Subjects will be given an intravenous challenge dose of nicotine or placebo in a constant volume of 1 ml on any study day. The nicotine solution (1.0 mg/70kg or 1.5 mg/70kg or 2.0 mg/70kg) will be administered over 1 min. This rate of drug delivery (1 ml over 1 min) has been safe in our IRB approved studies of nicotine. Most investigators have administered nicotine over 10 sec without any adverse reactions. We concur with the IRB recommendation that the lower doses (1.0 mg/70kg and 1.5 mg/70kg;) should be administered first and the higher dose (2.0 mg/70kg) will be administered last.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between the ages of 18 and 40 who currently smoke at least 15 cigarettes
             every day, and who fulfill DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for nicotine dependence (305.10)
             will be eligible for participation.

          -  No evidence of clinically significant disease based upon complete medical history and
             physical examination by Dr. Arthur Siegel (Chief of Internal Medicine, McLean
             Hospital).

          -  Absence of DSM-IV Axis I Disorders other than nicotine dependence (305.10) as measured
             by the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID).

          -  Routine laboratory blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN and
             creatinine, liver function test, hepatitis panel and urinalysis will be performed.
             Laboratory parameters must be within the normal range. HBsAg must be negative but
             subjects who have hepatitis serology consistent with previous exposure to Hepatitis A,
             Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C, but who do not have clinical and biochemical evidence of
             acute infection, will be acceptable.

          -  Hematocrit levels ≥ 39% for males and ≥ 35% for females.

          -  Serum pregnancy test (hCG beta subunit) results must be negative within 24 hrs of the
             study day.

          -  Normal ECG.

          -  Subjects must be able to read and understand instructions, as well as provide a valid
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women and men with any lifetime DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than nicotine abuse or
             dependence will be excluded.

          -  Women who are pregnant will be excluded.

          -  Women who use hormonal contraceptive medications will not be accepted for
             participation because this would confound the hormonal measures.

          -  Men and women with clinically significant medical disorders will be excluded.

          -  Obese and underweight subjects will be excluded. A mean Body Mass Index (ratio of
             weight (W) to height (H) squared; W/H2=kg/m2) will be calculated. Women with a mean
             Body Mass Index (BMI) of between 18.0-27.0 and men with a BMI between 21.4-29.0 will
             be accepted.

          -  Treatment seeking subjects will not be selected but will be referred to local smoking
             cessation programs.
