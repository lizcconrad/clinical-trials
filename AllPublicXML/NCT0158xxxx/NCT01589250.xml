  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of risk scoring systems in the assessment of patients presenting with upper
      gastrointestinal haemorrhage is increasing. Comparative studies have intended to identify the
      system of choice, but the majority of these are characterized by retrospective designs, small
      sample sizes, low rate of severe bleeding, or low mortality. The main aim of this study was
      to identify the optimal scoring system.

    <measure>Identification of low-risk patients</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Low-risk patients were defined as patients who did not need hospital-based intervention, and survived more than 30 days from day of admission. Low-risk patients were considered as suitable for early discharge and potential outpatient management.</description>

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Rebleeding was defined as presence of hematemesis, blood per nasogastric tube, or melaena associated with a decline in B-hemoglobin of at least 1mmol/l (not explained by hemodilution) or decline in systolic arterial pressure of at least 20mmHg after the initial bleeding had stopped.</description>

        Data were collected from consecutive patients admitted with UGIH at Odense University
        Hospital between August 2009 and August 2011. UGIH was defined as history of haematemesis,
        coffee-ground vomit, or melaena.
