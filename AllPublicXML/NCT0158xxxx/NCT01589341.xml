    <textblock>
      This research studies chromosomes in samples from younger patients with neuroblastoma.
      Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors
      learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the impact on overall survival of patients with non-MYCN neuroblastoma below 18
      months of age as compared to neuroblastoma patients above 18 months of age.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived DNA samples are analyzed for segmental chromosome aberrations by multiplex
      ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
      technique. The following genomic regions are being studied: 1p, 1q, 3p, 4p, 7q, 9p, 11q, and
      17q, as are the copy numbers of MYCN, NAG, DDX1, and ALK genes.
