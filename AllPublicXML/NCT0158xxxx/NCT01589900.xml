  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sox2 has been studied in several types of human solid tumors. The investigators found that
      Sox2 had higher expression level in colorectal cancer and metastatic tissues than normal
      tissues. So the investigators assumed that whether Sox2 plays an important role in the
      progression and migration of colon cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our study, we examined Sox2 expression in archived human colon cancer tissues and found
      that its Sox2 expression correlates with reduced patient survival, increased tumor grade and
      metastasis probability.

        All rchived 136 tissues were obtained and pathologically confirmed from patients who
        underwent surgical resections between 2005 and 2006 at the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-sen
        University (Guangzhou, Guangdong, P. R. China)). The patients from whom the samples were
        derived underwent curative resection between 2005 and 2006. Tumor differentiation was
        characterized according to WHO classification, while the surgical pathologic stage was
        analyzed according to the TNM classification system of the International Union against
        Cancer. All samples were anonymously coded in accordance with local ethical guidelines.
