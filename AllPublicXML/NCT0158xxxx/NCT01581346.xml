  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the course of their disease patients with Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often
      experience impaired psychological and physical functioning resulting in a reduced quality of
      life (QoL). The aim of the study is to explore the feasibility and the effects of an eight
      weeks combined muscle strength and endurance training on physical capacity and QoL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this open, prospective, single center study 40 patients (pts) with NSCLC undergoing
      adjuvant or palliative chemo-/ or radiotherapy are enrolled. Physical status is assessed by
      using the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) for endurance and by using the Handheld Dynamometer
      (HHDM) for strength (flexion and extension of elbow, hip and knee). Psychological performance
      is measured by standardized questionnaires (MFI, FACT-L, PHQ - 9). Data are collected at
      baseline (T0) and after the 8 weeks sports intervention (T1). Pts are instructed to train at
      least 5 times/ week in the inpatient setting. After discharge pts are instructed to train in
      a home-based setting at least 3 times/week for a period of 8 weeks. Feasibility is defined as
      an adherence of two trainings per week during at least 6 weeks (out of 8 weeks of the
      intervention).
