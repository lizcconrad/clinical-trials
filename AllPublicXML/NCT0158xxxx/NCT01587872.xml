  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of colonoscopy is to visualize the inside of the entire large bowel. Several factors
      can make the procedure difficult, and sometimes a complete examination is not possible.
      Complicating factors include poor bowel preparation and technical challenges such as
      differences in anatomy (long, redundant colonic segments), post-surgical adhesions,
      strictures and diverticulosis. A special endoscope with two inflatable balloons, originally
      designed to examine the small bowel, has been used for several years with success in such
      technically difficult colonoscopies. More recently a modified double-balloon instrument was
      designed specifically for colonoscopy, but the documentation of the performance of this
      instrument is limited. The aim of the present study is to investigate the performance of the
      double-balloon colonoscope in cases where conventional colonoscopy have failed due to
      technical difficulties.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study to investigate the performance of the test instrument. The
      test instrument consists of a slim, flexible colonoscope with an overtube and an inflatable
      balloon on the tip of the colonoscope and the tip of the overtube. Patients are eligible for
      inclusion if conventional colonoscopy fails due to technical difficulties such as loop
      formation, long colonic segments or suspected adhesions. Written informed consent is
      required. The study procedures will be performed immediately after the failed conventional
      colonoscopy, or on a rescheduled appointment within four weeks.
