  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a common form of heart rhythm disturbance that for some patients is
      treated by catheter ablation (making an ablation lesion or burn inside the heart using a fine
      wire (catheter)). A new system for manipulating the catheters has recently been introduced
      into clinical practice (the Amigo Remote Catheter System (RCS)). This trial is designed to
      answer two primary questions: a) is the contact force (the force with which the catheter
      comes into contact with the heart) any different using the RCS to manual techniques,and b)are
      the resulting ablation lesions within the heart any different in terms of the volume and
      contiguity of the lesions produced. Additionally the investigators aim to determine how the
      two techniques compare in success (the proportion of patients whose heart rhythm disturbance
      is corrected by the procedure).

      The trial aims to recruit 50 patients, randomised into two groups, to have ablation for
      atrial fibrillation performed either using the RCS, or manually. Contact force information
      will be collected during the procedure, but the operators will be blinded to this
      information. Patients will have follow-up to include post-procedural cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging and ambulatory electrocardiograms.
