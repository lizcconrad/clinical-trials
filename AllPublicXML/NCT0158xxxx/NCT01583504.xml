      Hypothesis: High volume saline injections are an effective pain relieving treatment for
      people with longstanding pain in the achilles tendon which has not improved with a
      physiotherapy programme.

      Objective 1: To establish whether high volume saline injections are an effective treatment in
      decreasing pain for people with achilles tendinopathy

      Objective 2: To investigate whether high volume saline injections can improve day to day
      functioning, quality of life and the ultrasound appearances of the tendon for people with
      achilles tendinopathy

      Objective 3: To assess the tolerability of the procedure and levels of patient satisfaction
      using a simple questionnaire.

      Objective 4: To follow up the cohort of people who have received the injection for 9 months
      and ascertain whether any benefits persisted, or if the symptoms recurred.

      Background: Achilles tendon disorders are a common problem for athletes with a lifetime risk
      of around 50%. They are also common for less active people with a lifetime risk of around 6%.

      Tendinopathy is a condition which is characterised by pain, difficulty with weight bearing
      and swelling of the tendon. Symptoms may occur with exercise at first but can progress to
      occurring at rest and interfering with day to day activities. When the problematic tendon is
      examined under the microscope, it usually shows signs of degeneration rather than
      inflammation - especially when symptoms have been persistent. An ultrasound scan will usually
      show that the tendon is swollen with an increased water content and a disorganised tendon
      structure.

      A special type of ultrasound scan which looks at fluid flows, called a doppler ultrasound,
      often shows areas of increased blood flow around the tendon. Studies have shown that when
      these areas of increased blood flow are present, the patient tends to be experiencing more
      pain and stiffness in the tendon. Under the microscope, these blood vessels are often
      accompanied by nerve fibres and it has been suggested that these newly growing nerve endings
      are responsible for the persistent pain that patients experience.

      There is robust evidence that a particular type of exercise programme (eccentric loading) is
      an effective treatment for achilles tendinopathy. These exercises involve taking weight on
      the tendon whilst it is being compressed rather than stretched - heel lowering exercises.
      Nevertheless after completing a 3 month eccentric loading exercise programme, around 24-45%
      of patients will still have symptoms. There is no clear consensus amongst doctors as to what
      is the best second line treatment to try for this group of people.

      A number of different treatments have been described in research literature to try to treat
      this group of people with persistent symptoms, although no firm conclusion can be reached.
      There have been 2 small trials of high volume saline injections which showed some promising
      potential for the treatment. The aim of this injection is to destroy the blood vessels and
      nerve endings that grow into the swollen tendon to reduce pain and allow people to move and
      exercise more normally using the tendon. These studies simply looked at before and after
      injection results and did not compare the injections to a placebo or other treatment. The aim
      of this project is to conduct a high quality comparison of this new type of injection against
      a more common steroid and local anaesthetic injection around the tendon sheath. The design of
      the trial is a double blind, randomised controlled trial. This means that neither the
      patient, nor the doctor collecting data on pain scores knows which treatment the participant
      has been given, allowing a fair comparison of the interventions.

      The main comparisons between the 2 groups will take place at a 6 week follow up appointment.
      Once outcome measures have been recorded by the blinded assessor, the participant will then
      be told which arm of the study they are on. If they previously received the control injection
      (steroid and local anaesthetic only)and they still have symptoms, they will at this stage be
      offered the high volume saline injection as well. The investigators will then follow all of
      the study participants up for 9 months to ascertain whether people show a persistent benefit
      from the treatment, or whether symptoms subsequently return.

      The full study protocol is available on request from the Principle Investigator, along with
      information leaflets, ethical approvals etc.
