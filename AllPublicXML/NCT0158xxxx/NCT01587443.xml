  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) presents a heavy burden on a patient's psychological and
      social life, as well as overall quality of life (QoL). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)
      in dialysis patients measures the physical, social or emotional well-being that is affected
      by ESRD and/or its treatment, and has been increasingly used as an outcome measure in
      interventional studies. Additionally, associations between social support and QoL have been
      observed, indicating that improved social support could improve HRQoL, morbidity and
      mortality in ESRD patients. However, it is not clear if hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal
      dialysis (PD) have different impacts on HRQoL. Furthermore, comparisons of HRQoL and social
      support between HD and PD patients in the multiethnic society of Singapore have not been
      evaluated. As such, the investigators propose to conduct this cross-sectional study in the
      investigators local multiethnic ESRD patient population to evaluate and compare
      patient-reported outcomes (HRQoL and social support), economic and clinical laboratory
      outcomes in HD and PD patients.

      All chronic HD and PD patients seen in NUH outpatient renal or PD clinic will be included in
      this cross-sectional, observational study. Information on patient demographics,
      medical/medication histories, dialysis vintage, clinical laboratory data and associated
      medical costs will be obtained from clinic notes, electronic medical records and hospital
      databases. Patient-reported outcomes will be determined from scores of the Kidney Disease
      Quality of Life-Short Form, EuroQol 5 Dimensions, Family Functioning Measure, Oslo-3 Social
      Support Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Kessler Psychological
      Distress Scale and Health Services Utilization questionnaires (for indirect costs), and
      compared between HD and PD patients.

      Results from this study will provide important HRQoL information to assist renal physicians
      and patients to make treatment decisions. Furthermore, intervention programs could be
      developed to improve social support based on patients' needs. These could in turn improve
      patients' HRQoL, morbidity and mortality outcomes with minimal risks involved.
