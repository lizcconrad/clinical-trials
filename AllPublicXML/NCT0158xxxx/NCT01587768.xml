      The studies described in this protocol are all performed within the framework of PROTECT
      (Pharmacoepidemiological Research on Outcomes of Therapeutics by a European ConsorTium)
      Workpackage 2 (WP2) and Workgroup 1. The primary aim of these studies is to develop, test and
      disseminate methodological standards for the design, conduct and analysis of
      Pharmacoepidemiological (PE) studies applicable to different safety issues and using
      different data sources. To achieve this, results from PE studies on 5 key adverse events
      (AEs) performed in different databases will be evaluated. Therefore, emphasis will be on the
      methodological aspects of the studies in this protocol and not on the clinical consequences
      of the association under investigation. The standards to develop will contribute to
      decreasing the discrepancies in results from different studies in the future and increase the
      usefulness and reliability of these studies for benefit-risk assessment in the EU.

      We propose to assess the association between antibiotics use and idiopathic acute liver
      injury with different study designs (descriptive, cohort, nested case-control and case
      crossover) across different primary care databases and to compare the results between
      databases, across designs to evaluate the impact of design/database/population differences on
      the outcome of the studied association.

      Specific aims (in each database):

        1. To describe characteristics, clinical features, and risk factors for acute liver injury
           in patients exposed and unexposed to antibiotics.

        2. To estimate the overall risk of acute liver injury associated with antibiotics exposure
           (users and non-users) in each database

        3. To estimate the risk of acute liver injury associated with various antibiotics classes

        4. To estimate the risk of acute liver injury associated with specific individual
           antibiotics

        5. To assess the effect of dose and duration of use for specific individual antibiotics.

        6. To compare the results of a case-control study with the results of a retrospective
           cohort study and self-controlled case series study in the different databases

      The proposed studies will be collected in populations from the following databases: The
      General Practice Research Database [GPRD] (UK), Health Improvement Network [THIN] (UK), BIFAP
      [Base de datos Informatizada para estudios Farmacoepidemiologicos en Atencion Primaria]
      (Spain)- the Bavarian Claims Database (Germany), Mondriaan (Netherlands), and the National
      Databases of Denmark.

    <textblock>
      Acute liver injury is one of the most important safety concerns, being the leading cause for
      drug withdrawal from the market on safety grounds. For most suspected hepatotoxic drugs the
      only existing information comes from spontaneous reports, lacking appropriate risk
      quantification through formal epidemiological studies. A few population-based studies
      examining the risk of acute and clinically relevant liver injury among users of various drugs
      have been published, reporting an elevated risk of liver injury in users of antibiotics. As
      acute liver injury is often idiosyncratic and because its diagnostic criteria used in
      epidemiological studies have been variable, the reported range of incidences of acute liver
      injury caused by antibiotics is broad. In the United Kingdom (UK), case-control studies
      investigating the effect of antibiotics on acute liver injury have generated odds ratios
      ranging from 94.8 for the combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid to 6.2 for
      tetracyclines. Age, sex, alcohol intake, concomitant medication and comorbidities have been
      proposed as risk factors for antibiotic induced liver injury and may have influenced the
      quantification of risk estimates. In the present protocol, we propose to further quantify the
      risk of acute liver injury associated with antibiotics in the general population using
      different study designs and in different primary care databases, and to compare the results
      to evaluate the impact of design and population differences on the outcome of the study
      association.

      Acute liver injury or hepatotoxicity in this study implies chemical, drug driven liver damage
      which can be classified based on clinical presentation and laboratory features ranging from
      asymptomatic mild biochemical abnormalities to acute liver failure. The most common
      classification used for drug induced liver injury (DILI) is according to laboratory
      abnormalities (hepatocellular, cholestatic or mixed) and according to mechanism of toxicity
      (direct, immune-mediated, idiosyncratic, or mitochondrial toxicity). Being idiosyncratic in
      most cases, reactions often cannot be reproduced experimentally in laboratory animals. The
      relationship between the dose and the occurrence or severity of the reaction is not constant,
      and the latent period between drug exposure and sensitivity reaction is rather variable. The
      infrequency of DILI, though with significant impact, and complicated case ascertainment in
      pharmacoepidemiological studies has led to wide ranges of reported incidence rates. A recent
      study, using data from the GPRD database, reported crude incidence rates of liver injury
      caused by any type of drug ranging from 1 to 18 per 100,000 prescriptions. The Drug-Induced
      Liver Injury Network (DILIN), a US based collaboration between academic and health
      institutions to study the aetiology and prevention of DILI, found antibiotics to be the
      largest class of agents to cause drug-induced liver injury. UK based estimates of incidence
      rates of antibiotic induced liver injury range from 2.5 to 8.6 per 100,000 users.

      Antibiotics are a type of antimicrobial used to treat infections and are amongst the twenty
      most prescribed drugs in England, with approximately 38.7 million prescriptions dispensed in
      2009. The most frequently prescribed type of antibiotics is penicillins, a group of
      bactericidal antibiotics that interfere with bacterial cell wall synthesis. Other
      bactericidal antibiotics include cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. Antibiotics with
      bacteriostatic mechanisms of action, inhibiting the growth or proliferation of bacterial
      cells, include tetracyclines, macrolides, sulphonamides and quinolones. Most types of
      antibiotics have been associated with drug-induced liver injury.

      Liver injury accounts for 10% of all adverse reactions to drugs and is the most frequent
      reason for withdrawal of medications from the market. This study would provide a valuable
      contribution to our current knowledge as drug induced liver injury is the most common cause
      of acute liver failure and antibiotics are the largest drug class of agents, with the highest
      exposure prevalence, to cause acute liver injury.

        The primary source population will be comprised of patients of all ages with an active or
        died registration status during the study period of January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2009.
        Patients must have attained one year of enrolment with the general practioner (GP) and one
        year of computerized prescription history.

        From the aforementioned source population, two study cohorts will be selected.

        The first cohort will include all patients who received at least one antibiotic
        prescription during the study period. For this cohort, the date of first prescription of an
        antibiotic after meeting the eligibility criteria (entry date) defines the start of
        follow-up (start date), for the exposed cohort.

        The second cohort will be selected from the same source population among patients who have
        not received an antibiotic prescription during the study period and in the year before the
        entry date (date when the patient meet the eligibility criteria and enter in the study).
