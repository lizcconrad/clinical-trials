  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how the drug
      is absorbed into the bloodstream) and antiviral activity of repeated doses of TMC647055 given
      in combination with telaprevir in HCV infected patients. TMC647055 is being investigated for
      the treatment of hepatitis C infection. Telaprevir has recently been approved in the USA and
      in Europe for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infected patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open label trial in genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients.
      The study population consists of 16 adult patients. TMC647055 is given as an oral solution
      and telaprevir (TVR) is given as oral tablets. Patients found to be eligible after the
      screening visit will be divided over 2 panels that will be performed sequentially. In the
      first panel, 8 patients will receive TMC647055 at a dose of 500 mg twice a day in combination
      with TVR at a dose of 1125 mg twice a day for 10 consecutive days. In the second panel, 8
      subjects will receive TMC647055 in combination with TVR for 14 days. TMC647055 and TVR dose
      will be decided based on results from panel 1. TMC647055 dose will not be higher than 1000 mg
      twice a day and TVR dose will be 1125 mg twice a day or 1500 mg twice a day. It could also be
      decided to change duration of panel 2 to 10 days. In that case, the timing of assessments of
      panel 1 will be followed. For the duration of dosing in the 2 panels, patients will remain on
      site. Immediately after the last dose in panels 1 and 2, patients will start the extension
      phase. In this phase, patients will receive TVR at a dose of 750 mg every 8 hours for 12
      weeks in combination with pegylated interferon alfa (Peg IFN)(180ug subcutaneous once weekly)
      and ribavirin (RBV) (1000 or 1200 mg per day orally depending on weight in 2 divided doses).
      After that they will receive either 12 or 36 weeks of PegIFN -RBV treatment at the same dose
      regimen, depending on virus levels at week 4 and 12 in this extension phase. In the extension
      phase, patients will come to the site for visits at week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36 (if
      applicable) and 48 (if applicable). Patients who prematurely drop out in panel 1 or 2, will
      have a follow-up visit at 2 and 4 weeks after their last dose. Patients participating in the
      extension phase will have a follow-up visit at 4 and 12 weeks after their last dose. Safety
      and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study.
