    <textblock>
      The purpose of the National Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry is to collect health
      information in order to study the lymphedema as a complication of breast cancer treatment.
      The investigators hope to learn whether early diagnosis will help to prevent lymphedema or,
      if it does occur, to reduce the severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, breast cancer-associated lymphedema has been relatively ignored, with
      mis-diagnosis, late diagnosis, and failure to treat. The condition has a measurable,
      substantial impact on patient function and perceived quality of life (QOL). Recent pilot
      studies suggest that interventions that are designed to facilitate early diagnosis and
      preventive strategies have a major impact on the incidence and severity of disease burden.
      This registry is designed to prospectively capture the relevant data to document the impact
      of preemptive diagnostic and treatment strategies.
