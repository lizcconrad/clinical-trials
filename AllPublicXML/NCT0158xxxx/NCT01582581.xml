      This Phase II SBIR project represents the continuing development of an Information Technology
      Enabled Disease Management System for Treatment of Adolescent Depression (iTAD) following a
      highly successful Phase I award in which all Specific Aims were met. The need for this system
      innovation arises from the substantial costs that inadequately treated adolescent Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) has on the course of adolescent development and society as a whole.
      Effective treatments involving the combined use of a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor
      (SSRI) and the administration of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered the &quot;modal
      treatment&quot; for adolescent MM. Yet, multiple barriers interfere with the implementation and
      dissemination of this &quot;gold standard' of care. These barriers include: under recognition of
      depressive symptoms by parents and pediatricians, inability to assess adolescent depression
      accurately and reliably in primary care settings, safety concerns related to pharmacologic
      treatment, monitoring of symptom changes and adverse treatment effects, such as irritability
      and suicidal behavior, treatment non-compliance, lack of access to an integrated medical and
      treatment history; and an alarming shortage of properly trained child and adolescent
      psychiatrists capable of implementing optimal treatment safely, reliably, and effectively.

      In this current project, the investigators are making tailored forms of CBT broadly and
      easily accessible to the community, using the iTAD (previously &quot;ITEMS-TAD&quot;) which is intended
      to address these problems. Development of the system has continued and we have modified the
      existing prototype that was created with funding from federal sources (Phase 1). The
      technological infrastructure of the prototype includes a Computer Assisted Telephone
      Interview (CATI) platform, a database consisting of patients' real time medical and treatment
      history, and an underlying set of intelligent algorithms that tailors the intensity of the
      treatment resources and approaches administered in individual cases, with a special focus on
      identifying those enrolled adolescents needing more intensive or urgent care. When
      interacting with patients over the telephone, primary care nurses use the CATI to facilitate
      the reliable assessment of patient status and administer manualized, empirically informed
      interventions. The programming for the platform that delivers this intervention is complete
      and the debugging and refinement underway. The content for the remaining iTAD program has
      been developed and is being programmed. A Rapid Iterative Evaluation &amp; Testing (RITE) study
      was undertaken to refine the content of the application and assess the usability of the
      technology involved in its delivery; A field trial is underway to evaluate empirically
      indicators of efficacy and patient acceptance related to the ITEMS-TAD approach. The clinical
      trial of iTAD will begin in early April 2012. The investigators are currently enrolling
      depressed adolescents who will begin the trial shortly.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in measures of depression over the course of treatment among teens with Major Depressive Disorder.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The measure used is the PHQ-9 (Kroenke, et al.), a standard and validated measure for use in screening for or monitoring adolescent depression. Teens that score positively on Item #9 (a self-harm risk item), will be further evaluated by the clinician using two interactive and validated methods for standardized assessment of suicide risk: a brief version of the Beck Hopelessness scale and the C-CASA (Columbia University). Teens needing referral to a behavioral health specialist will be referred by the nurse and/or the pediatrician for further evaluation and treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of program efficacy as indicate by changes in subjects' knowledge of depression.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Depression Knowledge Test (DKT) will be used to assess changes in the level of knowledge teens have about depression and its treatment. The DKT consists of 10 open response questions based on materials from the TADS Adolescent Workbook. Sample questions include &quot;We know there are four main causes of depression. List as many as you can,&quot; and &quot;There are some learned patterns that people need to change to overcome depression. List as many patterns as you can.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of program efficacy as indicated by development of self-efficacy skills.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Skill Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SSEQ) will be used to assess changes in the level of self-confidence teens have in their ability to use the cognitive behavioral skills taught in the demo program. Using the same assessment schedule as the DKT, teens will be asked to rate self-confidence in their ability to &quot;set goals,&quot; &quot;achieve goals,&quot; &quot;know what they are feeling,&quot; &quot;know how intensely they feel something,&quot; and &quot;know what causes their feelings.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of program efficacy as indicated by the establishment of therapeutic alliance.</measure>
    <time_frame>12weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic alliance between adolescents and nurse managers will be measured by the Therapeutic Alliance Scale for Adolescents (TASA; Shrink et al., 2008. The TASA is explicitly designed to measure the strength of the therapeutic alliance among teens participating in CBT treatments. A maximum score is 6.0 based on a Likert scale from one to six. The list of items for this measure of therapeutic alliance indicates very high bonding between counselors and patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of program efficacy as indicated by fidelity and treatment quality.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTR) will be used as a measure of treatment quality and fidelity of the calls by and interactions of the study nurses with the teens. The CTR has been considered a standard measure of competence in cognitive therapy for more than 20 years,(Young JE 1980; Dobson, Shaw et al. 1985; Vallis, Shaw et al. 1986). Recorded sessions will be rated on the scale by certified raters from the American Academy of Cognitive Therapy (ACT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evidence of program efficacy as indicated by program acceptance.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An acceptance questionnaire will be administered to teens to determine their overall perception and acceptance of the program. The questionnaire contains 9 questions, asking the subject to rate the usefulness of the program; comment on its quality, and suggest areas for improvement. The acceptance questionnaire uses a 7-point Likert scale for rating purposes ranging from (1 = not at all to 7 = extremely). It also includes three open-ended questions to capture what teens like the best or the least about the program, and their suggestions for improving the program.</description>
