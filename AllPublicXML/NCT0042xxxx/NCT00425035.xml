    <textblock>
      Multicenter, 2-part, multiple-dose study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
      weekly administration of panitumumab in subjects with renal carcinoma. Part 1 was initiated
      in 2001 and will not be presented here. Part 2 was designed to examine a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/wk
      in 2 cohorts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to comprehend and sign an IRB approved Informed Cosent Form

             double barrier birth control, or an IUD and have a negative serum pregnancy test upon
             entry into this study; or male patients willing to use contraception upon enrollment
             into this study

          -  Pathologic diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma by fine needle aspirate or tissue biopsy

          -  Prior nephrectomy

          -  Prior Therapy:

               1. Cohort 1 only: Previously received and failed one prior biotherapy, defined as
                  IL-2 therapy or interferon-alpha (alone or in combination); Karnosky score of &gt;
                  or = 70%

               2. Cohort 2 only: No prior therapy except nephrectomy and fall within the Motzer
                  intermediate group with one or two of the risk factors, as defined in teh Study
                  Design section.

          -  Has bi-dimensionally measurable disease

          -  Has tumor tissue available for diagnostics (acceptable: biopsy, nephrectomy tissue,
             fine needle aspirate, or archived tissue that is formalin fixed and paraffin
             embedded). In cases when a fresh biopsy can be obtained, the biopsy should be divided
             into two; one half should be formalin fixed, and the other half frozen. Tumor samples
             must be received at the central laboratory prior to patient regisration.

          -  Adequate hematologic data, as follows:

               1. ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L

               2. Platelet count &gt; 100x 109/L

          -  Adequate renal function, as follows:

             1. Creatinine &lt; or = 2.2mg/dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function, as follows:

               1. Alkaline phosphatase &lt; or = 3x ULN

               2. AST &lt; or = 3x ULN

               3. ALT &lt; or = 3x ULN

               4. Total bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Brain metastases

          -  Cohort 1 only: Hypercalcemia (calcium level outside the upper limit of normal;
             antihypercalcemic treatment is allowed)

          -  Cancer therapy within 30 days of ABX-EGF infusion (hormone therapy is allowed; steroid
             therapy is only allowed if it is replacement therapy)

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 30 days of ABX-EGF infusion

          -  Prior treatment with any anti-EGFr agents

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 45%, as measured by MUGA Scan

          -  Myocardial infarction within one year prior to entering the study

          -  Has other cancer that has been active and required treatment within the past 5 years
             (prior renal cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or cervical carcinoma in situ are
             allowed)

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding female; male or female of childbearing potential (defined
             as: post menarche and is biologically capable of becoming pregnant) unwilling to use

             treatment

          -  Known to be HIV positive

          -  History of any chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that
             in the opinion of the Investigator may increase the risks associated with study
             participation or study drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results

          -  Allergy to the ingredients of the study medication or to Staphylococcus Protein A
