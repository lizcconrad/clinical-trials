        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male patient with age ≧ 18 years old.

             pressure not adequately controlled on existing antihypertensive treatment.

          -  Patient with sitting systolic blood pressure (sSBP)/ sitting diastolic blood pressure
             (sDBP) ≦ 180/110 mmHg at screening visit.

          -  For non-diabetic patient, sitting systolic blood pressure (sSBP) ≧ 140 mmHg or sitting
             diastolic blood pressure (sDBP) ≧ 90 mmHg at baseline visit; for diabetic patient,
             sitting systolic blood pressure (sSBP) ≧ 130 mmHg or sitting diastolic blood pressure
             (sDBP) ≧ 80 mmHg at baseline visit.

          -  Patient or his/her legally acceptable representative has signed and dated the informed
             consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known or suspected secondary hypertension.

          -  Patients taking more than two anti-hypertensive medications at the screening visit.
             (Fixed-dose combinations of two or more antihypertensive therapies will be counted as
             two or more antihypertensive medications.)

          -  Known NYHA functional class Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) III and IV.

          -  With a history of myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular
             accident within the preceding 6 months, clinically significant valvular heart disease,
             or hepatic and/or renal dysfunction as defined by the following laboratory parameters
