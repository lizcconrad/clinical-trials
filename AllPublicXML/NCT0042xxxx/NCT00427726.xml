  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will provide follow-up evaluations of breast cancer or multiple myeloma patients
      who received gene therapy (gene transfer) as part of their participation in an NIH protocol.
      Gene therapy is a new technology, which may involve a permanent change in the patient s
      genetic code. Therefore, although the risk of long-term harmful effects of this therapy is
      very small, the Food and Drug Administration requires prolonged monitoring of patients health
      status.

      Patients previously enrolled in NIH protocols 96-C-0007, 93-C-0208, 92-C-0161, or 92-H-0057
      will be followed under the current protocol. No further gene therapy will be provided in this
      study.

      Patients health status will be evaluated for an indefinite period of time, or as long as they
      are willing to be monitored. They will provide a blood sample once a year and will be
      interviewed about their health status twice a year for the first 5 years after gene therapy
      and once a year thereafter. These procedures are done to look for the development of any
      diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, autoimmune or blood disorders that may be
      related to side effects of the gene transfer.

      This Protocol aims to provide long-term follow-up of breast cancer and multiple myeloma
      subjects previously receiving autologous primitive marrow and blood hematopoietic cells
      exposed to gene transfer retroviral vectors on the following protocols: MB 294 (92-C-0161;
      T-92-0018), MB 310 (93-C-0208; T-92-0192), MB 361 (96-C-0007; T-95-0096) or (92-H-0057;
      T-92-0139) at the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
      Institute. Subjects will undergo an annual health history and annual complete blood counts
      will be performed. Blood samples will also be collected annually (either locally or off-site
      by the subjects' personal physicians) for testing for presence of the gene transfer vector
      and vector integration sites.
