  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a booster session is needed after a brief
      intervention upon initial admission to the emergency room (ER) in order to reduce the rate of
      alcohol-related injury recidivism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the proposed research is to compare the effectiveness of brief
      intervention, brief intervention plus a booster and treatment as usual for adult patients
      with an alcohol related injury. The primary outcomes of interest in the proposed trial are
      injury recidivism, alcohol intake, and alcohol problems. Because brief alcohol interventions
      with injured patients are opportunistic in nature, the patient's motivation to change or
      stage of change likely influences their response to brief intervention as well as the need
      for additional intervention. Therefore, the primary hypothesis of the proposed research is
      that patients presenting for treatment of an alcohol related injury who are in the
      precontemplation or contemplation stages of change require brief intervention with booster
      while patients in the preparation or action stages of change benefit equally from brief
      intervention alone or brief intervention plus booster. That is, an interaction between the
      patient's stage of change (Precontemplation and Contemplation or Action) at enrollment and
      treatment type (Brief Intervention, Brief Intervention with Booster and Treatment as Usual)
      is hypothesized to influence treatment effect at follow up. In addition, the impact of
      intervention on the patient's motivation to change at follow up will be assessed.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are treated for an intentional or unintentional injury associated with
             motor vehicle collisions involving driver (i.e., passenger or pedestrian) will be
             eligible for inclusion in the study.

          -  Patients who are treated for an intentional or unintentional injury associated with
             violence-related injuries including gunshot wounds, stab wounds, or other injuries
             related to assaults and falls will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

          -  Patients must be eighteen years of age or older.

          -  Study clinicians actively monitor these patients on a daily basis and the patient's
             ability to participate is determined through the use of hospital medical records,
             daily contact with the emergency department nursing staff and hospital personnel as
             well as direct contact with the patient.

          -  Currently, patients who are intoxicated at the time of admission to the emergency room
             are maintained in an observation area or admitted for twenty-three hour observation in
             order to rule out severe injury. They will be monitored by study personnel on an
             hourly basis and approached to participate in the study after evidence of acute
             intoxication has subsided.

          -  Admitted patients who are intoxicated will be approached during their hospital stay
             after they are medically stable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other penetrating trauma not related to motor vehicle collisions,
             violence or falls, such as poisoning, bites, contusions, concussions, strains and
             sprains are excluded.

          -  Patients with traumatic brain injury, or a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than
             15, are also excluded.
