    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if different doses of Investigational Drug are safe,
      tolerable, and if they have an effect on Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-Clinical experiments indicate the AL-108 compound has neuroprotective, cognitive
      protective and neurotrophic properties; therefore, the compound could be tested in a variety
      of human diseases. Human diseases include Cognitive impairment associated with aging or
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease.

      This clinical trial aims at providing the dose rationale as well as safety and tolerability
      information for AL-108 as evaluated after 12 weeks of intranasal administration in subjects
      with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).

      There are currently no drugs approved for the treatment of MCI nor accepted treatment or
      standard treatment approach.
