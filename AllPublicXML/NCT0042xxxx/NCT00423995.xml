  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is study of LMC, phenylephrine, and placebo in subjects with SAR. There are three
      visits: At Visit 1, subjects will be evaluated for participation and, if they qualify, will
      attend Visit 2 for priming. At Visit 2, ragweed pollen will be fed continuously and dispensed
      into the environmental exposure unit to induce an allergic reaction. Pollen counts will be
      monitored and recorded. During the priming visit(s), subjects will be evaluated to determine
      if they qualify. If qualified, they will return for Visit 3, where ragweed pollen will be fed
      continuously and dispensed into the environmental exposure unit to induce an allergic
      reaction. Pollen counts will be monitored and recorded as in the Priming Session. Subjects
      will complete symptom evaluations and if qualified, they will receive study medication and
      remain in the environmental exposure unit where symptoms will be evaluated for 8 hours after
      dosing. PNIF will be evaluated only during the treatment session. Four nasal symptoms
      (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) and three non-nasal symptoms
      (itching/burning eyes, tearing/watery eyes, and itching of ears/palate) will be evaluated.
      Adverse events will be collected throughout the study to assess safety and tolerability, and
      vital signs will be collected at Visit 1 and at the end of Visit 3.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages 18 years or greater, of either sex, any race.

          -  A history of SAR due to ragweed for at least two consecutive ragweed seasons, as
             diagnosed by the investigator, another physician, or subject-provided history.

          -  Positive skin prick test to ragweed allergen to be used in the EEU, unless previously
             done within 12 months

          -  Minimum scores (diary evaluation time) must be achieved during pollen exposure during
             both a Priming Visit and the Treatment Visit:

          -  A negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and prior to randomization at the
             Treatment Visit for all female subjects of childbearing potential.

          -  Use of a medically accepted method of birth control.

          -  In the judgment of the investigator, good health and freedom from any clinically
             significant disease (other than SAR) that would interfere with the study schedule or
             procedures, or compromise the subject's safety.

          -  The appropriate washout times from the prohibited medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, intention of becoming pregnant, or lactation.

          -  A situation or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere
             with optimal participation in the study.

          -  Use of any investigational drugs, including placebo, within 30 days of Screening and
             for the duration of the study.

          -  Current participation in any other clinical study.

          -  Staff personnel directly involved with this study.

          -  Dependence (in the opinion of the investigator) upon nasal, oral, or ocular
             decongestants, nasal topical antihistamines, or nasal steroids.

          -  Nasal structural abnormalities, including large nasal polyps or marked septal
             deviation, that cause greater than 50% obstruction of nasal airflow.

          -  Previous enrollment (ie, signed informed consent) into this study.

          -  History of rhinitis medicamentosa.

          -  A history of anaphylaxis or severe or serious reaction to skin testing.

          -  A known potential for hypersensitivity, allergy, or idiosyncratic reaction to the
             study drugs or excipients.

          -  Narrow-angle glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, urinary retention,
             hypertension, severe coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, diabetes
             mellitus, hyperthyroidism, renal impairment, or prostatic hypertrophy; current
             treatment with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
