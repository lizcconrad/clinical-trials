  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ossur Prosthetic Power Knee claims to assist in helping people with transfemoral
      amputation to walk up stairs and stand up from sitting. We expect to find that this product
      has the ability to help unload the sound knee during these tasks. We plan to collect force
      and motion data while people stand up from a chair. We will compare the data from people
      using several types of prosthetic knees, including the power knee as well as from people who
      are not amputees to see what the force and motion contributions are from the different knees
      evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  7 control subjects with normal lower extremity function: mentally independent adults
             with intact extremities. These individuals shall have no significant medical history
             that would impair their ability to perform 3, repeated, sit to stand trials.
             Exclusionary examples might include history positive for total joint arthroplasty of
             the hip or knee and significant cardiomyopathy. Control subjects will be non-amputee,
             generally healthy individuals, mentally capable of providing informed consent. They
             will have no significant medical history that could be perceived by investigators to
             hinder the ability to transfer. Anyone not meeting these criteria cannot be a control
             subject.

          -  28 subjects with unilateral amputation at the level of the thigh. 7 each in four
             groups:

               1. Active Extension Group: Power Knee

               2. Microprocessor Stance Control Group: C-Leg, Rheo, Adaptive

               3. Non-Microprocessor Stance Control Group: Mauch, Catech or other stance control
                  units

               4. Non-Microprocessor and Non-Stance Control units: WASB, polycentrics, pneumatics
                  Each subject must have a prosthesis for which they have had for a minimum of 90
                  days in its present condition.

          -  All subjects must be:

               1. at least 21 years of age,

               2. mentally independent, and

               3. able to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are not candidates if they:

               1. are under 21 years of age

               2. are mentally dependent and unable to provide their own informed consent

               3. have worn the present prosthesis for less than 90 days in the current condition

               4. have bilateral amputation

          -  Subjects with an amputation are not candidates if they only use a prosthesis for
             transfers or therapy (K0 or K1 Medicare functional class). They must be independently
             ambulatory, at some level in the community (Medicare functional class &quot;K2-K4&quot;). They
             are furthermore not a candidate for this study if they have bilateral amputation (at
             any level) of the lower extremity as the purpose is to determine sound versus involved
             side loading, then against control. If all of the latter criteria are satisfied, the
             final piece is the 90 day prosthetic accommodation period. Candidacy then hinges upon
             the fact that they are accommodated to their current prosthesis as evident by having
             worn the current device, unaltered for the 90 days prior to testing.
