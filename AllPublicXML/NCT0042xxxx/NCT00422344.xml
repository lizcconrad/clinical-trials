  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of RAD-001 and Sunitinib given in combination
      for renal cell cancer. We also want to find out what effects (good and bad) the combination
      of RAD-001 and Sunitinib have on you and your tumor.

      RAD001 is a pill that works by shutting down some of the pathways in the cell that make
      tumors grow. Sunitinib is a pill that works by shutting off the signal in the cancer cells
      that tell the cells to grow blood vessels. Without this signal, the blood vessels to the
      tumors shrink down.

      To assess the maximum tolerated doses and overall safety and tolerability of Sunitinib
      administered in combination with RAD001 for the treatment of patients with metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma.

      To assess antitumor activity of the combination of Sunitinib and RAD001.

      This study is designed to confirm that the 2 agents can be administered safely in
      combination. Patients will begin treatment with Sunitinib and RAD001 on Day 1. RAD001 will be
      administered orally on a weekly schedule. Sunitinib will be given orally on a 4 weeks on, 2
      weeks off schedule. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycle 1 - a
      cycle is defined by Sunitinib dosing ( 6 weeks). Once the MTD for the combination has been
      identified, a total of 10 patients will be enrolled at the highest dose level that allows for
      administration of multiple cycles and provides potentially therapeutic drug levels of both
      drugs to further assess safety and tolerability and to obtain a preliminary assessment of
      efficacy. Patients will be treated with RAD001 and Sunitinib until there is disease
      progression, significant toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients judged to derive
      benefit from treatment would be offered participation in a continuation protocol at the
      conclusion of this study.

    <description>Patients will start treatment with Sunitinib and RAD001 on Cycle 1, Day 1. Sunitinib will be given orally daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week rest period. RAD001 will be given orally daily or weekly in subsequent cohorts with the first treatment on day 1. DLT determination will be based on toxicities observed in Cycles 1 - a cycle being defined by Sunitinib dosing.
