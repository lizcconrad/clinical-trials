      To compare the efficacy, acceptability and safety of the new 2 liter gut cleansing solution
      (Moviprep) and NaP preparation in routine colon cleansing prior to tumor screening
      colonoscopies

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized and multicenter phase III study in ambulatory subjects undergoing an
      elective colonoscopy for colon cancer screening. Gut cleansing was performed using either the
      2 liters of Moviprep gut lavage solution or the 90 ml NaP-containing preparation prior to
      colonoscopy. Efficacy, acceptability and safety assessments was performed.

    <measure>Efficacy was measured as the degree of cleansing using a 5 grades scale for each of the predefined colon areas resulting into a final grading of the overall quality of gut preparation (A or B: &quot;success&quot; versus C or D: &quot;failure&quot;).</measure>
