  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major challenge in obesity treatment is not producing weight loss but in preventing that
      weight from being regained. There are many different methods to lose weight, but there are no
      recommendations for how you can best achieve long-term weight loss maintenance. Despite the
      method used to reduce one's body weight, very few of these individuals are able to keep their
      weight off permanently. This project aims to identify how much activity is necessary to
      prevent weight regain after weight loss.
