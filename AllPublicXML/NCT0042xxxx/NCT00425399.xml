      In the current study we will study the effect of adding shiatsu treatment to conventional
      therapy in work with hospitalized schizophrenic patients.

      The hypotheses of this study are several:

        1. Shiatsu can improve the patients' symptoms

        2. Shiatsu can ameliorate neuromuscular side effects produced by standard anti-psychotic
           treatment

        3. Shiatsu can provide patients with tools to deal with the stresses of their illness

      2. Methodology We propose an open pilot study in which a total of 20 patients of both sexes
      will be enrolled. These patients will be drawn from the inpatient psychiatric wards at Herzog
      Hospital.

      Upon inclusion into the trial, all participants will receive shiatsu treatment, consisting of
      two individual weekly 40-minute shiatsu treatment sessions for four weeks. Provider and
      patient will be of the same gender. Standard pharmacotherapy will be provided as needed
      during the treatment period. Medication and dosage will not be changed. If necessary,
      benzodiazepines will be administered as required.

      Outcome measures:

      The following assessments will be included:

        1. Medication: Use of SOS benzodiazepines

        2. Clinical rating scales: PANSS, CGI, NOSIE, Hamilton Scales for depression and anxiety

      1. Side effect scales: Simpson Angus Scale, AIMS scale, UKU scale 2. Neurophysiological
      testing: Prepulse inhibition (PPI). 3. Neurocognitive testing: This will be performed using
      the NIMH's Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)
      Consensus Cognitive Battery for Clinical Trials.

      SHIATSU ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA Protocol for an Open Pilot Study

      1. Background Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic mental illness that affects approximately 1%
      of the population worldwide. While the pharmacological treatments available have advanced
      considerably in the last fifty years, there are limits to what they offer some patients,
      especially in terms of improving dysphoria, sleep, mood, avolition, social functioning, and
      anhedonia, which contribute greatly to the everyday misery of these patients.

      Furthermore, some of the antipsychotic drugs induce side effects of parkinsonism, akathisias,
      orofacial dyskinesias, dystonias, and their associated muscle pain, and stiffness. The
      treatments used for those side effects are anticholinergic drugs (e.g. trihexyphenidyl),
      benzodiazepines, and beta blockers. The number and variety of such drugs suggests what
      clinicians know to be unfortunately true: there are no magic bullets for these symptoms.
      These drugs are also not innocent, causing side effects of their own, contributing to
      polypharmacy, and carrying a financial cost.

      Schizophrenia, then, remains a debilitating illness whose treatment results are often partial
      and may produce unpleasant side-effects. New approaches to supplement standard modalities
      ought to be considered.

      Shiatsu, or acupressure, is a holistic form of medicine originating in Japan but now widely
      practiced throughout the world. Shiatsu involves applying pressure to &quot;meridians&quot; of the
      body, much like acupuncture but without the needles. The shiatsu therapist views the whole
      body as interconnected - stiffness in one part may reflect a problem in another, or emotional
      disharmony. In accordance with the WHO definition of health as &quot;a state of complete physical,
      mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity,&quot; shiatsu
      massage aims to improve the overall well-being of its recipients by manipulating the body.

      Shiatsu theory is based on traditional Chinese medicine, which posits meridians of life force
      (chi) running through the body, and aims to optimize health through manipulating the body
      into maximal alignment. Disease, according to this approach, is as an accumulation of damage
      and stress that causes the body to tense up in various areas, leading to health disturbances.
      The treatment aims to loosen tense muscles and tendons and restore balance to the body.

      Shiatsu also involves a diagnostic process that is designed to locate sources of problems.
      The main four areas of this process are the patient's appearance, his/her voice, the specific
      complaints and medical history of the patient, and touch diagnosis. The touch is meant to
      reveal areas of excess or lack of energy in the body or internal organs and autonomic nervous
      system. Treatment is individualized according to the findings of this examination.

      Goals of treatment, in addition to releasing muscle and tendon tension and protecting these
      structures, are to help the patient acquire an awareness of his or her body and psyche in
      order to avoid recurrence of the problems, to identify life stressors (mental and physical),
      and to strengthen the patient's overall energy flow and resilience to disease.

      The two fields of shiatsu are do-in and anma. Do-in are the exercises that involve stretching
      parts of the body combined with breathing exercises in order to loosen tense joints and
      improve general circulation. Anma shiatsu is the more familiar massage-type treatment.
      However, it is not performed for comfort or pleasure, as in Western massage, but rather as a
      type of medical treatment. It is performed with a fully dressed patient, with direct pressure
      applied with the practitioner's fingers. Both diagnosis and treatment are performed this way,
      with the findings of the exam directing further actions.

      How might the effects of shiatsu be explained in terms of Western medicine? In order to
      answer this, we will consider research done not only for shiatsu but for acupuncture as well,
      which has been more extensively examined. This is justified for two reasons: first of all,
      shiatsu and acupuncture share the same understanding of human functioning and disease,
      including the core concepts of chi and meridians, and accordingly they recognize the same
      points along the body for applying pressure (shiatsu) or needles (acupuncture). Secondly, in
      studies which have been conducted to test the effectiveness of alternative remedies,
      acupressure and acupuncture have often been combined (e.g. Vachiramon &amp; Wang, 2005; Melchart
      et al, 2006).

      2. Biological basis for shiatsu Medical research has attempted to understand how Chinese
      medicine works its effects. Several theories have been developed which may be of relevance to
      schizophrenia.

        1. Endorphins: The most established effect of acupuncture is the release of endorphins,
           which are endogenous opioid neuropeptides (Hökfelt, 1991; Sjölund et al, 1977).
           Endorphin release appears to be closely related to the analgesic effects of acupuncture.
           Endorphins also promote a general feel of well being and reduction of tension which can
           have salutary effects in treating mental illness.

        2. Cytokines: Cytokines mediate the inflammatory response. They also promote endorphin
           release by the pituitary (Van der Meer et al, 1996). Drzyzga et al (2006) have reviewed
           the possible connection between cytokines on the one hand, and neuropathological
           changes, schizophrenia, and anti-psychotic medication mechanisms of action on the other.
           A growing body of evidence suggests that cytokinins mediate neuropathological changes in
           schizophrenia and the antipsychotic effects of medication. Acupuncture has been shown to
           affect the cytokine system in animal (Liu et al, 2004) and human (Petti et al, 2002)
           studies. The cytokine system is theoretically a pathway through which acupuncture could
           produce therapeutic effects upon schizophrenia.

        3. Glutamatergic mechanisms gained prominence as an important factor in the pathogenesis
           and treatment of schizophrenia. In experiments with animals, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
           (NMDA) receptor antagonists have synergistically enhanced the anti-nociceptive effects
           of electro-acupuncture (Zhang et al, 2002). Assessing the relationship between
           glutamatergic activity and acupuncture effects could provide important information about
           therapeutic mechanisms of action.

        4. Neuropeptide Y (NPY): NPY's role in the CNS is not well understood. However,
           appreciation for the possible role of NPY in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorder
           has increased in recent years. NPY mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the frontal
           cortex of patients with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Kuromitsu et al, 2001).
           NPY has also been shown to play a role in mediating the effects of antipsychotic
           medication, in both animal (Huang et al, 2006) and human studies (Obuchowicz et al,
           2004). Interestingly, the effects of NPY may be mediated by glutamatergic mechanisms
           (Rosse &amp; Deutsch, 2004). This is relevant to our study because NPY levels in saliva have
           been found to increase following acupuncture treatment (Dawidson et al, 1998). This,
           then, is another possible mechanism through which acupuncture can be clinically relevant
           to the treatment of schizophrenia.

      Studies have already been carried out to assess the effectiveness of Chinese medicine in the
      treatment of schizophrenia. In a recent review of five studies in the Cochrane Database
      (Rathbone &amp; Xia, 2005), acupuncture as adjuvant therapy provided with anti-psychotic
      medication showed some evidence of improved outcomes on clinical rating scales and side
      effect profiles, though overall the evidence was deemed insufficient to reach a definite
      conclusion, and &quot;more comprehensive and better designed studies&quot; were recommended.

      A second review (Moffet, 2006) of clinical trials of acupuncture for various medical
      disorders made the important observation that too often, no meaningful physiological
      rationale is provided for the proposed effectiveness of the treatment. Proposing a rationale
      enables the investigator to suggest a testable causal hypothesis which can contribute to our
      knowledge of the technique's mechanism of action.

      In the current study we will focus on assessments of the glutamatergic system by
      neurophysiological (prepulse inhibition) testing using prepulse inhibition (PPI). In this
      paradigm, the subject is presented with an auditory stimulus, or &quot;pre-pulse&quot;, which would not
      ordinarily cause the subject to blink. Following this initial prepulse by a tenth of a second
      comes a second, louder stimulus, the pulse, which would cause blinking were it not preceded
      by the prepulse. Pre-pulse inhibition, a measure of sensory gating or filtering, is
      determined by the reduction in blink response to a pulse following a pre-pulse as compared to
      the blink response without the preparatory pre-pulse. Prepulse inhibition of the startle
      response, which has been reliably demonstrated in both humans and animals (rev. in Braff et
      al., 2001; Swerdlow et al., 2001), is a preattentive, automatic process.

      Schizophrenia patients have been repeatedly shown reduced inhibition of the startle reflex in
      PPI (rev. in Geyer et al., 2001). This loss of normal PPI is thought to be a measure of the
      deficient sensorimotor gating (Braff and Geyer, 1990) that underlies sensory flooding and
      cognitive fragmentation in these patients (McGhie and Chapman, 1961). Furthermore, some
      studies report that PPI deficits may correlate with symptoms severity or cognitive and
      functional impairment in schizophrenia and may partially or completely resolve with
      antipsychotic drugs treatment (rev. in Braff et al., 2001).

      One of the proposed models of PPI hypothesizes the involvement of glutamatergic, mainly
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated neurotransmission. Glutamate is a key
      inhibitory neurotransmitter. Glutamatergic neurotransmission may correlate with the
      efficiency of sensory gating (Swerdlow and Geyer, 1999). Glutamatergic synapses have been
      implicated in the regulation of PPI in rodents (Swerdlow et al., 2001).

      In light of the possible connection between PPI and the glutamatergic system, we decided to
      administer PPI to the subjects before and after the shiatsu treatment in order to assess
      whether any ameliorating effect of shiatsu, which as noted can involve glutamatergic
      mechanisms, may correlate with changes in the PPI.

      We will also assess neurocognitive function using a battery of tests developed specifically
      for use in assessing patients with schizophrenia.

      3. Study goals: Based upon the rationales we suggested for utilizing shiatsu in the treatment
      of schizophrenia, and based upon the studies which have already been performed, we are
      proposing a pilot study to examine the efficacy of shiatsu as adjuvant therapy for
      antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.

      The goals of this study are several:

      1. To improve the patients' symptoms 2. To ameliorate neuromuscular side effects produced by
      standard anti-psychotic treatment 3. To provide patients with tools to deal with the stresses
      of their illness 4. To provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of shiatsu 4.
      Methodology We propose an open pilot study in which a total of 20 patients will be enrolled.
      These patients will be drawn from the inpatient psychiatric wards at Herzog Hospital. They
      will be recruited by the treating physicians at these facilities. All patients would be fully
      informed of the experimental treatments, goals, and possible outcomes. Either the
      participant, or where relevant the court-appointed guardian, will be required to provide
      informed consent. Participants will of course be free to discontinue their participation for
      any reason at any time.

      4.1 Inclusion Criteria:

        1. DSM-IV-R diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder

        2. Ages 18 and over

        3. Clinical status stable, as reflected by at least one month of drug treatment without
           change of anti-psychotic drug or dosage.

        4. Ability to cooperate with 40-minute sessions 4.2 Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Active fracture or other orthopedic problem

        2. Skin condition that renders treatment unsafe or painful

        3. Active infection in skin or soft tissues, such as cellulitis

        4. Any acute illness or other medical condition (e.g. solid tissue malignancy) for which
           shiatsu may be contraindicated.

      4.3 Study design Upon inclusion into the trial, all participants will receive shiatsu
      treatment, consisting of two individual weekly 40-minute shiatsu treatment sessions for four
      weeks. The shiatsu providers are all trained and certified by Tsabar College, an alternative
      medicine training institute, and all have at least two years of post-training experience in
      shiatsu. Each patient will receive all treatments from the same provider for the duration of
      his or her treatment. Provider and patient will be of the same gender. The patient is clothed
      with a shirt and full-length trousers or skirt during shiatsu. Treatment will not include
      contact with sensitive regions of the body, such as the chest (in work with females), pelvic,
      or inner thigh regions, or any other region of the body with which the patient is not
      comfortable.

      Standard pharmacotherapy will be provided as needed during the treatment period. Medication
      and dosage will not be changed. If necessary, benzodiazepines will be administered as
      required.

      4.4 Rescue strategies and withdrawal from research In case of exacerbation, defined as an
      increase of 2 points on the BPRS (or 4 to 6 on the individual items listed above), or of one
      point on the CGI, the patient may receive clothiapine at a dose of up to 80 mg/day for not
      more than 3 days within a 14-day period.

      In case of relapse, defined as an increase of 3 points on the BPRS (or from 5 to 7 on somatic
      concern, conceptual disorganization, hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior or
      unusual thought content), or of 2 points on the CGI, the patient will be withdrawn from the
      study and appropriate treatment instituted. Furthermore, if the patient deteriorates
      clinically in a way that may be related to treatment (e.g. paranoid fantasies directed
      towards the shiatsu therapist), the research protocol for that individual will be
      discontinued.

      Significant emergent medical problems will also lead to the withdrawal of the patient from
      the research.

      4.5 Outcome measures

      The following assessments will be included:

        1. Medication

           a. Use of SOS benzodiazepines: quantity and frequency

        2. Clinical rating scales

             1. PANSS

             2. CGI

             3. NOSIE

             4. Hamilton Scales for depression and anxiety

      2. Side effect scales:

        1. Simpson Angus Scale

        2. AIMS scale

        3. UKU scale 3. Neurophysiological testing: Prepulse inhibition (PPI). This is performed as
           follows: The eyeblink component of the acoustic startle reflex is measured using
           electromyography of the obicularis oculi muscle. Two electrodes (6 mm) Ag/AgCl
           electrodes filled with electrode gel (parker laboratories inc.) will be positioned below
           and to the right of the patient's right eye, over the obicularis oculi muscle.
           Electrodes will be placed to minimize potential electro-oculogram artifact.
           Specifically, 1 electrode will be placed approximately 1 cm lateral to and 0.5 cm below
           the lateral canthus, and the second electrode will be placed approximately 1.5 cm below
           and slightly medial to the first electrode, conforming to the location of the obicularis
           oculi fibers. A ground electrode will be placed behind the right ear over the mastoid.
           All resistances will be less than 10 kOhm. Electrodes will be fixed to the skin as close
           as possible to each other using adhesive collars. All acoustic stimuli will be delivered
           binaurally through headphones (Maico, TDH-39-P). Subjects will be seated comfortably in
           a softly lit after they will be informed of the procedure. The prepulse and startle
           stimuli are bursts of white noise with a fixed interstimulus intervals of 30, 60 and 120
           ms for measuring PPI or 15 ms and 4500 ms for measuring PPF. The startle session will
           begin with a 5-minute acclimation period of 70-dB white noise, which will continue
           throughout the session, followed by six trial blocks. Block 1 consisted of six
           pulse-alone trials. Blocks 2 and 3 each consisted of 32 trials, containing 8 pulse-alone
           and 24 prepulse-pulse trials presented in pseudorandom order. Block 4 consisted of six
           pulse-alone trials. Block 5 consisted of six pulse-alone trials and 12 prepulse-pulse
           trials and block 6 consisted six pulse alone trials. The first, forth and sixth blocks
           will measure habituation as well as startle response, the second and the third blocks
           will measure startle response and PPI and the fifth block will measure PPF. The pulse
           alone stimulus is a 40 ms presentation of 115dB white noise, the prepulse stimulus is a
           20 ms (except the 15 ms interval stimulus which lasts 5 ms) presentation of 86 dB noise,
           both over 70 dB of continuous background noise. Acoustic stimuli consist of pulse alone,
           prepulse and pulse, or no stimulus trials and are presented in a fixed pseudorandom
           order. Electromyographic activity recorded by the electrodes will be directed through a
           customized electromyographic amplifier to a computerized startle response monitoring
           system for digitization and analysis (SR-LAB; San Diego Instruments Inc, San Diego,
           Calif). The system will record 1000 one-ms readings starting at the onset of the startle
           stimulus. Acoustic startle and prepulse stimuli will be presented binaurally through
           headphones.

           4. Neurocognitive testing: This will be performed using the NIMH's Measurement and
           Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive
           Battery for Clinical Trials. This recently-developed battery is recommended for use in
           clinical trials of putative cognition-enhancing agents in schizophrenia. The MATRICS
           battery, including Hebrew translations of relevant tests, is presently used in the
           Stanley Foundation-sponsored Israel Multicenter D-Serine Trial (IMSER) (Dr. Heresco-Levy
           - Co-Principal Investigator) and will be implemented by a trained psychologist presently
           participating in this project.

           5. Hypothesis: Shiatsu adjuvant therapy will improve psychiatric and motor symptoms in
           patients after four weeks of therapy.

           6.1 Potential Benefits: Shiatsu treatment is a pleasant experience involving applying
           pressure manually to various points of the body. Furthermore, the research will itself
           lead to more time spent by staff with patients, which is to the patient's benefit.
           Beyond that we anticipate that shiatsu will be of benefit, alongside the standard
           pharmacological treatment which will be continued, in enhancing the patient's wellbeing
           and reducing medication side effects.

           6.2 Potential Adverse Effects: Shiatsu is not known to carry any significant risks to
           patients. It may rarely cause soreness, muscle cramps, or local pain. Patients will be
           informed of this possibility and instructed to notify the shiatsu therapist if
           discomfort occurs during treatment. Psychological distress may be aroused by the human
           contact and touching that occurs during treatment. Patients will be advised about this
           possibility as well. Patients wishing for any reason to discontinue the research will of
           course be withdrawn from the study.

           6.3 Significance of study: The treatment of schizophrenia could benefit from new
           modalities to complement existing approaches. To date, no study has systemically
           evaluated the use of shiatsu in treating schizophrenia, and only one study has evaluated
           shiatsu in this population for drug induced myospasm. Due to the chronic nature of this
           disease and the severe impairment of quality of life, any and all means should be sought
           in combating the suffering inherent in this disease. Shiatsu may be a cost-effective,
           pleasant, and well-tolerated treatment for some schizophrenia symptoms. This study may
           pave the way for similar studies in other psychiatric patients.
