  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, known as &quot;first&quot; or &quot;induction chemotherapy&quot; in the therapeutic
      assumption of breast cancer is based on the narrow dependence preclinically revealed between
      primary tumour, tumoral angiogenesis and growth of distant metastases.

      The results of the Aberdeen Group (Smith et al, 2002 ; Hutcheon et al, 2003), of the NSABP
      B27 trial (Bear et al, 2003) and of the Gepar-Duo Group (Von Minckwitz et al, 2002) have
      shown that a sequential protocol, using docetaxel after an anthracycline-based combination,
      allowed a better clinical response leading to more frequent conservative surgeries and, more
      importantly, to an increase in the rate of complete pathological response, assessing a better
      efficacy.

      The use of a reference adjuvant protocol as a neo-adjuvant treatment is fully admissible
      because 7 randomized trials have shown a perfect equivalence between an adjuvant protocol and
      the same chemotherapy given as an induction treatment Even keeping the principle of a
      sequential treatment, a crucial question is to know if this sequential treatment should be
      the same for all patients, or if the oncologist could get a better complete pathological
      response, disease-free or overall survival rates by an adaptation of treatment to the
      objective result beginning after 2 FEC 100 courses by modulation of the following courses.

      We will use as a primary regimen 3 FEC cycles + 3 TAXOTERE cycles, a standard adjuvant
      regimen (noted in the Temporary Protocol of Treatment of the Inca page 5 (October 2005) as
      well as in Saint Paul de Vence 2005 recommendations for adjuvant chemotherapy (Oncologie --
      volume 7 - N°5, August 2005, p 370). This standard treatment will be compared to the same
      chemotherapy modulated in its repartition according to results obtained by subsequent tumor
      evaluations during induction therapy.
