    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects/patients from 18-60 years of age

          -  Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 and 30 kg/mÂ². Subjects/patients
             must weigh a minimum of 50 kg.

          -  Female subjects/patients must either have been surgically sterilized or
             hysterectomized at least 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject/patient must be able to provide written informed consent prior to study
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values at the screening evaluation or at
             the baseline re-evaluation, for patients excluding those normally associated with
             severe degree of renal impairment or the primary cause of renal insufficiency.

          -  Use of any over-the-counter medications or herbal / natural supplements during 2 weeks
             prior to dosing. (acetaminophen is acceptable, but must be documented in the
             Concomitant Medications / Non-Drug Therapies page of the CRF).

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing or longer
             if required by local regulation.

          -  Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to dosing or other
             amount considered to compromise the health of the subject/patient if previous history
             of anemia exists.

          -  Significant acute illness within the two weeks prior to dosing.

          -  History of any significant cardiovascular events (M.I., angioplasty, angina) within 6
             months of study start.

          -  A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history
             of a prolonged QT-interval syndrome.

          -  History of hyponatremia.

          -  History of seizures.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the
             absorption,distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs other than renal impairment
             or which may jeopardize the subject/patient in case of participation in the study. The
             investigator should be guided by history of any of the following: inflammatory bowel
             syndrome, gastritis, ulcers, gastrointestinal or rectal bleeding gastropathy
             (gastroparesis) or enteropathy major gastrointestinal tract surgery such as
             gastrectomy, gastroenterostomy, or bowel resection clinical evidence of pancreatic
             injury or pancreatitis

          -  History of immunocompromise, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test
             result.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result .

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 6 months prior to dosing or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or
             baseline evaluations.
