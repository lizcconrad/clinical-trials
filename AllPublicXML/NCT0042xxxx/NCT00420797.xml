  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that topical application of phenylephrine
      improves faecal continence and quality of life in subjects with passive faecal incontinence
      after ileo-anal pouch construction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Faecal seepage and even frank incontinence at night can be a problem for approximately 30% of
      patients who have undergone ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). Nocturnal seepage may be a
      problem in patients who do not have gross incontinence, or who may even have no incontinence
      during the day. Although baseline continence during the day is maintained by involuntary
      control of the internal anal sphincter, this can be supplemented by voluntary contraction of
      the external sphincter. While sleeping, this supplementary external sphincter effect is lost
      and internal anal sphincter tone is reduced, leading to seepage. This is obviously
      distressing and leads some patients to wear a pad to reduce the soiling that may occur.

      The primary objective is to determine the effect of 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride gel,
      applied three times a day, on the change from baseline to the end of study (8 weeks)in the
      faecal incontinence score (St Mark's) with passive faecal incontinence after ileo-anal pouch
      construction, compared with placebo.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Incontinence of solid or liquid stool/mucus following ileo-anal pouch construction, at
             least once per week over the last month

          -  At least six months must have elapsed since IPAA surgery or six months since closure
             of a loop ileostomy created during IPAA surgery, whichever is the later

          -  Aged 18 years or over

          -  If female, the subject must not be lactating and must be (a) post-menopausal, (b)
             surgically sterilised, or (c) have a negative pregnancy test result prior to entry
             into the study and will use adequate contraception for the duration of the study
             (sterilization of partner, abstinence, an intra-uterine device (IUD), double barrier
             method or oral hormonal contraception).

          -  Written informed consent to participate has been provided

        NB: Seepage, leakage, soiling of faecal material is regarded as incontinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of surgery to the anal sphincter complex

          -  Active pouchitis (determined by clinical examination and macroscopic inflammation on
             endoscopy. Patients on maintenance antibiotics need not be excluded but their
             antibiotic dose should remain the same throughout the study)

          -  Undergone pelvic radiotherapy at any time

          -  Cardiac or cardiovascular disease, including ischaemic heart disease, history of
             stroke, cerebral arteriosclerosis, aneurysm, tachycardia or hypertension

          -  Hyperthyroidism or diabetes mellitus

          -  Crohn's disease (indeterminate colitis is not an exclusion criterion)

          -  The use of α- or β-adrenoceptor agonists (other than inhaled β-adrenoceptor agonists)
             or antagonists, other sympathomimetics or any cardiovascular drugs during the study
             (including eyedrops, nasal drops and OTC cold cures containing phenylephrine or
             pseudoephedrine)

          -  The use of mono-amine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants in the 4 weeks
             prior to the first dose of study medication or during the study

          -  Any mental or other impairment which, in the investigator's opinion, would render them
             unlikely to be able to comply with the requirements of the study

          -  Considered by their physician unlikely to be able to comply with the protocol

          -  Participation in a clinical trial within the past three months

          -  Known hypersensitivity to phenylephrine or excipients

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse
