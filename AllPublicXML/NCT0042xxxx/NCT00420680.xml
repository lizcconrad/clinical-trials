      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of 2.0 mg/kg and 4.0 mg/kg sugammadex
      given as a reversal agent at reappearance of T2 after 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in cardiac
      patients

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac patients of NYHA Class II to III

          -  ASA class maximally 4

          -  Age at least 18

          -  Scheduled for elective, non-cardiac surgery under general anesthesia with propofol in
             the supine position, with planned muscle relaxation using rocuronium and allowing for
             12-lead ECG assessment during surgery;

          -  Given written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Disorders interfering with the reliability of the assessments (e.g. ECG measurements),
             such as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or the presence of a pacemaker

          -  Known or suspected neuromuscular disorders impairing NMB

          -  Known or suspected significant renal dysfunction

          -  Known or suspected (family) history of malignant hyperthermia

          -  Known or suspected allergy to narcotics, muscle relaxants or other medication used
             during general anesthesia

          -  Intended) use of medication expected to interfere with the effect of rocuronium as
             given in this trial, based on the dose and/or the time of administration (such as
             antibiotics, anticonvulsants and Mg2+ )

          -  Pregnancy (pregnancy to be excluded for women both from medical history and by an hCG
             test within 24 h before surgery, except for women who were not of childbearing
             potential, i.e. at least 2 years menopausal or have undergone tubal ligation or a
             hysterectomy)

          -  Childbearing potential without using any method of birth control or using only
             hormonal contraception as birth control (subjects were allowed to participate if they
             were willing to use a condom, or a diaphragm with spermicide, or IUD, or have a
             vasectomized partner (&gt;6 months) or abstinence, for one month after participation in
             the trial)

          -  Breast -feeding

          -  Prior participation in any trial with Org 25969

          -  Participation in another clinical trial not pre -approved by Organon, within 30 days
             of entering into trial 19.4.309
