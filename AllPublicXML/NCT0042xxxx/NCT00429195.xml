  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LIPGENE Human Dietary Intervention Study, multi-centre, trans -European, single-blinded,
      randomised, controlled trial with two principal aims. Firstly to determine the relative
      efficacy of reducing dietary SFA consumption, by altering quality of dietary fat and reducing
      the quantity of dietary fat, on metabolic and molecular risk factors of the metabolic
      syndrome. Secondly to determine if common genetic polymorphisms affect an individual's
      responsiveness to dietary therapy.

      521 free-living subjects with the metabolic syndrome received one of four dietary treatments
      for 12 weeks: (1) High-fat (38% energy) SFA-rich diet; (2) High-fat (38% energy), MUFA-rich
      diet; (3) Isocaloric low-fat (28% energy), high-complex carbohydrate diet and (4) Isocaloric
      low-fat (28% energy), high-complex carbohydrate diet, with 1 g/d LC n-3 PUFA. A 3-day weighed
      food intake assessed dietary compliance pre-, mid- and post- intervention. An IVGTT,
      lipoprotein analysis, cytokine, adhesion molecule, coagulation factor and isoprostane levels
      were determined pre- and post-intervention. DNA, adipose and skeletal muscle biopsies, and
      PBMC were isolated to characterise nutrient sensitive molecular markers of insulin
      sensitivity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Gender: males and females (not pregnant or lactating).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) 20-40 kg/m2

          -  Total cholesterol concentration equal to or &lt; 8.0 mmol/l.

          -  Medications / nutritional supplements allowed, on condition that the subjects adhere
             to the same regimen during the intervention: anti-hypertensive medication (including
             beta-blockers), oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, multi-vitamin
             supplements, other non-fatty acid based nutritional supplements (e.g. garlic,
             anti-oxidants, etc).

          -  Smokers and non-smokers.

          -  Regular consumers of alcohol, which is not excessive as defined by elevated liver
             enzymes (AST and ALT).

          -  Ethnicity: Intention to include white Europeans.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes or other endocrine disorders.

          -  Chronic inflammatory conditions.

          -  Kidney or liver dysfunction.

          -  Iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin &lt; 12g/dl men, &lt; 11g/dl women)

          -  Prescribed hypolipidaemic medication

          -  Prescribed anti-inflammatory medication

          -  Fatty acid supplements including fish oils, evening primrose oil, etc.

          -  Consumers of high doses of antioxidant vitamins (A, C, E, beta-carotene).

             portion is defined as a small herring or mackerel, one can of salmon or sardines or
             one salmon or tuna steak. Tinned tuna is permitted as it contains only minor amounts
             of long chain n-3 PUFAs.

          -  Highly trained or endurance athletes or those who participate in more than 3 periods
             of intense exercise per week.
