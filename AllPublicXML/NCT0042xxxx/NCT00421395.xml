  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label, multiple center, non-randomized, dose-escalation Phase I/II
      trial, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a repeated, outpatient regimen
      utilizing IMMU-hLL2 intact monoclonal antibody IgG labeled with different doses of 90Y for
      the treatment of patients B-cell lymphoma (NHL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      90Y-labeled hLL2 will be administered according to a schedule based upon whether or not a
      patient had prior high-dose chemotherapy with a marrow or stem cell transplant. Patients with
      both indolent and aggressive types of NHL will be enrolled at each dose level without
      segregation. However, at the conclusion of the trial, with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      defined, a minimum number of 6 patients with indolent NHL, 6 patients with aggressive NHL,
      and 6 patients with &gt;25% bone marrow involvement will be studied at that dose level.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have a histologic or cytological diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, and
             have failed at least one regimen of standard chemotherapy. All histologic grades of
             non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) will be eligible for these studies.

          -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Measurable disease by CT, with at least one lesion &gt; 1.5 cm in one or both dimensions

          -  less than 25% bone marrow involvement as determined by bone marrow biopsy

          -  Patient must have greater than 15% cellularity of the bone marrow.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond any major surgery.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond any radiation therapy to the index lesion and
             must have recovered from radiation induced toxicity.

          -  Patients must be at least 4 weeks beyond prior chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, or
             2-weeks after corticosteroids, and their blood counts must be within the eligibility
             criteria. Corticosteroids may, however, be given concomitantly if used to treat
             adrenal insufficiency

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 70 or greater on the Karnofsky scale
             equivalent to ECOG 0-1 (See Appendix A) and a minimal life expectancy of 6 months.

          -  Patients must be able to give cognizant informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a significant concurrent medical complication including severe anorexia,
             nausea or vomiting that in the judgement of the Investigator could affect the
             patient's ability to tolerate or complete this study.

          -  Patients with metastasis to the brain.

          -  Patients with extensive irradiation to more than 25% of their red marrow will be
             excluded, except those who had total body irradiation in the context of bone marrow or
             stem cell transplantation regimen with subsequent engraftment of a functional marrow
             (i.e., resulting in normal peripheral blood counts). Subjects who have received
             external radiation to specific organs or areas at the maximum tolerated level are also
             excluded.

          -  Women who test positive for pregnancy.

          -  Patients with splenomegaly.

             radiotherapy and/or other immunotherapy.

          -  Patients with prior radioimmunotherapy treatments (unless for retreatment under this
             protocol).

          -  Patients receiving rituximab within 3 months, unless progressing after treatment.

          -  Patients with &lt;50% LVEF by required MUGA or 2-D ECHO.

          -  Patients with &lt;60% of predicted value by required pulmonary function tests.

          -  Patients who have active Hepatitis B or C or are known HIV positive.

          -  Patients with another primary malignancy (except basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix.

          -  Patients with other serious medical, surgical, or psychiatric history, unless
             currently stable and well controlled, without significant increase in treatment
             medications for at least 30 days preceding study entry.
