  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following radical prostatectomy (RP), about 20% to 40% of the patients with prostate cancer
      (PCa) exhibit pathological parameters which are associated with a high risk of disease
      recurrence. The rationale for NHT is based on the theory that androgen ablation induces PCa
      apoptosis which induces a regression of the primary tumor bulk before RP. However the use of
      NHT prior RP is highly controversial. In spite of these unenthusiastic results, the relative
      short time of treatment and the use of different drugs from those utilized in other trials
      might still to make this regimen attractive in terms of drug related side effects and
      effectiveness. In this regard, Bicalutamide presents unique characteristics since it work
      differently respect to other anti-hormonal agents by interfering on both genotropic and
      non-genotropic mechanisms of androgen receptor
