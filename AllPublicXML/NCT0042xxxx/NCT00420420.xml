  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of an investigational medication
      for improving symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. Subjects will receive either active medication
      or placebo for 28 days. Tests of memory, concentration will be included. Safety will be
      monitored using routine clinical and laboratory tests.

    <measure>Week 4 Change From Baseline in Computerized Neuropsychological Test Battery (CNTB): Short CNTB Summary Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The CNTB was used to evaluate cognitive function, as measured by the mean change from Baseline to Week 4 in the short CNTB summary score. The short CNTB summary score was scored as the mean score across 5 modules: Word List Learning-Selective Reminding, Word List Learning-Delayed Recall, Simple Reaction Time, Choice Reaction Time, and Visual Memory subtests. The short CNTB summary score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores (and positive changes from baseline) indicating better performance.</description>

    <measure>Week 4 Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog): ADAS-Cog Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog, scored as the total score of 11 tasks including mazes was used to evaluate cognitive function, as measured by the mean change from Baseline to Week 4 in the ADAS-Cog total score. The ADAS-Cog total score ranges from 0 to 70, with higher total scores indicating more impairment. Lower scores (and negative changes from Baseline) indicate better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Week 4 Change From Baseline in Cognition Summary Score (CSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The CSS was used to evaluate cognitive function as measured by the mean change from Baseline to Week 4 in the CSS total score. The CSS was derived from the correct sequence percentage from the Route Test and 6 of the CNTB scores (the CSS was scored as the mean of the 7 scores). CSS scores can range from 0 to 100, higher scores (and positive changes from baseline) indicate better performance.</description>

        <title>Week 4 Change From Baseline in Cognition Summary Score (CSS)</title>
        <description>The CSS was used to evaluate cognitive function as measured by the mean change from Baseline to Week 4 in the CSS total score. The CSS was derived from the correct sequence percentage from the Route Test and 6 of the CNTB scores (the CSS was scored as the mean of the 7 scores). CSS scores can range from 0 to 100, higher scores (and positive changes from baseline) indicate better performance.</description>
