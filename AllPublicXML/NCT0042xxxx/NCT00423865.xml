    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Everolimus may also help cisplatin work better by making tumor cells more sensitive
      to the drug. Giving cisplatin together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when
      given together with cisplatin in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or recurrent or
      metastatic solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of everolimus when administered with low-dose
           cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Describe the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Assess the effects of this regimen on p53 and p21 immunohistochemistry assays of pre-
           and post-treatment tumor biopsies from patients with recurrent or metastatic solid
           tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of everolimus (part A) followed by a biological
      marker study (part B).

        -  Part A (closed to accrual as of 1/2009): Patients receive cisplatin* IV over 30 minutes
           on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral everolimus* once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of everolimus until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose proceeding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during course 1. The recommended phase II
      dose is defined as the dose at which 1 of 6 patients experience DLT during course 1.

      Blood is drawn periodically on days 1 and 8 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.

        -  NOTE: *Patients who have completed 5 courses of treatment and maintain stable disease or
           better may continue treatment with everolimus alone or in combination with cisplatin

        -  Part B: Patients undergo biopsy of the primary tumor, metastatic deposit, or involved
           lymph node. No more than 14 days later, patients receive everolimus at the recommended
           phase II dose and cisplatin as in part A.

      Patients undergo another tumor biopsy on day 15 of course 1, before receiving chemotherapy.
      The pre- and post-therapy tissue is examined by immunochemistry and analyzed for p53 and p21
      expression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 people will be accrued for this study.

    <description>After the phase 2 recommended dose is established in the phase I portion of the study (Part A), we plan to enroll an additional 6 patients for pharmacodynamic studies (Part B). Entry into Part B requires the patient have tumor tissue which is easily accessible for research biopsy. The patients will be asked to provide written informed consent for the research biopsies. Patients also will be asked to provide written informed consent to allow the use of their tissue for future research studies. The research biopsies are not mandatory for any patient. Patients who do not consent to the research biopsies or who withdraw consent for the research biopsies may still receive RAD001 + cisplatin in the study</description>
