  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients experience functional limitations related to the cancer and treatment
      side effects. Early functional limitations affect short- and long-term quality of life, and
      may lead to long-term complications. Patients living in rural areas are at particular risk
      because they do not have easy access to services. Therefore, early intervention is indicated
      to have an impact on the overall public health. Problem solving training (PST) is a
      standardized manual driven intervention that may be ideally suited to assist breast cancer
      patients to preserve their valued activities and to comply with recommended symptom
      management regimens (e.g., physical therapy, aerobic exercise and relaxation/guided imagery)
      that improve function. Telephone-based PST provided from a centralized location (such as the
      comprehensive cancer center) may improve access and outcomes in a cost-effective manner. We
      propose to conduct a feasibility study of a PST intervention with 30 rural breast cancer
      patients undergoing adjuvant treatment randomly assigned to PST or to usual care. The
      intervention group will receive weekly phone-based PST sessions for six consecutive weeks.
      The specific aims of this R03 small grant application are to:1) Test the feasibility of
      enrolling and retaining newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in a clinical trial to assess
      telephone-based PST. 2) Collect preliminary data on outcome measures of function to determine
      effect size estimates that will inform power analyses for a full scale randomized controlled
      study. Primary outcome measures will be acceptance rates for enrollment in the study,
      retention rates across both intervention arms, and satisfaction levels with the PST
      intervention. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and at six weeks (end of PST
      intervention) and 3 months following baseline. The long-term goal of this line of
      investigation is to develop practical, widely applicable rehabilitation models of care to
      preserve function and decrease distress in cancer patients undergoing treatment.
