      The primary purpose of your participation in this study is to help answer the following
      research question, and not to provide you treatment for your condition.

      Whether duloxetine once daily can help patients with Chronic Low Back Pain.

      Patients who do not have their pain reduced by at least 30% by week 7 will be given 120 mg
      dose for the duration of the study. After the 13 week double blind period, patients
      randomized to placebo will switch to duloxetine 60 mg or 120 mg in the 41-week extension
      period.

        <description>24-hour average pain severity scores recorded daily on an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Patients should complete the electronic diary at bedtime. The 11-point Likert scale will also be used for assessment of night pain and worst pain each day, and evaluated as weekly means. Average interference was calculated as the average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 13 Endpoint in Weekly Mean of 24-hour Average Pain, Night Pain and Worst Pain by 11-Point Likert Scale</title>
          <description>24-hour average pain severity scores recorded daily on an 11-point Likert scale, an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Patients should complete the electronic diary at bedtime. The 11-point Likert scale will also be used for assessment of night pain and worst pain each day, and evaluated as weekly means. Average interference was calculated as the average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>

        <description>BPI-S and BPI-I are self-reported scales measuring severity of pain and interference on function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question assessing worst pain, least pain, and average pain in past 24 hours, and pain right now. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Average interference = average of non-missing scores of individual interference items.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 13 Endpoint in EuroQoL Questionnaire - 5 Dimension (EQ-5D)</title>
        <description>The EuroQoL Questionnaire – 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) is a generic, multidimensional, health-related, quality-of-life instrument. The profile allows patients to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score between 1 and 3 is generated for each domain. For each patient, the outcome rating on the 5 domains will be mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranges between 0 and 1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the patient. Scores presented used the UK Based Index Score.</description>
