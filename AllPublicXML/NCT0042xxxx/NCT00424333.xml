  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus:

        1. Whether glycemic control can be achieved at least as effectively with a) an intensive
           insulin regimen involving pre-meal inhaled insulin plus twice daily subcutaneous NPH
           insulin as with b) an intensive subcutaneous insulin regimen involving pre-meal regular
           insulin plus twice daily NPH, given as 4 injections per day. The treatment regimens
           differ only by the route of delivery of the short acting insulin.

        2. The toleration and safety of inhaled insulin therapy and its effects after 6months, if
           any, on measures of pulmonary function.
