      To examine the feasibility of VATS lobectomy for clinical stage IB or II non-small cell lung
      cancer. Success is defined as VATS lobectomy without conversion. If success rate over 90%,
      VATS lobectomy is considered as feasible procedures for clinical stage IB or II non-small
      cell lung cancer

      Video-assisted or minimally invasive surgery has become the standard approach for many
      abdominal surgical operations such as cholecystectomy and fundoplication. With respect to the
      thorax, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery(VATS) is the accepted technique for biopsy of
      the lung and pleura and surgical treatment of pneumothorax.Thoracoscopic, also termed
      video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy has become accepted as a safe and effective procedure
      to treat early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several pilot series of
      thoracoscopic lobectomy in stage I lung cancer patients have been reported, demonstrating low
      complication rates and effective short-term and long-term oncologic results. With increasing
      experience, the indications for thoracoscopic lobectomy have been expanded. Single and
      Multi-institutional studies have demonstrated that thoracoscopic lobectomy is not only a safe
      and feasible technique, but is also associated with decreased morbidity, including shorter
      length of hospitalization and chest tube duration, decreased postoperative pain, improved
      preservation of pulmonary function, reduced inflammatory response as measured by lower
      postoperative cytokine levels, and shorter recovery time, as compared with conventional
      thoracotomy. The advantages of thoracoscopic lobectomy have been demonstrated in patients
      with clinical stage I NSCLC, and this strategy has been found to be particularly useful for
      specific subsets of patients such as the elderly and those patients with poor performance
      status.

      The purpose of this study is to know whether VATS lobectomy for clinical stage IB or II
      non-small cell lung cancer is possible.
