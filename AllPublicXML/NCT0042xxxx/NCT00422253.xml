      We hypothesize that reduction in dietary advance glycation endproducts (AGE) intake will
      increase insulin sensitivity and normalise insulin secretion in overweight and obese
      individuals through reduction of chronic low grade inflammation.

      We propose to test this hypothesis by performing euglycemic hypeinsulinemic glucose clamp and
      intravenous glucose tolerance test before and after low AGE diet and normal Australian diet
      in a cross-over design. This study will provide information relevant to the development and
      prevention of type 2 diabetes.

             examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they:

               -  are aged &lt;18 years or &gt; 50 years;

               -  have a history of: diabetes, cardiovascular and hematological disease,
                  respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, renal or central nervous system

               -  are actively seeking to lose weight, or if their weight has changed by more than

                  test) or lactating

               -  have highly unusual dietary habits or follow vegan diets (because of the
                  difficulty in complying with the assigned diet).
