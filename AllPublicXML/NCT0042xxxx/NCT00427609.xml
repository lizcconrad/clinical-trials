      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy for Bicillin L-A, administered
      intramuscularly in a dose of 2.4 million units every three (3) weeks, for the treatment of
      chronic, plaque-type psoriasis unresponsive to topical medications or when other systemic
      therapies are contraindicated.

    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder most commonly manifested by
      well-demarcated, erythematous and/or scaling plaques on the elbows, knees, scalp, and trunk.
      Psoriasis is a common disease with overall incidence of 1-3% of the general population. The
      estimated prevalence varies from 1-2%. There is significant geographical variability with the
      lowest incidence of the disease around the equator and increasing towards the poles.

      Psoriasis is now considered an autoimmune disease mediated by activated T-cells, releasing
      proinflammatory cytokines, predominately TNF-a and IFN-y. The key role for T-cells in the
      pathogenesis of psoriasis was supported by reported beneficial effects of specific T cell
      targeted therapies including cyclosporin A and certain recently marketed immune response
      modifiers.

      While disease pathogenesis is still not completely understood, the factors that may trigger
      or worsen psoriasis have been systematically studied and well described in the medical
      literature. Psychological stress, mechanical trauma to the skin, certain medications and
      Streptococcus strains are the most common disease triggers.

      It was first reported in 1916 that the onset of psoriasis is often preceded by throat
      infections with hemolytic streptococci and the role of M-protein positive beta hemolytic
      streptococci in triggering guttate psoriasis has been confirmed in subsequent studies.
      Exacerbation of chronic plaque type psoriasis has been reported in association with
      tonsillitis in retrospective studies. Moreover, high frequency of remission after
      tonsillectomy or antibiotic treatment has been documented.
