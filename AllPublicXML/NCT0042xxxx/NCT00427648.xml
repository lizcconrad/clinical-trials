  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether alkalized lidocaine instilled into the
      bladder is effective in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing first-line treatments for overactive bladder are limited by requirements for chronic
      dosing and associated systemic side effects. Small case series suggest that bladder
      instillation of lidocaine may be effective in downregulating the afferent neuronal activity
      of a sensitized bladder, leading to elevation of the urge sensory threshold and decreasing
      detrusor activity. However, neither the effectiveness over placebo nor the durability of the
      response has been previously investigated.

      Comparison(s): We propose a randomized, prospective double-blinded controlled trial to
      determine if a three-week trial of intravesical alkalized lidocaine instillation decreases
      symptoms of overactive bladder more than instillation of normal saline using a validated
      outcome instrument, the OAB-q.
