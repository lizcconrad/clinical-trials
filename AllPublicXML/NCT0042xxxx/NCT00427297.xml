    <textblock>
      Globally, children who acquire HIV-1 increasingly do so in the context of maternal
      antiretroviral prophylaxis. It is important to determine whether maternal antiretroviral
      prophylaxis should alter infant treatment regimens. Nevirapine (NVP) is commonly used for
      PMTCT and is also a commonly used first-line drug for treatment of pediatric HIV-1.
      Approximately half of infants exposed to NVP have detectable NVP resistance early in infancy,
      with loss of detectable resistance over time. Thus, if an HIV-1 infected child was exposed to
      single-dose NVP prophylaxis, the question remains whether NVP or any NNRTI can be used
      effectively in therapeutic regimens. Alternative PI-based regimens are associated with
      heat-lability, poor palatability, cumulative toxicity, and fewer salvage options. This poses
      challenges for pediatric PI-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in settings
      without refrigeration and limited antiretroviral repertoire. It is plausible that in older
      NVP-exposed infants (older than 6 months since exposure) who are genotypically
      NVP-susceptible, that nevirapine will be effective and useful.

      We propose to study resistance in a pediatric HIV-1 clinical trial involving 100 children.
      Among children enrolled at between 6 and 18 months of age, we will provide real-time
      field-based genotypic NVP-resistance testing, and randomize 100 NVP-susceptible children to
      NVP-containing versus NVP-sparing HAART to compare therapeutic response, adverse events, and
      morbidity in the 2 arms during 2-year follow-up. Follow-up in these studies will be closely
      monitored by an external Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB).

      Hypotheses

        1. Infants older than 6 months who do not have detectable nevirapine resistance on
           genotypic testing will respond equivalently to a nevirapine-sparing or a
           nevirapine-containing HAART regimen, despite previous single-dose nevirapine exposure.

        2. Genotypic drug resistance levels may predict response to therapy and clinical
           progression.

      Specific Aims/Primary Objectives

        1. To compare response to therapy (viral levels, CD4%, growth, and morbidity) in infants
           without detectable nevirapine-resistance on population-based sequencing who are
           randomized to nevirapine-containing versus nevirapine-sparing HAART.

        2. To develop methods to detect and quantify nevirapine resistance mutations present at low
           frequency in the virus population in order to examine the relationship between the copy
           number of such variants and virologic failure of infants treated with
           nevirapine-containing HAART.

      Secondary Aim/Secondary Objective: To determine predictors of non-progression in these
      studies, including: age, time since nevirapine-exposure, adherence, HIV-1 specific immune
      responses, baseline HIV-1 RNA, CD4 percent, and immune activation.

      Design: Randomized clinical trial in which infant 6-18 months of age will be randomized to
      nevirapine containing versus nevirapine sparing HAART regimen and followed for 24 months.

      Population: HIV-1 infected infants (6-12 months) meeting eligibility will be enrolled.
      Infants who were exposed to nevirapine in-utero or following delivery, with no detectable
      resistance to nevirapine will be eligible for enrollment.

      Sample size: 100 infants will be enrolled (50 infants in each arm).

      Treatment: All infants will be treated with NVP containing or sparing HAART. The regimen will
      be prescribed according to WHO and Kenyan national guidelines on dosage and combination of
      antiretroviral drugs. The HAART regimen that will be used in this study are:

      First line regimen:

      For infants on NVP containing HAART

        -  AZT/3TC/NVP (zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine)

        -  d4T/3TC/NVP (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine)

        -  ABC/3TC/NVP (abacavir/lamivudine/nevirapine)

      For infants on NVP sparing HAART

        -  AZT/3TC/ABC (zidovudine/lamivudine/abacavir)

        -  d4T/3TC/ABC (stavudine/lamivudine/abacavir)

      For children who have anaemia (Hb of &lt;8g/dl), AZT will be substituted for d4T.

      Second line regimen:

        -  ddI/ABC/LPV/r (didanosine/abacavir/lopinavir-ritonavir (kaletra))

        -  ABC / ddI or TDF / NVP or EFV (abacavir / didanosine or tenofovir / nevirapine or
           efavirenz) Among children randomized to NVP sparing HAART, who will be initiated on a
           regimen containing lopinavir/ritonavir, zidovudine and lamivudine will be substituted
           with abacavir and didanosine or tenofovir (TDF) and lopinavir/ ritonavir will be
           replaced with nevirapine or efavirenz (EFV) in case of treatment failure of the LPV/r
           containing regimen.
