      Rationale: Adjuvant chemoradiation considered as standard of care after curative surgery for
      adenocarcinoma of stomach and gastroesophageal cancer. Preoperative chemotherapy in the in
      locally advanced gastric cancer results in significant tumoral downstaging with improved rate
      of curative resections.

      Purpose: To evaluate feasibility and safety of combination of preoperative chemotherapy and
      postoperative chemoradiation for locally advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach and
      gastroesophageal cancer

             carcinoma not otherwise specified, of stomach or gastro-esophageal junction.

          2. T2-4 N0-3 M0. T1 tumors are eligible if T1N1-3

          3. Disease must be clinically limited to the stomach or GEJ.

          4. Pre-treatment Port-a-Cath insertion obligatory

          5. No prior chemotherapy.

          6. No prior radiotherapy.

          7. Patients must be surgical candidates as determined by the treating surgeon.

          8. Adequate organ function defined as:

          9. Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status &lt; 1.

         10. Patients must be able to sign the informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Tis (in-situ carcinoma) and tumors determined to be TIN0 following endoscopy,
             endoscopic ultrasound and CT scanning.

          2. Patients with primary carcinomas of the esophagus.

          3. Prior chest or upper abdomen radiotherapy, prior systemic chemotherapy within the past
             5 years, or prior esophageal or gastric surgery.

          4. Patients with evidence of metastatic disease are not eligible.

          5. New York Heart Association Class III or IV heart disease.

          6. Severe co-morbid conditions or nonmalignant illness whose control may be jeopardized

          7. Pregnant or lactating women or men unable or unwilling to practice contraception are
             excluded.

          8. Any history of prior malignancy (other than non-melanoma skin cancer, in-situ cervical
