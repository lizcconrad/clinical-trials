  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims as defining success rate of the incontinence ring in women with test proven
      stress urinary incontinence and determining factors associated with successful use.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if the incontinence ring is effective in
      decreasing the incontinence episode frequency per week. Other objectives include the
      determination of the cure rate (objective and subjective) with the ring, the effects to
      bladder function as noted on urodynamic testing, the impact on quality of life and the
      acceptability to this device in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.

      In this cross-over study, 40 women will undergo a two-period treatment. In one of the
      periods, she will spend 4 weeks wearing continuously the ring and in the other (also 4 weeks
      duration), she will not be using any treatment for her incontinence. Between periods, she
      will spend 2 weeks in &quot;wash out&quot; to eliminate the risk of continuous effect from the
      treatment in the preceding period. Each woman will be randomly assigned to the treatment
      sequence.

      Stress urinary incontinence is a common problem affecting at almost 20% of women. Treatments
      currently advocated include pelvic floor exercises and surgery. Pelvic floor exercises
      require great motivation and usually 3 months of training to show an impact. Surgery is very
      effective, but costly and carries a number of complications. The use of the incontinence ring
      may allow women to control their symptoms with immediate result at minimal risk. This device
      has never been properly evaluated before its introduction into the market.

The UDI is a 6-question validated questionnaire assessing the urinary tract symptoms and their bothersomeness.

    <description>Peak flow rate (ml/sec) during uninstrumented uroflow. The 'no treatment' flow rate was obtained during baseline urodynamic studies (UDS) and the 'incontinence ring' flow rate was obtained at the end of the ring period for each participants, while wearing the ring.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The I-QOL (Incontinence-Quality of Life) is a valid and reproducible self-administered measure for assessing quality of life of patients with urinary incontinence. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert response scale (very much, moderately, a little, not at all). Scoring the I-QOL questionnaire involves summing the responses into a single score. The sum score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with a higher number representing a better quality of life</description>

The questions were combined, scored, and weighted to create two scales that provide glimpses into mental and physical functioning and overall health-related-quality of life. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of 12 questions and range from 0-100, where a 0 score indicates the lowest and 100 the highest level of health measured by the scales.
In MCS section, we are looking at Mental Health composite score.</description>

This UDS was considered to reflect the 'no treatment' period, although technically it was done at baseline. A UDS during the 'no treatment' period would have been ideal, but this would have represented an additional UDS testing that likely would not have differed from the baseline testing. All patients needed to have UDS-proven urodynamic stress incontinence as inclusion criteria.</description>

        <description>The I-QOL (Incontinence-Quality of Life) is a valid and reproducible self-administered measure for assessing quality of life of patients with urinary incontinence. Items are scored on a 4-point Likert response scale (very much, moderately, a little, not at all). Scoring the I-QOL questionnaire involves summing the responses into a single score. The sum score is transformed to a 0-100 scale, with a higher number representing a better quality of life</description>
