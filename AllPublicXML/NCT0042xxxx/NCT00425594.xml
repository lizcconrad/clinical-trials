          -  Subjects impacted at screening

          -  Subjects with impaired consciousness that predisposes them to pulmonary aspiration.

          -  Subjects who are undergoing colonoscopy for foreign body removal and decompression

          -  Subjects with known difficulties for swallowing tablets

          -  Subjects with pre-existing electrolyte disturbances, such as dehydration, or those
             secondary to the use of diuretics.

          -  Subjects who are taking drugs that may affect electrolyte levels with the exception of
             routine diuretics.

          -  Subjects with known clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities such as

          -  Subjects who are allergic to any preparation components

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, should not be included in the study
             for any reason, including inability to follow study procedures.

          -  Subjects who have participated in an investigational clinical, surgical, drug, or
             device study within the past 30 days.
