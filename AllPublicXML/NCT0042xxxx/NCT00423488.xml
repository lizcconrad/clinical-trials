    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess, after 6
      weeks of dosing, whether co-administration of ezetimibe 10 mg with simvastatin 20 mg will be
      more effective than treatment with doubling the dose of simvastatin to 40 mg alone in
      reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations and in achieving the
      National Cholesterol Expert Panel (NCEP) III LDL-C target goal of &lt;2.6 mmol/L (&lt;100 mg/dL)
      for subjects with diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease.
