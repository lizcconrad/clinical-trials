  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective controlled randomized clinical trial. Consecutive patients with acute proximal
      deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities, with or without contemporary manifestations of
      pulmonary embolism, are randomized to receive either a below-knee or a full-leg graduated
      compression (30-40 mm Hg at the ankle) elastic stocking for prevention of the post-thrombotic
      syndrome (PTS). All patients are followed up to three years to assess the development of the
      PTS, defined according to a validated clinical score (the Villalta scale). The rate of PTS is
      compared between the two study groups. In addition, there is an assessment of patients'
      compliance and tolerability of the two different devices.
