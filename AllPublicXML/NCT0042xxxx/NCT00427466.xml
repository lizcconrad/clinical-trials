    <textblock>
      The aims of this trial are to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of pemetrexed in
      patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who have progressed after or during an
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy and to assess the toxicity profile

    <textblock>
      One therapy cycle takes a total of 3 weeks. On day 1, Pemetrexed is intravenously
      administered. The dosage is 500 mg/m2 over a period of 10 minutes. A repetition of this
      procedure is performed on day 22

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed metastasized or locally inoperable soft tissue sarcoma

          -  Progression or relapse after previous cytostatic treatment with adriamycin and/or an
             ifosfamide containing chemotherapeutic substance

          -  Two-dimensionally measurable/evaluable tumor parameters (according to WHO-criteria)

          -  Previous radiotherapy is acceptable as long as the irradiated area does not include
             the only measurable lesion

          -  Patient compliance and geographic proximity, which ensure the possibility of adequate
             Follow-up

          -  Adequate bone marrow function at the initiation of therapy

          -  Adequate kidney function

          -  Patient consent

          -  Patient ability to consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or concurrent irradiation of the indicator lesion

          -  Other concomitant tumor therapy

          -  Severe impairment in hepatic function

          -  Active Infection

          -  Previous treatment with Pemetrexed

          -  Second tumor within the past 5 years (excepting basal cell carcinoma, adequately
             treated carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, of the bladder urothelium or colon
             polyps including pTis and pTin)

          -  Severely symptomatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease

          -  HIV, active Hepatitis B or C
