  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MalaroneÂ® (atovaquone/proguanil) is frequently used in malaria prophylaxis. Unfortunately,
      there are indications that certain anti-HIV agents may decrease atovaquone plasma levels by
      induction of atovaquone metabolism.

      For travelling HIV patients, the clinical consequences of these possible drug drug
      interactions are serious, since a diminished exposure to the anti-malarial drug will result
      in suboptimal prophylaxis of malaria and potential development of drug resistant strains of
      Plasmodium falciparum.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if HIV patients using HAART regimes with either
      lopinavir/ritonavir, atazanavir/ritonavir or efavirenz have lower atovaquone plasma levels
      than healthy volunteers after a single dose of atovaquone/proguanil.
