      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical applicability of an enteral tube
      feeding formula containing fish oil and prebiotics in a critical care population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In terms of nutrition support in the acute care setting, it is generally accepted that

        1. earlier is better

        2. enteral is superior to parenteral

        3. the quality of nutrients appears more important than quantity

        4. select populations will show additional benefit from specific nutrient supplementation.

      The current study is designed to evaluate the tolerance of an enteral formula in trauma and
      surgery patients, as demonstrated by achieving and maintaining enteral feeding goal,
      gastrointestinal tolerance and inflammatory markers.
