  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topotecan and gemcitabine are drugs globally registered for recurrent ovarian carcinoma. This
      trial will determine the maximum tolerated dose and the efficacy of this combination
      administered weekly in patients with platinum -resistant ovarian cancer.

             platinum-refractory/resistant ovarian cancer. This category also will include patients
             with disease progression within six months of completing the most recent
             platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Patients had to have at least one bidimensionally measurable and/or evaluable
             (unidimensionally measurable) target lesion in a non-irradiated area, or increased Ca
             125

          -  A &gt;= 4 weeks interval between their last chemotherapy regimen and the start of study
             treatment

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Performance status (WHO) 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of at least three months

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000/mm^3, platelet count &gt;
             100000/mm^3, hemoglobin &gt; 9 gr/mm^3)

          -  Adequate liver (bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times upper limit of normal and SGOT/SGPT &lt; 2 times
             upper limit of normal) and renal function (creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl)

          -  Informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Psychiatric illness or social situation that would preclude study compliance

          -  Other concurrent uncontrolled illness

          -  Other invasive malignancy within the past 5 years except nonmelanoma skin cancer
