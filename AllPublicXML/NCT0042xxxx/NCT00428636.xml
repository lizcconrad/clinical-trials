  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We conducted a prospective randomized study to evaluate the results of early closure of
      temporary loop ileostomy at eight days in comparison with late closure at two months, after
      elective rectal resection with low pelvic anastomoses.

      The aim of this multicentric prospective randomized study is to compare for patients
      requiring rectal resection followed by under Douglassienne anastomosis (low colorectal,
      coloanal, ileoanal) protected by ileostomy, two strategies about delay of ileostomy closing :
      delayed closing of ileostomy when second hospitalization two months later (classical
      attitude) ; precocious closing of ileostomy during the same hospitalization (at Day 8 of
      first operation). All patients aged 18 years or older with disease (carcinoma, inflammatory
      bowel disease, benign disease) requiring colorectal or rectal resection with low pelvic
      anastomoses (LPA) (ie low colorectal, coloanal, or ileoanal procedures) were eligible to
      participate in the study. A water-soluble contrast enema examination through temporary loop
      ileostomy was performed at day 7. If there were no radiologic signs of contrast leakage,
      patients were allotted to the group of early closure (EC) or to the group of late closure
      (LC). The primary end point was the rate of either postoperative death or postoperative
      complications occurring at 90 days after the first initial procedure.Postoperative
      complications will be considered present for a patient if one of the following elements is
      observed during the study : post operative death, anastomotic fistula, postoperative
      peritonitis ; serious event requiring hospitalization : prolapsus or peristomial eventration,
      erosive peristomial dermitis, serious wall sepsis, dehydration with hydroelectrolytic
      disorders, occlusive syndrome.
