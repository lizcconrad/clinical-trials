      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of abrupt discontinuation of
      saredutant over 1 week in outpatients with depression who completed 8 weeks of treatment with
      saredutant 100 mg once daily.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 8 weeks of open-label
