          -  Subjects must agree to abstain from alcohol for 24 hours prior to the start of dosing

          -  Current or recent (within one year) gastrointestinal disease; a history of
             malabsorption, oesophageal reflux, irritable bowel syndrome; frequent (more than once
             a week) occurrence of heartburn; or any surgical intervention (e.g., cholecystectomy)
