  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natalizumab (TYSABRI) is a protein-based drug that is manufactured by Biogen Idec in
      partnership with Elan Pharmaceuticals. Natalizumab is approved in the US and Europe for the
      treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The purpose of this study is to determine whether the
      amount of natalizumab (TYSABRI) that is present in your blood (plasma) can be reduced or
      eliminated by separating and removing the plasma and replacing it with other fluids, a
      process called plasma exchange.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  considered by the Investigator to be free of signs and symptoms suggestive of any
             serious opportunistic infection

          -  willing to discontinue and remain free from concomitant immunosuppressive or
             immunomodulatory treatment (including interferon beta and glatiramer acetate) for the
             duration of the study

          -  willing and able to comply with the site's plasma exchange protocol which may require
             hospitalization or daily visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  considered by the Investigator to be immunocompromised

          -  history of, or available abnormal laboratory results indicative of any major disease
             that would preclude the administration of a recombinant humanized antibody
             immunomodulating agent for the duration of the study.

          -  condition(s) considered to be contraindication(s) for plasma exchange, including but
             not limited to bleeding diathesis, hypotension, or vascular access limitations
