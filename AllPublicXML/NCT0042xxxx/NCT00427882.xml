      Primary:

      To assess improvement in ejaculation from baseline to the end of treatment (Week 12 or
      premature withdrawal) with Alfuzosin 10mg OD, using MSHQ score.

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate sexual function improvement

        -  To evaluate LUTS (Lower Uninary Tract Symptoms) improvement

        -  To evaluate the association between LUTS severity and sexual function.

        -  To assess the safety and the tolerability of Alfuzosin 10mg OD.
