  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the antitumour activity (response rate) in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of two different combinations of docetaxel and
      gemcitabine and of a sequential treatment of cisplatin /gemcitabine followed by docetaxel as
      first line chemotherapy · To evaluate the quantitative and qualitative toxicity of each
      treatment arms.· To determine time to progression, duration of response, time to treatment
      failure, and overall survival in each group.· To evaluate changes from baseline in the Lung
      Cancer Symptom Scale of patients in each treatment arm.

        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.

        Main criteria are listed hereafter:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC istologic subtypes may
             include large cell, squamous cell, or adenocarcinoma or a generic cytological
             diagnosis of NSCLC;

          -  Patients must have a locoregionally advanced unresectable non metastatic NSCLC Stage
             IIIB (only N3 supraclavicular or T4 for pleural effusion) or Stage IV according to the
             revised International Staging System

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion;

          -  Previous radical surgery (more 30 days before study entry) is allowed but a pathologic
             proof of progression of neoplastic disease must be documented whenever possible;

          -  Weight loss &lt; = 5% within the last 3 months;

          -  Laboratory requirements at entry :

               -  Blood cell counts: Absolute neutrophils &gt; 2.0 x 109/LPlatelets &gt; 100 x
                  109/LHemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dl

               -  Renal function:Serum creatinine &lt; 1 upper normal limits (UNL). In case of limit
                  value of serum creatinine, the creatinine clearance should be &gt; 60 mL/min

               -  Hepatic functions:Serum bilirubin &lt; 1 x UNLASAT and ALAT &lt; 2.5 x UNLAlkaline

             treatments;

          -  Prior radiotherapy for NSCLC;

          -  Cyto-histological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, carcinoid, or mixed small-cell

          -  Patients with not measurable disease only;

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases or with leptomeningeal disease. However;
             patients with symptomatic brain metastases who become asymptomatic under
             corticosteriods treatment can enter the study;

          -  History of prior malignancies, except for cured non melanoma skin cancer, curatively
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to polysorbate 80;

          -  Pregnant or lactating women (women of childbearing potential must use adequate
             contraception);

          -  Concurrent treatment with other experimental drugs;

          -  Current peripheral neuropathy NCI grade &gt; = 2;

          -  Significant neurological or psychiatric disorders;

          -  Hepatic functions abnormalities;

          -  Participation in clinical trials with other experimental agents within 30 days of
             study entry;

          -  Other serious concomitant illness of medical conditions;

          -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including demential or
             seizures;

          -  Active infection requiring iv antibiotics;

          -  Active ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or other contra-indication to corticotherapy;

          -  Any other condition, which in the judgement of the investigator would place the
             subject at, undoes risk or interferes with the study.

          -  Treatment with biphosphonates.
