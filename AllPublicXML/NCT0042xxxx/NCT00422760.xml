      Boerhaave's syndrome represents a diagnostic dilemma for the physician. Boerhaave's syndrome
      is an uncommon condition where there is oesophageal rupture following forceful vomiting. We
      report a case of spontaneous rupture of the esophagus in 75-year-old male with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease who was referred to our hospital with acute onset of
      breathlessness. The absence of vomiting prior to presentation is the distinguishing feature
      of this particular case.
