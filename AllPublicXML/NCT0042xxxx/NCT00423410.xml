      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic effects of a
      novel anti-cancer drug, EPC2407, administered to patients with advanced cancer which have not
      responded to or have recurred following treatment with available therapies

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and
      pharmacodynamic study of EPC2407 administered intravenously over 60 minutes on a QDx3
      schedule repeated every 21 days. Patients are enrolled and dosed at the level defined by the
      escalation scheme. The primary goal of the study design is to assess toxicity at the fixed
      dose levels according to the modified Fibonacci schema.

             on standard therapies, for which effective therapy is not available or for patients
             who are unwilling to undergo such therapies.

          2. Males and Females at least 18 years of age

          3. Laboratory data as specified below (according to the site's clinical laboratory ranges
             for normal):

             9 gm/L ii. Hepatic: Direct bilirubin &lt;1.5 X ULN; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 X ULN. For patients with known liver metastases

             &lt; 5.0 X ULN iii. Renal: serum creatinine WNL or creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min

          4. 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT intervals: QTc ≤ 450 msec for men and ≤ 470 msec
             for women.

          5. Estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          6. ECOG Performance Status &lt; or = 1

          8. For men and women of child-producing potential - willingness to employ appropriate
             contraceptive methods (including abstinence) during the study

          9. Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent
             and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information, and agree to
             abide by the study restrictions and to return for the required assessments

         10. Cardiac ejection fraction ≥50% by 2D Echocardiogram or &gt; institutional lower limits of
             normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or nursing

          2. Radiotherapy or any chemotherapy within the previous 21 days or five half lives of
             prior drug (whichever is shorter). See also exclusion #4 below for patients at risk
             for cardiac toxicity. Recovery to Grade 1 or less from chemotherapy-induced toxic
             effect, except alopecia, is required.
