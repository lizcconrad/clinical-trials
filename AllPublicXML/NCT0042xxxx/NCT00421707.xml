    <measure>Mean Global Improvement Scale (GIS) Responder Rate Over the Last Four Weeks by Regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 105 (weeks 3-6 in period 1, weeks 12-15 in period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The GIS is comprised of ten questions, all rated on a seven point scale ranging from substantially worse (7) to substantially improved (1). GIS assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening) as assessed by the clinician on a 7-point scale: 1: very much improved; 2: much improved; 3: minimally improved; 4: no change; 5: minimally worse; 6: much worse; or 7: very much worse for diarrhea, constipation, stool frequency, stool consistency, urgency, bloating, incomplete evacuation, and straining. Values reported are less than the minimum score on scale as the rate is the proportion of the last four weeks that the participant is a responder.</description>

    <measure>Ratings on Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBSQoL) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 105 (weeks 3-6 in period 1, weeks 12-15 in period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The IBSQoL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to IBS that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBSQoL consists of 30 statements about bowel problems, which formed 9 scales: emotional health, mental health, health belief, sleep, energy, physical functioning, diet, social role, physical role and sexual relation. All 9 scales were rated on a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). Scores for individual items were averaged to obtain a total score for each subscale of IBSQoL. Then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS-specific quality of life. Transformed scale score = (raw score - lowest possible scale score)/ (scale range) X 100. The data presented for individual scale.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvements in Pain and Discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 105 (weeks 3-6 in period 1, weeks 12-15 in period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with improvements in pain and discomfort on GIS were presented. GIS assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening) as assessed by the clinician on a 7-point scale: 1: very much improved; 2: much improved; 3: minimally improved; 4: no change; 5: minimally worse; 6: much worse; or 7: very much worse on specified time points. Responder = Yes if A responder answered either 'moderately improved' or 'substantially improved'.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pain Severity Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Day 105 (weeks 3-6 in period 1, weeks 12-15 in period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity scores from the 11-point scale and it's corresponding change from Baseline scores was summarized by treatment group for the last 4 weeks (i.e. weeks 3-6 and Weeks 12-15) of treatment period. Scale from 0 to 10, 0 meaning no pain, 10 worst possible pain. Lower values represent a better outcome. Day 1 was considered as Baseline. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline value from specified time point value. Reported data values are lesser than minimum score on scale as change from Baseline is reported.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Anxiety and/or Depression on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 105 (weeks 3-6 in period 1, weeks 12-15 in period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>HAD Scale was used to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression in participants. There were 14 questions. Seven questions related to depression and seven questions related to anxiety. Participants rated the severity of symptoms in the answer to each question. There were four options in each answer, from which participants had to select one. Responses were scored on a scale of 0, 1, 2 or 3, where 0 indicated best and 3 indicated worse. Total score ranged from 0-42 where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher scores indicated higher anxiety/depression complains. This questionnaire was completed at screening, and all study visits.</description>

        <title>Ratings on Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life (IBSQoL) Scale</title>
        <description>The IBSQoL is a self-report quality-of-life measure specific to IBS that can be used to assess the impact of IBS and its treatment. The IBSQoL consists of 30 statements about bowel problems, which formed 9 scales: emotional health, mental health, health belief, sleep, energy, physical functioning, diet, social role, physical role and sexual relation. All 9 scales were rated on a five-point response scale ranging from 1 (always) to 5 (never). Scores for individual items were averaged to obtain a total score for each subscale of IBSQoL. Then transformed to a 0-100 scale for ease of interpretation with higher scores indicating better IBS-specific quality of life. Transformed scale score = (raw score - lowest possible scale score)/ (scale range) X 100. The data presented for individual scale.</description>

        <description>Number of participants with improvements in pain and discomfort on GIS were presented. GIS assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening) as assessed by the clinician on a 7-point scale: 1: very much improved; 2: much improved; 3: minimally improved; 4: no change; 5: minimally worse; 6: much worse; or 7: very much worse on specified time points. Responder = Yes if A responder answered either 'moderately improved' or 'substantially improved'.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Improvements in Bowel Function and Changes in Individual Bowel Symptoms/Function</title>
          <description>The GIS comprised of ten questions, all rated on a seven point scale ranging from substantially worse (7) to substantially improved (1). GIS assesses the participant's improvement (or worsening) as assessed by the clinician on a 7-point scale: 1: very much improved; 2: much improved; 3: minimally improved; 4: no change; 5: minimally worse; 6: much worse; or 7: very much worse. Number of participants who showed improvement and changes on the scale were presented. Participants were counted as &quot;Yes&quot; if they scored 1-3, and as &quot;No&quot; if they scored 4-7.</description>

        <title>Summary of Anxiety and/or Depression on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)</title>
        <description>HAD Scale was used to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety and depression in participants. There were 14 questions. Seven questions related to depression and seven questions related to anxiety. Participants rated the severity of symptoms in the answer to each question. There were four options in each answer, from which participants had to select one. Responses were scored on a scale of 0, 1, 2 or 3, where 0 indicated best and 3 indicated worse. Total score ranged from 0-42 where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher scores indicated higher anxiety/depression complains. This questionnaire was completed at screening, and all study visits.</description>
