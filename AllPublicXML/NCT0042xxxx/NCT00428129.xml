    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria include:

          -  Patients with radiographically-confirmed acute proximal DVT

        Exclusion Criteria include:

          -  Isolated calf or popliteal vein DVT, based on duplex ultrasound

          -  Thrombus involving the inferior vena cava (IVC)

          -  Proximal (e.g. cranial) aspect of thrombus cannot be adequately assessed to level of
             the iliac veins or inferior vena cava, based on duplex ultrasound.

          -  Cannot traverse the target vessel segment with guidewire

          -  Symptomatic pulmonary embolism is present at time of presentation

          -  Documented history of prior DVT in target extremity

          -  History of anticoagulants administered for &gt; 30 days for undocumented/ unclear reason
             (e.g. for reasons other than presence of mechanical cardiac valve, atrial
             fibrillation, etc.)

          -  Documented history of thrombophilic disorder, with diagnosis established via previous
             objective testing (e.g. familial screening for thrombophilia).

          -  Cannot receive standard secondary prevention pharmacotherapy [i.e. heparin or LMWH and
             vitamin K antagonists (VKA)] due to contraindications to anticoagulation [e.g. known
             bleeding diathesis, thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 100,000 mm3), heparin induced
             thrombocytopenia (HIT), known allergy to heparin or warfarin]

          -  Absolute contraindication to thrombolytic therapy

          -  Previous central nervous system haemorrhage

          -  Life expectancy less than 1 year, due to other comorbid condition.

          -  Previous intervention in target limb to address venous thrombus.

          -  Target limb has chronic venous insufficiency of C4 or greater severity

          -  Acute or chronic symptomatic musculoskeletal condition in target limb (e.g. trauma,
             fracture, severe arthritis).

          -  Documented patent foramen ovale or other right-to-left cardiac shunt.

          -  Absolute contraindication to contrast media or renal insufficiency (baseline
             creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL).
