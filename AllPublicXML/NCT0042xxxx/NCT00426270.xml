  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Octagam is a solvent/detergent-treated human normal immunoglobulin (IGIV) solution for
      intravenous administration. Octagam 5% is currently registered in about 80 countries. This
      study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Octagam 10% in Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura
      (ITP) in adults. As Octagam 10% is essentially similar to Octagam 5%, it is expected that
      Octagam 10% is as efficacious and safe (in respect to viral safety) as Octagam 5%.

      The primary objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy of Octagam® 10% in
      correcting platelet count. The blood count as well as laboratory chemistry were checked
      repeatedly up to day 21.

      The secondary objective of the study was to investigate the safety of Octagam® 10%. Safety
      was assessed by monitoring vital signs, evaluating adverse events, assessing laboratory
      parameters, and by viral safety testing.

    <time_frame>Day 2 to the end of the study (Day 63)</time_frame>

    <measure>Duration of the Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 to the end of the study (Day 63)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of the clinical response was the number of days that the platelet count remained ≥ 50*10^9/L. Platelet count was assessed on Days 2 through 7 and on Days 14, 21, and 63. A conservative method was used to calculate the duration of the clinical response. For example, if the platelet count was ≥ 50*10^9/L on Day 7 and dropped below 50*10^9/L at Day 14, Day 7 was used as the last day to calculate the duration of the clinical response. The same procedure was used if the platelet count dropped below 50*10^9/L at Day 21 from Day 14 or Day 63 from Day 21.</description>

    <description>The investigator evaluated the severity of bleeding using the following rating scale: None (definitely no haemorrhage of any kind), Minor (few petechiae [≤ 100 total] and/or ≤ 5 small bruises [≤ 3 cm diameter], no mucosal bleeding), Mild (many petechiae [&gt; 100 total] and/or &gt; 5 large bruises [&gt; 3 cm diameter], no mucosal bleeding), Moderate (overt mucosal bleeding [epistaxis, gum bleeding, oropharyngeal blood blisters, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding, etc] that does not require immediate medical attention or intervention).</description>

        <title>Duration of the Clinical Response</title>
        <description>The duration of the clinical response was the number of days that the platelet count remained ≥ 50*10^9/L. Platelet count was assessed on Days 2 through 7 and on Days 14, 21, and 63. A conservative method was used to calculate the duration of the clinical response. For example, if the platelet count was ≥ 50*10^9/L on Day 7 and dropped below 50*10^9/L at Day 14, Day 7 was used as the last day to calculate the duration of the clinical response. The same procedure was used if the platelet count dropped below 50*10^9/L at Day 21 from Day 14 or Day 63 from Day 21.</description>
