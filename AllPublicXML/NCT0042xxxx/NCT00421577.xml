  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a simple laboratory technique for localization of caries associated bacteria on
      tooth surfaces by taking an impression of the teeth with a material containing sucrose.

      The purpose of this study is to check whether the technique can be incorporated into dental
      clinics as diagnostic tool comparing to other diagnostic methods available.
