  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study was to determine the incidence of increased serum aminotransferase
      concentrations (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or aspartate aminotransferase [AST]), as
      well as the overall safety and tolerability of ambrisentan, in participants with pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH), idiopathic PAH (IPAH), or familial PAH (FPAH) who had previously
      discontinued ERA therapy (bosentan or sitaxsentan) due to increased serum ALT or AST
      concentrations.

        <description>The SF-36 Health Survey is a self-reporting, multi-item scale measuring 8 health concepts: 1) physical functioning, 2) role limitations due to physical health problems, 3) bodily pain, 4) general health, 5) vitality (energy/fatigue), 6) social functioning, 7) role limitations due to emotional problems and 8) mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). Each item is scored from 0 to 100 (least healthy to most healthy).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) analysis set was defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postdose efficacy value.</population>
