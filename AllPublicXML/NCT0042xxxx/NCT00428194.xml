      RATIONALE: Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Erlotinib and
      cisplatin may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving erlotinib together
      with cisplatin and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib when
      given together with cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients with stage IB, stage
      II, stage III, or stage IVA cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when administered with
           cisplatin and pelvic radiotherapy in patients with stage IB-IVA squamous cell carcinoma
           of the cervix.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-35 and cisplatin IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for
      approximately 5 weeks concurrently with chemotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose proceeding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks.
