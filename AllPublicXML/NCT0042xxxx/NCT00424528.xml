    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of arformoterol twice a day
      and tiotropium once a day (dosed sequentially) versus tiotropium once a day alone in subjects
      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

      This study is a multicenter, randomized, modified-blind, double-dummy two-week parallel-group
      efficacy and safety study of arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution twice daily,
      tiotropium inhalation powder once daily and arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution twice
      daily and tiotropium inhalation powder once daily (dosed sequentially) in subjects with COPD.
      This study was previously posted by Sepracor Inc. In October 2009, Sepracor Inc. was acquired
      by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma., and in October 2010, Sepracor Inc's name was changed to
