  <brief_title>Study of Zoledronic Acid Administered Monthly Versus Every 3 Months in Multiple Myeloma and Breast Cancer Patients Who Were Treated With Zoledronic Acid the Prior Year</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Stratified, Randomized, Open-label, Multi-center Comparative 2-arm Trial of PK, PD, and Safety of Zoledronic Acid Infusions Administered Monthly vs. Every 3-month, in Multiple Myeloma Patients With Malignant Bone Lesions, and Breast Cancer Patients With Bone Metastasis, Who Have Received 9-12* Doses of Zoledronic Acid Over the Prior Year. (*Amendment 1 Changed the Required Doses to 9-20 But Due to FDA Guidelines, the Title Has Not Been Changed)</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the repeat-dose pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile of zoledronic acid when administered every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks, in patients
      treated with 9-20 infusions of zoledronic acid during the previous 10-15 months.
