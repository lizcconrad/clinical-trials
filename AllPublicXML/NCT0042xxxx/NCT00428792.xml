    <measure>Fremdbeurteilungsbogen für Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-Hyperaktivitätsstörungen (FBB-AHDS) Teacher Rating in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Friday of each of the 2 treatment weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The FBB-ADHS is a 20-item rating scale. Each item describes a typical ADHD symptom. The 20 items are divided into 3 subscales: Attention deficits (9 items), hyperactivity (7 items), and impulsiveness (4 items). Each item is rated on a scale of 0 = not at all up to 3 = very much. The FBB-ADHS was completed by teachers on Friday afternoon of each week of the study. A total score (sum of all items divided by 20) was calculated. The total score can range from 0 to 3. A lower score indicates more ADHD.</description>

    <measure>10-Minute Math Test - Problems Attempted</measure>
    <time_frame>Saturday of each of the 2 treatment weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-Minute Math Test is a paper and pencil test consisting of several pages of math problems requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication and division calculations presented in ascending order of difficulty during a 10-minute period. Test difficulty was altered for subjects at different skill levels and ages. The number of problems attempted is an objective measure related to &quot;academic productivity&quot;. The math test was carried out on the Saturday visit at the end of each of the 2 treatment weeks under supervision of a teacher who had been trained on this test.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) Scale Score - Physician Rating of Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Saturday of each of the 2 treatment weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a scale to assess the global severity of illness. The rating is determined by the investigator answering one question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; Ratings are on a 7-point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients. The rating is based upon the average observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days.</description>

    <time_frame>Saturday of each of the 2 treatment weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a scale to assess improvement (change in state) of illness. The rating is based on the investigator answering one question: &quot;Compared to the patient's condition prior to medication, this patient's condition is: 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.&quot; The investigator compares the patient's overall clinical condition to the 1 week period just prior to the initiation of medication.</description>

        <title>Fremdbeurteilungsbogen für Aufmerksamkeitsdefizit-Hyperaktivitätsstörungen (FBB-AHDS) Teacher Rating in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population</title>
        <description>The FBB-ADHS is a 20-item rating scale. Each item describes a typical ADHD symptom. The 20 items are divided into 3 subscales: Attention deficits (9 items), hyperactivity (7 items), and impulsiveness (4 items). Each item is rated on a scale of 0 = not at all up to 3 = very much. The FBB-ADHS was completed by teachers on Friday afternoon of each week of the study. A total score (sum of all items divided by 20) was calculated. The total score can range from 0 to 3. A lower score indicates more ADHD.</description>

        <description>The FBB-ADHS is a 20-item rating scale. Each item describes a typical ADHD symptom. The 20 items are divided into 3 subscales: Attention deficits (9 items), hyperactivity (7 items), and impulsiveness (4 items). Each item is rated on a scale of 0 = not at all up to 3 = very much. The FBB-ADHS was completed by teachers on Friday afternoon of each week of the study. A total score (sum of all items divided by 20) was calculated. The total score can range from 0 to 3. A lower score indicates more ADHD.</description>

        <description>The 10-Minute Math Test is a paper and pencil test consisting of several pages of math problems requiring addition, subtraction, multiplication and division calculations presented in ascending order of difficulty during a 10-minute period. Test difficulty was altered for subjects at different skill levels and ages. The number of problems attempted is an objective measure related to “academic productivity”. The math test was carried out on the Saturday visit at the end of each of the 2 treatment weeks under supervision of a teacher who had been trained on this test.</description>
