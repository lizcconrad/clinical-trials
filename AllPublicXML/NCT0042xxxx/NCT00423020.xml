      The EPOC-AMI study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of systemic administration of
      erythropoietin for inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia after stent implantation in the
      patients with acute myocardial infarction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stents coated with sirolimus or paclitaxel have been shown to significantly reduce restenosis
      in selected coronary lesions. However, the potential risk of late stent thrombosis forces
      prolonged treatment of dual anti-platelet regimen to all the patients after implantation of
      drug eluting stents. Patients with acute myocardial infarction may have uncertain clinical
      characteristics, such as occult bleeding focus or further need for surgical procedures. Thus,
      bare metal stent is considerably alternative for primary PCI after AMI and there remain an
      appreciable number of patients at risk for restenosis. Use of systemic pharmacological
      therapy to inhibit coronary stent restenosis of bare metal stent has been largely
      unsuccessful. We have reported that erythropoietin could enhance reendothelialization leading
      to inhibition of in-stent restenosis by directly protecting endothelial apoptosis and
      mobilizing endothelial progenitors. The EPOC-AMI study is designed to assess the safety and
      the efficacy of systemic administration of erythropoietin aiming inhibition of neointimal
      hyperplasia after stent implantation in the patients with acute myocardial infarction.
