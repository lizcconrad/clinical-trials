  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assesss the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine based on Modified Vaccinia
      Ankara (MVA) expressing the 85A antigen (from Mycobacterium. tuberculosis). This vaccine is
      delivered intrdermally by a needle injection in healthy volunteers.

      1. This is a phase I study to assesss the safety and immunogenicity a recombinant MVA
           encoding a secreted antigen from Mycobacterium. tuberculosis Antigen 85A, delivered
           intrdermally by a needle injection in healthy BCG naive volunteers.

        2. Selection of volunteers

           Volunteers for the study will be recruited through advertisements. Each volunteer will
           have received an information sheet concerning the study and will have agreed to
           participate in writing. Volunteers will be given at least 48 hours between reading the
           information leaflet and agreeing to participate. Female volunteers will be told of the
           theoretical risk of congenital anomaly should they become pregnant during the study and
           only those who undertake to take precautions to avoid pregnancy during the study period
           will be eligible. Volunteers will give signed consent for their GP’s to be notified
           about their participation in the trial. The GP will be faxed a letter on the day of
           screening and asked to reply if they know of a reason why the volunteer should not take
           part. The signed consent form will also be faxed with the letter.

        3. Screening

           Volunteers will be asked to sign the informed consent form for screening. The following
           will be performed:

             -  Laboratory evaluations – including clinical chemistry, haematology, HLA typing,
                anti-vaccinia antibodies, anti-HBV antibodies, anti-HCV antibodies, anti-HIV
                antibodies

             -  Heaf test – to exclude prior exposure to TB

             6. Confirmed pregnancy

             7. Previous MVA immunisations

        6. Withdrawal Criteria

             1. Withdrawal of consent by subject for any reason

             2. Loss to follow-up

             3. Non-compliance with study procedures

             4. Protocol violation

             5. Serious adverse event (as defined in Appendix 3)

             6. Any other reason at discretion of the Principal Investigator

             7. Confirmed pregnancy during study period

                7 Immunisation

                On Day 0 and Day 21, subjects will receive a single intradermal injection of 5 x
                107pfu in 0.1ml over the deltoid muscle. Subjects will be observed for an hour
                after all immunisations. Vital signs will be monitored at 30 and 60 minutes
                post-immunisation. Local reactions at the site of administration will be evaluated
                at 60 minutes.

                A photograph of the injection site may be taken at 48 hours (with written consent).
                The injection site will be reviewed 7 days after each immunization.

                Blood will be taken at the following time points: At the screening visit*, prior to
                the first vaccination, *1 week after the first vaccination, prior to the second
                vaccination, *1 week after the second vaccination, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, *12 weeks and
                24 weeks after the second vaccination. Up to 55 mls will be taken at any one time
                with the total being no more than 500 mls over the study period. *Samples taken on
                these dates will be tested for full blood count and biochemical screen.
                Immunological assays will be performed at all time points to determine vaccine
                immunogenicity. A pregnancy test will be performed on screening and each
                vaccination day prior to vaccination for female volunteers. Peripheral blood
                mononuclear cells will be prepared for cellular immunological assays to be
                performed without or following cryopreservation. Other serological measures of
                immune response, i.e. antibody titres, will be assayed on frozen plasma samples.

                At the end of the six month follow-up period, volunteers will be offered BCG
                immunisation. If they accept, imunological monitering will continue for a further
                six months. 50mls of blood will be taken for cellular immunological assays 1 week,
                2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months and 6 months after BCG immunisation.

                All blood tests will be taken within 1-3 days of the due date as described in the
                schedule above.

                8 Endpoints

                The occurance and severity of local side-effects. The occurance and severity of
                systemic side-effects. The induction of T cell responses (as measured by an
                interferon-gamma Elispot assay).

                Proliferation assays and cytotoxic T cell assays will be performed on strong CD4+
                and CD8+ responses respectively.

                This study has been completed.
