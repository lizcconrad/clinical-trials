  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify the genes that contribute to susceptibility to
      recurrent/persistent middle ear disease. Five hundred families with at least 2 children who
      have undergone tympanostomy tube insertion will be enrolled. A blood sample will be obtained
      from the children who had tubes and any available parent (at least 1), as well as any
      siblings without significant histories of middle ear disease.

      Using the twin study approach, the investigators demonstrated that time with middle ear
      effusion (MEE), number of episodes of MEE and numbers of episodes of acute otitis media (AOM)
      have a strong genetic component. The point estimate of heritability of time with MEE was
      0.73. While there is significant evidence that susceptibility to recurrent/persistent OM is
      largely genetically determined, the specific genes which confer susceptibility are unknown.
      The overall research strategy to identify genes underlying OM is to apply a three-stage study
      design that will allow the investigators to balance cost efficiency with statistical power.
      Five hundred evaluable pairs of siblings with a history of tympanostomy tube insertion
      (affected), their parent(s) and available non-affected full siblings will be recruited. A
      blood sample will be obtained from each subject for genotyping.
