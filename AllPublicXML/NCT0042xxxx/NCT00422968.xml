      The primary objective of the PRE-COMBAT trial is:

      To establish the safety and effectiveness of coronary stenting with the sirolimus-eluting
      balloon expandable stent (Cordis Johnson &amp; Johnson, Warren, New Jersey) compared with bypass
      surgery for the treatment of an unprotected LMCA stenosis. The alternative hypothesis is that
      the experimental strategy (coronary stenting with the sirolimus-eluting stents) is not
      inferior to the standard strategy (bypass surgery).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite bypass surgery has been considered as the standard strategy for the treatment of
      unprotected left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesions, several studies have demonstrated that
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the unprotected LMCA is feasible and appears to
      be an alternative strategy in selected patients. However, the safety and efficacy of PCI in
      patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis are still a matter of debate.

      Previous studies have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of unprotected LMCA
      intervention using bare metal stents (BMS). There was a favorable initial outcome after LMCA
      intervention using BMS in low-risk patients. However, in-stent restenosis after BMS
      implantation has emerged as the interference to widely perform PCI for unprotected LMCA
      lesions and the most important reason for selection of bypass surgery as the first choice for
      treating LMCA stenosis. In-stent restenosis in these patients not only influences long-term
      survival, but also make repeat intervention more complex. Despite endeavors to decrease
      in-stent restenosis after LMCA intervention using BMS, such as aggressive debulking
      atherectomy, the restenosis rate still remains at 20-30%. The sirolimus-eluting stent (SES)
      (Cypher, Cordis, Johnson &amp; Johnson Corp, Miami, Florida) markedly decreases in-stent
      restenosis in elective patients with relatively simple coronary lesions. In real-world
      practice using SES, patients undergoing SES implantation were treated with a less restrictive
      interventional approach. However, the results are very promising similar to the randomized
      controlled trials. These findings warrant new studies to compare the efficacy of SES for more
      complex lesion subsets including LMCA disease with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).
