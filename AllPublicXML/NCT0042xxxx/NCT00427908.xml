  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has 2 phases, a vaccination phase and a long-term follow-up phase. In the
      vaccination phase of this study, the new meningococcal vaccine 134612 will be evaluated in
      children using Mencevax™ ACWY (in children above 2 years) or Meningitec™ (in children below 2
      years) as controls. In the long-term follow-up phase of the study, the long-term protection
      offered by the vaccines will be assessed up to 5 years after vaccination.

      Subjects will be randomized in the primary vaccination phase of the study; no new subjects
      will be enrolled during the long-term follow-up phase of the study.

      Subjects will be enrolled in 3 age strata. Subjects including and above two years of age will
      receive either GSK Biologicals meningococcal vaccine 134612 or Mencevax™ ACWY, subjects below
      two years of age will receive either GSK Biologicals meningococcal vaccine 134612 or
      Meningitec™. All subjects will have 7 blood samples taken: prior and one month after
      vaccination and one, two, three, four and five years after vaccination.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act,
      September 2007.
