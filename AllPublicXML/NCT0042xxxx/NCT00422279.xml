    <textblock>
      Common complications encountered when replacing missing teeth with Endosseous dental implants
      include lack of adequate bone volume limiting the possibility of optimal patient treatment.
      Typical limitations include severely resorbed alveolar ridges (height and width) in patients
      following long-term edentulism. In other cases, the alveolar ridge may have become
      compromised due to advanced periodontal disease, traumatic extractions, and other trauma
      disallowing Endosseous dental implant placement to meet aesthetic and functional demands.
      Conversely, placing Endosseous dental implants to optimally meet aesthetic and functional
      demands in sites exhibiting alveolar ridge aberrations often results in partial exposure of
      the Endosseous dental implant bone-anchoring surface. In some cases clinicians have attempted
      to overcome the deficient bone volume by augmenting the anticipated Endosseous dental implant
      site using bone biomaterials, commonly originating from human or animal cadaveric sources, or
      synthetic biomaterials. The biomaterials have been used alone and in combinations including
      autologous bone grafts. Non-resorbable and bioresorbable barrier devices have been used to
      prevent dislocation of implanted biomaterials. The ability of the Bone Inductive Implant to
      form new bone above the level of the resorbed alveolar ridge to immerse the exposed portion
      of the Endosseous dental implant in bone (Treatment group 1) and the ability of the Bone
      Inductive Implant to induce bone formation around stable Endosseous dental implants placed
      into tooth extraction sockets (Treatment group 2) without the use of bone grafts, bone
      biomaterials, or barrier devices will be assessed.

    <measure>Primary Endpoint Was to Assess Implant Stability of the Implants( 4 Patients in Two Groups With a Total of 8 Implants) at Baseline and After 3 Months of Submerged Healing and After 6 Months of Prosthetic Loading</measure>
    <time_frame>Implant insertion, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The following success criteria for the primary endpoint have been adopted and apply to both treatment groups. 1.The implant stability (ISQ) was recorded by means of resonance frequency analysis (RFA) at implant insertion, 3 months and after 6 months of loading 2. radiographic and computed tomography analyses shall not show any signs of peri-implant radiolucency at the 3 and 6 month time point 3. implant stability after 3 months shall allow tightening to 35Ncm without implant rotation by using a torque wrench</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Showing Bone Growth With rhBMP-2 (15 and 30 µg Per Implant)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint of the study was to assess the minimum dose of rhBMP2 eliciting bone growth.The secondary endpoint was assessed by measuring using a probe the quantity of any newly formed bone 1.in the group where implants were placed in the supra alveolar position the treatment is successful if the bone exceeds 1.5 mm above the initial alveolar bone level in all measured points 1. in the group where implants were placed in extraction sockets the treatment is successful if the gap between the implant body and the extraction socket is filled with Bone.
Safety dose used:- In the dog model; seroma formation was extensive with higher rhBMP-2 concentrations (3.0 and 4.0 mg/mL.Seromas was also significant in the dog model for the 0.75 and 1.5 mg/mL rhBMP-2 concentrations, hence a minimum dose of 15 and 30 µg per implants was chosen)</description>

        <title>Primary Endpoint Was to Assess Implant Stability of the Implants( 4 Patients in Two Groups With a Total of 8 Implants) at Baseline and After 3 Months of Submerged Healing and After 6 Months of Prosthetic Loading</title>
        <description>The following success criteria for the primary endpoint have been adopted and apply to both treatment groups. 1.The implant stability (ISQ) was recorded by means of resonance frequency analysis (RFA) at implant insertion, 3 months and after 6 months of loading 2. radiographic and computed tomography analyses shall not show any signs of peri-implant radiolucency at the 3 and 6 month time point 3. implant stability after 3 months shall allow tightening to 35Ncm without implant rotation by using a torque wrench</description>
