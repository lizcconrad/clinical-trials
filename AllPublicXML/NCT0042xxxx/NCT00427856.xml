  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defects in the apoptotic process can lead to the onset of cancer by allowing cells to grow
      unchecked when an oncogenic signal is present. Obatoclax is designed to restore apoptosis
      through inhibition of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, thereby reinstating the natural process
      of cell death that is often inhibited in cancer cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase II study of obatoclax administered alone as a
      weekly, 3-hour or 24-hour infusion for 12 weeks followed by a combination with rituximab to
      patients with previously-untreated Follicular Lymphoma. For purposes of clinical evaluations,
      treatment cycles will occur in 4-week periods. Treatment may be administered on an outpatient
      basis. No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described may be
      administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy.
