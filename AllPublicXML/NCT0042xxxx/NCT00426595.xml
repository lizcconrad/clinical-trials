  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease and reflux-esophagitis are a major chronic problem in most
      children with cerebral palsy and mental retardation. Oral administration of enteric-coated
      formulations of the acid-labile proton pump inhibitor omeprazole is often problematic in
      these patients who may be suffering from swallowing disorders. A suspension of omeprazole in
      a sodium bicarbonate solution is often used for administration via the gastrostomy tube. This
      trial aims to compare the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole administered through the gastrostomy
      tube as a suspension in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy and mental retardation versus
      the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole administered as a multi-unit-pellet system (MUPSÂ®). The
      crossover study will consist of 2 consecutive treatment periods of 14 days.
