  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine, in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:

        1. Whether glycemic control can be achieved at least as effectively with an insulin regimen
           involving pre-meal EXUBERA™ (inhaled insulin) plus a single bedtime Ultralente injection
           as with a conventional subcutaneous insulin regimen involving 2 mixed Regular/NPH
           insulin injections per day.

        2. The toleration and safety of EXUBERA™ (inhaled insulin) therapy and its effects after 6
           months, if any, on measures of pulmonary function.
