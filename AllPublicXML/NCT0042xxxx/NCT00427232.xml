  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelin is a hormon that causes acute and chronic narrowing of heart vessels. The purpose
      of this study is to assess whether suppression of this activity by using two types of
      receptor antagonists can reduce this effect and thus improve blood supply of the heart
      muscle.

      Endothelin (ET) is the most potent vasoconstrictor known and plays a major role in the
      development of coronary artery disease as well as in acute vasoconstriction. This effect is
      mainly mediated by the vascular ET-A receptor, whereas the ET-B receptor mediates
      vasodilation and cleavage of ET. Currently, there are both selective ET-A antagonists and
      non-selective ET-A and ET-B antagonists under investigation. The aim of the study is to test
      the effect of ET-receptor blockade on the vasoreagibility of epicardial and intramyocardial
      coronary arteries in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. We randomly use the
      selective ET-A receptor BQ-123 (Group A) and the combination of BQ-123 and the ET-B receptor
      antagonist BQ-788 (Group B). The tested infusion will be applied selectively into the
      assessed coronary artery by a special infusion catheter. To evaluate the morphometric changes
      we use quantitative coronary angiography to measure the diameter of the coronary artery
      before and after intracoronary infusion of the tested substances. Furthermore we will use
      Pressure Wire to measure the hemodynamic conditions before and after infusion, thus
      evaluating the epicardial and the intramyocardial blood perfusion.

      Comparison: Coronary artery diameter as measured by quantitative angiography (minimal lumen
      diameter) and parameters indicative of epicardial and intramyocardial blood flow as
      determined by Pressure Wire (fractional flow reserver, coronary flow reserve, intramyocardial
      resistance) before and after ET-antagonist infusion will be compared.
