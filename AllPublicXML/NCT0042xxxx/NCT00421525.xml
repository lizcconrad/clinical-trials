  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label, multi-center study conducted in patients with recurrent or
      refractory multiple myeloma who have failed at least two prior standard systemic treatments.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receive hLL1 administered intravenously twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating doses of hLL1 in order to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for this administration schedule. Up to approximately 30
      additional patients will be entered at one or more dose levels at or below the MTD in order
      to determine the optimal dose for subsequent studies.
