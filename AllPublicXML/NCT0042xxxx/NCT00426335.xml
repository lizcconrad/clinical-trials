  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether a group CBT intervention is effective in
      reducing psychological distress in women with primary breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of cancer is associated with high levels of psychological
      distress, which can be long-term in duration. The end of adjuvant therapy can be a time which
      patients find anxiety provoking; as concerns of recurrence and how to return to life after
      treatment often arise at this juncture.

      Cognitive behaviour therapy has demonstrated efficacy in reducing anxiety and depression in
      people with cancer on a 1:1 basis. The CBT model has been shown to be significantly more
      beneficial than supportive counselling. Therapy delivered in groups is considered desirable
      because of its cost effectiveness, and its potential to confer additional benefits in terms
      of peer support, reduced isolation and modelling of adaptive strategies by other group
      members.

      No studies have looked at the changes in participants health beliefs and beliefs about their
      ability to copy (self-efficacy) with stress and tolerance of uncertainty following group CBT
      and the relationship with psychological distress.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate a GCBT programme intervention against a waiting list
      control and to examine its effects on health beliefs, self-efficacy, coping, tolerance of
      uncertainty and psychological distress in women with early diagnosed breast cancer.
