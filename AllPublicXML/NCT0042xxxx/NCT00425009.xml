    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is health threats worldwide. However, treatment of this disease is limited by
      availability of effective medicines. All of the existing oral hypoglycemic agents have
      secondary failure after long term administration. Thus, new oral medicines are needed for
      long term control of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. In diabetes care,
      dietary approaches have drawn more and more attention in the prevention and treatment of
      hyperglycemia. Generally regarded as safe (GRAS) plants have been widely used for their
      benefits in antioxidation, anti-inflammation, anticancer, anti-obesity and anti-diabetes.
      Numerous botanical products such as pigments that include anthocyanins and flavonoids have
      been consumed or studied for anti-obesity and anti-diabetes. However, most of these botanical
      products are mixtures of multiple compounds. It is difficult to control their quality in the
      study or production. Up to now, as a single purified compound, berberine is demonstrated to
      have hypoglycemic effect in vitro and in vivo. Berberine is the main active component of
      Coptis chinensis French, which was used for thousands of years in China in the treatment of
      human diseases including diabetes.

      Comparison(s): Effects of berberine compared with metformin in newly diagnosed type 2
      diabetic patients.
