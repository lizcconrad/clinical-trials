  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) fluctuation may be significantly associated with the
      progression of glaucomatous visual field loss, even in patients kept always low IOP after
      triple procedure, an effective approach for patients with coexisting glaucoma and visually
      significant cataracts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies reported that lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) slowed the advancement of
      visual field damage in glaucoma patients. However, even if the IOP can been substantially
      lowered, reduction of mean and peak IOP does not always prevent visual field progression.We
      believe that the long-term IOP fluctuation may play a significant role in visual field
      deterioration in those patients.
