  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the efficacy of 70% trichloroacetic acid on atrophic scars of
      varicella
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      high concentration trichloroacetic acid peeling has been shown to be effective in treating
      and flattening the atrophic acne scars. According to the lack of an effective and low cost
      therapy for removing these relative common and nuisance lesions; We aimed to answer that
      whether we could achieve the same results from 70% TCA on atrophic varicella scars.
