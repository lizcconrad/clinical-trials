  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Isolated uni or bilateral mild cerebral ventriculomegaly represents the most frequent “minor”
      cerebral anomalies discovered by antenatal echography. There are not French data making it
      possible to specify the incidence and the prevalence of this pathology and international data
      of the prevalence are very heterogeneous, going, according to the published series, of 1.48
      to 22 per 1000 births.

      The prognostic of ventriculomegaly remains dubious : the studies have small populations, are
      for the majority retrospectives with a short and often vague follow-up. The announced rate of
      after-effects varies between 0 and 48 %.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the neuropsychological development until the 5
      years age of the children for whom a prenatally diagnosis of mild isolated ventriculomegaly
      was carried (absence of another cerebral or extra-cerebral anomaly in imagery and a negative
      aetiology). This prospective cohort will be compared with children for whom no neurological
      anomaly was prenatally detected.

      The children diagnosed for an mild isolated cerebral ventriculomegaly will be identified by
      the investigators among medical files of the Centers of Prenatal Diagnosis (CPDPN) of the UH
      of Angers and the UH of Nantes. The patient inclusion will be done at the 2 years age after
      parental agreement, with a follow-up at 5 years. The control children will be included under
      the same conditions after having ensured of the normality of the echographies of 22 and 30
      gestational weeks. The follow-up of these 2 cohorts will be based on the 2 years obligatory
      paediatric examination, and on the network “Naitre ensemble” set up in the Pays de la Loire
      Loire. In addition to the clinical routine examinations, standardized neuropsychological
      examinations will be done (Brunet Lezine Revised score at 2 years, NEPSY at 5 years and ASQ
      at 2 and 5 years).

      This study will allow to compare the neuropsychological development at school age of the
      children diagnosed for a foetal mild, apparently isolated, cerebral ventriculomegaly from
      children not presenting any foetal anomaly, to evaluate the incidence of the mild isolated
      ventriculomegaly, to identify the predictive factors of the neuropsychological anomalies in
      the children diagnosed for ventriculomegaly and to compare (in the children diagnosed for
      ventriculomegaly), the neuropsychological development at the school age of the children
      having a ventricular atrium between 10 and 12 mm with those having a ventricular atrium
      between 12,1 and 15 mm.

      This study will allow to define the neuropsychological morbidity of the foetal mild isolated
      cerebral ventriculomegaly and will allow to define the best clinical and educational follow
      up of these children and their family.
