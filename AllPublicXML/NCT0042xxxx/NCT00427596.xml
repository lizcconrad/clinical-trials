  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study. Part 1 is designed to find the best modified release formulation of
      GW423753; Part 2 is designed to use the selected formulation(s) from Part 1 to find out if
      food affects the way the medication is processed by the body.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening physical examination,
             clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, or any other medical condition or circumstance
             making the subject unsuitable for participation in the study based on the
             Investigator's assessment.

          -  Subjects with either a blood pressure measurement &gt; 150/90 mmHg, or a history of

          -  Positive urine drug, alcohol or serum pregnancy test at screening and prior to dosing
             in each study session.

          -  Positive for hepatitis C antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen or HIV at screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs within 7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is longer) prior to administration of study medication and during the study. By

          -  Subjects who have donated more than 500 mL of blood or plasma within 56 days prior to
