  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect, freeze and store leukemia cells from the
      blood or bone marrow of patients that have advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that
      is not in clinical remission. This study is a companion study to DF/HCC clinical trial 06-196
      in which the participants' own CLL cells may form part of a vaccine treatment for their
      leukemia.

      -  It is important to understand that even if the participant consents to allow us to save
           their leukemia cells, we cannot guarantee that they will be able to receive a vaccine.
           First, we may not be able to make enough vaccine from the collected cells. Second, they
           may not be able to participate in a vaccine study in the future for reasons related to
           the status of your overall health. Third, an appropriate vaccine trial may not be
           available in the future.

        -  In order to make the vaccine, leukemia cells will be collected by one or more of the
           following methods: drawing blood during one of two visits to the clinic; leukapheresis;
           bone marrow aspiration; or, surgery to remove a lymph node.

        -  The physician will discuss with the participant which approach is best in their case to
           ensure the highest number of tumor cells collected.
