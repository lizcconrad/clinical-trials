  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present clinical trial is a dose comparison of a multi-component active immunotherapy
      designed to stimulate an immune reaction to specific tumor associated antigens which are
      highly expressed on a large number of solid cancers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of tumors are ignored by the immune system and it was thought for a long time
      that tumor antigens did not exist. However, recently a number of tumor antigens have been
      described. These antigens reside on cancer cells and can be recognized by specific T-cells
      which can ultimately attack and destroy the tumor.
