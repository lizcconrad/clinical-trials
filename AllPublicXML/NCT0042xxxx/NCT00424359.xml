      This is a study comparing clinical tests of walking and balance. The goal of this study is to
      discover which of those tests are best at predicting walking problems due to MS.

    <textblock>
      This study includes:

      Three study visits to the MS Center at Evergreen; wearing a pedometer for two, one-week
      periods to record walking during regular daily activities; keeping a diary for any walking
      problems such as falls and slips.

      Subjects must meet the following criteria:

      Diagnosis of MS (any form); 18-70 years of age; be on stable MS treatment OR no MS treatment
      for the last three months; no scheduled hospitalization in the next six months.
