      Aim

      To evaluate the effects of peginterferon and ribavirin therapy on the immune response in
      chronic HCV genotype 1,2 or 3 patients before, during and after treatment.

      Background

      Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) has shown a remarkable success. However, genotype 1
      patients have reduced response rates. A better understanding and improvement of these results
      can now be considered the greatest challenge.

      In chronically infected patients, HCV-specific immune responses are generally weak, narrowly
      focused, and often dysfunctional. The presence of HCV-specific cells suppressing the immune
      response (regulatory T-lymphocytes=Treg) are able to suppress the immune response. These Treg
      are possibly responsible for the impaired immune response.

      Previous studies have indicated increased Treg frequency and activity of immune regulating
      mechanisms, locally in the liver, as a result of HCV re-infection. Hence, these Data
      highlight the importance of monitoring intrahepatic immune responses in addition to
      peripheral immune responses. Using the minimally-invasive technique of fine-needle aspiration
      biopsy (FNAB), it is now possible to obtain safe and frequent liver samples to monitor local
      antiviral immune responses in chronic HCV patients during antiviral therapy.

      Rationale and hypothesis of the study

      Our previous studies and current literature support the concept that Treg may contribute to
      HCV persistence by suppressing HCV-spec immune responses. The current study is designed to
      examine if peginterferon and ribavirin therapy affects the activity of Treg and DC, and if
      this results in enhanced HCV-specific immune responses.

      Design

      Single centre, translational and observational open label study with one arm of 20 genotype 1
      patients and one arm of 7 genotype 2/3 patients.
