          -  They are considered as healthy by the investigator at screening. Healthy subjects are
             defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease as
             determined by their medical history, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests,
             vital sign, 12-lead ECG, immunology tests and urinary drug screening tests.

          -  They are Japanese males.

          -  Aged 20 to 64 years, inclusive.

          -  They have a body mass index (weight/height2) at screening in the range of 18.5 and
             &lt;25.0 kg/m2 inclusive. Standard weight is in the range of 55-85 kg inclusive.

          -  Blood pressure and pulse rate at screening within the normal range (systolic 90-140
             mmHg, diastolic 40-90 mmHg, pulse rate 40-90bpm).

          -  They have the following clinical laboratory test

          -  Biochemistry (AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), ALP, LDH and gamma-GTP : within normal range at
             screening.

          -  Haematology (RBC, Hb and Ht) below upper limit normal range at screening.

          -  Normal ECG at screening (QTc value of &lt;440msec).

          -  They give their consent to be able to abstain from sexual intercourse or use condom
             for contraception from at screening until post-study screen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has any clinically relevant abnormality on medical examination, vital
             sign, clinical laboratory test or medical history at screening in the medical opinion
             of the investigator or the subject has a medical history that is not considered as
             eligible for inclusion in this study by the investigator.

             months of the first dosing.

          -  The subject is concurrently participating in another clinical study or post-marketing
