    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF-00915275 following administration to adult human subjects with
      T2DM for 4-weeks. The primary end point is glucose lowering (24 hour mean glucose
      concentration).
