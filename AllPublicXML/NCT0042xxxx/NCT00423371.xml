        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women ≥40 years of age

          2. Pain due to primary OA of the first CMC joint present for at least half the days of
             the previous month AND a mean combined pain score ≥ 30 mm out of 100 mm of the 5 pain
             questions on the AUSCAN Index Pain Subscale (See Appendix 1)

          3. A series of X-rays confirming OA of the first CMC joint of the target thumb obtained
             at screening with a stage of 2, 3, or 4 according to Grading Scale in Appendix 3.

          4. Ability and willingness to use only acetaminophen as the analgesic (rescue) study
             medication

               -  The acetaminophen dose must not exceed 4 grams/day (4000 mg)

               -  If subject has known chronic liver disease, the maximum dose of acetaminophen
                  must not exceed 2 grams/day (2000 mg)

               -  The subject must be willing and able to discontinue acetaminophen at least 24
                  hours prior to all study-specific visits

               -  The study specific acetaminophen provided will only be used for thumb/joint pain.

          5. Willingness and ability to complete efficacy and safety questionnaires and ability to
             read and understand study instructions

          6. Signed study-specific Subject Informed Consent Form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any major injury to the target thumb within the 6 months prior to the Screening Visit

          2. Anyone having Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), DeQuervain's tenosynovitis, trigger
             finger, or a ganglion cyst of the target hand ONLY IF there is evidence of extreme
             atrophy AND two-point average discrimination is greater than 10-mm, OR if the pain
             from these conditions renders the subject unable to objectively assess OA pain in the
             target hand

          3. Any surgery to the target joint within the 12 months prior to the Screening Visit

          4. Regular use of assistive devices such as a cane or crutch or a CTS brace

          5. Concomitant rheumatic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus arthropathy, psoriatic
             arthritis)

          6. History of chondrocalcinosis in the target joint

          7. Gout exacerbation in any joint in the past 6 months

          8. X-ray findings of acute fractures, severe loss of bone density, and/or severe bone or
             joint deformity in the target joint

          9. Significant target joint infection or skin disorder/infection within the 3 months
             prior to study enrollment

         10. Known hypersensitivity to acetaminophen, EUFLEXXA™, or Phosphate Buffered Saline
             solution

         11. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, or planning to become
             pregnant, and those who do not agree to remain on an acceptable method of birth
             control throughout the entire study period

         12. Recurrent medical history of severe allergic or immune-mediated reactions or other
             immune disorders

         13. Current treatment or treatment within the previous 2 years prior to the Screening
             Visit for any malignancy unless specific written permission is provided by the Sponsor
             (excluding basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin)

         14. Active liver disease based on liver profile of AST, ALT, and conjugated bilirubin &gt;2
             times the upper limit of normal

         15. Renal insufficiency based on serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL

         16. Any clinically significant laboratory value based on clinical history that the
             Investigator feels may affect the study evaluation

         17. Any intercurrent chronic disease or condition that may interfere with the completion
             of the 6-month follow-up of the study, such as liver disease, severe coronary disease,
             drug abuse, disordered mental state, or other clinically significant condition

         18. Current alcoholism, and/or any known current addiction to pain medications

         19. Any clinically significant finding that would place the subject at health risk, impact
             the study, or affect the completion of the study

         20. Any psychiatric illness that would prevent comprehension of the details and nature of
             the study

         21. Participation in any experimental device study within 6 months prior to the Screening
             Visit, or an experimental drug study within 1 month prior to the Screening Visit
