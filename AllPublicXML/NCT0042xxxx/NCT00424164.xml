      RATIONALE: Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy
      using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells.
      Giving lapatinib together with tamoxifen may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of lapatinib and
      tamoxifen in treating patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib ditosylate and tamoxifen citrate in patients
           with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any relationship between drug exposure and adverse events or biological
           modifications of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the antitumor activity of this regimen in patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate on days 1-28 of course 1. In all
           subsequent courses, patients receive oral tamoxifen citrate and oral lapatinib
           ditosylate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate on days 1-14 of course 1. In all
           subsequent courses, patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate and oral tamoxifen
           citrate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both treatment arms, blood is collected periodically during courses 1 and 2 for
      pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
