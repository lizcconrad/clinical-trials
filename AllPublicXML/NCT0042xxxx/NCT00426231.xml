      Our research aims to improve the use of medicines known to prevent recurrent heart attacks.
      In particular, we know that statin treatment is useful after heart attacks, but many patients
      do not use it. There are a few possible reasons for this. Patients cannot find affordable
      medicine. Their doctor may not prescribe the medicine after they leave the hospital. Some
      people may culturally mistrust using the medicine. So they may decide not to take it even if
      it is prescribed. We are developing a hospital based culturally attuned program to target
      this problem. In this program, a community health worker counsels and helps patients in
      accessing pharmacy assistance programs. We will test whether this program can improve
      appropriate statin use.

      We will enroll patients who have heart attacks. We will compare patients who are counseled by
      the community health worker with those who get the usual care at baseline and at 6 and 12
      months (participants enrolled during the early phase of the recruitment will have an
      additional study visit at 24 months). We will test if their &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol levels are
      controlled. We will find out how regularly they have filled their questionnaire and taken the
      medicine. Finally, we will test if they are getting benefit from the statin treatment. We
      will do this using blood tests and imaging the patients' arteries with ultrasound. We will
      also measure how cost-effective it is for a hospital to run the program.

      It is our goal to develop a community health worker model that is culturally sensitive for
      people with cultural, educational or educational barriers. Statin use is known to benefit
      patients in theory; such a culturally competent program will improve health outcomes in
      practice. After we test it, a cost-effective program such as this can be implemented in other
      hospitals.

    <textblock>
      The lipid-specific and pleiotropic benefits of statin therapy, and secondary prevention of
      coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality have been demonstrated. Statin therapy in particular
      is underutilized in both white and Black American populations who have CAD and who do not
      have access to therapy or who cannot afford it. Systems factors related to these findings
      involve a lack of continuous access to medications following hospital discharge for many
      Black Americans and for white Americans who do not have the ability to readily afford their
      medicines or who do not have the educational background to understand the importance of
      therapy. In many cases, there is failure by primary care physicians to continue statin
      therapy after discharge in patients who have poor access to therapy or who do not comply with
      pharmacotherapy. Patient factors include mistrust and volitional nonadherence related to
      beliefs and personal priorities, and a lack of education and support related to preventive
      therapy.

      This trial will thus take place in lower income and lower educational level Black and white
      American patients identified at the time of hospitalization and will continue for two years
      after a myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, or percutaneous intervention.
      The overall hypothesis is that a quality of care intervention delivered to Black and white
      American patients with lower incomes and /or education by a culturally competent community
      health worker (CHW) within an existing hospital system will result in improved outcomes. The
      CHW will counsel patients and help them access resources, including Maryland and private
      pharmacy assistance programs. The specific aims are to compare the impact of a hospital-based
      CHW intervention versus usual care (UC) on (1) the percent who achieve LDL cholesterol goals,
      (2) adherence to the statin regimen, and (3) health outcomes including inflammatory markers
      and vascular function at 6 and 12 months after hospitalization for the premature CAD event.
      (Participants enrolled during the early phase of the recruitment will have an additional
      study visit at 24 months.) We will determine the cost of achieving the LDL-C goal in each
      group. Outcome measures include patient adherence (pill counts, modified Hill-Bone
      questionnaire), lipid parameters, hs-CRP, and brachial artery reactivity as a marker of
      endothelial function.

      Intention to treat analyses will be used. Multivariable adjusted analysis using generalized
      linear models or generalized estimating equations will be used to determine the independent
      effect of the interventions after adjusting for covariates. A sample size of 68 subjects per
      group can detect hypothesized differences in the proportion of participants meeting goal
      levels of LDL-C with 92% power, as the primary outcome at 1 years. This proposal will
      demonstrate the effectiveness of a potentially generalizable model of culturally competent
      care that will improve the use of statin therapy and its health outcomes in Black and white
      Americans with documented CAD and poor access to statin pharmacotherapy.
