  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether there is an interaction occurs between
      etoposide and aprepitant in patients with testis carcinoma treated with the standard BEP
      regimen.

      Also to determine how long treatment with aprepitant is necessary in BEP regimen for 5
      consecutive days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aprepitant is a novel, potent and selective nonpeptide neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist that
      was licensed in 2004 for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated
      with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.More recently the indication for use of aprepitant
      was extended to patients with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Based on experience with
      the use of aprepitant it appears rational to consider aprepitant as part of the anti-emetic
      regimen for patients treated with BEP. There are, however, no published data available for
      the use of aprepitant in this situation.
