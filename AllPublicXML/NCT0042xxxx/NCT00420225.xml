  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether reenforcement with polypropylen mesh
      compared with traditional anterior colporrhaphy for anterior vaginal wall prolapse results in
      fewer recurrences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior vaginal wall prolapse is the most common type of pelvic organ prolapse in
      postmenopausal women. This anatomic defect has traditionally been repaired with anterior
      colporrhaphy plication, a series of interrupted stitches being the main surgical component.
      The procedure is associated with a high recurrence rate, up to 32 % even after using
      paravaginal repair along with anterior colporrhaphy.It has been sought to resolve the problem
      of recurrence using artificial mesh as in the repair of abdominal hernias.

      Comparison: Anterior vaginal wall repair with or without reinforcement with polypropylene
      mesh were compared in a prospective randomized study
