  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, the effect of rennin inhibition and the
      relationship among pharmacokinetics, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) biomarkers, and blood
      pressure lowering effects of oral doses of SPP100 in Japanese patients with mild to moderate
      essential hypertension. Safety will also be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension aged 20 to 80 years

          -  Blood pressure: Mean (based on 3 recordings at 1-2 minute intervals) sitting diastolic
             blood pressure values on 14 days or 3 days before the treatment should meet the
             following criteria:

               -  14 days before treatment: ≥ 90 mmHg and &lt; 110 mmHg

               -  The difference in mean sitting diastolic blood pressure between 14 days and 3
                  days before the treatment is within 10 mmHg

          -  Body weight no less than 50 kg

        Exclusion Criteria:

             pressure ≥ 180 mmHg and/or mean diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mmHg at Day -28, Day
             -14 and Day -3.
