      The PDT/Lucentis trial will be a Phase IV comparative trial comparing the use of combination
      therapy with ITV ranibizumab and verteporfin PDT to ITV ranibizumab alone in patients with
      exudative AMD. Patients will be randomized to one of three groups. All patients will receive
      three consecutive monthly treatments with ITV ranibizumab. Patients randomized to group I
      will receive only ITV ranibizumab. Patients randomized to group II will also receive one
      treatment with reduced fluence (20% fluence) verteporfin PDT at day 0. Patients randomized to
      group III will also receive one treatment with reduced fluence (40% fluence) vPDT. All
      patients will also be evaluated for possible retreatment with ranibizumab according to
      established criteria. Thirty patients (ten per group) will be recruited from one U.S. sites
      in a 6-month period. Randomization will occur at the time of entry into the study. Follow-up
      will continue until month 12 (from day 0) in all subjects.
