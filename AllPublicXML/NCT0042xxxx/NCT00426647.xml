    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this equivalence study is to evaluate the efficacy of Norspan®
      patches versus Tramadol in subjects with chronic, moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain of
      the hip, knee and/or lumbar spine.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and general satisfaction for the patients
      in the two treatment groups.

      This is a randomised, double-blind, multicentre equivalence study with active comparator,
      parallel group, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Norspan® patches versus Tramadol in
      subjects with OA pain in hip, knee and/or lumbar spine, currently receiving sub-optimal
      analgesic treatment (defined as BS-11 score &gt; 4) when treated with paracetamol 4000 mg/day or
      another analgesic at least comparable to this.

      The study consist of 4 phases:

      Run-in, Wash-out, Double blind and Follow-up
