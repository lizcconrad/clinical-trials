      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine fumarate
      (Seroquel) with daily dose 600mg-750mg used as mono-therapy in the treatment of acute
      schizophrenic patients by evaluation of the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Day
      56 using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.
