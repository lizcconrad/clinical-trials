      RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Imatinib
      mesylate and bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to
      the tumor. Giving imatinib mesylate together with bevacizumab as maintenance therapy may stop
      non-small cell lung cancer from growing or coming back.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with
      bevacizumab after first-line chemotherapy and bevacizumab works in treating patients with
      stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy comprising imatinib mesylate and
           bevacizumab after completion of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy and bevacizumab,
           in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
           lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 1 year in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
