  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the largest cause of death and disability in the world.
      Besides medicines, the principle treatment of this condition requires opening of the narrowed
      arteries, responsible for angina and other symptoms of the disease, by angioplasty or
      surgery. Introduction of metal scaffolds called 'stents' in the past few decades
      revolutionised the angioplasty technique, and has made it the most popular treatment today
      for CAD. However these stents are prone to becomin narrow and obstructed after implanataion,
      causing symptoms and non-fatal heart attacks in some patients. Introduction of stents that
      slowly release drugs locally to minimize this process, called 'drug-eluting stents'(DES)he
      past few years has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in the field of cardiology. However
      ven the current available DES are still prone to narrowing in high-risk patients, like those
      with diabetes, and also have a higher chance for sudden blockage by a blood clot even many
      years later after insertion. Thus it is important to develop technology for more efficacious
      and safer DES.This includes safer drugs, better stent design and delivery, and more inert
      platforms for drug release We hypothesise that a new stent made with nanoporous particle with
      better polymer for drug release will prove to be safer and more efficacious alternative to
      currently available DES.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant female 2: 18 years of age (note: females of child bearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of treatment and must use
             effective pregnancy avoidance until the 6 month angiogram is completed)

             infarction or documented silent ischemia

          3. Treatment of a native vessel de novo coronary lesion (only 1 single study
             lesion/patient)

          4. Target vesseI2.5mm-4.0mm in diameter (visual estimate)

          5. Target lesion length::: 12mm (visual estimate)

          6. Target lesion stenosis&gt; 50% and &lt; 100% (visual estimate)

             form that is approved by the local Ethics Committee

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has experienced an acute myocardial infarction (Q wave or non-Q wave) within
             72 hours prior to the index procedure with CK enzymes 2: 2x the local laboratory upper
             limit of normal, with the presence of CK- MB levels elevated above the local
             laboratory upper limit of normal;

          2. Unprotected left main coronary disease with&gt; 50% stenosis;

          3. Significant (&gt; 50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might
             require revascularization or impede runoff;
