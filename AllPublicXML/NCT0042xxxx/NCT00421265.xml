  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with prostate cancer with indolent features, disease progrssion may be very slow
      and in many cases will never become clinically evident during the patient's lifetime. Active
      surveillance is a continuous process of monitoring disease characteristcs aiming to avoid the
      morbidity of active therapy in patients with stabe indolent parameters, while offering early
      detection of disease activity in others who will need active therapy to control their
      disease. We hypothesize that active surveillance will permit the avoidance of therapy related
      morbidity in the majority of appropriate patients and will be associated with maintaining
      their quality of life.
