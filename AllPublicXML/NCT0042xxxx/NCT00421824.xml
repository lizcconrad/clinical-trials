      Primary:

        -  To assess complete pathological response rate of both strategies.

      Secondary:

        -  Safety profile

        -  To assess downstaging rate of both strategies.

        -  To compare relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin and capecitabine of both strategies

        -  To compare time to progression and overall survival of both strategies.
