  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this Phase I study in 15 adult subjects suffering from epilepsy and
      chronically treated with phenytoin monotherapy is to evaluate the effect of steady-state ucb
      34714 administration on the steady-state plasma levels of phenytoin.

             least three months before entry into the study and will be kept stable for the entire
             trial duration.

          -  Subjects with a creatinine clearance of ≤50 mL/min.
