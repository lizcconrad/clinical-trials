  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' in vitro data suggest that Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists like
      aprepitant will decrease the expression of CCR5, an essential co-receptor in the life cycle
      of HIV, in the surface of macrophages and lymphocytes to levels at least similar to those
      observed in patients heterozygous for the CCR5 32 mutation. Together with a direct potential
      antiviral effect this could alter disease progression in patients with HIV infection.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that aprepitant is safe, tolerable and has antiviral
      activity in HIV infected individuals.

      This is randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study to determine the safety and
      antiviral activity of aprepitant by comparing the change in HIV RNA viral load after 2 weeks
      of aprepitant monotherapy.

      27 HIV infected males and females ≥ 18 years old who have early infection with CD4 cell
      counts ≥ 350 cells/mm3. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive two different doses of
      aprepitant (Emend®) or placebo.

      DESIGN

      Randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study to determine the safety and antiviral
      activity of aprepitant by comparing the change in HIV RNA viral load after 2 weeks of
      aprepitant monotherapy.

      DURATION

      42 days.

      SAMPLE SIZE and POPULATION

      27 HIV infected males and females ≥ 18 years old who have early infection with CD4 cell
      counts ≥ 350 cells/mm3.

      REGIMEN

      Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive two different doses of aprepitant (Emend®) or
      placebo.

        -  Arm A: Aprepitant placebo

        -  Arm B: Aprepitant 125 mg QD

        -  Arm C: Aprepitant 250 mg QD

      HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES

        -  Hypothesis : Aprepitant is safe, tolerable, and has antiviral activity in HIV infected
           individuals.

        -  Primary Objectives:

             -  To assess the safety and tolerability of aprepitant for 2 weeks at two different
                doses.

             -  To assess the response of plasma HIV-1 RNA to two different doses of aprepitant
                compared with baseline.

        -  Secondary Objectives:

             -  To investigate the course and duration of antiretroviral response to 2 different
                doses of aprepitant given over a 14-day period.

             -  To evaluate the dose-response and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship
                between viral RNA change and aprepitant plasma levels.

             -  To evaluate aprepitant effects on CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts, circulating SP
                levels, natural killer cell number and function and CCR5 expression in peripheral
                PBMCs.

             -  To evaluate the effects of aprepitant in the viral tropism and envelope sequence of
                the main HIV-1 population of the participants.

             -  To assess viral drug susceptibility in conjunction with baseline coreceptor tropism
                phenotype and changes in coreceptor phenotype after the exposure to aprepitant.

             -  To evaluate aprepitant effects on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HDL, free fatty
                acids, and triglyceride concentrations after 14 days of treatment.

             -  To provide preliminary description of any change from baseline in sleep quality,
                anxious mood, depressed mood and neurocognitive measures after 2 weeks of
                aprepitant therapy.
