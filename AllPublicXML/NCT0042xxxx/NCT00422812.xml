  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staccato Prochlorperazine is being developed to treat patients suffering from acute migraine
      headaches. In October 2005, we completed a 75 patient, multi-center, double-blind
      placebo-controlled Phase 2A clinical trial in patients suffering from moderate to severe
      acute migraine headaches. This Phase 2B clinical trial of Staccato Prochlorperazine has been
      initiated to assess the efficacy and safety in outpatients with migraine headache with or
      without aura.

          4. Patients who agree to: not use the study drug within 72 hr of a prior migraine attack,
             and to use the investigational medication when they have a pain rating of Moderate or
             Severe (on a None, Mild, Moderate or Severe Scale) prior to dosing.

          5. Patients who speak, read, and understand English sufficiently well and are willing and

          6. Patients who are willing and able comply with the study schedule and study
             requirements, and agree to return to the clinic within 5 working days of use of the
             investigational treatment.

          7. Patients who are in good general health prior to study participation as determined by
             a detailed medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, blood chemistry
             profile, hematology, urinalysis and in the opinion of the Principal Investigator.

             participants (if sexually active with a partner of child-bearing potential) who agree
