        <description>The FSFI Satisfaction Domain (items 14-16) measures satisfaction with emotional closeness, sexual relationship, and overall sexual life. Each question is scored on a 0/1 to 5 scale and domain score is calculated by multiplying the total points by 0.4, for a total score range of 0.8 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
