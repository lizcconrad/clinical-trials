  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A lack of public awareness about entitled health and social services may contribute to poor
      delivery of services in developing countries. We sought to determine the impact of educating
      villagers about entitled services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      105 gram panchayats (village clusters) were randomized to receive information about their
      guaranteed health, education, and village governance rights. We then selected households
      within each treatment and control village to assess whether the information had made an
      impact.
