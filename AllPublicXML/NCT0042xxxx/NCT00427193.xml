      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that two years of sustained 25% caloric
      restriction (CR) in men age 21-50 (inclusive) and women age 21-47 (inclusive) will slow aging
      and protect against age-related disease processes.

      The overall aim of CALERIE Phase 2 is to test the hypothesis that two years of sustained
      caloric restriction (CR), involving a reduction in energy intake to 75% of baseline (25% CR),
      in healthy, non-obese men aged 21-50 (inclusive) and women aged 21-47 (inclusive), will
      result in the same adaptive changes that were observed in a wide variety of animal studies.
      Particular emphasis is on the adaptive responses thought to be involved in slowing the aging
      process and protecting against age-related disease processes. Primary outcomes include core
      body temperature and resting metabolic rate. Secondary outcomes include risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease, inflammatory markers, immune function, psychological and physical
      function; oxidative changes in lipids, proteins, and DNA; and, risk factors for age-related
      conditions such as diabetes and body composition. An important secondary aim is to identify
      potential adverse effects of CR in humans.

      The study will be conducted as a multi-center, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial
      (RCT). A sample of 200 participants will be enrolled, and assigned to either the CR
      intervention or a control group. Control participants will be advised to simply continue
      their current diets. Participants in both treatment arms will be followed over a period of 24
      months. A comprehensive set of evaluations will be performed prior to initiating the
      intervention, with follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months afterwards.
