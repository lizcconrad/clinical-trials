  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if and to what extend a composite measure of
      treatment motivation and behavior change motivation predicts alcohol treatment success. It is
      expected that the composite measure based on the stages of the Transtheoretical Model of
      Behavior Change is a better predictor for treatment outcome than treatment motivation or
      behavior change motivation alone. Participants will be recruited from alcohol treatment
      centers. A baseline interview regarding their motivation, drinking behavior and personal
      treatment goals will be conducted. At the end of treatment, treatment staff will be asked
      about treatment involvement of each participant. Two follow-up interviews will be conducted
      after 6 and 12 months. To identify the impact of behavior change and treatment motivation on
      change in drinking behavior, data will be pooled with a non-treatment seeking sample.
      Conclusions can be drawn on what motivation pattern best predicts behavior change for those
      utilizing formal help and for those remitting without formal help (self-changers).
