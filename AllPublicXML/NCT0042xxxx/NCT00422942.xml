  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will investigate the pattern of B cell depletion in synovial tissue and
      peripheral blood of patients with active RA, after MabThera (1000mg iv x 2 on days 1 and 15)
      + methotrexate (10-25mg/week po) treatment. The clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile
      of MabThera after treatment and retreatment will also be investigated. The anticipated time
      on study treatment is 2+ years, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

    <description>ACR20/50/70 response is greater than or equal to (≥) 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement, respectively, in tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC); and improvement in at least 3 of 5 remaining ACR core measures: patient assessment of pain; patient global assessment of disease activity; physician global assessment of disease activity; self-assessed disability (disability index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]); and C-Reactive Protein (CRP).</description>

    <description>The change in DAS28-ESR at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48, relative to baseline. DAS28-ESR was calculated from SJC and TJC using 28-joint count, ESR (millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient global assessment of disease activity (participant-rated arthritis activity assessment). Total score range: 0-9.4, higher score equals (=) more disease activity. DAS28-ESR less than or equal to (≤) 3.2 implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;)3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-ESR &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

Change from baseline to Week 48 over time in ACR core set: SJC, TJC, physician's global assessment of disease activity, patient's global assessment of disease activity, patient's assessment of pain, HAQ, ESR, and CRP. ACR20/50/70 response: ≥20%/50%/70% improvement in SJC; ≥20%/50%/70% improvement in TJC; and ≥20%/50%/70% improvement in at least 3 of 5 remaining ACR core measures: participant assessment of pain; physician's global assessment of disease activity, participant's assessment of disease activity, participant assessment of functional disability via a HAQ, and CRP at each visit.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 48</time_frame>
    <description>mTSS = sum of erosion and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Change: scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS)</title>
        <description>mTSS = sum of erosion and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Change: scores at observation minus score at baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline. An increase in mTSS from baseline represented disease progression and/or joint worsening, no change represented halting of disease progression, and a decrease represented improvement.</description>

Study was terminated after enrollment of 3 participants as it was decided that it would not be appropriate to expose further participants to study drug since the objectives and data sought from this study had been published from other, independent sources and given the recruitment difficulties encountered.</population>
