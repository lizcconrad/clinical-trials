      RATIONALE: Gefitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. PEG-interferon alfa-2a may interfere with the growth of tumor cells
      and slow the growth of skin cancer. Giving gefitinib together with PEG-interferon alfa-2a may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PEG-interferon
      alfa-2a when given together with gefitinib and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with unresectable or metastatic skin cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the tolerability of gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2a in patients with
           unresectable or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with gefitinib for 1 month.

        -  Determine whether the addition of weekly PEG-interferon alfa-2a to ongoing gefitinib
           improves response rate in these patients .

        -  Determine whether PEG-interferon alfa-2a exacerbates rash in patients who have been
           treated with gefitinib for 1 month.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, pilot, dose de-escalation study of PEG-interferon alfa-2a
      followed by an open-label, phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral gefitinib alone once daily for 4 weeks. Beginning in week
           5, patients also receive PEG-interferon alfa-2a subcutaneously once weekly. Treatment
           continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of patients receive de-escalating doses of PEG-interferon alfa-2a until a tolerable
      dose is determined.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive gefitinib and PEG-interferon alfa-2a at the tolerable dose
           determined in phase I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16 patients will be accrued for this study.
