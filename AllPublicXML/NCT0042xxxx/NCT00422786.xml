  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAP-232 in the treatment
      of patients with previously treated (refractory) renal cell carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, open label, single arm study. Approximately 40 patients were
      initially planned to be recruited.

      Each patient was to receive a treatment cycle consisting of CAP-232 via continuous IV
      infusion over 21 days at 0.48 mg/kg/day followed by a 7-day rest period. Treatment cycles to
      be repeated in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of Life questionnaires were to be administered at baseline, after each visit and at
      the end of the study.

      Signs and symptoms of adverse events were closely monitored during treatment cycles. Safety
      laboratory measures were done at Screening, during the 72hr hospitalization (first cycle), at
      every interim visit , and at the end of the study. A follow-up safety visit was to be
      scheduled at least 30 days after the end of treatment.

      CAP-232 plasma levels were also determined.
