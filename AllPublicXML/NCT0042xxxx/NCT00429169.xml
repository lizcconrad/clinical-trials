      The primary study comparing effectiveness for suicidal ideation and/or behavior of two
      antidepressant medications in depressed patients who have attempted suicide or are currently
      experiencing suicidal thoughts has been completed.

      A secondary study component using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate
      different medication effects on reward processing in the same sample is ongoing.

      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and serious psychiatric illness. It is among the
      leading causes of disability and is the psychiatric disorder most often associated with
      suicide. The treatment of MDD with antidepressant medication remains largely trial and error.
      Little empirical evidence exists to guide the treatment of MDD when suicide risk is a major
      factor. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a type of antidepressant
      medication that works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain
      that helps maintain mental balance. The study compared the effectiveness of paroxetine, an
      SSRI, versus bupropion, a non-SSRI, on suicidal ideation and/or behavior in depressed
      patients with a past suicide attempt and/or current suicidal thoughts. Results of the
      completed primary study have been published (Grunebaum MF et al. Neuropsychopharmacology.
      2012 Feb;37(3):697-706).

      In the ongoing secondary neuro-imaging component of the study, Participants are randomly
      assigned to either paroxetine or bupropion treatment for 8 weeks with fMRI scans involving a
      reward processing task at baseline and Week 8. Weekly study visits include interviews with a
      psychologist, self-report scales, and medication monitoring. All participants will then be
      offered 4 additional months of open clinical treatment. If original medication assignments
      prove to be ineffective, participants will have the option to switch to another medication.
      After completing the study, participants will be referred for ongoing treatment.

    <description>The clinician-rated Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) (Beck et al 1979)was used weekly for 8 weeks. It has 19 items scaled 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe) and total score is the sum, ranging 0 to 38 (Beck et al 1979). Items measure frequency, intensity, and attitudes toward suicidal thoughts, feelings of control over them, and suicide plans. Mean score in 90 inpatients hospitalized for suicidal ideation was 9.4±8.4, versus 4.4±5.8 in outpatients as cited in the study by Beck et al, 1979.</description>

        <title>Scale for Suicidal Ideation</title>
        <description>The clinician-rated Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) (Beck et al 1979)was used weekly for 8 weeks. It has 19 items scaled 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe) and total score is the sum, ranging 0 to 38 (Beck et al 1979). Items measure frequency, intensity, and attitudes toward suicidal thoughts, feelings of control over them, and suicide plans. Mean score in 90 inpatients hospitalized for suicidal ideation was 9.4±8.4, versus 4.4±5.8 in outpatients as cited in the study by Beck et al, 1979.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
        <population>The study was powered for N=50 subjects per group based on naturalistic pilot data from our clinic. An interim data analysis showed an interaction of treatment with baseline suicidal ideation severity on follow-up ideation. After consulting with clinical colleagues, statisticians and the IRB, a decision was made to stop enrollment.</population>
