      The primary objective of this study is to describe the effect of a single dose of medication
      compared to placebo in the upper respiratory tract in previously healthy children less than
      or equal to 12 months of age who are hospitalized with lower respiratory tract illness.

      The primary objective of this study is to describe the effect of a single 30 mg/kg or 100
      mg/kg intravenous (IV) dose of Motavizumab compared to placebo on study drug levels and viral
      load as measured by cultivatable virus and real-time RT-PCR in the upper respiratory tract in
      previously healthy children ≤12 months of age who are hospitalized with lower respiratory
      tract illness.
