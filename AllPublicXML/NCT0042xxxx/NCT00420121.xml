      Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical
      manifestations and a variable prognosis. The aim of the study is to create a standardized
      evaluation of the different subtypes of this disease in order to receive an overview of the
      spectrum of clinical and laboratory features as well as the therapeutic strategies for
      patients with CLE.

      Methods: A core set questionnaire has been developed in the course of the &quot;European Society
      of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (EUSCLE)&quot;, and a total of 40 patients (32 females, 8 males)
      in two centres, Germany and Sweden, were included in this study. Results: CLE was diagnosed
      in 39 individuals (5 with acute CLE, 10 with subacute CLE, 13 with chronic CLE, and 18 with
      intermittent CLE) and one individual presented with a systemic manifestation of the disease.
      Furthermore, disease onset and duration as well as activity and damage of skin lesions using
      a modified CLASI were examined. Interestingly, 75% of the patients with CLE showed a positive
      history of photosensitivity, but only 62.5% exhibited characteristic lesions after
      standardized phototesting. Laboratory analysis revealed positive antinuclear antibodies in
      50% of the patients, positive anti-Ro/SSA in 12 and positive anti-La/SSB antibodies in 8
      cases. The predominantly used treatments included sunscreens (38 patients), topical steroids
      (31 patients), topical calcineurin inhibitors (12 patients), chloroquine (19 patients),
      hydroxychloroquine (11 patients), and systemic steroids (12 patients). Conclusions: The new
      core set questionnaire enables the clinician to characterize the different skin
      manifestations involved in CLE and to evaluate disease activity and reasonable treatment
      modalities. Furthermore, epidemiological data and laboratory features can be assessed for the
      various subtypes. In the future, this standardized evaluation might lead to the development
      of diagnostic guidelines and evidence based therapeutic strategies thus improving quality of
      care for patients with CLE.

    <description>The Total RCLASI Activity Score measures (i) the activity of skin lesions by evaluating the parameters &quot;erythema&quot;, &quot;scaling ⁄hyperkeratosis&quot;, &quot;oedema ⁄Infiltration&quot;, and &quot;subcutaneous nodule ⁄plaque&quot; and/or (ii) the activity of mucous membrane lesions and/or (iii) the activity of alopecia.
The Total RCLASI Damage Score measures (i) the damage of skin lesions by evaluating the parameters &quot;dyspigmentation&quot; and &quot;scarring/atrophy&quot; and/or (ii) the damage of scarring alopecia.</description>
