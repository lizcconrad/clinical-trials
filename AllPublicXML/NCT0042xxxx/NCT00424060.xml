      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as epothilone ZK-219477, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well epothilone ZK-219477 works in treating
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the therapeutic activity of epothilone ZK-219477 in patients with recurrent
           glioblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety profile, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics of this drug in
           these patients.

        -  Gather information about the biological characteristics of the patients' tumor that may
           provide information on response or resistance to this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive epothilone ZK-219477 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline for biomarker analysis and for comparison of genetic
      alterations in tumor tissue with germline DNA. Blood samples are also collected periodically
      during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies. Tumor tissue obtained at diagnosis, and possibly
      recurrence, is used for immunohistochemical analyses for biomarkers. Fluorescent in situ
      hybridization (FISH) is used to detect genetic alterations and gene expression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
