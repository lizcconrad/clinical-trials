    <textblock>
      Asthma and smoking during pregnancy cause significant morbidity in both the mother and the
      offspring. Asthma represents the most common respiratory disorder during pregnancy and
      smoking rates during pregnancy range from 15-30% in the United States. Maternal asthma and
      smoking during pregnancy have been shown to increase the rate of intrauterine growth
      retardation and preterm delivery, as well as increase the risk of wheeze, asthma, respiratory
      infections, and otitis media in children. However, controlled asthmatics during pregnancy
      have similar pregnancy outcomes to non-asthmatic pregnancies. Measurement of the fractional
      concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is a new, easily performed, non-invasive method
      that has been used to assess airway inflammation in adults and children. The long term goal
      of this study is to establish baseline FENO values and to monitor airway disease in pregnant
      asthmatics, pregnant smokers and pregnant controls, and to correlate these levels with other
      inflammatory markers in the mothers and their offspring. These values will be correlated with
      current methods to diagnose and monitor disease control in these patients. The use of FENO
      levels in the pregnant asthmatic may prove to be a better method for monitoring disease
      control and titrating steroid doses in this population. Finally, this study may identify
      children at higher risk of developing asthma or allergic disease. This could serve to
      identify factors that may be modified to prevent or limit the development of these diseases
      in this population.

          -  Patients need to be aged 18 to 35 to participate in the study.

          -  Smokers must have smoked over 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke 5
             or more cigarettes per day.

          -  Asthmatics must be diagnosed with asthma and have a current prescription for an asthma
             medication such as albuterol or an inhaled steroid.

          -  Cannot have been treated with oral steroids or had a respiratory infection in the 4
             weeks before study entry.

          -  Cannot have another illness that can significantly affect quality of life (such as
             depression or cancer).
