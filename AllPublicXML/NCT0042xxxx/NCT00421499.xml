  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular intake of cocoa-containing foods is linked to a considerably lower cardiovascular and
      all-cause mortality in observational studies. Short-term intervention studies indicate that
      high doses of cocoa improve endothelial function and reduce blood pressure (BP), but the
      clinical impact of long-term intake of small dietary amounts of cocoa on BP and the
      underlying BP lowering mechanisms are unclear. We hypothesized that cocoa consumption lowers
      blood pressure by augmentation of the circulating vasodilative nitric oxide (NO) pool due to
      the action of the cocoa polyphenols at the vascular endothelium.

      To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized single-blind, parallel group study in
      subjects with mild essential hypertension to evaluate the effects of polyphenol-rich dark
      chocolate versus polyphenol-free white chocolate on blood pressure and plasma levels of cocoa
      phenols, circulating bioactive nitric oxide, and plasma markers of oxidative stress. After a
      7 day cocoa-free run-in period, 44 subjects will be 1:1 randomized to receive over 18 weeks
      daily doses of either dark chocolate (6.3 g per day with a total of 30 mg of polyphenols and
      30 kcal) or polyphenol free white chocolate (5.6 g per day with 30 kcal, containing similar
      amounts of macronutrients, electrolytes and vitamins). Subjects will be counseled to maintain
      an isocaloric diet and to abstain from other cocoa products during the study. Blood pressure
      and plasma parameters will be assessed in each subject after the run-in period and after 6,
      12, and 18 weeks of treatment.

             blood pressure (between 130/80 and 140/90 mmHg) or mild hypertension (blood pressure
             between 140/90 and 160/100 mmHg)on no medication or nutritional supplements

          -  Non-manual workers with a household income &gt; 20,000 â‚¬/year
