      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as liposomal daunorubicin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well liposomal daunorubicin works in treating
      patients with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of liposomal daunorubicin citrate on Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
           herpes virus (KSHV) viral gene expression in tumors of patients with HIV-related
           Kaposi's sarcoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on KSHV viral gene expression in peripheral blood
           mononuclear cells.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on KSHV viral load in plasma.

        -  Correlate viral load with viral gene expression and/or tumor regression in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients receive liposomal daunorubicin citrate IV days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 4
      weeks for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Biopsies are performed at baseline and once during treatment to evaluate Kaposi's sarcoma-
      associated herpes virus (KSHV) viral gene expression in tumors and skin tissue using reverse
      transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Blood samples are collected at baseline
      and periodically during treatment to evaluate KSHV viral gene expression in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells and viral load in plasma.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
