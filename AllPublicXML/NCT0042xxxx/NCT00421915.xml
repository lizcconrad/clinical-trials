  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of etanercept (25 mg, twice
      weekly) with that of placebo based on the percentage of patients who achieve the Assessment
      in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) response criteria (ASAS 20%) at week 12.
