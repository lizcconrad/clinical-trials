  <brief_title>Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of ACZ885 in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
  <official_title>A 12-week, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group, Dose-finding Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Tolerability of ACZ885 (Anti-interleukin-1beta Monoclonal Antibody) With Three Different Dose Regimens in Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Stable Treatment With Methotrexate Including 76-week and 96-week Extensions</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 12-week core study was designed to evaluate risk-benefit of three subcutaneous dose
      regimens of ACZ885, added on to stable methotrexate (MTX) therapy (greater than or equal to
      7.5 mg/week), compared to placebo in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The
      study investigated the magnitude of effect as well as onset of effect for the different dose
      regimens.

      The primary objective of the extension studies was to assess long-term safety and
      tolerability of canakinumab (ACZ885) in patients with active RA. CACZ885A2201E1 evaluated
      this objective in patients who had participated in the core study (CACZ885A2201) and
      CACZ885A2201E2 did the same in patients who completed the first extension study.

    <description>The patient health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) was used to assess the physical ability and functional status of participants as well as quality of life. The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' (Score=0) to 'unable to do' (Score=3). The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in disability status.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The fatigue subscale of the FACIT is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. Participants respond to each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much) based on their experience of fatigue during the past 2 weeks. The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. FACIT Fatigue subscale scores range from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue.
Least squares means (LSMs) were derived from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and center with baseline FACIT-F value as a covariate.</description>

      <recruitment_details>277 patients were randomized in core (CACZ885A2201): 71 were assigned to ACZ885 600 mg intravenous(iv) + 300 mg subcutaneous each 2 weeks(sc q2wk), 66 to ACZ885 300 mg sc q2wk, 69 to ACZ885 150 mg sc q4wk, 71 to placebo. 3 were randomized but not treated. All other 274 (98.9%) were treated and had post-baseline efficacy data.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Enrollment in core &amp; CACZ885A2201E2 was determined by how many entered first extension study. Study protocols did not mandate that patients continue treatment in the extension phase and furthermore the reason for not continuing from the Core to the Extension phase was not capture. A total of 6.6% completed extensions.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Participants were defined as ACR50 responders if they had at least a 50% improvement from Baseline in both the tender and the swollen 28-joint count, and in at least 3 of the following 5 measures:
Patient’s pain assessment (assessed using a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]);
Patient’s global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm);
Physician’s global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm);
Patient self-assessed disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score);
Acute phase reactant (high sensitivity C-reactive Protein [hsCRP]).
Details on each of these components are provided in Outcome Measures 10-16. Participants were considered as non-responders if they failed the ACR50 criteria. Participants who prematurely discontinued due to insufficient therapeutic effect were also considered non-responders.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity</title>
        <description>The patient’s global assessment of disease activity was performed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from no arthritis activity (0) to maximal arthritis activity (100), after the question &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, draw a line on the scale for how well you are doing”. The distance in mm from the left edge of the scale was measured. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in assessment of disease activity.

The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories, ranging from ‘without any difficulty' (Score=0) to 'unable to do' (Score=3). The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in disability status.
Least squares means (LSM) were derived from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and center with baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28</title>
        <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 is a combined index to measure the disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and includes the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L;
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale.
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. DAS28 above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 lower than 2.6.
Least squares means (LSMs) were derived from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and center with baseline DAS28 value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue (FACIT-F)</title>
        <description>The fatigue subscale of the FACIT is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. Participants respond to each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much) based on their experience of fatigue during the past 2 weeks. The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. FACIT Fatigue subscale scores range from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue.
Least squares means (LSMs) were derived from an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment and center with baseline FACIT-F value as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 is a combined index to measure the disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and includes the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L;
Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale.
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. DAS28 above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 lower than 2.6</description>

        <description>To assess differences between the level of clinical response attained and not just whether the patient did or did not achieve a particular level of response, patients were categorized as follows:
Did not attain an ACR20 response;
Attained a 20% but not a 50% response;
Attained a 50% but not a 70% response;
Attained a 70% or greater response.
A participant was considered as improved according to the ACR20, ACR50 or ACR70 criteria if they had at least a 20, 50 or 70% improvement from Baseline, respectively, in both the tender and the swollen 28-joint count, and in at least 3 of the following 5 measures:
Patient's pain assessment (100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm);
Physician's global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm);
Patient self-assessed disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score);

          <title>Number of Distinct Responders According to ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 Criteria at the End of the Extension Study</title>
          <description>To assess differences between the level of clinical response attained and not just whether the patient did or did not achieve a particular level of response, patients were categorized as follows:
Did not attain an ACR20 response;
Attained a 20% but not a 50% response;
Attained a 50% but not a 70% response;
Attained a 70% or greater response.
A participant was considered as improved according to the ACR20, ACR50 or ACR70 criteria if they had at least a 20, 50 or 70% improvement from Baseline, respectively, in both the tender and the swollen 28-joint count, and in at least 3 of the following 5 measures:
Patient's pain assessment (100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]);
Patient's global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm);
Physician's global assessment of disease activity (VAS 100 mm);
Patient self-assessed disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score);
Acute phase reactant (high sensitivity C-reactive Protein [hsCRP]).</description>

          <description>The patient's global assessment of disease activity was performed using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from no arthritis activity (0) to maximal arthritis activity (100), after the question &quot;Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, draw a line on the scale for how well you are doing&quot;. The distance in mm from the left edge of the scale was measured. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in assessment of disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score During the Extension Study</title>
        <description>The patient health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) was used to assess the physical ability and functional status of participants as well as quality of life. The disability dimension consists of 20 multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and activities. Participants choose from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' (Score=0) to 'unable to do' (Score=3). The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A negative change from Baseline score indicates improvement in disability status.</description>
