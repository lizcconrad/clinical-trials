  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal tolerated regime of PEP005 for the
      treatment of actinic keratoses of the face or face and scalp.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Actinic keratoses (AK) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, scaly patches or
      sores on the top layer of the skin which if left untreated can progress to skin cancer.
      Current treatments can cause scarring and hypopigmentation, be inconvenient, or require long
      treatment duration. Non-invasive alternative therapy for treatment of AK lesions is thus
      being researched.
