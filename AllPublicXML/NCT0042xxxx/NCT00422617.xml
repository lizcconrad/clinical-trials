      An open-label, multicentre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of one course of weekly
      intramuscular administration of Amevive in Taiwan patients with chronic plaque psoriasis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to establish the efficacy and safety of one course of
      once weekly 15 mg intramuscular (IM) administration of AMEVIVE in an alternate study
      population and to address the issue of peak time to response by measuring the proportion of
      patients achieving a â‰¥ 75% reduction in PASI at any time after completion of treatment.
