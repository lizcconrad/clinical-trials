    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the heart rate variability, daily heart
      rate, and/or intrathoracic impedance recorded by implantable cardiac devices can be used in
      conjunction with other traditional clinical practice methods to determine if heart failure
      patients are ready for hospital discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices with or without cardiac
      resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) have the ability to continuously monitor heart rate
      variability, daily heart rate, and patient activity. Changes in these measures have been
      associated with heart failure prognosis. In addition, ICD or CRT-D devices also have the
      ability to measure daily intrathoracic impedance. Previous data have demonstrated that
      device-based intrathoracic impedance measurements correlate with pulmonary capillary wedge
      pressure and fluid retention, both of which are common measures of heart failure status. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate whether the heart rate variability, daily heart rate,
      and/or intrathoracic impedance can be used in conjunction with other methods to determine if
      patients are ready for hospital discharge. This will be the first step in potentially
      developing an inpatient care strategy which includes implantable device data. It is
      hypothesized that device diagnostic data will identify an appropriate and safe time to
      discharge patients admitted for worsening heart failure symptoms before usual clinical
      indicators. More specifically, we hypothesize that device data will &quot;normalize&quot; at least one
      day prior to the clinical indicators of readiness for discharge and patients discharged prior
      to &quot;normalization&quot; of the device data will be at greater risk for rehospitalization
