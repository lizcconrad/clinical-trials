    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab
      used in combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy (Visudyne®) compared to ranibizumab
      monotherapy for the treatment of subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal ranibizumab has shown to increase average vision in patients with subfoveal CNV
      secondary to AMD. However, the treatment does not provide benefit to all patients and the
      treatment regimen requires monthly intravitreal injections. Ranibizumab is an anti-VEGF-A
      monoclonal antibody fragment. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy acts through occluding newly
      formed vessels. The combination of these therapies acting through different modes of action
      bears the potential to provide a more convenient and less frequent therapy while
      maintaining/improving the increase in vision improvement observed with ranibizumab
      monotherapy. The strategic goal is to evaluate whether intravitreal ranibizumab in
      combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy is an effective, safe and convenient
      treatment for patients with subfoveal CNV secondary to AMD and explore potential advantages
      of such treatment compared to ranibizumab monotherapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients over 50 years, subfoveal CNV of any type secondary to age-related macular
             degeneration (AMD), no &quot;macula-treatment for the last 30 days (e.g. with PDT, TA,
             Laser, Macugen®).

               -  the area of the CNV must occupy at least &gt;50% of the lesion (total lesion size
                  under 5400 microns in greatest linear dimension)

               -  Occult CNV:

                    -  recent disease progression

                    -  bleeding

                    -  VA decreased the last three months &gt;5 letters or 2 or more than two lines
                       (Snellen)

                    -  10% increase of the lesion size the last three months

          2. Best corrected visual acuity score between 24-73 letters (20/40 to 20/320) (ETDRS 4 m)

        Exclusion Criteria:
