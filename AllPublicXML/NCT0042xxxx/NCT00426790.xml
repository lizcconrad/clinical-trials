  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that the &quot;Open lung approach&quot; ( recruitment and PEEP) during
      general anaesthesia reduces atelectasis formation and improves respiratory function in the
      immediate post-operative period after major abdominal surgery.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical-trial,performed in patients undergoing
      major abdominal surgery, to compare the effects on the post-operative pulmonary complications
      of two different intraoperative ventilatory strategies during general anaesthesia: 1- Control
      Group: PEEP 0 cmH2O without recruitment manoeuvre; 2- Treatment Group:recruitment manoeuvre
      (after intubation and before extubation) and PEEP 10 cmH2O In the post-operative period the
      following variables will be recorded at the first, third and fifth postoperative day: 1-
      Gas-exchange in air; 2- Chest X-ray for atelectasis evaluation; 3- signs of pulmonary
      complication (cough, secretions, dyspnea, thoracic pain)
