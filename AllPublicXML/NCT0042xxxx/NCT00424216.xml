      This study will explore what effects, if any, direct current (DC) brain polarization may
      produce on mental processes, such as attention, reaction time, working memory, speed of
      information processing and mood or emotional states. In DC brain polarization, a very weak
      electrical current is applied to the head. This technique has been used for many years on
      patients and healthy people with no known serious side effects. Studies have shown that DC
      polarization can temporarily improve people's ability to think of certain words. To determine
      if DC polarization can be used as a treatment for certain types of brain disorders, its
      possible effects on mood and other mental abilities must be determined.

      Healthy normal volunteers over age 18 may be eligible for this study.

      In each of three 1.5-hour sessions scheduled a day apart, participants complete the tasks
      listed below to determine the effects of polarization. For each session, electrodes are
      placed on the head, arm, and hand. One set of electrodes is for brain stimulation; the second
      set is used to measure the amount of skin moisture on the hand. The participants' tasks are
      to:

        -  Push a button on a keyboard when they see a specific item.

        -  Circle a number or make a mark on a line to indicate how much they feel a particular
           emotion or sensation at that time.

        -  Answer questions about themselves, or their opinions on certain topics.

        -  Look at several pictures and say how emotional they think they are.

        -  Read about an imaginary situation and say what they would do in that situation.

        -  Choose between decks of cards to try to win money.

        -  Compare the angles of lines.

        -  Identify smells, using a scratch and sniff test.

        -  At the end of the session, say how they are feeling.

      Participants are called by phone on the day after each session to see how they are feeling.

      Objective: The principal objective is to establish the safety and feasibility of bilateral
      direct current (DC) polarization of the frontal lobes, which may be a useful modality for
      treatment of frontal lobe cognitive or behavioral deficits. Our secondary objective is to
      gather preliminary data on whether DC can modulate cognitive and emotion-related functions of
      the frontal lobes in healthy individuals. Study population: 25 healthy volunteers between the
      ages of 18 and 80 will be enrolled. Design: The study is a double-blind crossover study with
      three arms: anodal polarization, cathodal polarization, and sham treatment. Outcome Measures:
      The primary outcome measures are 1) cognitive function as measured with the CalCAP battery or
      2) emotional state as measured with the Profile of Mood States. Secondary outcome measures
      include tests of emotion-based decision making and social cognition.
