  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how easily gas can be taken up by the lung. We are
      comparing infants born premature &lt;32 weeks gestation to infants born full term &gt;37 weeks. We
      hope to evaluate the differences between the two groups in order to learn more about
      premature lung growth and development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that infants who were born prematurely but are clinically without chronic
      respiratory disease have a lower lung diffusion capacity than healthy infants born at full
      term, when evaluated at comparable post-conception ages. In addition, prematurely born
      infants that develop chronic lung disease have an even lower diffusion capacity than healthy
      premature infants and full term infants. A lower diffusion capacity, when normalized to lung
      volume, would be consistent with decreased alveolarization and alveolar surface area in the
      infants born prematurely. We will study the age range of 1 to 24 month as this represents the
      period of rapid lung growth.

        Recruitment for premature infants were through Infant Lung Disease clinic at Riley Hospital
        for Children and IU NICU. Healthy full term infants were recruited through advertisements
        in local newspapers.
