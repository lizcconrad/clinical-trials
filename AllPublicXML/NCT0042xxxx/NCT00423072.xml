    <textblock>
      The investigators know that middle-ear disease is very common in infants with cleft palate
      and causes hearing loss that can last into childhood. It is thought that a poor ability to
      keep the pressure in the middle ear at a similar level to that in the environment causes
      middle-ear disease and that this depends on the opening function of a natural tube that
      connects the back of the nose with the middle ear, called the Eustachian tube. The
      investigators believe that the middle-ear disease in cleft palate infants and children is
      caused by poor Eustachian tube function that in turn is caused by anatomical problems in the
      muscles that open the tube. The investigators plan to test these relationships by studying
      the changes between 5-24 months and 6 years in middle-ear health, the way the Eustachian tube
      works and Eustachian tube anatomy in cleft palate children.

    <textblock>
      Otitis media with effusion (OME) is recognized as nearly universal in the population of
      infants and children with cleft palate (CP) and is often associated with long-standing
      conductive and, perhaps, sensorineural hearing losses. Most evidence suggests that OME in CP
      patients is a complication of inefficient Eustachian tube function (ETF). The investigators
      plan to use our most complete tests to characterize ETF in CP infants tested at age 5-24
      months and followed up through age 6 years by yearly collection of clinical data for the
      presence/absence of OME and repeat ETF testing. To obtain anatomical data, the investigators
      will obtain basal and lateral cephalograms at age 3 years in all subjects and perform MRI
      tests prepalatoplasty when possible and then at 3 and 5 years on a subset of the enrolled
      children. Functional-anatomical reconstructions based on the MRI data will be studied for the
      mechanical interactions underlying the phenomenon of ET constriction in CP patients and
      examined for the possibility of surgical interventions to correct identified abnormal
      interactions.
