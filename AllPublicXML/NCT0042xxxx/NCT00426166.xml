  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) can
      reduce pain and/or improve wound healing in patients with an acute traumatic injury to the
      upper extremity (wrist, forearm, or elbow).

      This is a prospective, two group, controlled study using random assignment. All eligible
      patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the control group (usual care) or
      the experimental group (usual care plus LLLT). We plan to enroll 50 subjects in this study:
      25 subjects will be randomly assigned to the LLLT group and 25 to the usual care group.

      All subjects will be recruited within one to two days prior to hospital discharge or at the
      time of their first postoperative clinic visit. No subjects will be recruited while sedated
      or receiving intravenous pain medication.
