  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested and is approved as a treatment for type II diabetes
      mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body ineffectively uses glucose. RSG XR, the
      investigational drug, is an extended-release form of RSG. This study tests whether RSG XR
      safely provides benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). RSG XR is a
      new approach to AD therapy and this study tests whether one's genes alter the effectiveness
      of RSG XR. Glucose is used by cells to make energy that they need to live. Changes in the
      ability of cells to use of glucose can lead to diseases like diabetes. Glucose levels may be
      lower in the brains of AD patients, and their brain cells may also use glucose less well than
      in unaffected people. The proper function of brain cells may be critical to memory and
      thought. If brain cells use glucose poorly, this might impact AD. Drugs that help brain cells
      properly use glucose may help a person maintain normal memory and thinking. Data suggesting
      that RSG may help AD patients was first seen in a small study at the Univ. of Washington and
      then from a larger international GSK study. In the first study, those receiving RSG once
      daily for 6 months scored better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not
      receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that benefited most from therapy with RSG XR had a
      specific genetic pattern. They lacked the gene that caused them to produce apolipoprotein E
      e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent,
      or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE
      e3 version of the gene from one parent. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained
      fairly stable while those with two copies of APOE e4 continued to worsen during the 6-month
      treatment. This study will directly test the effect of RSG XR on people who either have or
      lack the APOE e4 gene.

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean ADAS-Cog Total Score at W24 as a Function of APOE e4 Status in Apolipoprotein epsilon4 (APOE e4) Negative Cohort</title>
        <description>The 11-item ADAS-Cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Items were evaluated by tests and clinician ratings on a 5-point scale. Scores ranged from 0-70 with higher scores indicates more dysfunction. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline is defined as value at W0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. The adjusted means were presented. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean ADAS-Cog Total Score at W24 as a Function of APOE e4 Status in Full Population Cohort</title>
          <description>The 11-item ADAS-Cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech. Items were evaluated by tests and clinician ratings on a 5-point scale. Scores ranged from 0-70 with higher scores indicates more dysfunction. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline is defined as value at W0. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.</description>

        <description>The CIBIC+ assessment comprised of a 7-point rating of severity (at baseline) and change (at indicated time points). It was rated on a scale of 1 to 7 as 1: markedly improved, 2.: moderately improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: markedly worse; higher score means greater dysfunction. It was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver by an independent rater. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean CIBIC+ Global Functioning Total Score at W24 as a Function of APOE e4 Status in Full Population Cohort</title>
        <description>The CIBIC+ assessment comprised of a 7-point rating of severity (at baseline) and change (at indicated time points). It was rated on a scale of 1 to 7 as 1: markedly improved, 2.: moderately improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: markedly worse; higher score means greater dysfunction. It was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver by an independent rater. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived. Estimated value was calculated by Active treatment minus Placebo. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to control for the two rosiglitazone dose groups and the three genetic subgroups. There was no adjustment for the donepezil versus placebo comparisons, which were included to assess the sensitivity of the trial to detect a treatment effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean CIBIC+ Global Functioning Total Score at W8, W16, W24</title>
        <description>The CIBIC+ assessment comprised of a 7-point rating of severity (at baseline) and change (at indicated time points). It was rated on a scale of 1 to 7 as 1: markedly improved, 2.: moderately improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: moderately worse and 7: markedly worse; higher score means more dysfunction. The scale was based on interviews with the par. and caregiver and was completed by an independent rater. It required separate structured 15-20 minute interviews with the par. and caregiver. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived. It was evaluated at Baseline, W8, W16 and W24.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score at W8, W16, W24</title>
        <description>The NPI assessed behavioral disturbances comprises 10 dimensions: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, apathy, euphoria, disinhibition, aggressiveness and agitation, irritability, anxiety and aberrant motor activity. The par. caregiver asked about behavior in the par. If âYesâ, the informant then rates both the severity on a 3-point scale, 1: mild to 3: severe (total range: 0-36) and the frequency using a 4-point scale, 1: occasionally to 4: very frequently. The total domain score was frequency Ã severity. The distress was scored on 5-point scale, 0: no distress to 5 - very severe or extreme. A total NPI score can be calculated by adding all domain scores together; NPI total score: from 0-144 and NPI distress score: from 0-60, all with higher scores indicating more severe behavioral disturbance. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) Scale Total Score at W8, W16, W24</title>
        <description>The DAD, assessed the ability of a par. to execute basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) and leisure activities. The scale consists of 40 questions assessing basic and instrumental ADLs. This scale assesses a participantsâ ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item was scored as yes: 1, no: 0 and N/A: not applicable. Higher scores indicate less disability with a score of 100 indicating no disability and 0 indicating no functional ability. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. The percentage score was calculated as (DAD total score/total number of applicable items) multiplied by 100. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean Short Term Memory Assessment Total Score (ADAS-Cog Q1 Plus Q7) at W8, W16, W24</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in short term memory assessment score was assessed from a combined analysis of items 1 (word recall task) and 7 (word recognition task) of ADAS-Cog scale. Word recall task consist of the participants score was the mean number of words not recalled on three trials (maximum score 10) and word recognition task, to score this item the number of incorrect responses was counted (maximum error score was 12). Higher score indicating greater dysfunction. Total score is sum of individual score. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D Proxy was a 2 part scale used to assess the quality of life and utility benefit. The data for Part 1 is presented. It is a 5 dimensional Health State Classification. Caregivers were asked to respond as they feel the par. would on dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Answers to each question were recorded on a 3-point scale which indicates the level of impairment (level 1= no problem; level 2=some or moderate problem(s) and level 3=unable, or extreme problem with higher scores indicating greater dysfunction. EQ-5D Proxy assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions Proxy Version (EQ-5D Proxy) Total Score at W12, W24 Assessed by Thermometer (Visual Analog Scale [VAS])</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D Proxy is a 2 part scale used to assess the quality of life and utility benefit. The data for Part 2 is presented. It is a the visual analogue scale Thermometer which assessed caregiver's impression of par. overall health. The Thermometer has endpoints of 100 (best imaginable health state) and 0 (worst imaginable health state). EQ-5D Proxy assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.</description>

        <description>The RUD instrument was developed as a comprehensive tool to assess the amount of resource use among demented par. RUD assess both formal and informal resource use of the par. and the primary caregiver, making it possible to calculate costs from a societal perspective. Q1 relates to assisting par. with basic activities of daily living and Q2 relates to instrumental activities of daily living. The assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (W0) in Alzheimerâs Carerâs Quality of Life Instrument (ACQLI) Score at W12 and W24.</title>
        <description>The ACQLI was an assessment of caregiver quality of life. This instrument consists of 30 questions exploring various aspects of carerâs quality of life. Each of the questions had a two point response and the 30 questions were summed to provide a total score. Items are assumed to be unidimensional (i.e., represent a single variable) and are scored 0/1 (false/true) before summation into a total score with a 0â30 range. To ease comparisons between scales, ACQLI scores were transformed to range between 0â100 (100: worse). The assessments was performed at Baseline, W12 and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value. Baseline was defined as value at W0. Endpoint treatment differences which were adjusted to take account of missing data are derived.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measures was obtained digitally, approximately one minute apart after the par. had rested in the supine position in a quiet room (no TV, minimal talking) for at least 10 minutes. Conduction intervals from the 12-lead ECGs were manually read and confirmed by an external cardiologist/vendor. The ECG parameters includes PR interval, QRS duration, QT â uncorrected interval, QTc Bazett (QTcB), QTc Fridericia (QTcF) and RR interval of Central Cardiologist are reported. The assessments was performed at Baseline and W24. Change from Baseline was calculated as value at scheduled time point minus Baseline value.
