  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, single-arm treatment study combining lenalidomide plus high dose
      dexamethasone.

      Subjects who qualify for participation will receive lenalidomide plus high dose dexamethasone
      in 4 week cycles. Subjects will be seen every 2 weeks for the first 3 cycles of therapy and
      then every 4 weeks after the third cycle until disease progression is documented, study drug
      is discontinued for any reason or lenalidomide becomes commercially available for this
      indication. Assessments of safety and quality of life are performed during the study.

    <measure>Overall Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), by Severity, Seriousness, and Relationship to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 123 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Counts of study participants who had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) defined as any reported AE that started on or after the first day of study drug dosing. A participant with multiple occurrences of an adverse event within a category is counted only once in that category.
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 3.0) was used by investigators to assess TEAEs. Severity scale ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (death). Grade 3=severe AE; Grade 4=life threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5=death.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. EORTC QLQ-C30 includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and other (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of physical functioning.</description>

Pulse dexamethasone administered orally, 40 mg daily on Days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 for each 28-day cycle during Cycles 1 to 4 (approximately months 1-4). Beginning with Cycle 5 (approximately month 5), a maintenance dose of dexamethasone (40 mg QD) was administered on Days 1 to 4 of each 28-day cycle.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Patients With Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) Physical Functioning Scale</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. EORTC QLQ-C30 includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and other (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most questions used 4-point scale (1 ‘Not at All’ to 4 ‘Very Much’); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 ‘Very Poor’ to 7 ‘Excellent’). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score=better level of physical functioning.</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in cancer patients. Most questions used 4-point scale (1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'); 2 questions used 7-point scale (1 'Very Poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale; higher score for a symptom scale like the pain scale = higher level of symptomatology/problems.</description>
