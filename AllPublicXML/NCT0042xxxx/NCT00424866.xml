      FGF-1 for the treatment of patients with peripheral arterial disease with intermittent
      claudication.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FGF-1 administered by intramuscular injection for the treatment of peripheral arterial
      disease with intermittent claudication. Eligible patients are allocated to one of three
      treatment arms. Patients within each dosing group will be randomized between study drug and
      vehicle control. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and cardiovascular improvement will be evaluated
      at day 1 and weeks 1, 4 and 12 post dosing.

    <description>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FGF-1 in patients with peripheral arterial disease and intermittent claudication. Vital signs, physical examinations, safety laboratory evaluations and total number of adverse events will be captured and analyzed accordingly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Subjects considered eligible to enter the study must sign an informed consent form
             prior to the initiation of any study procedures. In the event that the subject must be
             withdrawn and is re-screened for study participation at a later date, a new informed
             consent form must be signed. Subjects must be competent to give written informed
             consent.

          2. Age must be ≥50 and ≤75 years of age with a life expectancy of &gt; 1 year and leg
             survival &gt; 6 months. Patients &gt;75 and ≤80 years of age will be considered if they show
             no signs of cognitive or muscle function decline and are fully able to comply with the
             protocol.

          3. Patients must have experienced intermittent claudication for at least 6 months and
             have been stable for the past 3 months.

          4. Patients must have peripheral arterial disease, as confirmed by a resting ABI ≥0.40
             and &lt;0.90 based on at least one leg as measured using both the dorsal pedis and
             posterior tibial arteries.

          5. Stenosis of &gt;70% up to total occlusion must be present in the popliteal artery and/or
             in the tibial peroneal trunk or at least 2 tibial arteries above the ankle without
             inflow limitation of the popliteal artery. Adequate popliteal inflow is defined as
             continuous flow from the abdominal aorta, iliac, common femoral and superficial
             femoral with any stenosis &lt; 50% as determined either by intra-arterial DSA, CTA or Gd
             CE-MRA.

          6. The screening Gardner treadmill test peak walking times (PWT) must be &gt;1 minute and &lt;
             12 minutes and limited by pain in one or both calves.

         21. Uncontrolled hypertension (≥160 systolic or ≥100 diastolic pressure) or hypotension
             (&lt;90 systolic or &lt;60 diastolic pressure)

         22. Disease or drug (e.g. systemic corticosteroid) immuno-compromised

         23. Hepatic dysfunction as defined either by AST or ALT &gt; 2.0 times the upper limit of
