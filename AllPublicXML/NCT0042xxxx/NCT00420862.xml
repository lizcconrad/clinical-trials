  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High survival rates have been reported for screen-detected Stage I lung cancer patients, but
      there are concerns about the potential biases of uncontrolled studies. DANTE is a prospective
      randomized controlled trial exploring the effects of screening with LDCT on
      lung-cancer-specific mortality, and on the prevalence and incidence rates of lung cancer,
      stage distribution and resectability rates in a selected high-risk population. The prevalence
      of a set of biomarkers in sputum and blood samples is also being determined.
