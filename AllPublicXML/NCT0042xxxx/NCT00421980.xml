        1. Completed the entire 12 weeks of therapy in study 0881A3-311-EU, or completed at least
             8 weeks of therapy and returned for the week 12 visit in study 0881A3-311-EU.

          2. Negative serum β-HCG pregnancy test at baseline (all women of childbearing potential).

          3. Sexually active women of childbearing potential had to use a medically acceptable form
             of contraception. Medically acceptable forms of contraception included oral
             contraceptives, injectable or implantable methods, intrauterine devices, or properly
             used barrier contraception. Additionally, the use of condoms was suggested as an
             adjunct to the methods previously addressed to protect against sexually transmitted
             diseases and to provide additional protection against accidental pregnancy.

          4. Sexually active men had to agree to use a medically accepted form of contraception
             during the study.

          5. Able to reconstitute and self-inject test article or have a designee who can do so.
