      The purpose of this study is to assess the comparative effects of two different ways of
      enhancing long-term adherence to and benefits associated with participation in the
      evidence-based, Fit and Strong multi-component exercise intervention for older persons with
      lower extremity osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common condition affecting older people today. It is the
      leading cause of disability among older people and its impact is projected to increase
      substantially with the aging of the U.S population from 43 million currently to 60 million by
      2020.

      Promising 2- and 6-month outcomes have recently been reported from a randomized trial of a
      multi-component exercise intervention targeted at older adults with lower extremity OA. The
      Fit and Strong intervention, developed and tested as part of the Midwest Roybal Center for
      Health Maintenance, coupled strength training and aerobic walking with health education for
      sustained behavior change. Improvements have been found in confidence in ability to exercise,
      confidence in ability to continue exercising over time, lower extremity stiffness, lower
      extremity pain, and 6-minute distance walk. Importantly, the average adherence rate in the
      people who participated in the exercise intervention at six months was twice that reported by
      controls.

      The specific aims of this study are to use a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial
      to replicate the Fit and Strong intervention and to test the comparative effectiveness of a
      negotiated/tailored follow-up maintenance strategy vs. a mainstreaming, facility-based
      maintenance strategy, both of which will be tested with and without telephone reinforcement
      as an enhancement.

      All enrolled participants will participate in the 8-week Fit and Strong exercise program
      designed specifically for older adults with lower-extremity OA. Prior to the conclusion of
      Fit and Strong participants will be randomly assigned to one of two follow-up maintenance
      groups. There is no more than minimal risk associated with this program.

    <description>Treatment Arm A will develop tailored/negotiated contracts with the exercise instructor to maintain post intervention exercise adherence at home or in the community. Half of the participants in this &quot;negotiated maintenance&quot; arm will be randomly assigned to receive telephone calls to reinforce adherence and half will be assigned to a no telephone calls group.</description>

    <description>Fit and Strong! is an 8-week (24 sessions) multi-component exercise and health education intervention, including flexibility, aerobic conditioning, strength training, and group discussion/problem solving for lifestyle change. Following participation in Fit and Strong!, all study participants are randomly assigned to one of 2 maintenance treatment follow-up groups.</description>
