  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective was to determine if liver injury develops in alcoholic patients during or
      following 5 days of therapeutic acetaminophen dosing. Volunteers were recruited from two
      community detoxification centers to take either acetaminophen (4g/day) or placebo for 5
      consecutive days. All subjects were monitored an additional two days following the dosing
      period. The primary measures were aminotransferase measures taken at baseline and Days 2, 4,
      6 and 7. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in aminotransferase means between
      the groups at any study period.
