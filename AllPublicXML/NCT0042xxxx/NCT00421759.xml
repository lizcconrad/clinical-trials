  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to develop a non-invasive, noise-based technique for
      enhancing somatosensation and thereby improving balance control in elderly fallers and older
      adults with somatosensory deficits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that sub-sensory mechanical noise (i.e., random vibration with a
      small intensity) can enhance somatosensory function in healthy individuals and older adults
      with somatosensory deficits. Moreover, the postural sway of both healthy young and healthy
      elderly individuals during quiet standing can be significantly reduced by applying
      sub-sensory mechanical noise to the feet using vibrating shoe insoles.

      The specific aims of this project are to determine the effects of noise-enhanced
      somatosensation at the feet on balance performance in elderly individuals with somatosensory
      deficits and/or recurrent falls, and to assess whether adaptation occurs in noise-enhanced
      balance control in these individuals. To accomplish these aims, quiet-standing and dynamic
      posture studies and clinical balance assessments will be conducted on elderly individuals
      with somatosensory deficits and elderly individuals with recurrent falls (two or more falls
      over a 12-month period).

      This project could lead to the development of a novel bioengineering technique for improving
      balance control in older adults and patients with somatosensory deficits. The work could thus
      serve to reduce the frequency, morbidity and cost of falling, and assist aged individuals in
      achieving maximal independence in activities of daily living and mobility.

      Two groups of participants will be recruited from the RNH Epidemiology Core: 85 elderly
      individuals with somatosensory deficits, and 85 elderly individuals with recurrent falls. The
      study consists of three visits--a one-hour neurological exam, and two 6-hour laboratory
      testing sessions scheduled one week apart.

    <description>Participants wear vibrating sandals for 3 trials of 6 minutes, during a single lab visit. The sandal vibration is on during either first or second 3 minutes of the 6 minute trial, as they walk.
