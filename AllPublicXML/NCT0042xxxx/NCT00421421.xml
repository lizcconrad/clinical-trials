  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dutasteride at reducing
      relapse rates of Acute Urinary Retention (AUR), including reduction in surgical intervention
      for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), in patients who receive a 6 month treatment of
      dutasteride (0.5mg once daily) following a single episode of AUR followed by successful Trial
      Without Catheter compared with placebo.
