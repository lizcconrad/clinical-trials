        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and/or female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age. Female subjects must be
             surgically sterilized or postmenopausal (Postmenopausal women must have no regular
             menstrual bleeding for at least 2 years prior to inclusion. Menopause will be
             confirmed by a plasma FSH level of &gt;40 IU/L. Female subjects must have been surgically
             sterilized at least 6 months prior to screening. Surgical sterilization procedures
             must be supported with clinical documentation made available to sponsor and noted in

          -  Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study. The subjects must be able to provide written informed
             consent prior to study participation, thus excluding subjects with encephalopathy
             grade 3 or 4.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 to 32. For instructions and
             tables see Appendix 5.

        Hepatically impaired group:

          -  Subjects must have liver cirrhosis (hepatic fibrosis with evidence of either micro- or
             macro-nodular regeneration) confirmed by imaging techniques, ultrasound, MRI or CT.

          -  Subjects must have physical signs consistent with a clinical diagnosis of liver
             cirrhosis (e.g., liver firmness to palpation, splenic enlargement, spider angiomata,
             palmar erythema, parotid hypertrophy, testicular atrophy, gynecomastia).

             following ranges: oral body temperature between 35.0-37.5 °C systolic blood pressure,
             100-180 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure, 60-115 mm Hg pulse rate, 60 - 100 bpm

          -  Subjects with creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min (based on Cockcroft and
             Gault formula)

        Control group:

          -  Subjects must be in good health as determined by past medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Subjects should be matched to the hepatically impaired group in gender, age (±10%),
             smoking status, BMI (±10%).

          -  At Screening, and Baseline, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and
             pulse rate) will be assessed after the subject has rested for at least three (3)
             minutes, and again when required after three (3) minutes in the standing position.
             Vital signs should be within the following ranges: oral body temperature between
             35.0-37.5 °C systolic blood pressure, 90-140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure, 50-90 mm
             Hg pulse rate, 40 - 90 bpm When blood pressure and pulse will be taken again after 3
             minutes standing, there shall be no more than a 20 mm Hg drop in systolic or 10 mm Hg
             drop in diastolic blood pressure and increase in heart rate (&gt;20 bpm) associated with
             clinical manifestation of postural hypotension. All blood pressure measurements at
             other time-points should be assessed with the subject supine, unless stated otherwise
             in the protocol design, and utilizing the same arm for each determination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Control group and hepatically impaired group:
