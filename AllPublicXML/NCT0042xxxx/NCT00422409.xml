  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstruction of the digestive tract is a frequent cause of morbidity in patients with
      gastrointestinal cancer.Palliative endoscopic treatment with self- expanding metal
      stents(SEMS)is an alternative to palliative surgery and other palliative treatment
      options.The method has expanded to include patients with malignancies in the
      esophagus,gastroduodenal region, biliary tractus and colon. Numerous retrospective studies
      have reported treatment with SEMS to be safe and effective. Prospective studies,and
      especially studies regarding Quality of Life improvement are needed.

      PURPOSE:

      The purpose of this trial is to prospectively study the use and effect of selfexpanding metal
      stents(SEMS)in a defined population i Norway, especially Quality of Life changes.

      The study is divided into four projects:

        1. Establish a central register over all patients with malignant GI-obstruction who are
           treated with SEMS in the Eastern health region in Norway .Treatment incidence, methods
           used, treatment effect,complications related to the procedure,Need for reinterventions,
           hospitalisations and survival will be studied.

        2. Quality of life(QoL) studies will be performed before and 14 days after treatment.The
           EORTC QLQ C30 and EORTCs organospecific modules will be used.

        3. Gastric emptying before/after stent will be studied.

        4. Evaluate SEMS treatment of acute colon obstruction, as a permanent palliative treatment
           or as a &quot;bridge to surgery&quot;
