  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is characterised by memory loss and difficulties with thinking. These
      problems may be due to a deficiency in a brain chemical called acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
      helps transmit messages between nerve cells. Acetylcholine is degraded by an enzyme called
      &quot;acetylcholinesterase&quot;. ZT-1 is a new drug derived from a plant extract already used in China
      for memory disorders, which blocks the action of the enzyme and restores adequate levels of
      acetylcholine.

      This study will test the safety and efficacy of ZT-1 in the treatment of patients with
      Alzheimer's disease.

      BRAINz stands for Better Recollection for Alzheimer's patients with the Implant of ZT-1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, oral donepezil controlled
      study on the safety and efficacy of repeated monthly s.c. injections of a sustained-release
      implant of ZT 1 in patients with moderate Alzheimer's Disease.

      The study enrolls patients aged &gt;50 years, with moderate AD with a MMSE score at study
      screening ≥14 and ≤22. The study aims to recruit 128 patients.

      The study is divided into 3 periods:

        1. A screening period

        2. A 6-month treatment period, consisting of one month of titration with an oral medication
           and 5 months of treatment with an implant administered under the skin every 4 weeks.
           Oral treatment will be maintained throughout the treatment phase

        3. A 2 week follow-up period.

      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of 2 groups: the ZT-1 (investigational
      product) treatment group or the donepezil (active comparator) treatment group.

      The study comprises a total of 11 visits including screening and follow-up. An additional
      visit for PK/PD assessment is scheduled in about 10% of patients.
