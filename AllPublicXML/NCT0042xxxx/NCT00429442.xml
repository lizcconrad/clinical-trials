      A Double Blind, Randomised, Placebo Controlled Study Investigating Simvastatin as an add-on
      Treatment to Copaxone for the Treatment of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in patients treated
      with Copaxone for at least 3 months

    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, placebo controlled, randomised, phase 3 study. Patients that have
      been treated with Copaxone for at least 6 months at the screening visit will be randomised
      for treatment with simvastatin or placebo as an add-on to their Copaxone treatment. Patients
      will start treatment with 40 mg peroral simvastatin daily (or an apparently identical
      placebo) for one month. Hereafter, patients will escalate dosage to 80 mg daily. The patients
      will be examined clinically at screening, baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. Blood samples
      for immunology will be performed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Blood samples for
      safety assessments will be performed at all study visits. MRI will be performed (T1-weighted
      and T2-weighted) at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

               -  The patient must give written informed consent prior to any study related
                  activities. Study related activities are any procedures that would not have been
                  performed during normal management of the patient.

               -  Is between the age of 18 and 60 years (both included).

               -  Suffers from definite relapsing-remitting MS according to Poser criteria (CDMS or
                  LSDMS) 21 or definite MS according to McDonald criteria 22.

               -  Has a disability equivalent to an EDSS of 6.5 or less 20.

               -  Has shown clinical activity defined as at least one reported or documented
                  relapse within the last year or two reported or documented relapses within the
                  last two years.

               -  Has been treated with Copaxone for at least 3 months.

               -  The patient must be prepared to and considered able to follow the protocol during
                  the whole study period and to attend the planned visits, even if the treatment
                  has to be withdrawn.
