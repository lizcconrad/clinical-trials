      Diabetes Mellitus constitutes one of the most important public health problems due to its
      high prevalence and enormous social and economic consequences. Diabetic foot ulcers are one
      of the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus and constitute the most important cause of
      non-traumatic amputation of inferior limbs. It is estimated that 15% of diabetic population
      will develop an ulcer sometime in their life. Although novel therapies have been proposed,
      there is no effective treatment for this pathology. Naturally produced nitric oxide
      participates in the wound healing process by stimulating the synthesis of collagen,
      triggering the release of chemotactic cytokines, increasing blood vessels permeability,
      promoting angiogenic activity, stimulating the release of epidermal growth factors, and by
      interfering with the bacterial mitochondrial respiratory chain. Topically administered nitric
      oxide has demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of chronic ulcers secondary
      to cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, due to their unstable nitric oxide release, the topical
      donors needed to be applied frequently, diminishing the adherence to the treatment. This
      difficulty has led to the development of a multilayer polymeric transdermal patch produced by
      electrospinning technique that guarantees a constant nitric oxide release. The main objective
      of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this novel nitric oxide
      releasing wound dressing for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

      A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, including 100 diabetic patients was
      designed. At the time of enrollment, a complete medical evaluation and laboratory tests will
      be performed, and those patients who meet the inclusion criteria randomly assigned to one of
      two groups. During 90 days group 1 will receive active patches and group 2 placebo patches.
      The patients will be seen by the research group at least every two weeks until the healing of
      the ulcer or the end of the treatment. During each visit the healing process of the ulcer,
      the patient's health status and the presence of adverse events will be assessed. Should the
      effectiveness of the patches be demonstrated an alternative treatment would then be available
      to patients.

      Background

      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) constitutes one of the most important public health problems with a
      worldwide impact due to its high prevalence and enormous social and economic consequences. It
      is believed that there are more than 135 million diabetics, and this number is expected to
      increase to 300 million in the next 25 years (30% in developed and 70% in developing
      countries) [1;2].

      This epidemic is related to several factors like ethnicity, the longer life expectancy, and
      the epidemiological and nutritional transition in developing countries due to the
      urbanization process that brings about obesity and sedentarism [3;4]. In Colombia, the 2002
      basic health indicators showed a 2% prevalence of DM. However, it is believed that these
      numbers are underestimated [5]. Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) are one of the chronic
      consequences of DM which constitute the most important cause of non-traumatic amputation of
      the Inferior Limbs (IL), and are associated with high human, social and economic costs
      [6-11]. It is estimated that approximately 15% of the diabetic population will develop a DFU
      some time in their life [12-16].

      DFU is a consequence of two of the most frequent chronic complications of DM: Peripheral
      neuropathy and vascular insufficiency [12]. The combination of these factors in association
      with mechanic extrinsic and intrinsic aggressions, like feet bone deformations, triggers the
      ulcer formation. This polyfactorial etiopathology explains the multidisciplinary approach
      required for this disease [17-19].

      The early detection of risk factors for DFU may prevent their appearance [20-28]. This is why
      the monitoring of neuropathic, vascular and muscle-skeletal functions [29], the reinforcement
      of self care [30], the control of glycemic levels and the prevention of traumatic foot
      lesions [31-34], have a positive impact on the prevention of this pathology.

      The wound healing process involves the interaction of multiple cellular groups, extra
      cellular matrix molecules and growth factors [35], and is affected by vascular insufficiency,
      the severity of the lesion and the presence of infection [18;36].

      Immune and wound healing mechanism dysfunctions have been described in diabetic patients
      [37]. This alteration of the immune response is characterized by a decrease in the adherence
      of leukocytes to the capillary endothelium, chemotaxis damage and a reduction in the ability
      of polymorphonuclear cells to phagocyte and destroy bacteria due to a minor production of
      Nitric Oxide (NO) [38;39]. Diabetic patients also show a diminution in fibroblasts activity
      provoked by the unavailability of glucose for the aerobic metabolism, leading to inadequate
      fibrous collagen tissue proliferation [40]. The imbalance in these processes has been
      described as the main cause for the appearance and persistence of DFU [41].

      Alternative therapies for DFU have been proposed, such as tissue engineering, growth factors,
      hyperbaric oxygen therapy [42;43] and ketanserine [44;45]. Various types of products have
      also been used to keep the wound dry and covered (hydrogels, hydrocolloids, alginates and
      foams [46], however, there is no effective treatment for this pathology [47;48].

      In normal conditions, NO is continuously produced [49] and is tightly linked to many
      physiological processes, among which wound healing. It has been described that NO stimulates
      collagen synthesis [50], triggers the release of chemotactic cytokines [51], and has an
      important microbicidal effect by interfering with the enzymatic processes of the bacterial
      mitochondrial respiratory chain [52]. It also increases blood vessels permeability [53-56],
      promotes angiogenic activity, and stimulates the release of epidermal growth factors [57;58].

      Various studies , performed in murine models, have demonstrated the role of NO in the healing
      process. The levels of the final metabolic products from NO (nitrite and nitrate) rise during
      the first two days more than subsequently in the liquid recovered from the sponges previously
      placed in the subcutaneous tissue of healthy subjects' wounds [59], increase that is not
      observed in diabetic subjects [60], suggesting an impairment in the cutaneous production of
      NO in diabetic individuals. The topical use of NO accelerates the wound healing process of
      excisional wounds while NO inhibitors increase the healing time of these lesions [61;62]. The
      use of colloid NO donors in diabetic subjects shows an adequate granulation and closing of
      wounds [63;64].

      Our experience in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis with
      s-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), a NO donor, shows a beneficial effect without adverse
      events [65]. Moreover, a clinical trial is being conducted to study the effectiveness of a
      controlled NO releasing patch in the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis [66]. Currently,
      there are no studies using topical NO donors in humans with diabetic ulcers. Though the use
      of NO donors in healthy volunteers has shown an adequate NO diffusion rate to dermis, and an
      increase in the microcapillar blood flow [67], this method has demonstrated not to be
      effective due to the short half life and release span of NO [68].

      This difficulty in controlling the stability and release of NO has led to the development of
      a new NO releasing patch (NOP). This device, produced by the electrospinning technique [69],
      is a multilayer polymeric transdermal patch in which the principal components are stabilized
      and encapsulated in nanofibers which guarantees a constant NO release upon its hydration.

      Since it is well known that the system generates NO almost immediately, nitrite ions are
      bound to an ionic exchange resin (DOWEX®) in order to stabilize them, allowing a constant
      release of 3.5 µmol of NO during 12 hours [69] or more depending upon the dosage. This device
      has been tested by our group for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis obtaining
      encouraging results in the healing process with no report of serious adverse events [70].
      Since there is no specific effective treatment for DFU our group proposes to investigate the
      topical use of NOP, elaborated by the electrospinning technique, for the treatment of DFU.

      Objectives

      General Objective

      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NOP for the treatment of DFU.

      Specific Objectives

        1. To evaluate the healing process of DFU using a NOP compared with placebo.

        2. To assess the healing process of infected DFU using a NOP compared with placebo.

      type I error of 0.05. Assigning a successful rate of 30% in the control group and 60% in the
      active group, 95 participants will be needed. After adjusting for a loss rate of 5%, the
      total number of patients that must be recruited is 100 (50 patients per group).

      Population

      The population will be composed of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DM type 1 or 2 who
      present DFU, meet the inclusion criteria and don't present any criterion that could exclude
      them.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Men and women 18 years or older.

        2. Capacity of attending the visits at the research site.

           University score ≤2.

        5. Pharmacological treatment for glycemic control.

        6. Willingness to participate in the study and to sign the informed consent form.

           0.5.

        7. Clinical findings suggesting complicated venous insufficiency of IL.

        8. Distal necrosis of the limb with the ulcer.

        9. Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

       10. Mentally or neurologically disabled patients that are considered not fit to approve
           their participation in the study.

       11. Refusal to give informed consent.

      Study Development

      Logistic phase

      This phase will be managed by the physician in charge of the study and a professional nurse
      and will include the following activities.

        1. Acquisition of the materials required for the development of the project.

        2. Elaboration of flyers, promotional and educative material, procedures manual and Case
           Report Format (CRF).

      4. Training of personnel that will participate in the study. 5. Treatment randomization

      The treatment randomization will be realized by the epidemiologist of the Fundación
      Cardiovascular de Colombia (FCV). This randomization will be done in blocks in order to avoid
      long sequences of patients assigned to the same group and to reduce when possible, some of
      the bias inherent to the simple randomization process. Additionally, this randomization in
      blocks will facilitate the execution of interim analyses.

      Recruitment Phase

      Patients will attend the screening visit at the FCV or at the offices of the physicians
      involved in the study.

      Screening Visit

      During this visit a complete medical check-up, based on universally accepted techniques, will
      evaluate risk factors, DM complications, vascular and neuropathic compromise, medications and
      other therapies used for the treatment of DFU. The ankle/arm index will be obtained to rule
      out the presence of critical IL ischemia. The inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied
      and the selected candidates informed about the study after which they will sign an informed
      consent form. A blood sample will be withdrawn to determine the percentage of glycosylated
      hemoglobin (HbA1c), the levels of creatinine and fasting glucose, the hemogram, and the lipid
      profile.

      The laboratory of the Research Institute of FCV and the laboratories of every other center
      will be in charge of the processing of blood samples. All the tests will be elaborated using
      standard techniques.

        1. Glycosylated hemoglobin: Chromatography.

        2. Creatinine: Spectrophotometry.

        3. Hemogram: Manual method.

        4. Lipid profile: Spectrophotometry.

        5. Fasting glucose: Spectrophotometry.

      Initial Visit

      The selected patients will be scheduled for the initial visit. In this visit the patients
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Group 1 will receive NOP and Group 2
      placebo patches. A complete medical evaluation will be performed, the ulcers measured, and
      their pictures taken. Neuropathy will be assessed using the modified validated neuropathic
      impairment score (NDS) [71]. Before taking the pictures, a graduated ruler will be placed
      next to the ulcers with a sticker marked with the identification code of the participant and
      the date of the visit. The first patch (active or placebo) will be applied on the lesion. All
      the information obtained will be registered in the CRFs. The treatment previously prescribed
      for DM or other concomitant pathologies, and the medical, surgical or orthopedic therapies
      for DFU will be continued with the exception of topical treatment. The researchers will
      follow the guidelines of the International Diabetic Foot Consensus (CIPD). The patient and
      his/her family will receive information regarding the treatment of DFU, the correct technique
      for the daily application of the patches and the identification and notification of adverse
      events.

      Follow-up visits

      The treatment will last 90 days. During this period, the patients will be seen by the
      research group at least every two weeks until the healing of the ulcer or the end of the
      treatment. The frequency of the visits will vary depending on the clinical evolution of the
      patients. During each visit the healing process of the ulcer, the patient's health status and
      the presence of adverse events will be assessed. The patch will be applied and the evolution
      of the ulcers photographically registered. The maximum and minimum diameters of the ulcer
      will be measured using a graduated ruler and then registered in the CRF. The technique for
      the application of the patches, the identification of adverse events and the importance of
      reporting them, will be emphasized.

      Final Visit

      The final visit will take place at the end of the treatment or before in case of complete
      healing of the ulcer. A thorough medical evaluation, including laboratory tests will be
      performed along with the assessment of vascular and neuropathic compromise. The presence of
      adverse events will also be evaluated. The evolution of the ulcers will be documented by
      measuring their maximum and minimum diameters and by photographing them.

      National Coordination from Monitoring Center: Every six months a researcher from FCV will
      visit each center to evaluate the fulfillment of the protocol and the accomplishment of the
      Good Clinical Practice.

      Data base depuration phase

      After completing all the data entry to the CRF the results will be audited and the detected
      errors evaluated and corrected. The information will be entered in two different databases by
      two different people and the records compared to detect any discrepancy using a statistical
      software (Epi-Info 6.04). The mistakes will be corrected according to the CRF, and the
      corrections registered. Each patient will be identified using an internal code. All the
      photographs will be processed using a digital edition software.

      Statistical Analysis

      For the statistical analysis, Stata 8.0 will be used. The descriptive analysis will be
      composed of medians and proportions according to the nature of the variables, with their
      respective 95% confidence intervals. As a dispersion measurement the standard deviation will
      be calculated. The distribution of the variables will be studied using the Shapiro-Wilk test
      and the homoscedasticity of the variances with the Levene test. To detect any difference
      between the groups, a T-test or a Mann Whitney test will be performed according to the
      distribution of the variables. The categorical variables will be compared using the Chi2 test
      or the exact Fisher's test. If required, a model of multiple logistic regressions or a
      covariance analysis will be realized. Two interim analyses will be performed when 35 and 70%
      of the total sample is collected to determine differences in effectiveness and safety between
      the groups.

      Endpoints

      At the end of the treatment the following endpoints will be evaluated:

        1. Healing of the ulcer.

        2. Complete cure of the infection that was present before the treatment.

        3. Infection of the ulcers during the treatment.

        4. Presence of adverse events related to the application of the patches.

      Final report

      The results of the study will be evaluated and discussed and a final report presented to the
      Federación Diabetológica Colombiana (FDC), entity that is sponsoring the project. The results
      will be submitted for publication and presented in congresses and scientific meetings.

      Ethical Aspects

      This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the
      Colombian legislation as per the Resolution 8430/93 from the Ministry of Health. Prior to the
      admission of the patients in the study, the objectives and the methodology will be explained
      and a written informed consent obtained. The study was approved by the Research Ethics
      Committee of the FCV (Act# 075/April 27/2004). The patients' right to confidentiality will be
      maintained in all the phases of the study.

      Evaluation and management of adverse events

      During the visits the patients will be asked about adverse events. Each adverse event will be
      classified by the physician as serious or non-serious. A serious adverse event should meet
      one or more of the following criteria:

        1. Death

        2. Life-threatening

        3. Hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

        4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity

      The presence of a serious adverse event that puts the patient's life at risk and/or requires
      immediate medical or surgical procedure will call for the discontinuation of the treatment
      and the initiation of the pertinent medical management. The investigator will notify the
      Adverse Event Committee (AEC) of the FCV of any serious adverse event within 24 hours of
      learning about it.

      A non-serious adverse event will be classified as follows:

        1. Mild: The patient is aware of his/her symptoms and/or signs, but those are tolerable.
           Medical intervention or specific treatment is not required.

        2. Moderate: The patients present troubles that interfere with his/her daily activities.
           Medical intervention or specific treatment is required.

        3. Severe: The patient is unable to work or to attend his/her daily activities. Medical
           intervention or specific treatment is required.

      The possible relationship between the adverse events and the tested medication will be
      classified by the investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following
      definitions:

        1. Definitely related: Event can be fully explained by the administration of the tested
           medication.

        2. Probably related: Event is most likely to be explained by the administration of the
           tested medication rather than other medications or by the patient's clinical state.

        3. Possibly related: Event may be explained by the administration of the tested medication
           or other medications or by the patient's clinical state.

        4. Not related: Event is most likely to be explained by the patient's clinical state or by
           the use of other medications, rather than the tested one.

      All the events will be reported to the AEC that, depending on its criteria, will decide the
      continuity of the patient in the study and therefore the breaking of the code. Although the
      project has been designed to minimize the inherent risks, any adverse event related to the
      study medication will be carefully evaluated by the AEC and the costs generated by the
      required treatment covered by the study.
