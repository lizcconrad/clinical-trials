      This is an open label dose adjusted phase II trial of the oral farnesyltransferase inhibitor
      (FTI) lonafarnib (SCH66336) for patients with HGPS and progeroid laminopathies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare &quot;premature aging&quot; disease in which all
      children die at an average age of thirteen years (range 8-20 years) of severe atherosclerosis
      leading to strokes and heart attacks. It is a multisystem disease with objective clinical
      markers for disease progression. These include abnormalities in growth and body composition,
      bone mineral density, joint function, endocrine function, alopecia, and vascular disease.
      There is no effective therapy for any of the progressive and deleterious aspects of this
      disorder.

      The gene defect causing HGPS and most progeroid laminopathies has been identified as a
      mutation in the gene LMNA, coding for the nuclear protein lamin A. Lamin A is normally
      expressed by most differentiated cells, and requires posttranslational farnesylation to
      incorporate into the nuclear membrane. The lamin A C-terminal peptide, including the farnesyl
      group, is subsequently cleaved, and mature lamin A becomes a prominent component of the
      nuclear scaffold just internal to the nuclear membrane, affecting nuclear structure and
      function.

      In most cases, HGPS is a sporadic autosomal dominant disease caused by a single base
      alteration (henceforth designated as G608G) in the LMNA gene, which creates a cryptic splice
      site giving rise to an altered lamin A protein product in which 50 amino acids are deleted.
      The defective protein product in HGPS (henceforth progerin) lacks the cleavage site for
      removal of the C-terminal farnesylated peptide, and likely produces disease via dominant
      negative effects on the nuclear structure and function of various cell types that express
      lamin A. Most other progeroid laminopathies are caused by various mutations in the LMNA gene,
      which also subsequently creates abnormally functioning lamin A.

      Lonafarnib is a farnesyltransferase inhibitor that blocks the post-translational
      farnesylation of prelamin A and other proteins that are targets for farnesylation.
      Farnesylation is essential for the function of both mutant and non-mutant lamin A proteins,
      including progerin. Therefore, farnesyltransferase inhibitors are ideal candidates for
      treatment of HGPS, which is caused by a protein (progerin) that likely depends on carrying a
      farnesyl group to execute its aberrant functions.

      Both cell culture and mouse model studies of HGPS demonstrate improved phenotype after
      exposure to FTI. In vitro, exposure of HGPS skin fibroblasts and progerin-transfected HeLa
      cells to FTIs, including lonafarnib, prevents preprogerin from intercalating into the nuclear
      membrane where it normally functions, and eliminates nuclear deformity. In vivo, three
      Progeria-like mouse models show no appreciable signs of toxicity after FTI administration. In
      all three of these models, disease is significantly reduced when compared to age-matched
      controls after oral administration of FTI.

      We propose that clinical features of HGPS can be ameliorated or reversed by blocking
      posttranslational farnesylation via treating patients with lonafarnib. We hypothesize that
      reduction of the quantity of functional progerin or, in the case of other progeroid
      laminopathies, other abnormal lamin proteins, will improve disease signs, symptoms and
      outcome. We also hypothesize that the toxicity profile of FTI inhibition using lonafarnib
      will be similar to that observed in children with malignant brain tumors treated with the
      compound.

    <description>Activity was assessed by determining the change in rate of weight gain over two years from baseline (determined pre-therapy for each patient).
Primary outcome success was predefined as a 50% increase over pre-therapy in estimated annual rate of weight gain, or change from pre-therapy weight loss to statistically significant on-study weight gain.</description>

    <description>Lonafarnib will be taken orally, twice per day, by all patients enrolled on this study. The drug is supplied to patients in capsule form, and for patients who are unable to swallow pills, the drug may be dissolved into solution. Every patient will start lonafarnib therapy at a dose of 115mg/kg. The study allows for patients to receive a dose escalation (up to 150mg/kg) if the drug is being well-tolerated. Every patient enrolled on this study will undergo two years of lonafarnib therapy.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Successful Rate of Weight Gain</title>
        <description>Activity was assessed by determining the change in rate of weight gain over two years from baseline (determined pre-therapy for each patient).
Primary outcome success was predefined as a 50% increase over pre-therapy in estimated annual rate of weight gain, or change from pre-therapy weight loss to statistically significant on-study weight gain.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed at weeks 16, 32, 52, 68, 84 and 104</time_frame>
        <population>Results are reported for the 25 patients with classic HGPS who completed at least 2y of therapy. One additional patient with a prior history of strokes died of a stroke after 5 mo on study and is not included in the analysis. Two additional patients had nonclassic mutations and are not included in this analysis.</population>

            <description>Lonafarnib (Merck &amp; Co., Inc.) dosing was initiated at 115 mg/m2 and was increased to 150 mg/m2 after an adjustment period of at least 4 mo. Dosage was reduced back to 115 mg/m2 for patients experiencing drug-related grade 3 or 4 toxicity and also not responding to supportive care. Once dosage was reduced, patients were permitted to increase the dose of lonafarnib. Patients received oral lonafarnib either by capsule or liquid suspension dispersed in Ora-Blend SF or Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories, Inc.) every 12 Â± 2 h for a period of 24â€“29 mo.</description>
