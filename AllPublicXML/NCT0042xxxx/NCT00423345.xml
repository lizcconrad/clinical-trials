  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Registration of patients referred for colon investigation by barium enema, CT colonography
      and colonoscopy in two hospitals and one radiology centre in Telemark, Norway, for a period
      of minimum six months. Indications, delay and results of procedure will be
      recorded.Hypothesis: Choice of procedure for colon investigation is not based solely on
      clinical indication, but factors like delay, patient preference, lack of knowledge about the
      the procedures by the referring physician may have a decisive influence. The study will also
      analyse the correlation between patients symptoms, clinical findings and laboratory results
      and major pathology findings by colon investigation. Further, delay from patientÂ´s first
      symptoms to finally diagnosis by colon investigation will also be registered and analysed.
