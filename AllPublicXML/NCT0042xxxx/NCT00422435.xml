          -  A single de novo lesion per study subject may be treated with the study device

          -  Each target lesion may be composed of multiple lesions but must be completely
             coverable by 1 study stent

          -  Cumulative target lesion length per vessel ≤30 mm based on a visual estimate

          -  RVD ≥2.5 mm to ≤3.0 mm based on a visual estimate

          -  Target vessel has not undergone prior revascularization within the preceding 6 months

          -  Target lesion must be a minimum 10 mm distance from any previously treated segment of
             the target vessel

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known sensitivity to cobalt chromium, paclitaxel or polymeric matrices: Translute or
             PLGA

          -  Planned treatment with any other PCI device in the target vessel(s)

          -  Co-morbid condition(s) that could limit the patient's ability to participate in the
             study, compliance with follow-up requirements or impact the scientific integrity of
             the study

          -  Currently participating in another investigational drug or device study that has not
             completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the endpoints of
             this study

          -  Left main coronary artery disease (stenosis &gt;50%), whether protected or unprotected

          -  Target lesion is ostial in location (within 3.0 mm of vessel origin)

          -  Target lesion and/or target vessel proximal to the target lesion is severely calcified
             by visual estimation

          -  Target lesion involves a bifurcation with a diseased (&gt;50% stenotic) branch vessel
             &gt;2.0 mm in diameter that requires intervention

          -  Target lesion is totally occluded Thrombolysis In MI (TIMI flow ≤1)

          -  Angiographic presence of probable or definite thrombus

          -  Target vessel will be pre-treated with an unapproved device, directional or rotational
             coronary atherectomy, laser, cutting balloon or transluminal extraction catheter
             immediately prior to stent placement

          -  Prior coronary intervention using brachytherapy to any segment of the target vessel

          -  The target vessel has had prior drug-eluting stent placement to vessel segment (or
             branch) proximal to intended target lesion site

          -  Angiographic restenosis of any segment of the target vessel that has undergone prior
             percutaneous coronary intervention

          -  Angiographic evidence of atherosclerotic disease with &gt; 50% diameter stenosis (by
             visual estimate) proximal or distal to the target lesion (applies to the major
             epicardial portion of the target vessel and contiguous vessel segment if the target
             lesion is located in a branch vessel)
