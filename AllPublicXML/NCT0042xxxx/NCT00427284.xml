  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate wether endothelial dysfunction associated with
      stable coronary artery disease is altered by selective aldosterone antagonism with Eplerenone
      as potential anti-inflammatory drug versus placebo.

      Additionally we hypothesize that selective aldosterone antagonism reduces systemic
      inflammatory response such as C-reactive proteine, oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory
      cytokines.
