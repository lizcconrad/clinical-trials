        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with persistency of symptoms and requiring antibiotics for bacterial upper
             respiratory tract infections, i.e. complicated acute otitis media (diagnosed by
             otoscopic examination) or beta-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis
             (diagnosed by pharyngeal swab and rapid antigen detection test or positive culture);

          -  Outpatients or patients attending an emergency room for both diagnoses, and inpatients
             in case of complicated acute otitis media;

          -  Written informed consent from both parents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of clinically significant chronic diseases, or chronic diseases necessitating
             the use of continuous drug therapies, or of any disease that may interfere with the
             successful completion or the objectives of the trial;

          -  Clinical evidence of relevant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, hematological, neurological or of any disease that may interfere
             with the successful completion or the objectives of the trial;

          -  Use of antibiotics, prebiotics or probiotics (medications or dietetic supplements) in
             the last 2 weeks prior to study entry;

          -  Hypersensitivity to the investigational product;

          -  Subjects enrolled in another trial in the previous three months.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
