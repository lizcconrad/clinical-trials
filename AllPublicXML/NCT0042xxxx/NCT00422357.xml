  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder worldwide. Some herbs are
      traditionally used in treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Urtica Dioica (UD) or
      stinging nettle is traditionally used in Morocco, Turkey, Brasil, Jordan and with much
      frequency in northern Iran.

      Studies on animal models along with in vitro studies has shown hypoglycemic effect for
      aqueous extract of UD.

      This study aimed to investigate hypoglycemic effects of UD tea bags in patients with T2DM on
      glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, along with its effects on lipid profile (LP), blood
      pressure (BP), liver, and kidney function.

      The study will be performed under randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, and
      case-control design. The object of this study is patients with T2DM. Patients are randomly
      assigned to start with placebo tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in boiling
      water for 20 minutes: mixture of bran powder which is already boiled in water twice plus
      spinach powder) in control groups and UD tea bags (3 tea bags as 2-gram tea bag steamed in
      boiling water for 20 minutes) in patients with T2DM for two months. Every two weeks, fasting
      glucose, postprandial glucose after a standard breakfast, serum insulin, lipids, alanine
      amino transferase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), creatinine (to calculate GFR),
      along with blood pressure will be measured.

      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Randomized Clinical Trial.
