      The purpose of this research is to find whether or not there are differences in the executive
      functions during &quot;shopping&quot; in a &quot;virtual mall&quot;, between children with Acquired Brain Injury
      (ABI) vs healthy children.

      The hypothesis is that there will be differences in time (more time to shop) and mistakes
      (more mistakes during shopping), in the ABI group.
