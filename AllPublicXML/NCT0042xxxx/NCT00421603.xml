  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol is a double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study of the safety
      and efficacy of Adderall-XR (ER-MAS) and topiramate in the treatment of cocaine dependence.
      Since both of these medications have independently shown promise in helping with cocaine
      abuse we are proposing that together they may be even more successful in the treatment of
      cocaine abuse. We plan to enroll 120 subjects in a 14-week trial. The primary objective of
      the study is to determine the efficacy of ER-MAS and topiramate in promoting cocaine
      abstinence among cocaine-dependent patients. This study includes free treatment for cocaine
      dependence that includes medication.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of ER-MAS and topiramate in promoting cocaine
      abstinence among cocaine-dependent patients.

      Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of participants achieving sustained cocaine abstinence
      (via urine toxicology) for three consecutive weeks during the study will be significantly
      greater for the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

      Hypothesis 2: The proportion of urine samples negative for cocaine metabolites will be
      greater in the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

      Hypothesis 3: The pattern of cocaine use (amount of cocaine used per day in dollars and the
      number of using days per week), as measured by the time-line follow-back method, will show a
      greater reduction in use for the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo
      group.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of ER-MAS and topiramate on cocaine craving among
      cocaine-dependent patients.

      Hypothesis 4: Cocaine craving symptoms will be reduced to a greater degree in the combined
      pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

      Specific Aim 3: To explore a set of related secondary outcomes (treatment retention, global
      functioning, HIV risk behavior) as well as moderators and mediators potentially reflective of
      mechanism of action.

    <measure>Three Weeks of Continuous Cocaine Abstinence as Measured by Urine Toxicology and Self Report Based on Time Line Follow Back</measure>
    <time_frame>3 weeks of abstinence during 14 weeks of trial or for length of participation</time_frame>
    <description>Cocaine use was assessed by using urine toxicology confirmed self-report. Self-reported cocaine use data was collected for each day of the study period by the Time Line Follow Back. Urine samples were collected three times per week. A week was considered abstinence if no cocaine use was self reported during that week and if all urine samples collected that week were negative for cocaine. If a patient achieved three continuous weeks of abstinence based on this criteria they were considered cocaine abstinent in terms of this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Three Weeks of Continuous Cocaine Abstinence as Measured by Urine Toxicology and Self Report Based on Time Line Follow Back</title>
        <description>Cocaine use was assessed by using urine toxicology confirmed self-report. Self-reported cocaine use data was collected for each day of the study period by the Time Line Follow Back. Urine samples were collected three times per week. A week was considered abstinence if no cocaine use was self reported during that week and if all urine samples collected that week were negative for cocaine. If a patient achieved three continuous weeks of abstinence based on this criteria they were considered cocaine abstinent in terms of this outcome measure.</description>
