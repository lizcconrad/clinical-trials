    <textblock>
      This study assesses the aerosol delivery characteristics (measured by nebulization time,
      serum and sputum tobramycin pharmacokinetic parameters) and safety of tobramycin administered
      for inhalation by PARI eFlow rapid electronic nebulizer (no compressor) vs. PARI LC PLUS Jet
      Nebulizer (with compressor) in subjects with cystic fibrosis.
