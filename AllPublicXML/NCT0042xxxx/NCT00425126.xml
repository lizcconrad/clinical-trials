  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed graft function (DGF) is a major complication following deceased donor renal
      transplantation. The surgical procedure of harvesting a kidney from a cadaveric donor and
      implanting the kidney into the recipient inevitably causes some amount of injury. While not
      always clinically significant, anywhere from 10-50% of transplant patients may develop DGF.
      Ongoing research in animal models has demonstrated benefit with administration of
      erythropoietin. The investigators propose to study the effect of Procrit(Epoetin Alfa) on
      delayed graft function in subjects undergoing kidney transplantation.
