    <textblock>
      multicenter, randomized (1:1), semi-single blind study comparing the safety and efficacy of
      HDSD daptomycin (10 mg/kg q24h for 4 days) with that of comparator (vancomycin +/- SSP for
      7-14 days) in patients with cSSSI due to Gram-positive bacteria. Patients will be randomized
      on a 1:1 basis to receive either daptomycin 10 mg/kg i.v. q24h for 4 days or vancomycin 1 g.
      q12h for up to 14 days.

      The main criteria for evaluation will be:

        -  Efficacy

        -  Safety

        -  Microbiologic eradication
