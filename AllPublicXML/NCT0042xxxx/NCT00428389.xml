  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching from donepezil
      to an initial dose of 5cm^2 rivastigmine patch formulation in patients with probable
      Alzheimer's Disease (MMSE 10-24). The study included a 5-week, open-label, randomized period
      followed by a 20-week open-label extension period. Patients were randomized to either an
      immediate switch from donepezil to rivastigmine patch formulation or to a switch to
      rivastigmine patch formulation following a 7-day withdrawal period.

    <time_frame>Baseline through the end of the core phase of the study (Week 5)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 paradigms for switching from donepezil to rivastigmine patch in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary variable to assess tolerability of switching was the number of participants who discontinued from the study due to any reason during the core phase.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) Score at Week 5 and Week 25</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 5 (end of the core phase) and Week 25 (end of the extension phase)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC is an assessment tool used by a skilled clinician to make a judgment of the severity or a change of a patient's condition. The clinician relies solely on information obtained from the patient at the Baseline visit as well as clinical information obtained throughout the study period. The clinician does not have access to any post-baseline cognitive testing data. The CGIC is rated on a seven-point scale, ranging from (1) &quot;very much improved&quot; to (4) &quot;no change&quot; to (7) &quot;very much worse&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) Score at Week 25 and at the End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 25 (end of the extension phase) and at the end of study</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory - 10 Item (NPI-10) Score at Week 25 and at the End of Study.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 25 (end of the extension phase) and at End of Study</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI-10 assesses a wide range of behavior problems encountered in dementia patients. The 10 behavioral domains comprising the NPI-10 are evaluated through an interview of the caregiver by a mental health professional. The scale includes both frequency and severity ratings of each domain as well as a composite domain score (frequency x severity). The sum of the composite scores for the 10 domains yields the NPI total score, which ranges from 0 to 120, the lower the score the less severe the symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Total Score at Week 25 and at the End of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 25 (end of the extension phase) and at the end of Study</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL scale is composed of 23 items to assess the basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item are obtained through a caregiver interview. The total score is the sum of all items and sub-questions. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78; a higher score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the immediate switch group continued treatment with donepezil through the evening prior to Day 8 of the study. On Day 8, all patients began open-label treatment with 5 cm^2 rivastigmine patch formulation. A new patch was applied daily for 4 weeks. Patients who completed the core phase had the option of entering the extension phase, in which they received open-label treatment with rivastigmine patch formulation for an additional 20 weeks. In the absence of any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs), the dose was increased to 10 cm^2 patch, and it remained the same through Week 25. Patients who experienced dose-limiting AEs had their dose reduced to 5 cm^2 patch and continued on their best tolerated dose for the remainder of the study.</description>

          <description>Patients randomized to the delayed switch group were switched to 5 cm^2 rivastigmine patch formulation on Day 8, following a 7-day withdrawal period from donepezil. A new patch was applied daily for 4 weeks. Patients who completed the core phase had the option of entering the extension phase, in which they received open-label treatment with rivastigmine patch formulation for an additional 20 weeks. In the absence of any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs), the dose was increased to 10 cm^2 patch, and it remained the same through Week 25. Patients who experienced dose-limiting AEs had their dose reduced to 5 cm^2 patch and continued on their best tolerated dose for the remainder of the study.</description>

        <description>A secondary assessment of the safety and tolerability of 2 paradigms for switching from donepezil to rivastigmine patch in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) was the number of participants who discontinued from the study due to any reason during extension phases of the study.</description>
        <time_frame>From week 5 through the end of extension phase (25 weeks)</time_frame>
        <population>The Safety population consisted of all randomized patients who had at least 1 post-baseline safety assessment. Patients were analyzed according to the treatment received.</population>

            <description>Patients randomized to the immediate switch group continued treatment with donepezil through the evening prior to Day 8 of the study. On Day 8, all patients began open-label treatment with 5 cm^2 rivastigmine patch formulation. A new patch was applied daily for 4 weeks. Patients who completed the core phase had the option of entering the extension phase, in which they received open-label treatment with rivastigmine patch formulation for an additional 20 weeks. In the absence of any dose-limiting adverse events (AEs), the dose was increased to 10 cm^2 patch, and it remained the same through Week 25. Patients who experienced dose-limiting AEs had their dose reduced to 5 cm^2 patch and continued on their best tolerated dose for the remainder of the study.</description>

The 10 behavioral domains comprising the NPI-10 are evaluated through an interview of the caregiver by a mental health professional. The scale includes both frequency and severity ratings of each domain as well as a composite domain score (frequency x severity). The sum of the composite scores for the 10 domains yields the NPI total score, which ranges from 0 to 120, the lower the score the less severe the symptoms.

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Total Score at Week 25 and at the End of Study</title>
          <description>The ADCS-ADL scale is composed of 23 items to assess the basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item are obtained through a caregiver interview. The total score is the sum of all items and sub-questions. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78; a higher score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
          <population>The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population included all randomized patients who entered the switch period for at least 1 day and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of tolerability/safety. This outcome used observed cases without imputation (OC).</population>
