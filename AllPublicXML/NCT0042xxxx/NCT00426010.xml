  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to measure the effect of placebo by elimination as well as by a &quot;balanced placebo&quot;
      design, determine its interaction with active drug, and explore whether placebo exerts part
      of its effect at the pharmacokinetics level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placebos have been in use for centuries in medical practice. However, there is continued
      controversy regarding their effectiveness and mechanisms of action.

      The results of the study are expected to further our understanding of a widely used medical
      intervention, i.e., placebo, and of how to maximize its potential beneficial effect. It will
      also help assess the appropriateness of measuring the placebo effect by elimination, which
      has important ethical implications in relation to the design of randomized clinical trials.

      Comparison: caffeine vs placebo. Dependent variables:4 hours area under the curve (AUC) of
      pharmacodynamics endpoints as well as pharmacokinetics endpoints in a subgroup.
