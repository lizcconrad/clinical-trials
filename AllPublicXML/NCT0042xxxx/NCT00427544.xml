    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to asess the safety and tolerability of ascending single
      oral doses of PRA-027 in healthy women of nonchildbearing potential. The secondary purpose is
      to provide the initial pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of PRA-027 in
      healthy women of nonchildbearing potential, and to evaluate the effect of a high-fat meal on
      the PK and PD of PRA-027 administered to healthy women of nonchildbearing potential.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Women of nonchildbearing potential (WONCBP) aged 18 to 60 years. Must have a negative
             pregnancy test result within 48 hours before administration of test article. Women who
             are surgically sterile must provide documentation of the procedure by an operative
             report or ultrasound scan.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) in the range of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 and body weight ³50 kg. BMI
             is calculated by taking the subject's weight, in kilograms, divided by the square of
             the subject's height, in meters, at screening: BMI=weight (kg)/[height (m)]2

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator on the basis of screening evaluations.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Any significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory, gynecologic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or
             psychiatric disease.

          -  A history of drug abuse within 1 year before study day 1, a history of alcoholism
             within 1 year before study day 1 or consumption of more than 2 standard units of
             alcohol per day (a standard unit equals 12 ounces of beer, 1½ ounces of 80-proof
             alcohol, or 6 ounces of wine). Any positive findings during the urine drug screen for
             amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and
             opiates.

          -  Use of any investigational or prescription drug within 30 days before test article
             administration. Consumption of any caffeine-containing products (eg, coffee, tea,
             chocolate, or soda) or alcoholic beverages within 48 hours before study day 1.
             Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit-containing products within 72 hours before
             study day 1. Use of any over-the-counter drugs, including herbal supplements (except
             for the occasional use of acetaminophen and vitamins ≤100% of the recommended daily
             allowance) within 14 days before study day 1.
