  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of a standard smoking cessation treatment, including one-time
      brief counseling and provision of nicotine patch plus an 8-week moderate intensity exercise
      program versus the same standard smoking cessation treatment plus equivalent contact control
      among 60 healthy women. We hypothesize that participants in the smoking cessation plus
      moderate intensity exercise condition will be more likely to quit smoking than participants
      in the smoking cessation treament plus contact control condition.

      This study compares the effects of a standard smoking cessation treatment, including one-time
      brief counseling and provision of nicotine patch plus an 8-week moderate intensity exercise
      program versus the same standard smoking cessation treatment plus equivalent contact control
      among 60 healthy women. A number of techniques will be used to increase compliance with the
      treatment program, thus more effectively isolating the effects of exercise. These include:
      (1) a two-week run-in period prior to randomization; (2) use of behavioral contracting prior
      to participant randomization; and (3) performance of all exercise on-site. Smoking cessation
      outcomes (continuous abstinence and point prevalence abstinence) will be verified by carbon
      monoxide and saliva cotinine. Physical activity will be evaluated by attendance at the
      supervised sessions. We hypothesize that participants in the smoking cessation plus moderate
      intensity exercise condition will be more likely to quit smoking than participants in the
      smoking cessation treament plus contact control condition.
