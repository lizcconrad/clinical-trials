      The aim of this search is to realize the subjective experiences of employment among
      schizophrenic patients by qualitative analysis. We plan to recruit 50 people diagnosed with
      schizophrenia and divide into two groups, employment and unemployment. Every subjects will
      complete the demographic data, the evaluation of severity of disease, the record of
      medication and an intensive interview about their employment experiences. Finally, we will
      analysis the thick descriptions to understand how schizophrenic patients interpret their
      employment experiences and which factors will affect their successful employment.
