  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) pemetrexed has on
      patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.

      -  1 cycle is equal to 21 days. Every 21 days the following will be performed: a review of
           the patients symptoms and medications; physical exam; blood tests; vital signs; and
           pemetrexed infusion.

        -  Every 3 cycles (9 weeks) an assessment of disease extent by CT scan and a 24 hour urine
           collection (if applicable) will be performed.

        -  Before patients start receiving pemetrexed, they will be given folic acid, vitamin B12
           and dexamethasone to help reduce the chance of significant side effects. Dexamethasone
           will be taken the evening before, the morning before and the evening after receiving
           pemetrexed. Folic acid should be taken daily beginning 5-7 days before the first dose of
           pemetrexed and should be continued for three weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.
           Vitamin B12 will be given as an injection 1-2 weeks before the first dose of pemetrexed
           and once every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.

        -  Patients can continue to receive treatment with pemetrexed unless there is evidence that
           their tumor has grown or they are experiencing serious side effects.

        -  Immediately after the patient has completed the study, they will be given a physical
           exam, including vital signs, a CT scan, and blood tets. The study staff will continue to
           monitor the patients health either by clinic visits or phone calls every three months
           for the remainder of your life.
