        Inclusion Criteria

          1. HCC diagnosed by histology or clinical evidence supported by liver mass(es) at least
             2cm in the longest diameter and AFP equal to or more than 500 ng/mL in cirrhosis or
             chronic HBV or HCV infection27.

          2. Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Patients who have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          4. Patients who have at least one uni-dimensional measurable lesion by CT-scan or MRI
             according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

          5. Patients who have an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 - 2 (see Appendix 4).

          6. Patients who have received local therapy, such as surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic
             arterial embolization, chemo-embolization, radio-frequency ablation or cryo-ablation
             are eligible, provided that they either have a target lesion which has not been
             subjected to local therapy and/or the target lesion(s) within the field of the local
             therapy has shown an increase of ≥ 25% in the size. Furthermore, the local therapy
             applied to target or non-target lesions needs to have been completed at least 8 weeks
             prior to study inclusion. Lesions treated with external beam radiation therapy are not
             acceptable as target lesions, unless they fulfil the conditions described above.

          7. No more than one prior chemotherapy based regimen is allowed. Patients can receive up
             to two regimes where target therapies have been used (washout)

          8. Cirrhotic status of Child-Pugh Class A or B only (Appendix 5).

          9. Adequate hepatic function at screening as assessed by the following:

               -  Platelet count ≥ 60 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 8.5 g/dl

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 3 mg/dl

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 x the upper limit of normal

               -  PT-INR ≤ 2.3 or PT ≤ 6 seconds above control

         10. Patients who give written informed consent prior to any study specific screening
             procedures with the understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the
             study at any time, without prejudice.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Previous malignancy (except for cervical carcinoma in situ, adequately treated basal
             cell carcinoma, or superficial bladder tumors [Ta, Tis and T1] or other malignancies
             curatively treated &gt; 2 years prior to entry)

          2. Congestive heart failure &gt; NYHA Class II

          3. Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrythmics (excluding beta blockers or digoxin for
             chronic stable atrial fibrillation) or QTc greater than 450 msec.

          4. Active coronary artery disease or cardiac ischemia

          5. Active clinically serious bacterial, viral or fungal infections (&gt; grade 2 NCI-CTCAE,
             Version 3)

          6. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for less than 2 years or
             uncontrolled disease on antiretroviral medication

          7. Metastatic brain or meningeal tumors

          8. Patients with seizure disorder requiring medication (such as anti-epileptics)

          9. History of confusion or dementia or neurological condition that could mask a potential
             adverse response to the study drug (or something along these lines)

         10. History of organ allograft

         11. Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with
             the patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results

         12. Known or suspected allergy to the investigational agent or any agent given in
             association with this trial

         13. Any condition that is unstable or which could jeopardize the safety of the patient and
             his/her compliance in the study

         14. Pregnant or breast-feeding patients. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test performed within 14 days prior to the start of study drug.
             Both men and women enrolled in this trial must use adequate barrier birth control
             measures during the course of the trial
