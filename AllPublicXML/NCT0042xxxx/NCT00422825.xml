  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, four-treatment, four period, crossover study to evaluate the effect
      of food on the relative bioavailability of a single dose of imatinib (STI571) given as a 800
      mg modified release tablet, MR2 compared to twice-daily doses of 400 mg film-coated imatinib
      tablets. There will be a 10 day wash out phase between treatments and a 1 week safety period
      at the end of the study. Each participant will receive all four treatments
