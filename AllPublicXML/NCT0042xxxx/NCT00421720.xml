  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label study will compare two analgesia-based
      regimens for sedation (remifentanil/propofol vs. sufentanil/propofol) in medium to long-term
      ventilated intensive care patients in terms of efficacy, safety and resource utilization.

      The special characteristics of intensive care patients (organ insufficiencies etc.) regularly
      cause an accumulation of the analgesics, sedatives and adjuvants used. Clinically, this
      complicates the calculation of weaning and extubation times, often making mechanical
      ventilation necessary for longer periods than desired and also extending the stay of patients
      in the intensive care unit. Reducing weaning times and the duration of intensive care
      treatment by optimizing analgesia/sedation could furthermore lead to a reduction in typical
      complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or delirium.

      The demands on an ideal analgesic are analgesic efficacy without severe cardiopulmonary
      depression and rapid onset of effect and in particular a short dura-tion of effect and
      absence of accumulation or development of active metabolites. Remifentanil is an ultra-short
      acting µ-agonist which is, due to its molecular structure, metabolized organ-independently by
      unspecific blood and tissue esterases with the substance being degraded within only a few
      minutes and the resulting metabolites being virtually ineffective at the µ-receptor.
      Sufentanil, on the other hand, is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P-450-3A4 enzyme in
      the liver and small intestine.

      To date, only one study with a small sample size is available on the comparison of the
      effectiveness and safety of remifentanil and sufentanil when used for long-term
      analgesia/sedation.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Written informed consent was obtained from the patient

          -  The patient is under intensive medical care, intubated and ventilated

          -  The expected duration of ventilation and analgesia/sedation is &gt; 24 hours and &lt;/= 7
             days

          -  Propofol is planned to be used as sedative

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          -  Contraindication against administration of remifentanil, sufentanil, or propofol

          -  Concomitant medications:

          -  The patient is receiving epidural analgesia or a peripheral regional anesthetic
             therapy.

          -  The patient is requiring muscle relaxants to facilitate mechanical ventilation

          -  The patient participated in clinical drug trials within the previous 30 days or
             participated in this clinical trial before or is currently participating in any other
             clinical trial

          -  The patient has a known hypersensitivity to the drugs under investigation or to

          -  For female patients: the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  The patient is classified as ASA V or moribund

          -  The patient must be expected to show an impaired cerebral or neurologic capacity due
             to illness, trauma or other interventions, which will interfere with the collection of
             the analgesia/sedation scores and the waking behavior as for example, without being
             limited to:

          -  Hypoxic brain damage

          -  Cerebrocranial trauma grades II, III, and IV

             level 3

          -  The patient is alcohol or drug dependent (legal or illegal drugs in particular, but

          -  Typically an urgent desire to take the substance, problems in controlling consumption,
             and persistent use of the substance despite adverse consequences. The use of the
             substance has priority over other activities and responsibilities. Developing
             increased tolerance and occasionally physical withdrawal symptom.

          -  The patient suffers from a manifest organ failure

          -  The patient has a history of or actually suffers from ventricular tachycardia,
             ventricular flutter or ventricular fibrillation
