  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will determine the pharmacokinetic profile of patupilone in patients with
      mild or moderately impaired hepatic function within 2 cycles of treatment. The study
      population for this trial consists of patients with a documented advanced solid tumor.
      Patients will be stratified into 3 groups: those with normal liver function, and those with
      mild or moderate liver dysfunction.
