  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the addition of galantamine to a commonly
      used antidepressant, escitalopram (Lexapro), will be useful in the treatment of memory and
      other thinking problems that are frequently seen in depression. At present, galantamine is
      approved for use in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, but not for use for the
      treatment of depression in younger patients.

      Possible genetic effects of depressed individuals will also be studied. This study is
      involved in collecting blood from patients with depression. DNA, the genetic material in our
      cells, will be obtained from these blood samples. The DNA will be studied to determine the
      contribution of different genes to the development of depression. These blood samples are
      extremely useful to researchers who are trying to determine the genetic risk factors that may
      lead to depression.

      HYPOTHESES/OBJECTIVES

      Aim 1: To investigate whether patients treated with escitalopram in combination with
      galantamine will show a significantly greater improvement of depression compared to patients
      treated with escitalopram alone.

      H1: Patients treated with escitalopram and galantamine combination will have significantly
      greater improvement on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Clinical Global
      Improvement (CGI) scale compared to patients treated with escitalopram and placebo.

      Aim 2: To investigate whether treatment with escitalopram in combination with galantamine
      will lead to a greater improvement of cognitive function in depressed patients compared to
      escitalopram alone.

      H2: Patients treated with escitalopram and galantamine combination will have significantly
      greater improvement of scores on Selective Reminding Test (SRT) and Trail Making Test (TMT)
      than patients treated with escitalopram and placebo.

      Study Design and Method:

      This will be a randomized, single blind, parallel-group, placebo controlled study in which a
      total of 20 subjects, 10 in each arm: one arm would be escitalopram + galantamine treatment
      and the other arm will be escitalopram + placebo treatment. The subject will be blinded
      against the galantamine or placebo, but will be unblinded against escitalopram. The total
      duration of this study will be 10 weeks. After the baseline visit, patients will complete 8
      weeks of the study medication.
