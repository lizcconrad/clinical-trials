    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Response as Determined by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% Improvement (ACR20)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>ACR20 defined as overall score of ≥20 in ACR number (ACRn) calculation. Overall score defined as lowest percent improvement from baseline (BL) of following 3 measures: tender joint count (TJC; 68 joints), swollen joint count (SJC: 66 joints), and the 3rd lowest improvement achieved by at least 3 of 5 remaining ACR core parameters: physician's global assessment of disease activity, participant's global assessment of disease activity, participant's assessment of pain (visual analog assessment [VAS]), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). If CRP missing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was used. In order for improvements in the ACRn score to be expressed as a positive result, rather than the negative changes that improvements represent, the final ACRn results were multiplied by negative 1. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) for TJC/SJC, HAQ, CRP/ESR, VAS. If change in CRP incalculable, change in ESR used. ACR20 set to Non-Responder if ACRn missing</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score From BL at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F scores were obtained from a 13 question self-administered participant questionnaire designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants responded to the questions using a value between 0 and 4, where 0 indicated &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 indicated &quot;very much.&quot; 11 of the 13 questions were negatively stated; indicating the higher the score of the participant's response, the greater their fatigue. These questions were calculated as 4 minus the participants' response, so that a higher score indicated an improvement in health. The scores for the 2 positively stated questions were not changed. The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, which are scored 0 to 52 (52 = highest level of functioning). A positive change from BL indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>ACR20 defined as overall score of ≥20 in ACR number (ACRn) calculation. Overall score defined as lowest percent improvement from baseline (BL) of following 3 measures: tender joint count (TJC; 68 joints), swollen joint count (SJC: 66 joints), and the 3rd lowest improvement achieved by at least 3 of 5 remaining ACR core parameters: physician’s global assessment of disease activity, participant’s global assessment of disease activity, participant's assessment of pain (visual analog assessment [VAS]), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP). If CRP missing, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was used. In order for improvements in the ACRn score to be expressed as a positive result, rather than the negative changes that improvements represent, the final ACRn results were multiplied by negative 1. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) for TJC/SJC, HAQ, CRP/ESR, VAS. If change in CRP incalculable, change in ESR used. ACR20 set to Non-Responder if ACRn missing</description>

        <description>FACIT-F scores were obtained from a 13 question self-administered participant questionnaire designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants responded to the questions using a value between 0 and 4, where 0 indicated &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 indicated &quot;very much.&quot; 11 of the 13 questions were negatively stated; indicating the higher the score of the participant's response, the greater their fatigue. These questions were calculated as 4 minus the participants' response, so that a higher score indicated an improvement in health. The scores for the 2 positively stated questions were not changed. The participants' responses were summed to result in an overall score, which are scored 0 to 52 (52 = highest level of functioning). A positive change from BL indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) Score</title>
        <description>SF-36 scores were obtained by scoring participants' responses to a 36 item questionnaire. SF-36 evaluated 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health from a range of 1 (better) to 5 (worst). The score for each section was an average of the individual question scores, which were scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). These 8 aspects were summarized as physical and mental component scores.</description>

        <title>Change in SF-36 Score From BL</title>
        <description>SF-36 scores were obtained by scoring participants' responses to a 36 item questionnaire. SF-36 evaluated 8 aspects of functional health and well being: physical and social functioning, physical and emotional role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, mental health from a range of 1 (better) to 5 (worst). The score for each section was an average of the individual question scores, which were scaled 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning). These 8 aspects were summarized as physical and mental component scores.</description>

        <description>ANA titers were obtained by the following serum dilution schema: negative = negative, borderline = 1 diluted to (:) 40 or 1:80, and positive ≥ 1:160. The change categories were defined for the change from BL to Weeks 24 and 48 according to this schema. Negative to borderline was defined as any change from negative to borderline as no dilution is given for negative results. Negative to positive was defined as at least a two-fold positive change in dilution from BL. Borderline to negative was defined as any change from borderline to negative as no dilution is given for negative results. Borderline to positive was defined as at least a two-fold positive change in dilution from BL. Positive to borderline was defined as at least a two-fold negative change in dilution from BL. Positive to negative was defined as at least a two-fold negative change in dilution from BL. Unchanged was defined as any difference in dilution less than two-fold.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a Change From BL by Category in Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) Titers</title>
          <description>ANA titers were obtained by the following serum dilution schema: negative = negative, borderline = 1 diluted to (:) 40 or 1:80, and positive ≥ 1:160. The change categories were defined for the change from BL to Weeks 24 and 48 according to this schema. Negative to borderline was defined as any change from negative to borderline as no dilution is given for negative results. Negative to positive was defined as at least a two-fold positive change in dilution from BL. Borderline to negative was defined as any change from borderline to negative as no dilution is given for negative results. Borderline to positive was defined as at least a two-fold positive change in dilution from BL. Positive to borderline was defined as at least a two-fold negative change in dilution from BL. Positive to negative was defined as at least a two-fold negative change in dilution from BL. Unchanged was defined as any difference in dilution less than two-fold.</description>
