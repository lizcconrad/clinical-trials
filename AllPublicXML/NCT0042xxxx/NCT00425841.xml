      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor
      and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and
      oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving stereotactic radiation therapy together with
      combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may
      kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving stereotactic radiation therapy
      together with combination chemotherapy works in treating patients undergoing surgery for
      locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients undergoing surgery for locally advanced
           pancreatic cancer treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and
           oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to death in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine perioperative morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of R0 resections in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the histologic response rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients undergo hypofractionated, stereotactic radiotherapy on
           days 1-5. Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1
           and oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 2. Treatment with gemcitabine hydrocloride
           and oxaliplatin repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses.

        -  Surgery: Patients with resectable disease undergo tumor resection. Patients with
           unresectable disease undergo a second course of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed
           by resection.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive 3 more courses of
           chemotherapy as in neoadjuvant therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
