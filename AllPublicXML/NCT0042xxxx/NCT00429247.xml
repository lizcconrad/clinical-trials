  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial tumor cells can be detected in the bone marrow and/or the peripheral blood
      [disseminated and circulating tumor cells, (DTCs) and (CTCs) respectively] of otherwise
      metastases-free patients with early breast cancer. Several studies have shown that the
      presence of these cells is an independent factor associated with an increased incidence of
      early disease relapse and disease-related death. In almost 50% of the patients, adjuvant
      chemotherapy cannot eliminate these occult tumor cells and this is also associated with a
      higher probability of early relapse and death. In 60-70% of the patients, DTCs and/or CTCs
      express the HER2/c-neu molecule and one or two administrations of their monoclonal antibody
      trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) could eliminate these cells for a period ranging from 3-12 months.

      This pilot trial will compare the efficacy of the anti-HER2/erb-B2 monoclonal antibody
      trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) given after the completion of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy versus observation in patients with stage I-III operable breast cancer who have
      detectable cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) mRNA-positive tumor cells in the bone marrow or the
      peripheral blood before and/or after the adjuvant treatment.
