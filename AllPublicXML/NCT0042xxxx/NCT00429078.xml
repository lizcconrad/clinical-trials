      This study proposes to determine the safety and tolerability of 2nd generation designer T
      cells in patients with gastric cancer.Designer T cells are prepared by removing white blood
      cells from the participant, and then modifying these cells so that they recognize tumor
      antigen(CEA). These modified cells are then re infused back into the participant so that they
      can attack and kill tumor cells.Eligibility for this study is diagnosis of carcinoma of the
      stomach with failure to respond to standard curative therapy. Tumors must express CEA as
      demonstrated by elevated serum CEA &gt;10ng/ml and be measurable radiologically or by physical
      exam.

    <textblock>
      T cells can penetrate virtually every biologic space and have the power to dispose of normal
      or malignant cells as seen in viral and autoimmune diseases and in the rare spontaneous
      remissions of cancer. However, T cells are easily tolerized to self or tumor antigens and
      &quot;immune surveilÂ¬lance&quot; has manifestly failed in every cancer that is clinically apparent. It
      is the goal of this study to supply the specificities and affinities to patient T cells
      without regard for their &quot;endogenous&quot; T cell receptor repertoire, directed by
      antibody-defined recognition to kill malignant cells based on their expression of antigen. We
      will achieve this by preparing chimeric IgCD28TCR genes in mammalian expression vectors to
      yield &quot;designer T cells&quot; from normal patient cells. Prior studies in model systems
      demonstrated that recombinant IgCD28TCR could direct modified T cells to respond to antigen
      targets with IL2 secretion, cellular proliferation, and cytotoxicity, the hallmarks of an
      effective, self-sustaining immune response. It therefore becomes of paramount interest to
      extend these studies to a human system of widespread clinical relevance to explore the
      clinical potential of this new technology. The target antigen for these studies is
      carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is prominently expressed on tumors of the stomach,
      colon and rectum, breast, pancreas and other sites.
