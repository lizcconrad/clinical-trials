    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the changes on the shape and function of the left
      ventricle in patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation due to congestive heart failure
      and cardiomyopathy who undergo mitral valve reconstruction with a Geoform ring.
      Three-dimensional echocardiogram will be used for precise evaluation of the shape and
      function of the ventricle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure is a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality with an
      estimated 5 million people affected in the United States of America. Ischemic and idiopathic
      (dilated) cardiomyopathies are the two most common etiologies. As the left ventricle fails,
      changes in ventricular geometry and function occurs that leads to functional mitral
      regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation is a complication of end stage cardiomyopathy that
      adversely affects survival and patient's functional status. Mitral regurgitation in these
      patients is not an intrinsic disease of the mitral valve but rather results from mitral
      annular dilatation and ventricular dilatation.

      Geoform mitral annuloplasty ring reduces the antero-posterior diameter of the mitral valve
      and elevates the posterior mitral annulus. Although it has been very effective on eliminating
      mitral regurgitation its effects on ventricular geometry have not been fully elucidated.
      Evaluation of ventricular and mitral valve geometry and function and their interactions has
      been difficult. The availability of three dimensional echocardiogram with sophisticated
      finite volume analysis allows us to evaluate the changes in ventricular geometry associated
      with the implantation of the Geoform ring. We have then designed this study with the purpose
      of evaluating the changes in left ventricular geometry and function resulting from mitral
      valve annuloplasty with the Geoform ring in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and
      congestive heart failure.

      The two primary endpoints of this study will be:

        1. To assess the changes on left ventricular geometry and function as assessed by 3D
           echocardiography in patients with cardiomyopathy and severe mitral regurgitation who
           undergo mitral valve annuloplasty with a Geoform ring. This assessment will be done
           preoperatively, at three months, at six months, at one year, and at two years after the
           procedure.

        2. To evaluate the effects on mitral valve annuloplasty with a Geoform ring on functional
           status.

           Secondary endpoints will be:

        3. To evaluate the effect of mitral valve annuloplasty with a Geoform ring on mortality.

        4. To evaluate its effects on hospitalization for congestive heart failure.

        5. To evaluate the effect on the need of further interventions for congestive heart failure
           (insertion of ventricular assist device, transplantation, cardiac resynchronization
           therapy).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients would be at least 18 years old.

          -  They will have history of congestive heart failure and be in New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV.

          -  Their left ventricular ejection fraction will be less or equal to 30%.

          -  They will have moderate or severe mitral regurgitation as determined by
             echocardiogram. Echocardiogram's criteria for severe mitral regurgitation will be:

               -  regurgitant volume greater than 50 ml,

               -  regurgitant fraction greater than 50% and

               -  effective regurgitant orifice greater than 40 mm2.

        If the quantitative criteria are not available, severity of the MR will be graded
        qualitative in grades I, II, III, and IV. Patients with mitral regurgitation in grade III
        and IV will be eligible to be included in the study.
