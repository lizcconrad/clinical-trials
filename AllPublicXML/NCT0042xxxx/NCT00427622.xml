      RATIONALE: Measuring how often hot flashes occur in postmenopausal women may be done by using
      a skin conduction device or by using a diary.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is comparing a skin conduction device with a hot flash diary as
      a way of measuring hot flashes in postmenopausal women with hot flashes.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Correlate hot flash frequency, as measured by an ambulatory sternal skin conductance
           measuring and recording tool, with patient-recorded hot flash frequency using a hot
           flash diary in postmenopausal women with hot flashes.

        -  Determine the comfort, obtrusiveness, and feasibility of using the skin conductance
           recording tool for measuring hot flashes when worn daily for five weeks in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients wear an ambulatory sternal skin conductance hot flash device continuously
      for 5 weeks.

      Patients complete hot flash diaries once daily for 5 weeks. Patients also complete the
      Comfort, Bother, and Weight Questionnaire at the end of week 5.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
