  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of a single dose
      of imatinib given as a 800 mg modified release tablet, compared to twice-daily doses of 400
      mg film-coated tablets. There will be a 8 day wash out phase between treatments and a 1 week
      safety period at the end of the study. Each participant will receive all four treatments.
