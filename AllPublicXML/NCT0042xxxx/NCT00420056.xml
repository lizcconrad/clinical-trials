    <measure>Correlation Coefficient Between Change From Baseline in Fluoro-L-thymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT-PET) Maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUVmax) and in Phosphorylated Retinoblastoma (Phospho-Rb) Percent Positive Cells at Cycle 1 Day 21</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) was defined as the maximum value attained for the ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration at any time and the injected radioactivity concentration divided by the body weight (in kilogram [kg]). Phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in the tumor cells, expressed as phospho-Rb percent positive cells, was assessed using Immunohistochemical staining technique. Change from baseline in [(18)F]-FLT-PET SUVmax at Cycle 1 Day 21 and change from baseline in Phospho-Rb percent positive cells at Cycle 1 Day 21 were analyzed. The change values of FLT-PET SUVmax and Phospho-Rb percent positive cells were then correlated. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 1 Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma PD 0332991 concentration at Cycle 1 Day 21 was analyzed. Change from baseline in biomarkers (Ki-67 composite score, Cyclin D1 composite score, phospho-Rb positive cells) and SUVmax (FLT-PET SUVmax, FDG-PET SUVmax) at Cycle 1 Day 21 were analyzed. Correlation between PD 0332991 concentration and change in biomarkers (concentration versus Ki-67, concentration versus Cyclin, and concentration versus phospho-Rb) and SUVmax (concentration versus FLT-PET SUVmax, concentration versus FDG-PET SUVmax) was then assessed. Composite score = (sum of each intensity category multiplied by percent of cells in that category).

        <title>Correlation Coefficient Between Change From Baseline in Fluoro-L-thymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT-PET) Maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUVmax) and in Phosphorylated Retinoblastoma (Phospho-Rb) Percent Positive Cells at Cycle 1 Day 21</title>
        <description>Maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) was defined as the maximum value attained for the ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration at any time and the injected radioactivity concentration divided by the body weight (in kilogram [kg]). Phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein in the tumor cells, expressed as phospho-Rb percent positive cells, was assessed using Immunohistochemical staining technique. Change from baseline in [(18)F]-FLT-PET SUVmax at Cycle 1 Day 21 and change from baseline in Phospho-Rb percent positive cells at Cycle 1 Day 21 were analyzed. The change values of FLT-PET SUVmax and Phospho-Rb percent positive cells were then correlated. Here, ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure.</description>

        <description>Percentage of Ki-67 positive cells was determined by Immunohistochemical staining technique. Composite score = (sum of each intensity category multiplied by percent of cells in that category). Intensity categories of staining (0 = no staining; 1 = weak staining; 2 = moderate staining; 3 = strong staining). Composite score ranges from 0 (no staining) to 300 (100% of cells with 3 staining intensity).</description>

        <population>Tumor analysis set include all participants in FAS who completed tumor biomarker assessments at baseline and Day 21. Here, ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study medication to the first documentation of objective tumor progression, or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Tumor progression was defined as &gt;50% increase in sum of products of diameters, of dominant nodes and documented non-nodal sites or appearance of new sites of disease. PFS= (first event date minus the first dose date plus 1) divided by 30.44.</description>

        <description>Plasma PD 0332991 concentration at Cycle 1 Day 21 was analyzed. Change from baseline in biomarkers (Ki-67 composite score, Cyclin D1 composite score, phospho-Rb positive cells) and SUVmax (FLT-PET SUVmax, FDG-PET SUVmax) at Cycle 1 Day 21 were analyzed. Correlation between PD 0332991 concentration and change in biomarkers (concentration versus Ki-67, concentration versus Cyclin, and concentration versus phospho-Rb) and SUVmax (concentration versus FLT-PET SUVmax, concentration versus FDG-PET SUVmax) was then assessed. Composite score = (sum of each intensity category multiplied by percent of cells in that category). Intensity categories of staining (0 = no staining; 1 = weak staining; 2 = moderate staining; 3 = strong staining). Here, ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies participants evaluable for this measure.</description>
