      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with advanced
      primary cancers of the liver, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or carcinoma of the
      gallbladder or biliary tract (BTC), who have not received prior systemic cytotoxic therapy
      for advanced disease. Patients may have previously received radiation and/or systemic
      chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. Patients may not have been treated previously with a
      taxane. Patients may have been previously treated with up to two immunological and/or
      biologic agents (e.g., interferon, monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors).
      Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of 500mg/m2 (400mg/m2 for patients with
      an elevated bilirubin at baseline) intravenously by 1-hour infusion weekly for the first five
      weeks of a six week cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, intolerable
      toxicity, refusal of continued treatment by patient or Investigator decision.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologic or cytologic confirmation of primary cancer of the
             liver, including HCC or adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder or bile ducts and advanced
             (unresectable and/or metastatic) disease.

          2. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion by RECIST criteria.

          3. Patients may have received up to two prior systemic non-cytotoxic regimens for their
             disease. Prior treatment with immunologic and/or biologic agents is allowed.

          4. At least 6 weeks (42 days) since any prior immunologic or biologic therapy.

          5. At least 4 weeks (28 days) since prior radiotherapy to &gt;20% of the bone marrow or
             prior adjuvant chemotherapy.

          6. Lesions being used to assess disease status may not have been radiated or if so, must
             have progressed during or after radiation therapy.

          7. Patients must have ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          8. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          9. Patients must have adequate liver and renal function.

         10. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function.

         11. Patients must sign an informed consent form indicating that they are aware of the

          1. Patients who have received prior therapy with any taxane.

          2. Patients who have a past or current history of cancer other than the entry diagnosis,
             except for curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix or other cancers treated for cure and with a disease-free survival longer than
             5 years.

          3. Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis (es).

          4. Patients who are pregnant or nursing and patients who are not practicing an acceptable

             from laboratory tests or markers.

         10. Patients with a history of Gilbert's Syndrome.

         11. Patients must not receive any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, non-FDA approved
             nutritional supplements or herbal preparations or immunotherapy while on study.

         14. Patients must not have had any surgical procedure requiring hospitalization and
             administration of general anesthesia within the past 28 days.

         15. Patients must not have received prior systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease.
