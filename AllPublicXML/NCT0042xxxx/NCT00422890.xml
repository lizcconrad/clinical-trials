        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening phase:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients with CD34+ AML or MDS post-allogeneic HSCT

          -  Written patient consent after consultation

        Treatment phase

          -  AML/MDS: donor chimerism &lt; 80% in the CD34+ subpopulation following allogeneic HSCT in
             patients with CD34+ AML or MDS, but with no haematological relapse (blasts &lt; 5% in
             bone marrow)

          -  Leukocytes &gt; 3 Gpt/l and platelets &gt; 75 Gpt/l (transfusion-independent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known intolerance to 5-azacitidine or mannitol

          -  Uncontrollable infectious disease

          -  Patients with active hepatitis B or C or HIV infection

          -  Severe hepatic function impairment (ASAT and ALAT may not be above three times the
             normal value) or hepatic cirrhosis, or malignant hepatic tumour

          -  Renal function impairment (creatinine &gt; twice the normal value, creatinine clearance &lt;
             50 ml/min)

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Women of childbearing age, except for those who meet the following criteria:

          -  postmenopausal (12 months natural amenorrhoea)

          -  postoperative (6 weeks after bilateral ovarectomy with or without hysterectomy)

          -  regular and correct use of a contraceptive method with an error rate &lt; 1% per year
             (e.g. implants, depot injections, combined oral contraceptives, intrauterine device -
             IUD, whereby hormonal coils with a Pearl Index of &lt; 1% are safer than copper coils)

          -  sexual abstinence

          -  Partner vasectomy

          -  Men who do not use one of the following for contraception:

          -  post vasectomy

          -  condoms

          -  Participation of the patient in a drug trial outside the indication of allogeneic
             transplantation up to four weeks before study initiation

          -  Addictive or other illnesses that prevent the person concerned from comprehending the
             nature and impact, as well as potentical consequences of the clinical trial

          -  Evidence that the patient may intentionally not comply with the protocol, e.g. lack of
             cooperation With the exception of a known allergic reaction or intolerance to
             5-azacitidine, these criteria do not apply to the screening phase.
