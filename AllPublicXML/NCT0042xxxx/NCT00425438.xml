  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will compare the efficacy and safety of CellCept plus corticosteroids,
      versus cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids in the induction phase followed by azathioprine
      in the maintenance phase, in maintaining remission and renal function in patients with lupus
      nephritis. Patients will be randomized to receive CellCept 1g bid po plus corticosteroids for
      24 weeks, followed by CellCept 0.75g bid po plus corticosteroids for the following 24 weeks,
      or cyclophosphamide 0.5-1.0g/m2 monthly plus corticosteroids for 24 weeks, followed by
      azathioprine 2mg/kg/day po plus corticosteroids for the following 24 weeks. Response rate
      will be assessed at the end of the induction phase, and at the end of study. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

    <description>Treatment response was defined by a reduction in the ratio of urine protein to creatinine to &lt;3 mg/mg for participants with nephrotic proteinuria and a decrease of more than 50% in their urine protein to creatinine value from BL for participants with non-nephrotic proteinuria; a stable serum creatinine value or an increase of more than 30% from BL; and having not received IV prednisone after Week 28.</description>

Participants also received azathioprine 100 mg, PO, daily for participants with a body weight of 50 to 70 kg and 150 mg, PO, daily for participants with a body weight of more than 70 kg from Weeks 25 through 48. Participants also received prednisolone 0.75 to 1.0 mg/kg, PO, once per day, up to a maximum of 60 mg per day from Weeks 1 through 4, reduced by 10 mg per day every 2 weeks until dose reached 40 mg/day, followed by a reduction of 5 mg/day every 2 weeks until dose reached 10 mg per day up to Week 48.</description>

          <title>Complete Response (CR) by the End of Treatment - Percentage of Participants With an Event</title>
          <description>CR was defined as a urinary protein value of less than (&lt;) 500 mg per 24 hours (mg/24h) and no hematuria or cellular casts in the urine, and a stable serum creatinine value within the range of plus or minus (±) 25 percent (%) of baseline (BL) or some improvement.</description>
          <population>Efficacy data were not analyzed because of study termination. The study was terminated early for administrative reasons and no participants completed all planned study visits; therefore efficacy analyses could not be performed.</population>
