  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCI (coronary angioplasty) is a procedure performed through a catheter to open up blockages
      in the coronary arteries using balloons and stents for the treatment of angina or myocardial
      infarction. The balloon catheters and stents are moved to the coronary arteries through a
      “sheath” (a small tube used for placing of balloon and stent catheters in the body) placed in
      a major artery passing through the groin. After the PCI procedure and the removal of sheath,
      an “arterial closure device” is commonly placed to stop bleeding and allow you to get out of
      bed sooner. Although the usefulness of “closure devices” has been documented before their
      approval by the regulatory authorities, it is unclear if one device is better compared to
      other commercially available devices.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the two approved arterial closure devices, “Angioseal”
      and “Starclose”. This study will help us identify the better of the two devices to improve
      patient comfort after the procedure.

      All patients scheduled to undergo percutaneous coronary interventions will be screened for
      inclusion into the study. Informed consent will be obtained and patients will be randomized
      to the placement of either Angioseal or a Starclose vascular closure device to achieve
      hemostasis after the PCI procedure. The randomization will take place after a femoral
      angiogram has confirmed the suitability of the femoral artery for placement of arterial
      closure device. All patients will be monitored for bleeding or hematoma formation for twelve
      hours after the procedure. Patients will be ambulated at two hours after placement of the
      arterial closure device. A complete blood count and a vascular ultrasound will be performed
      in all patients before discharge to assess blood loss and detect vascular complications such
      as hematoma, arteriovenous fistula or femoral artery pseudoaneurysm. A written quality of
      life survey will be completed before discharge and at four weeks. A nursing survey will be
      completed by the nursing staff to determine nurse-sensitive outcomes and nurse resource
      utilization.
