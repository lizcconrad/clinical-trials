  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CACTUS-PTS is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study which aims primarily to
      determine the effectiveness of a 6 week course of therapeutic-dose LMWH (nadroparine)
      injections vs. placebo in patients with a first symptomatic isolated distal (calf) deep-vein
      thrombosis (IDDVT), as measured by rate of proximal DVT and symptomatic PE at 6 weeks.
      Additionally, the study aims to determine if the 6 week course of treatment with
      therapeutic-dose LMWH (nadroparine) injections, compared to placebo, decreases the frequency
      of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) at 1 year.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CACTUS-PTS study will compare anticoagulant treatment for 6 weeks versus placebo in
      acute, symptomatic distal DVT. Patients will be randomized to receive either a six-week
      period of LMWH at therapeutic dosage or a six-week period of placebo. All patients will be
      treated with elastic compression stockings and followed-up with a standardized
      ultrasonography protocol. Strict ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria for distal DVT have
      been defined. Control compression ultrasonography will be performed between days 3 and 7 and
      at six weeks after inclusion. The primary outcome will be a composite of the proportion of
      patients with extension of the thrombus to the proximal veins (detected by the programmed
      ultrasound examinations or by an ultrasound performed because of recurrent symptoms) or
      symptomatic PE in both arms of the study during the 6-weeks study period. Patients with such
      an outcome will be anticoagulated as currently admitted in presence of a proximal DVT.
      Secondary outcomes will be the individual components of the composite endpoint (distal DVT
      extension to proximal veins; symptomatic PE), major bleeding, serious adverse events and
      death reported at 6 weeks and 90 days. To answer the research question of the PTS add-on
      study, patients will self-assess and be assessed for PTS by a clinician using the Villalta
      scale, 1 year following their enrolment into the trial. In addition, patients will complete a
      Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire. The QOL questionnaire will be comprised of both the
      VEINES-QOL and SF-36. The primary outcome is the rate of PTS, with secondary outcomes of QOL
      scores and PTS severity.
