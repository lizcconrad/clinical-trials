    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      patupilone combined with carboplatin in adult patients with advanced solid tumors who
      progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists or who might
      benefit from treatment with carboplatin
