      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new investigational hepatitis B virus vaccine,
      HEPLISAV™, is safe in patients at least 40 years of age who have progressive loss of kidney
      function with more advanced stage 3 (GFR ≤ 45 mL/min) or stage 4 chronic kidney disease, and
      are expected to eventually go on hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health problem. Worldwide, it is
      estimated that 2 billion people have been infected previously and 350 million are chronically
      infected. About 25% of people who do not initially clear the infection will later develop
      chronic active hepatitis. Hemodialysis and pre-dialysis patients with kidney failure have
      multiple immune defects that make them more likely to develop a chronic infection. In
      addition, hemodialysis increases the risk of exposure to HBV. Existing HBV vaccines are
      effective in preventing infection in healthy adults. However, poor responses occur in people
      who are over 40 years of age and have end-stage kidney failure.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immune response of three escalating
      dose levels of HEPLISAV™, compared with a commercially available HBV vaccine, Engerix-B®, in
      patients at least 40 years of age who have progressive loss of kidney function with more
      advanced stage 3 (GFR ≤ 45 mL/min) or stage 4 chronic kidney disease and are expected to
      eventually go on hemodialysis. About 72 patients will be included in the study. Once patients
      have been consented, screened, and randomized to treatment, they will receive four injections
      over a 24-week period, with follow-up visits at 28 and 50 weeks. Safety and tolerability will
      be evaluated by occurrence of adverse events, periodic laboratory tests, vital signs, and
      local/systemic reactogenicity.

      Comparison: Patients will receive treatment with one of three escalating dose levels of
      HEPLISAV™ or the comparator vaccine, Engerix-B®.
