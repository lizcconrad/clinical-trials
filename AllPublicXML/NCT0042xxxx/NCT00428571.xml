  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of research studies on people who were morbidly obese (extremely overweight),
      and had bariatric surgery (anti-obesity surgery) have shown that patients who were diabetic
      before surgery often experienced significant improvement in their diabetes following the
      surgery. For some patients, blood glucose levels returned to the normal range, and they were
      able to stop taking all of their diabetes medications. For others, blood glucose levels
      improved, allowing them to reduce their diabetes medications.

      This research study is being done to determine whether bariatric surgery can safely provide
      better control of diabetes symptoms in obese diabetics than continuing medical management
      (anti-diabetic drugs in combination with diet and lifestyle changes).

      There are several different types of bariatric surgery currently being used to treat morbid
      obesity. Two of the most common techniques are gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding.
      This study will be comparing these two surgical techniques to treatment with a combination of
      drugs, diet, and lifestyle changes for control of type 2 diabetes.

             despite adequate management efforts. The complicating situations are:

               -  Severely reduced quality of life as assessed by the Audit of Diabetes Dependent
                  Quality of Life (ADDQoL) questionnaire

               -  Metabolic lability/instability, characterized by two or more episodes of severe
