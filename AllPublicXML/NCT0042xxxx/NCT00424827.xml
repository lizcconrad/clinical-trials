      This is an open-label, non-randomized, combination study of cetuximab, gemcitabine, 5-FU, and
      external beam radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pancreatic
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During cycle I (chemoradiation), gemcitabine (200 mg/m2) and cetuximab 400mg/m2 initial dose
      followed by 250mg/m2 IV weekly will be given with continuous infusion 5-FU (200 mg/m2/day)
      delivered 5 of every 7 days and concurrent external beam radiation therapy. Cetuximab,
      gemcitabine and 5-FU will begin on the first week of external beam radiotherapy and will
      continue throughout the course of external beam radiation therapy, and will be discontinued
      following the conclusion of external beam radiation therapy. All patients will have a central
      venous access device placed to facilitate chemotherapy administration.

      During cycles 2 through 5 (chemotherapy), gemcitabine will be administered at a dose of 1000
      mg/m2 over 30 minutes followed by cetuximab at a dose of 250mg/m2 over 30 minutes weekly for
      3 weeks followed by one-week rest for four cycles.

               -  Staging laparoscopy or staging laparotomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Enrollment in this trial will be limited to patients for whom protocol therapy is safe and
        appropriate. Physicians should consider the risks and benefits of therapy together with all
        relevant medical and other considerations in deciding whether this protocol is appropriate
        for a particular patient. Specific considerations include:

          -  Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent.

          -  Serious medical illness such as uncontrolled infection, severe cardiovascular disease
             including recent (&lt; 6 months) myocardial infarction or uncontrolled congestive heart
             failure, or other serious illness which would limit anticipated survival to &lt; 12
             weeks.

          -  Protocol treatment would pose significant risk to an unborn child. Pregnant women
             should not be enrolled, and women of child-bearing age should be strongly encouraged
             to practice effective birth control during and for three months after the trial.

          -  Inability to swallow medication. Patients should have adequate, unassisted oral
             intake.

      <recruitment_details>Between 2006 and 2011, twenty-six patients were screened and eleven of them were enrolled in the study. Most common reasons for screen failures were having resectable disease, metastatic disease or co-morbidity. Ten patients were able to tolerate and complete cycle 1 of chemoradiotherapy.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Most common reasons for screen failures were having resectable disease, metastatic disease or co-morbidity. A minority of patients present with localized disease. Surgical resection only hope for long-term survival. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is defined as surgically unresectable, but has no evidence of distant metastases.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>&quot;A Phase II Trial of Cetuximab, Gemcitabine, 5-Fluorouracil, and Radiation Therapy in Locally Advanced Nonmetastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma&quot;
This protocol will assess the antitumor activity of gemcitabine (200 mg/m2 per week) and cetuximab (400mg/m2 loading dose followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly) when given with continuous infusion 5-FU (200 mg/m2/day/M-F) and daily concurrent external beam radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) in patients with non-metastatic, locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma.
Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is defined as surgically unresectable, but has no evidence of distant metastases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and 5-FU along with radiation therapy in locally advanced non-resectable, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, using progression free survival as the primary end point.</description>
