      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CP-195543 and celecoxib dual therapy in
      subjects with rheumatoid arthritis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trial enrollment was prematurely discontinued on December 3, 2007. The results of an interim
      efficacy and safety analysis demonstrated an overall poor tolerability profile and high
      discontinuation rate when dual therapy with CP-195543 and Celecoxib was administered. The
      decision to discontinue further enrollment in the trial was not based on any efficacy or
      serious safety concerns. Previously enrolled study participants continued in the study and
      the trial completed on February 27, 2008.

    <description>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI): participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3, where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

        <description>DAS28-3 (CRP) was calculated from the SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count and CRP. It was calculated as DAS28-3 (CRP) = 1.15 + 1.10 * ([0.56 * square root of TJC] + [0.28 * square root of SJC] + [0.36 * natural logarithm of {CRP+1}]). Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count and C-Reactive Protein (3 Variables) (DAS28-3 [CRP]) at Week 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>DAS28-3 (CRP) was calculated from the SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count and CRP. It was calculated as DAS28-3 (CRP) = 1.15 + 1.10 * ([0.56 * square root of TJC] + [0.28 * square root of SJC] + [0.36 * natural logarithm of {CRP+1}]). Total score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;= 3.2 implied low disease activity and &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-3 (CRP) &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>
