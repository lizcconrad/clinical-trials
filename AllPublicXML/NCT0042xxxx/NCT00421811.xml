  <brief_title>A Study of ADH-1 in Combination With Normothermic Isolated Limb Infusion of Melphalan</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 1/2 Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Anti-tumor Activity of Systemic ADH-1 in Combination With Normothermic Isolated Limb Infusion of Melphalan in Subjects With Locally Advanced In-Transit Malignant Melanoma (Adherex Protocol Number AHX-01-007).</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding and on the surface of many tumor
      cells, is increased as cancer progresses. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study will test the
      safety and effects of the combination ADH-1 with Normothermic Isolated Limb Infusion of
      Melphalan in subjects with locally advanced malignant melanoma.
