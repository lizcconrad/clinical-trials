  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study was conducted to assess the insulin resistance indices in the subjects undergoing
      Ramadan fasting (diet which consisted of two meals at 12 hours intervals)for a thirty days
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is a feature of a number of clinical disorders, including type 2
      diabetes/glucose intolerance, obesity, dyslipidaemia and hypertension clustering in the
      so-called metabolic syndrome.The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, as defined by the 2001
      ATP III criteria, was 22 percent, with an age-dependent increase.Data demonstrates that the
      prevalence has continued to increase, particularly in women.Hyperinsulinemia occurring in
      response to insulin resistance may play an important role in the genesis of metabolic
      syndrome. Prevention or reduction of obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, is the main
      therapeutic goal in patients with the metabolic syndrome .Weight reduction is optimally
      achieved with a multimodality approach including diet, exercise, and possible pharmacologic
      therapy, as with orlistat .It has been shown that many different diets such as Mediterranean
      diet, DASH diet, Foods with low glycemic index and low saturated fat diet, independent of
      weight loss, by reducing insulin resistance may be effective in improving the metabolic
      syndrome .During the month of Ramadan (The ninth month of the Islamic calendar), Muslims fast
      every day from dawn to sunset. They refrain from drinking and eating for about 12h intervals.
      There are currently no reports on the effect of Ramadan fasting (only two meals per day) on
      metabolic syndrome. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the insulin resistance
      indices in the subjects undergoing this type of fasting for a thirty days period.
