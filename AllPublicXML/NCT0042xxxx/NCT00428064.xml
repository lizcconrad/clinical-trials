  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess equivalence in the rates of functional graft survival at 12 months after
      transplantation in patients receiving continuous therapy with cyclosporine (CsA, Sandimmune,
      Neoral) and sirolimus versus induction with CsA and sirolimus followed by CsA elimination and
      concentration-controlled sirolimus.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  End-stage renal disease, with patients receiving a primary or secondary renal
             allograft from a cadaveric donor, from a living-unrelated donor, or from a
             living-related (excluding 0 antigen mismatch) donor.

          -  Women who are of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before
             sirolimus administration and agree to use a medically acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the treatment period and for 3 months following
             discontinuation of sirolimus

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active systemic or localized major infection at the time of initial
             sirolimus administration

          -  Evidence of infiltrate, cavitation, or consolidation on chest x-ray obtained during
             pre-study screening.

          -  Chronic antiarrhythmic therapy for ventricular arrhythmia or other cardiac abnormality
             contraindicating general anesthesia or surgery
