  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine, in subjects with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus:

        1. Whether glycemic control can be achieved at least as effectively with an insulin regimen
           involving pre-meal inhaled insulin plus a single bedtime Ultralente injection as with a
           conventional subcutaneous insulin regimen involving 2-3 mixed Regular/NPH insulin
           injections per day.

        2. The toleration and safety of inhaled insulin therapy and its effects after 6 months, if
           any, on measures of pulmonary function.
