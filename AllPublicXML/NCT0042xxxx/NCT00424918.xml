  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In middle schools participating in a statewide program called &quot;Take Time&quot;, we are randomizing
      youth to a 10-12 week intervention using the dance mat games on the Playstation2 (like Dance
      Dance Revolution). This program is testing feasibility of using the dance mats as a way to
      increase activity during the school day. We are using &quot;Groove Masters&quot; as a peer-mentored
      mechanism to keep track of the activity of youth in the intervention compared to the control
      group. Our main objective is increase in activity time.

      We met with administrators and teachers and obtained consent and assent for this study. After
      assessing baseline measures (end-of-grade test scores, absenteeism, Pediatric Quality of
      Life, physical fitness, GEMS Activity Rating Scale, Dennison's measure of sedentary screen
      time, Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale, BMI%ile, (with a small subset assayed for fasting
      lipids and glucose, with a smaller subset wearing ActiGraphs for objective measures of
      activity) we randomized to the intervention or control group.

      In our intervention, youth play a dance game at school called &quot;In the Groove&quot;, with the goal
      of 40 additional minutes each week of physical activity during the school hours.

      We will obtain change scores and compare the groups to find an effect size for future
      studies, this this proves acceptable and feasible in Maine schools.
