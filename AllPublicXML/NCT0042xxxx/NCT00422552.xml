  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the change in inspiratory capacity and lung function
      in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when treated with indacaterol compared
      to placebo and formoterol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and post-menopausal female adults aged 40-80 years inclusive.

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for
             Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) Guidelines (2005)

          -  Smoking history of at least 10 pack years (either smokers or ex-smokers).

          -  Able to perform reproducible spirometry maneuvers.

          -  Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study. Understand and sign the written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  COPD exacerbations within 6 weeks prior to dosing

          -  Concomitant lung disease such as asthma, requirement for long term oxygen treatment or
             history of lung reduction surgery.

          -  Medical conditions that would interfere with the performance of spirometry or may pose
             a potential hazard from performing spirometry.

          -  Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may cause the
             patient to be unsuitable for completion of the study or place the patient at potential
             risk from being in the study, e.g. uncontrolled hypertension, unstable ischemic heart
             disease.

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing or longer
             if required by local regulations, and for any other limitation of participation based
             on local regulations.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
