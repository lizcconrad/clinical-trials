      The objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a
      Split Virus, Vero Cell derived, Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (VCIV) in comparison to a Licensed
      Egg Derived, Split Virus, Seasonal Influenza Vaccine (EIV) in healthy subjects 18 years of
      age and older.

      Approximately 1000 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single
      injection of VCIV or EIV. Subjects will be monitored for 180 days following vaccination for
      occurrence of adverse reactions and for antibody response to the vaccine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects who

          -  Are 18 to 49 years of age (inclusive) on the day of screening (Stratum A)

          -  Are 50 years of age or older on the day of screening (Stratum B)

          -  Have an understanding of the study, agree to its provisions, and give written informed
             consent prior to study entry

          -  Are clinically healthy (in a physical condition such that the physician would have no
             reservations administering influenza vaccine outside the scope of a clinical study)

          -  Are physically and mentally capable of participating in the study

          -  Agree to keep a daily record of symptoms

          -  If female and capable of bearing children, have a negative urine pregnancy test result
             within 24 hours of the vaccination on Study Day 0 and agree to employ adequate birth
             control measures. For the purposes of this study adequate birth control measures
             incorporate 2 types of the following FDA approved birth control measures through 60
             days after vaccination:

               -  Hormonal types of birth control (such as implants, birth control pills, patches
                  or other methods) or an intrauterine device, AND

               -  An additional barrier type of birth control measure (i.e., condoms, diaphragms,
                  cervical caps, etc.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who

          -  Have previously been vaccinated against influenza with vaccine formulated for the
             2006/2007 influenza season

          -  Have an oral temperature &gt;=37.5°C at the time of vaccination on Day 0 (see note below)

          -  Have Type I diabetes

          -  Have a Body Mass Index &gt;35

          -  Have hypertension at screening (with or without medication) that is graded as greater
             than Stage 1 defined as a systolic pressure &gt;159 or diastolic pressure &gt;99 while
             seated and at rest (measurement may be repeated twice before subject is absolutely
             excluded)

          -  Have clinically significant abnormal clinical laboratory values at screening

          -  Have clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormalities at screening

          -  Test positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV), Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
             (HbsAg) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)

          -  Have a history of cardiovascular disease that required hospitalization

          -  Have a history of immunodeficiency or autoimmune diseases

          -  Have a history of arthritis (joint swelling, tenderness, warmth or erythema) on more
             than one occasion, not related to trauma (including running) or any episode of
             non-trauma related arthritis within the previous 6 months

          -  Suffer from active neoplastic disease or have a history of hematologic malignancy

             contraindications)

          -  Have a rash, dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating

          -  Have a positive urine drug screen (unless the detected drug is currently prescribed by
             a licensed health care provider and the continued administration of the drug would not
             otherwise exclude the subject from participation)

          -  Were administered an investigational drug within 6 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Are concurrently participating in a clinical study that Inactivated Influenza Vaccine
             (Split Virus, Vero Cell Derived)includes the administration of an investigational
             product

          -  Are a member of the team conducting this study

          -  Are in a dependent relationship with the study investigator. Dependent relationships

          -  If female, are pregnant or lactating.

        &gt;=37.5°C on Day 0 may be included in the study at a repeat visit provided:

          1. They do not have an oral temperature &gt;=37.5°C at the repeat visit,

          2. The repeat visit is no more than 5 calendar days after the initial Day 0 visit,
