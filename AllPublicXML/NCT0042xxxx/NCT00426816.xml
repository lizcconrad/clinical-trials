  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Sleep Time (TST), Latency to Persistent Sleep (LPS) and Wake time after sleep onset (WASO) derived from polysomongraphic (PSG) recording.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Statistical paramaters of sleep measured by analysis of Polysomnography during night section of subject visit. Measured for one night during each 4 study visits and twice at screening. All visits will take in total approximately 9 weeks from screening to follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective PSG measures of sleep continuity including: wake during sleep (WDS), wake after sleep (WAS), and number of awakenings during sleep. Objective PSG measures of sleep structure</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Real time Polysomnography technique using combination of EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG to collect data on physiological cleep activity. Data/graphs are collected and analysed post sleep. Measured for one night during each 4 study visits and twice at screening. All visits will take in total approximately 9 weeks from screening to follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective PSG measures of sleep structure: Non-REM sleep time, Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS) time (stage 3 and 4), Stage 2 non-REM sleep time; REM sleep time, REM activity, REM density.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Real time Polysomnography technique using combination of EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG to collect data on physiological cleep activity. Data/graphs are collected and analysed post sleep. Measured for one night during each 4 study visits and twice at screening. All visits will take in total approximately 9 weeks from screening to follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spectral analysis of EEG</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Collected as part of PSG. Graph spectra can be quantitatively analysed to assess electrical activity in the brain. Measured for one night during each 4 study visits and twice at screening. All visits will take in total approximately 9 weeks from screening to follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Post-Sleep Questionnaire: TST, WASO, SOL, number of awakenings, and sleep quality (SQ) to be applied on each morning following PSG recording.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subject answers sleep quality questionnaires after night of sleep during the visit. Measured for each morning after each 4 study night visits and twice at screening. All visits will take in total approximately 9 weeks from screening to follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Daytime cognitive function data on the morning following dosing, including tests of alertness, memory, attention and fine motor control (i.e. Romberg, VAS for sleepiness/alertness, DSST, and immediate and delayed word recall).</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of insomnia effects on daytime regular functions</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HVLT-R (verbal memory tests), TST, SOL, SQ, WAS and number of awakenings measured with the Post-Sleep Questionnaire score collected on specified mornings at home during the 3-day period following each 2-night PSG sessions.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Further questionnaires answered after each visit regarding sleep quality. Measured during night and day sections at each visit depending on the outcome.</description>
