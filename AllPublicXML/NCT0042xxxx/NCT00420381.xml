        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease.

          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol.

          -  Patients must not be eligible for a higher priority GOG protocol, if one exists.

          -  Patients who have received one prior regimen must have a GOG Performance Status of 0,
             1, or 2. Patients who have received two prior regimens must have a GOG Performance
             Status of 0 or 1.

          -  Any hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least one
             week prior to registration. Continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted.

          -  Any other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including immunologic agents,
             must be discontinued at least four weeks prior to registration.

          -  Patients must have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for
             management of primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another
             organoplatinum compound.

          -  Patients must NOT have received any non-cytotoxic therapy for management of recurrent
             or persistent disease.

          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception (for example,
             intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for 3
             months after discontinuation of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previous enzastaurin treatment.

          -  Patients who have received radiation to more than 25% of marrow-bearing areas

          -  Patients with other invasive malignancies, with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             cancer, who had (or have) any evidence of other cancer present within the last 5 years
             or whose previous cancer treatment contraindicates this protocol therapy.

          -  Patients who have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not
             received regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          -  Patients who are unable to discontinue use of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and
             phenytoin (refer to Concomitant Medications for a discussion of enzyme inducing
             anti-epileptic drugs [EIAEDs]).

          -  Patients who are receiving concurrent administration of any other systemic anticancer
             therapy except for a biphosphonate if patient has bony metastases.

          -  Patients who have received prior therapy with non-cytotoxic agents (i.e. bevacizumab).

          -  Patients with serious concomitant systemic disorders (for example, active infection or
             abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) indicative of cardiac disease) that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient and his/her ability to
             complete the study.
