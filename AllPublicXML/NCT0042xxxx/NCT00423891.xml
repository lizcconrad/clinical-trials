        <title>Mean Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Mean Trough Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of Entecavir in LVD-naive and LVD-experienced Participants, by Age Cohort</title>
        <description>Cmax and Cmin were derived from plasma concentration of ETV versus time and measured in nanograms per milliliters (ng/mL). Blood samples were obtained before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration on Day 14 (+/- 4 days) for the PK assessment. Plasma samples were analyzed for ETV with a validated method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. Note: PK parameters were summarized for only Groups A and B. PK assessment was optional for Group C participants (NA-experienced participants who were included with the September 2011 country-specific protocol amendment). No Group C participants chose to participate in the PK assessment.</description>

            <description>Participants with less than (&lt;) 1 week of prior LVD therapy and with no LVD therapy within 24 weeks prior to enrollment were included in Group A. Prior to Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment, Cohort 1 (age ≥ 2 years to ≤ 6 years) and Cohort 2 (&gt;6 years to ≤ 12 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg, once a day (QD) and Cohort 3 (age &gt;12 years to ≤18 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg, or ETV tablets, 0.5 mg, QD. Following PK analysis, those who met the specified dosing requirements (at least 0.5 mg/day) and could tolerate swallowing ETV tablets were allowed to choose either formulation. Entecavir (ETV) was administered for a maximum of 120 weeks.</description>

          <description>Cmax and Cmin were derived from plasma concentration of ETV versus time and measured in nanograms per milliliters (ng/mL). Blood samples were obtained before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration on Day 14 (+/- 4 days) for the PK assessment. Plasma samples were analyzed for ETV with a validated method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. Note: PK parameters were summarized for only Groups A and B. PK assessment was optional for Group C participants (NA-experienced participants who were included with the September 2011 country-specific protocol amendment).

          <title>Mean Apparent Total Body Clearance (CLT/F) of Entecavir in LVD-naive and LVD-experienced Participants, by Age Cohort</title>
          <description>CLT/F was calculated by dividing the dose of ETV by AUC(TAU) of ETV and was measured in liters per hour (L/h). Blood samples were obtained before study drug administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours after study drug administration on Day 14 (+/- 4 days) for the PK assessment. Plasma samples were analyzed for ETV with a validated method using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection. PK assessment was optional for Group C participants (NA-experienced participants who were included with the September 2011 country-specific protocol amendment). No Group C participants chose to participate in the PK assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Hepatitis B s Antigen (HBsAg) Loss Through Week 96 in Treated Participants</title>
        <description>HBsAg loss: HBsAg negative. The method used for detection of HBsAg was the ADVIA Centaur iImmunoassay system. Baseline was the last value measured prior to or on the date of the first dose of study therapy.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
        <population>The intent-to-treat method of Non-Completer = Failure was used through Week 48 in which all treated participants were analyzed, and participants with missing data at the analysis week were considered failures. After Week 48, the method of Non-Completer = Missing was used, in which participants with missing data at the analysis week were excluded.</population>

            <description>Participants with &lt; 1 week of prior LVD therapy and with no LVD therapy within 24 weeks prior to enrollment were included in Group A. Prior to PK assessment, Cohort 1 (age ≥ 2 years to ≤ 6 years) and Cohort 2 (&gt;6 years to ≤ 12 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg, once a day (QD) and Cohort 3 (age &gt;12 years to ≤18 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.015 mg/kg up to 0.5 mg, or ETV tablets, 0.5 mg, QD. Following PK analysis, those who met the specified dosing requirements (at least 0.5 mg/day) and could tolerate swallowing ETV tablets were allowed to choose either formulation. Entecavir (ETV) was administered for a maximum of 120 weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Hepatitis B e Antigen Seroconversion Through Week 96 in Treated Participants</title>
        <description>HBe seroconversion: loss of HBeAg (HBeAg negative) with positive HB e antibodies (HBeAb), ie both the presence of HBeAb and the absence of HBeAg. The method used for the detection HBeAg seroconversion was the DiaSorin - Anti HBe enzyme immunoassay kit. Baseline was the last value measured prior to or on the date of the first dose of study therapy.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants Who Had a Protocol Defined Response (PDR) Through Week 96 in Treated Participants</title>
          <description>PDR was defined as confirmed HBV DNA &lt; 50 IU/mL plus confirmed HBeAg seroconversion on 2 sequential measurements at least 14 days apart. Baseline was the last value measured prior to or on the date of the first dose of study therapy.</description>
          <population>The intent-to-treat method of Non-Completer = Failure was used through Week 48 in which all treated participants were analyzed, and participants with missing data at the analysis week were considered failures. After Week 48, the method of Non-Completer = Missing was used, in which participants with missing data at the analysis week were excluded.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Combination of ALT Normalization and HBV DNA Less Than 50 IU/mL, Without HBeAg Seroconversion, Through Week 96 in Treated Participants</title>
        <description>Hepatitis B virus DNA by PCR was measured using the Roche COBAS TaqMan - HPS assay and was reported in IU/mL. Baseline was the last value measured prior to or on the date of the first dose of study therapy. Normalization in ALT= ALT ≤ 1.0*ULN. HBe seroconversion: loss of HBeAg (HBeAg negative) with positive HBeAb. The method used for the detection of HBeAg/Ab serologies was the DiaSorin enzyme immunoassay kit.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to Week 96</time_frame>
        <population>The intent-to-treat method of Non-Completer = Failure was used through Week 48 in which all treated participants were analyzed, and participants with missing data at the analysis week were considered failures. After Week 48, the method of Non-Completer = Missing was used, in which participants with missing data at the analysis week were excluded.</population>

Prior to PK assessment, Cohort 1 (age ≥ 2 years to ≤ 6 years) and Cohort 2 (&gt; 6 years to ≤ 12 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.030 mg/kg up to 1.0 mg, QD and Cohort 3 (age &gt;12 years to ≤18 years) received ETV oral solution, 0.030 mg/kg up to 1.0 mg, or ETV tablets, 1.0 mg QD. Following PK analysis, those who met the specified dosing requirements (at least 1.0 mg/day) and could tolerate swallowing ETV tablets were allowed to choose either formulation. Entecavir (ETV) was administered for a maximum of 120 weeks.</description>
