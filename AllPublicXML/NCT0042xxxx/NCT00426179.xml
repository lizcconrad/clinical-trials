    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male non-smoking subjects aged 18-55 years, with a history of seasonal
             allergic rhinitis consistent with Timothy grass pollen allergy. They must show: a
             positive skin prick test to Timothy grass pollen (wheal difference Timothy grass
             pollen - negative control ≥ 3 mm) at or within the 12 months preceding the screening
             visit and demonstrate symptomatic worsening (TNSS ≥4) within one hour after nasal
             allergen challenge

          -  Be otherwise healthy with no health problems that may jeopardize the subjects
             participating in the study, absence of history of other significant allergies.

          -  Subjects and their partners must agree to use effective contraceptive measures from
             screening until the end of study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Respiratory disease other than a history of mild stable asthma not requiring treatment
             and associated with normal lung function.

          -  Structural nasal abnormalities or nasal polyps on examination, a history of frequent
             nose bleeding, recent nasal surgery or recent (within 8 weeks prior to baseline visit)
             or recent (four weeks) or ongoing upper or lower respiratory tract infection.

          -  Use of any medication that would affect the response to the allergen challenge (e.g.
             corticosteroids, decongestants, anti-histamines, medications with anti-inflammatory
             effects) or any other nasally applied medication within 14 days prior to allergen
             challenge (30 days for systemic anti-inflammatory therapy including oral
             corticosteroids), or known to influence Imatinib bioavailability or clearance

          -  History or laboratory evidence of acute or chronic renal insufficiency or abnormal
             liver function.

          -  Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from or be withdrawn from the study at the
             discretion of the investigator or the sponsor at any time. Subjects may be withdrawn
             from the study prematurely for one of the following reasons:

          -  Subject withdrew consent

          -  Upper respiratory tract infection

          -  Presence of allergic rhinitis symptoms in the screening period or prior to pre-wash on
             Day 1

          -  A past medical history of inherited heart disease, valve defect, cardiomyopathy,
             rheumatic fever, arrhythmias, cardiac interventions or clinically significant ECG
             abnormalities.

          -  Adverse events and non-tolerable symptoms resulting from allergen challenge

          -  Administration of a concomitant medication (other than those randomized to receive
             Fluticasone propionate) that would impact on the study results (e.g. corticosteroids),
             including any subjects requiring asthma therapy (inhaled or systemic).
