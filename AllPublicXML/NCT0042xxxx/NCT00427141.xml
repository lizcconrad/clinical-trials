    <textblock>
      Studies for GSK580416 have been completed in rats and dogs. The main toxic effects seen in
      animals affected the digestive system and blood cells. Study OPS106400 will be the first
      administration of GSK580416 in humans. Parts A and B of this study will examine the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing single doses of GSK580416 with reference to
      placebo. Part C of the study will assess the effect of food on the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of a single dose of GSK580416 in healthy subjects.
