  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular risk factors cluster in hyperandrogenic women - including those presenting
      with the polycystic ovary syndrome - in association with insulin resistance, obesity, and
      other metabolic disorders.

      The present clinical trial intends to compare the effects of oral contraceptives and
      metformin on PCOS patients, focusing on classic and non-classic cardiovascular risk markers
      and indexes of cardiovascular performance, in order to whether or not, as suspected by
      previous data obtained in non-hyperandrogenic women, oral contraceptives worsen the
      cardiovascular risk profile of PCOS women, favoring the use of metformin if the latter
      actually ameliorates such a risk.
