  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of oral ixabepilone administered for 5
      successive days every 21 days in participants with advanced cancer. The safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of ixabepilone in the body will be studied. In addition, this study will
      assess preliminary evidence of the effect of food and famotidine on the pharmacokinetics of
      oral ixabepilone.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Ixabepilone</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is based on Cycle 1 data only and defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants with no more than 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (or fewer than one third of participants if more than 6 receive treatment) with at least 2 participants experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level. DLT=an event, such as neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; Gr 3 or 4 nausea or diarrhea; Gr 3 fatigue or asthenia; transient arthralgia or recalcitrant myalgia; and prolonged recovery from a toxicity, that occurs during the first course of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With DLTs by Worst Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1), continuously</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) graded by CTC version 3. Grade (Gr) 1=mild; Gr 2=moderate; Gr 3=severe; Gr 4=life threatening; Gr 5=Death related to AE. DLT is defined as an event related to ixabepilone that occurs during the first course of treatment. Includes neutropenia; thrombocytopenia; Gr 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despite adequate medical intervention and prophylaxis; Gr 3 fatigue or asthenia; transient arthralgia or myalgia unresponsive to medical intervention; any Gr 3 nonhematologic toxicity; and prolonged recovery from a toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Death as Outcome, Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs), and AEs Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1 through 21 (Cycle 1), continuously</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. Treatment related=possibly, probably, or certainly related to and of unknown relationship to study treatment.</description>

If none of the first 3 participants experiences a DLT in the first 21-day course, a new cohort is opened at the next dose level (30 mg/d). If 1 of the first 3 participants experiences a DLT, an additional 3 participants will be enrolled at this dose level for a total of 6 participants. If 2 or more of the 6 participants (or 1/3 or more of a cohort with more than 6 participants) experience a DLT, this dose level will be considered above the MTD. The MTD is the maximum dose that can be given to 6 participants without producing a DLT in more than 1 participant (or fewer than 1/3 if the cohort has more than 6 participants). More participants may be enrolled at any level to provide additional safety data. On all dosing days in Cycle 1, participants must fast at least 4 hours before and 4 hours after treatment.

          <description>After the ixabepilone MTD (25 mg) has been defined, participants who completed Cycle 1 (ixabepilone, 25 mg, given alone once daily orally on Days 1 through 5 of 21-day cycle, with participants fasting at least 4 hours before and 4 hours after treatment on all dosing days) then cross over to Cycle 2, during which they receive famotidine, 40 mg. Prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 2, famotidine administered in an oral dose 2 hours before ixabepilone 25-mg dose.</description>
          <population>Participants who received ixabepilone, at the MTD of 25 mg, alone in Cycle 1 and had adequate concentration profiles. Participants then were crossed over to a cycle in which they received MTD (25 mg) ixabepilone with famotidine,40 mg, on Day 1 of Cycle 2.</population>
