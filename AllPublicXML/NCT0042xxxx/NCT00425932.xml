  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to further investigate rituximab in the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis and to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging of the joints as a possible method to
      improve the evaluation of treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that has been approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's
      B cell lymphoma (a type of cancer) and for certain patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). To date, more than 1000 subjects with rheumatoid
      arthritis have received rituximab in clinical studies.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a modern and sensitive method of looking at joints in
      people with rheumatoid arthritis. It uses a magnetic field to create an image. The MRI takes
      an image in 3 dimensions and this provides a better picture for a physician to see more
      details.

      There are two treatment groups in this study with equal numbers of patients assigned to each
      group. All the patients will receive their baseline Methotrexate and two intravenous
      infusions 2 weeks apart of one of the following:

        -  1000 mg rituximab or

        -  placebo. Patients outcomes will be compared between the 2 groups. After week 24 (open
           label phase), the patients will receive rituximab if rheumatoid arthritis remains
           active.

      All the patients will have MRI of their dominant hand and wrist with and without gadolinium
      performed at baseline, 12, 24 and 48 weeks on 1.5 Tesla MRI . Some patients will also have
      additional MRI of the same hand and wrist without gadolinium at the same time points on 0.2
      Tesla MRI. Comparison of the images from the two machines will be performed.

      Various blood biomarkers will also be examined, compared between the 2 treatment groups and
      correlated with the MRI results.
