    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II trial whose aim is to assess the
      antitumor activity of two sequential schedules of docetaxel and cisplatin followed by
      gemcitabine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC; Histologic subtypes may
             include large cell, squamous cell, or adenocarcinoma or a generic cytological
             diagnosis of NSCLC;

          -  Patients must have a locoregionally advanced unresectable non metastatic NSCLC Stage
             IIIB (only N3 supraclavicular or T4 for pleural effusion) or Stage IV according to the
             revised International Staging System;

          -  Patients must have at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.

          -  Previous radical surgery (more 30 days before study entry) is allowed but a pathologic
             proof of progression of neoplastic disease must be documented;

          -  WHO Performance Status 0 or 1 ;

          -  Weight loss &lt; 5% within the last 3 months;

               -  Renal function: Serum creatinine &lt; 1 upper normal limits (UNL). In case of limit
                  value of serum creatinine, the creatinine clearance should be &gt; 60 mL/min

               -  Hepatic functions: Serum bilirubin &lt; 1 x UNL; ASAT and ALAT &lt; 2.5 x UNL; Alkaline
                  phosphatase &lt; 5 x UNL (unless accompanied by extensive bone metastases)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy ; prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant
             chemotherapy is allowed if ended at least 12 months before enrollment;

          -  Prior radiotherapy for NSCLC to measurable lesions. Prior radiotherapy (to &lt; 25% of
             the bone marrow) is allowed in non target lesions. At least 4 weeks must be elapsed
             since the completion of the radiotherapy and the patient must have all side effects
             recovered.

          -  Cyto-histological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, carcinoid, or mixed small-cell
             / non-small cell lung cancer;

          -  Patients with evaluable, not measurable disease only (non target lesions);

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases or with leptomeningeal disease;

          -  History of prior malignancies, except for cured non melanoma skin cancer, curatively
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or other cancer curatively treated and with no
             evidence of disease for at least five years;

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to polysorbate 80;

          -  Pregnant or lactating women (women of childbearing potential must use adequate
             contraception);

          -  Current peripheral neuropathy NCI grade &gt; 2;

          -  Significant neurological or psychiatric disorders ;

          -  Participation in clinical trials with other experimental agents within 30 days of
             study entry;

          -  Other serious concomitant illness of medical conditions:

               1. Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease;

               2. History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including demential or
                  seizures;

               3. Active infection requiring iv antibiotics;

               4. Active ulcer, unstable diabetes mellitus or other contra-indication to
                  corticotherapy;

               5. Any other condition which in the judgement of the investigator would place the
                  subject at undue risk or interfere with the study.
