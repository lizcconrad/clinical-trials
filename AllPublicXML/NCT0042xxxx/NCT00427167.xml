      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response of healthy volunteers to an
      experimental malaria vaccine called AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark) + CPG 7909.
      Malaria is an infection of red blood cells caused by a parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, that
      is spread by certain kinds of mosquitoes. Each year, about 1 million people are killed by
      malaria worldwide, most of them young children in Africa. AMA1 C1 may help block the malaria
      parasite from getting into red blood cells. The vaccine is mixed with Alhydrogel® (Registered
      Trademark), a material that is commonly added to vaccines to make them work better (also
      called an adjuvant). Besides evaluating the vaccine, this study will also test two solutions
      of an experimental adjuvant, CPG 7909-P and CPG 7909-S.

      Healthy people between 18 and 50 years of age may be eligible for this 7-month study.
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (A, B, C or D below). All
      receive two vaccinations, given as a shot in the upper arm either 1 or 2 months apart, as
      shown:

        -  Group A: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-P at Day 0 and Day 28
           (1-month interval)

        -  Group B: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-S at Day 0 and Day 28
           (1-month interval)

        -  Group C: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-P at Day 0 and Day 56
           (2-month interval)

        -  Group D: AMA1 CI/Alhydrogel® (Registered Trademark)/CPG 7909-S at Day 0 and Day 56
           (2-month interval)

      Group A and B participants return to the clinic for checkups at 3, 7, and 14 days after each
      vaccination and again at months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Group C and D participants come to the
      clinic at 3, 7, and 14 days after each vaccination and again at months 3, 4, 5, and 7.

      In addition to the vaccinations, the study includes the following procedures:

        -  Photographs of the subject's arm where the vaccination is given if a rash develops.

        -  Daily temperature and symptoms record for the first 6 days after each of the 2
           vaccinations, and at any other time there is concern about fever or other symptoms.

        -  Blood draws about 12 times during the study to check for safety and to measure the
           antibody response and the effect of the study vaccine.

      Some participants may be asked to undergo plasmapheresis, a procedure for collecting plasma,
      the liquid part of the blood. This is done by using a machine called a blood cell separator.
      Blood is collected through a needle place...

      AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 is a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. The objectives of this Phase 1
      study are to confirm the previously demonstrated safety and immunogenicity of AMA1-C1 + CPG
      7909 formulated in a phosphate buffer. In addition, this study will evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of AMA1-C1 + CPG 7909 formulated in a saline buffer, and determine if the
      addition of CPG 7909 in a saline buffer enhances the immune response to AMA1-C1 in a manner
      similar to that seen with the addition of CPG 7909 in a phosphate buffer. The immunological
      effect of giving a second dose of vaccine at 1 or 2 months will also be evaluated. The study
      is a double blind Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be
      screened and 24 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups in a 2x2
      design: 6 volunteers will receive 2 doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500
      micrograms CPG 7909 (phosphate) at a 1-month dosing interval; 6 volunteers will receive 2
      doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 micrograms CPG 7909 (saline) at a 1 month
      dosing interval; 6 volunteers will receive 2 doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500
      micrograms CPG 7909 (phosphate) at a 2-month dosing interval; and 6 volunteers will receive 2
      doses of 80 micrograms AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + 500 micrograms CPG 7909 (saline) at a 2 month
      dosing interval. Safety outcome measures are local and systemic (including laboratory)
      adverse events. Immune responses to vaccination will be measured by enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA), and will be compared
      among groups.
