    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy and safety of ozarelix 15 mg. given IM 2 weeks apart on
      the improvement of symptoms and the duration of improvement for up to 6 months in men with
      BPH who are over 50 years of age.

      This study will compare the improvement in symptom scores, peak flow rate and quality of life
      in men suffering from LUTS secondary to BPH following treatment with ozarelix. Ozarelix will
      be compared to placebo and injections will be given 14 days apart. Patients will be followed
      for 6 months and both safety and efficacy will be assessed at monthly visits.Additionally the
      impact of treatment on erectile function, if any, as well as PSA and Testosterone levels will
      be monitored.
