      Purpose: Assess different potential algorithms to improve the service and cost utility for
      diagnosis and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in patients with high
      pretest probability in Hong Kong.

      Hypothesis: Newer home sleep study device and algorithm provides an alternative for inpatient
      sleep study Design: Prospective randomized study Subject: High pretest probability of OSAS
      patients referred to a tertiary centre.

      Study instruments: a portable sleep study device, AutoCPAP and inpatient sleep monitoring
      system.

      Interventions: comparison between 3 different algorithms of health service for OSA patients
      would be made: conventional in-patient sleep study, empirical treatment and home sleep study.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome is the validity of the home sleep study device
      compare to inpatient sleep study. The secondary outcomes are the relative efficacy of
      different algorithms and the numbers of failed procedures in each algorithm.
