  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 month study of monthly injections of ranibizumab in subjects with polypoidal
      choroidal vasculopathy as diagnosed by fluoresceins/indocyanine green (FA/ICG) angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous treatment in subjects is allowed as long as appropriate washout period has elapsed.
      Patients will be followed by 4M ETDRS vision testing as well as scheduled OCT, ICG, FA and
      Fundus Photography.
