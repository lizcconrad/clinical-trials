  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BMEC-1217B is an abbreviated version of an old Chinese formulation. The ratio of each
      component was adopted by the sponsor following the observation that BMEC-1217B prepared from
      this ratio resulted in best pharmacological profile and in vitro bioactivities.

      BMEC-1217B was studied for the pharmacological activity on the release of cysteinyl
      leukotrienes, IL-4 and TNF-alpha in vitro and the airway hyperreactivity. The result
      indicated that BMEC-1217B can inhibit the synthesis of several key pro-inflammatory mediators
      involved in the pathophysiology of allergic asthma and can also improve lung function in a
      mouse model of allergic asthma.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing dose of
      BMEC-1217B when administered orally in healthy volunteers.
