    <textblock>
      The purpose is to see how quickly two different types of prostate cancer patients respond
      when taking enzastaurin.

      Cohort 1 - asymptomatic patients with androgen-independent PSA-progressive disease with or
      without clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.

      Cohort 2 - patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer (documented bone or
      soft tissue metastases) with rising PSA, clinical, radiographic disease progression following
      one prior docetaxel-based regimen
