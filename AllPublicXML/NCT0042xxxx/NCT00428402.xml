      Science Across Subjects) Assessment Objectives:

        -  Determine whether students are aware of the MIDAS Project.

        -  Identify strengths and weaknesses of MIDAS Project components including: integrated
           environmental health and science (EHS) curricula, field experiences, seminars and

      You are being asked to give your child permission to take part in a focus group to talk about
      what he or she has learned over the past year. Your child's school and other schools in the
      area have been working with a program called the Models of Implementation and Dissemination
      of Environmental Health and Science Across Subjects (MIDAS) Project. The MIDAS Project was
      developed by The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX.

      Purpose:

      Students will be asked to share about the topics that they learned about over the past year,
      including their field trip experiences. Participation in the focus group is strictly
      voluntary, and your child may or may not choose to take part. This focus group will not be
      graded, and your child's name will not be recorded with his or her responses. If your child
      chooses not to participate in this focus group, he or she will not be penalized in any way.
