  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membranous glomerulopathy (MN) is a common immune-mediated glomerular disease and the leading
      cause of nephrotic syndrome in Caucasian adults. 1 Because of its frequency, it remains the
      second or third cause of end-stage renal disease caused by a primary glomerulonephritis. 2 At
      presentation, 70% to 80% of patients have the nephrotic syndrome. 1, 3, 4 Proteinuria greater
      than 2.0 grams per day is found in &gt; 80% of patients at presentation, with greater than 10
      grams found in as many as 30%. 5 The disease affects patients of all ages, but it is most
      often diagnosed in middle age with the peak incidence during the fourth and fifth decades of
      life. There is close to a two-to-one predominance of males to females diagnosed with the
      disease. Idiopathic MN affects all races. Current therapeutic options include corticosteroids
      alone or in combination with alkylating agents, cyclosporin A, and mycophenolate mofetil. The
      most widely recognized, and best-validated regimen is combination therapy with
      corticosteroids and an alkylating agent, but its use is associated with significant adverse
      effects. Recent meta-analysis confirmed that present day treatments are far from ideal 6
      Thus, it should not come as a surprise that the outcome of MN has not substantially improved
      over the past 30 years, and up to 40% of patients still progress to end-stage renal failure.
      7 Like in other glomerular diseases the amount of protein in the urine correlates well with
      long term prognosis. Thus, this parameter has been used in previous studies, and will be used
      in this study, as the primary indicator of effectiveness of therapy. We proposed to do a
      pilot study to test the hypothesis that selective B lymphocyte depletion will result in
      disappearance of pathogenic antibodies and induction of remission of the nephrotic syndrome
      in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Our population will be 10 adults. The
      study will be conducted between our Nephrology Divisions at Mayo Clinic Rochester,
      Jacksonville, and Scottsdale. We will enroll patients with a GFR 25 ml/min as estimated by
      creatinine clearance and proteinuria &gt; 4g/24h, while receiving an ACEI or ARB and with BP
      controlled of &lt; 130/80 mmHg. Patients will receive Rituximab 1g on Day 1 and 15. Patients
      followed for 1 years following completion of treatment. The primary outcome will be change in
      urinary protein excretion at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be changes in serum albumin,
      serum lipid?s profile, the number of partial remissions, time to remission, and incidence of
      relapses. We will also perform a pharmacokinetic study to evaluate the effect of proteinuria
      on the bio-availability and effects of the drug.

      There is convincing evidence from both experimental and human studies that MN is mediated by
      the deposition of IgG antibodies in the subepithelial aspect of the GBM. More debatable, is
      the mechanism(s) of deposition of these antibodies in that location. Given the key role of
      IgG antibodies in MN, it is reasonable to postulate that suppression of antibody production
      by depleting B cells and/or plasma cells may improve or even resolve the glomerular pathology
      as reflected by a reduction in proteinuria. There is evidence that this strategy is effective
      in the treatment of other antibody-mediated diseases and preliminary studies in MN are
      promising. Data from animal studies suggest that immune deposition resulting from B cell
      activation promote injury to the glomerular filtering barrier and proteinuria.103 In humans,
      as discussed above, there is evidence that therapy directed against B cells, e.g.
      cyclophosphamide, is effective in MN. Cyclophosphamide has striking direct effects on B cell
      function, and suppresses the secretion of immunoglobulins.104 Thus, a case could be made for
      using an agent capable of depleting B cells, and therefore halting the production of
      nephrotoxic immunoglobulins. This approach could stop the pathogenic events at their initial
      stages and potentially result in resolution of the pathological process. The rationale for
      using such an approach can be further substantiated by the fact that Th2 pathway for antibody
      response is activated and that inhibition of B cells and of pathogenic antibodies is strictly
      associated with beneficial effects of immunosuppressive drugs in experimental MN.

      This is a open-label Phase I/II pilot study. Patients will receive Rituximab at a total dose
      of 1g on Day 1 and Day 15 according to infusion guidelines. Patient experience complete
      clinical response (as per response criteria outlined below), AND Patient subsequently
      experiences clinical relapse, defined as return of proteinuria to 4 g/24h, and in whom CD20+
      cell count have normalized, will receive a second course of Rituximab. Patients who relapse
      but who remain B cell depleted will not be retreated.

      <textblock>
        Patients must meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for study entry:

          -  Membranous Nephropathy with diagnostic biopsy performed within the last 3 years. Renal
             biopsy slides and electron photomicrographs will be reviewed by study investigators,
             and must confirm a diagnosis of MN.

          -  Age &amp;#61619; 18 years.

          -  Proteinuria as measured via Uprot/UCr ratio &gt; 4.0 on a spot sample of a 24-hour urine
             collection, despite ACE inhibitor / ARB treatment. The choice of urine
             protein/creatinine ratios is in accord with recently developed National Kidney
             Foundation Chronic Kidney Disease (NKF-CKD) guidelines.107 The NKF-CKD guidelines
             advocate urine protein/creatinine ratios as the preferred method for evaluation of
             urinary protein excretion in both adults and children.

          -  Patients need to be treated with an ACEI and/or ARB, for at least 3 months prior to
             enrollment with adequately controlled blood pressure (BP &lt;140/80 mm Hg in &gt;75% of the
             readings).

          -  Women must be post-menopausal, surgically sterile or practicing a medically approved
             method of contraception.

          -  Patients with thromboembolic complications and/or clinical signs of NS that are not
             controlled with conventional medical treatment will enter the immunosuppressive
             portion of the protocol (Rituxan treatment) without the 3 months of ACE/ARB treatment
             (high risk patients).

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol

          -  Adequate renal function as indicated by estimated GFR &amp;#8805; 25 ml/min per 1.73m2
             and/or or serum creatinine &lt;4.0 mg/dL in the presence of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy.
             The GFR will be estimated using the 4 variable MDRD equation as published in the
             NKF-CKD guidelines. The same NKF-CKD guidelines also promote the use of estimated GFR
             (GFRest) values rather than serum creatinine levels or creatinine clearance
             measurements as the preferred non-invasive method of determining glomerular filtration
             rates.107 We have opted to use this approach rather than the much more expensive and
             more invasive techniques that employ clearance measurements of exogenous substances
             (such as inulin or iothalamate) since the likelihood of detecting significant changes
             in GFR in this short term study is remote - no matter which method is chosen. The
             inclusion of and/or serum creatinine &lt;4.0 mg/dL is to cover possibility of incomplete
             24-hour collection at time baseline creatinine clearance.)

          -  Adequate liver function, as indicated by bilirubin, AST, and alkaline phosphatase
             levels (up to &lt; 2.5 times the upper normal limit).

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test (for women of child bearing age)

          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of
             birth control during treatment and for twelve months (1 year) after completion of
             treatment or a period of 21 months for those undergoing retreatment.
