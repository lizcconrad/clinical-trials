    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item assessment used to assess the severity of depression and its improvement during the course of therapy. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. The total score was the sum of the scores from HAMD-17 Items 1 through 17 and ranged from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Assessment Battery: Change From Baseline in Word List Learning and Delayed Recall Test (WLDRT) up to Week 8 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The WLDRT is a test of visual learning and recall. Participants are shown a series of words (commonly used nouns) and asked to say each of the words aloud, then are asked to recall the words and the total number of correct words recalled is recorded (possible score ranged from 0 to 15 words). The process is repeated 3 times. The Word List Learning Test score is calculated as the average number of words recalled during the first 3 trials. After a 30-minute delay, participants are again asked to recall the words, and the total number of correct words remembered after the delay is recorded as the Delayed Recall Test score. The baseline value was the last non-missing value before the first randomized double-blind study drug administration. Least Squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Assessment Battery: Change From Baseline in Symbol Digit Substitution Test (SDST) up to Week 8 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SDST is an attention-demanding psychomotor component based on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The participant is given a symbol/digit code in which each of the digits 1 through 9 is paired with a different symbol. Below the code, a series of symbols selected from those in the code are presented in an irregular order. The participant is instructed to write the number that is appropriate for each symbol in the space below each symbol and to complete as many correct digits as possible within a 90-second test period. For this test, the number of attempts and number of correct digits is collected. The percentage of correct digits is presented based on the number of correct digits divided by the number of attempts, multiplied by 100 (score ranged from 0 to 100% correct). Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Assessment Battery: Change From Baseline in Two Digit Cancellation Test up to Week 8 Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Two Digit Cancellation Test (2DCT) is a clinical adaptation of the visual search tasks that have been used to investigate cognitive processes involved in attention and visual information processing. For this test, the participant is presented with a piece of paper containing rows of digits. At the top of the page are two target digits. The participant is instructed to examine each row of digits working from top to bottom and left to right crossing off each number that matches either of the two numbers at the top of the page. The number of targets hit, number of errors, and number of times the participant had to be reminded of the task are recorded for the 45-second test. The 2DCT composite cognitive score is calculated as the number of targets hit - number of errors - number of reminders. 2DCT score ranges 0-40 with higher score indicating better cognition. Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

    <description>LY2216684: flexible dose of 3, 6, 9, or 12 milligrams (mg), tablets, administered orally, once daily for 8 weeks.
For the first week of treatment, participants received a starting dose of 3 mg/day. Then, based on tolerability, for the next 7 weeks, the dose could remain at 3 mg/day; it could be increased 3 mg at a time (scheduled visit) to a maximum dose of 12 mg/day; or it could be decreased 3 mg at any time (scheduled or unscheduled visits) to a minimum dose of 3 mg/day.
All participants were required to take an equal number of tablets (2) and capsules (2) per day. Therefore, participants on 3 mg/day and 6 mg/day of LY2216684 also received 1 LY2216684-matching placebo tablet + 2 escitalopram-matching placebo capsules. Participants on 9 mg/day and 12 mg/day of LY2216684 also received 2 escitalopram-matching placebo capsules.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) Total Score</title>
        <description>The HAMD-17 is a 17-item assessment used to assess the severity of depression and its improvement during the course of therapy. Each item was evaluated and scored using either a 5-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 4 (very severe) or a 3-point scale of 0 (not present/absent) to 2 (marked). Higher scores indicate greater symptom severity. The total score was the sum of the scores from HAMD-17 Items 1 through 17 and ranged from 0 (not at all depressed) to 52 (severely depressed). Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) Total Score up to Week 8 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The HAMA is a 14-item assessment used to assess the severity of anxiety. The investigator talked to the participant about the symptoms he or she experienced during the previous week. Each item was scored using a 5-point scale (0=not present to 4=very severe). The total score of HAMA ranged from 0 (normal) to 56 (severe). Least Squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 Health Status Survey is a generic, health-related scale assessing a participant’s quality of life on 8 domains: general health (GH), physical functioning (PF), role-physical, role-emotional, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and mental health. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items (GH [range: 5-25]; PF [range: 10-30]; role-physical [range: 4-8]; role-emotional [range: 3-6]; social functioning [range: 2-10]; bodily pain [range: 2-11]; vitality [range: 4-24]; mental health [range: 5-30]) and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning. Two summary scores (mental component and physical component scores) were constructed based on the 8 SF-36 domains. Mental component summary and physical component summary scores range from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicate better health status).</description>

        <description>OAS-M is a clinician-administered semistructured interview designed to assess various manifestations of aggressive behavior. Final scores are rated on 3 scales: Aggression (Agg), Irritability (Irrt), Suicidality (Suic). Agg scale has 4 subscales: Verbal Assault (Aslt), Aslt Against Objects, Aslt Against Others, Aslt Against Self; each item is scored 0-5, multiplied by the frequency of the behavior, then summed together. Agg total score is the weighted sum of the subscale scores (weights: 1=Verbal Aslt, 2=Aslt Against Objects, 3=Aslt Against Others, 4=Aslt Against Self). The Irrt scale has 2 subscales: Global Irrt, Subjective Irrt. Suic scale has 3 subscales: Suicidal Tendencies, Intent of Attempt, Lethality of Attempt. The 2 Irrt and 3 Suic subscales are rated on 6 or 7 point scales from 0=none/not at all to 6/7=very extreme. The total score ranges from 0-10 for the Irrt scale and 0-16 on the Suic scale.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Fatigue Severity Scale</title>
        <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a 9-item measure of fatigue severity. Each item is scored by the participant on a scale of 1 (“Disagree”) to 7 (“Agree”), with a higher score indicating a stronger agreement with the item statement regarding the participant’s fatigue symptoms. The FSS total score ranges from 1 to 7, and is obtained by averaging the responses to the 9 items. Least Squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for treatment, investigator, visit, baseline score, treatment-by-visit, and baseline score-by-visit.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment Battery: Change From Baseline in Word List Learning and Delayed Recall Test (WLDRT) up to Week 8 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The WLDRT is a test of visual learning and recall. Participants are shown a series of words (commonly used nouns) and asked to say each of the words aloud, then are asked to recall the words and the total number of correct words recalled is recorded (possible score ranged from 0 to 15 words). The process is repeated 3 times. The Word List Learning Test score is calculated as the average number of words recalled during the first 3 trials. After a 30-minute delay, participants are again asked to recall the words, and the total number of correct words remembered after the delay is recorded as the Delayed Recall Test score. The baseline value was the last non-missing value before the first randomized double-blind study drug administration. Least Squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

        <description>The SDST is an attention-demanding psychomotor component based on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The participant is given a symbol/digit code in which each of the digits 1 through 9 is paired with a different symbol. Below the code, a series of symbols selected from those in the code are presented in an irregular order. The participant is instructed to write the number that is appropriate for each symbol in the space below each symbol and to complete as many correct digits as possible within a 90-second test period. For this test, the number of attempts and number of correct digits is collected. The percentage of correct digits is presented based on the number of correct digits divided by the number of attempts, multiplied by 100 (score ranged from 0 to 100% correct). Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment Battery: Change From Baseline in Two Digit Cancellation Test up to Week 8 Endpoint</title>
        <description>The Two Digit Cancellation Test (2DCT) is a clinical adaptation of the visual search tasks that have been used to investigate cognitive processes involved in attention and visual information processing. For this test, the participant is presented with a piece of paper containing rows of digits. At the top of the page are two target digits. The participant is instructed to examine each row of digits working from top to bottom and left to right crossing off each number that matches either of the two numbers at the top of the page. The number of targets hit, number of errors, and number of times the participant had to be reminded of the task are recorded for the 45-second test. The 2DCT composite cognitive score is calculated as the number of targets hit – number of errors – number of reminders. 2DCT score ranges 0-40 with higher score indicating better cognition. Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>

          <description>The Two Digit Cancellation Test (2DCT) is a clinical adaptation of the visual search tasks that have been used to investigate cognitive processes involved in attention and visual information processing. For this test, the participant is presented with a piece of paper containing rows of digits. At the top of the page are two target digits. The participant is instructed to examine each row of digits working from top to bottom and left to right crossing off each number that matches either of the two numbers at the top of the page. The number of targets hit, number of errors, and number of times the participant had to be reminded of the task are recorded for the 45-second test. The 2DCT composite cognitive score is calculated as the number of targets hit – number of errors – number of reminders. 2DCT score ranges 0-40 with higher score indicating better cognition. Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug and who had a baseline and at least one post-baseline 2DCT value. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) methodology was used.</population>

        <title>Cognitive Assessment Battery: Change From Baseline in Trail Making A up to Week 8 Endpoint</title>
        <description>Trail Making A is a neurocognitive test associated with general brain function. While being timed, the participant is instructed to connect 25 randomly placed circled numbers on a page in numerical sequence without lifting their pencil. If a participant makes a mistake, the mistake is pointed out and the participant must start again from the last correct circle. The total time to complete the task (up to 300 seconds, with a lower value indicating better brain function) is recorded. Least squares (LS) means were adjusted for treatment, investigator, and baseline score.</description>
