  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients requiring joint replacement is increasing due to its success in
      restoring function and pain relief, and the growing population of the elderly. One of the
      most serious complications of arthroplasty is joint prosthesis infection. Due to the absence
      of prospective, randomized, controlled studies, there is no consensus concerning diagnosis
      and treatment of prosthetic joint infections. The main objective of this trial is to evaluate
      the clinical efficacy of rifampin combination therapy versus monotherapy using cloxacillin or
      vancomycin in early staphylococcal infections after total hip and knee arthroplasty.

    <textblock>
      The study is a controlled randomized multicentre trial with 8 participating centres in
      Norway. We will include patients with the diagnosis of early infections (within 4 weeks post
      operatively)after hip or knee replacement. Patients with clinical signs of infection are
      scheduled for a standardized soft tissue revision. Diagnosis of staphylococci must be
      established by arthrocentesis or at surgical revision, and must grow in at least 2/8
      cultures.The patients will randomly be assigned to antimicrobial therapy with or without
      rifampin by a randomization programme. Antibiotics will be given for 6 weeks. Two years
      follow-up. The study end points are final follow-up visit after two years or relapse of
      infection.
