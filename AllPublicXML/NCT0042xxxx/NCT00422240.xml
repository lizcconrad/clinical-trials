  <brief_title>Study to Demonstrate the Efficacy and Safety of Adapalene/Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel in Subjects With Acne Vulgaris</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with 12 weeks of
      treatment of acne vulgaris. Efficacy and safety evaluations will be performed at Screening
      (safety only), Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12. All Investigator's Global Assessment
      evaluators and lesion counters must be trained and approved by Galderma. The evaluator of a
      subject should remain the same during the study.

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority in efficacy and assess safety of
      adapalene/benzoyl peroxide topical gel (adapalene/benzoyl peroxide gel) versus adapalene
      topical gel, 0.1% (adapalene monad); benzoyl peroxide topical gel, 2.5% (benzoyl peroxide
      monad) and topical gel vehicle (gel vehicle) in the treatment of acne vulgaris for up to 12
      weeks.
