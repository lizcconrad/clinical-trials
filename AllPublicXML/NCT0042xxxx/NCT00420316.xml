  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of the subjects during the third year after
      priming with 2 doses of GSK Biologicals' oral live attenuated HRV vaccine (Rotarix) in the
      primary vaccination study (102247). The Rotarix vaccine was administered in the primary
      vaccination study. There was no vaccine/intervention in this long-term efficacy study.

    <time_frame>During the study period for the long-term follow-up (i.e. 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Occurence of any rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) caused by the circulating wild-type rotavirus strain was assessed in terms of number of subjects experiencing diarrhoea with or without vomiting. Two occurrences of diarrhoea were classified as separate episodes if there were 5 or more diarrhoea-free days between the episodes.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Severe Rotavirus Gastroenteritis (RVGE)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study period for the long-term follow-up (i.e. 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) episodes caused by the wild-type rotavirus strain and reported during the efficacy period, were presented by severity, using the Vesikari scale. The assessment of intensity of GE episodes was done using the 20-point Vesikari scale, according to which episodes with scores greater than or equal to (≥) 11 were labeled as severe.</description>

    <time_frame>During the study period for the long-term follow-up (i.e. 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Occurence of any rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) caused by the circulating wild-type rotavirus strain was assessed in terms of number of subjects experiencing diarrhoea with or without vomiting. Two occurrences of diarrhoea were classified as separate episodes if there were 5 or more diarrhoea-free days between the episodes. Only GE episodes in which wild-type RV strain of G1 serotype was identified in a stool specimen, were included in the efficacy analysis.</description>

    <description>Occurence of any rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) caused by the circulating wild-type rotavirus strain of non-G1 serotype was assessed in terms of number of subjects experiencing diarrhoea with or without vomiting.

    <time_frame>During the study period for the long-term follow-up (i.e. 6 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.</description>
