    <textblock>
      Background

        -  HGS-ETR2 is a monoclonal antibody, produced in the laboratory from human genes.

        -  HGS-ETR2 targets a protein called the TRAIL receptor that is located on the surface of
           some tumor cells. When the TRAIL receptor is activated, it can cause the tumor cell to
           self-destruct.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the highest dose of HGS-ETR2 that can be given safely in children and young
           adults with cancer.

        -  To study the pharmacology (how the body handles the drug) of HGS-ETR2 by measuring the
           amount of drug in the bloodstream over time before and after a dose is given to the
           patient.

        -  To determine if HGS-ETR2 can stop or slow tumor growth.

        -  To determine whether proteins in tumor tissue before treatment can predict whether the
           tumor will respond to HGS-ETR2 therapy.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients 1 to 21 years of age with solid cancers that do not respond to standard therapy.

      Design:

        -  HGS-ETR2 is given through a vein (intravenously, IV) once every 14 days. Each treatment
           cycle is 28 days long and consists of two doses of HGS-ETR2.

        -  The dose of HGS-ETR2 is increased in successive small groups of patients until the
           maximum tolerated dose (highest dose with acceptable side effects) is determined.

        -  During the treatment period, patients have a physical examination at least once a week,
           and routine blood tests at least twice a week. These tests are done less frequently in
           later treatment cycles.

        -  Additional blood samples are drawn for immunology and pharmacology studies.

        -  Tests to monitor the size of the tumor (X-rays, CT scans, MRI, PET scans) are done
           periodically throughout the treatment period.

        -  Patients may continue to receive HGS-ETR2 until unacceptable side effects develop or the
           tumor grows.

      Background:

      Pediatric solid tumors represent approximately one fourth of cancer diagnoses in children.
      Despite intensive regimens, patients with metastatic or recurrent tumors have unsatisfactory
      survival rates. Therefore new therapies are needed to improve outcomes.

      Members of the TNF ligand superfamily induce death in tumor cells through direct ligation of
      death receptors and apoptosis induction.

      TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) has specific anti-tumor activity against a wide
      range of tumor cells without inducing death in normal cells. TRAIL-induced apoptosis has been
      demonstrated in a wide variety of pediatric solid tumors, including Ewing's sarcoma,
      osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma.

      HGS-ETR2 (Human Genome Sciences; human monoclonal antibody) is a fully human monoclonal
      antibody that agonistically binds TRAIL receptor 2 and, like TRAIL itself, induces apoptosis
      in a variety of malignant cell types with little effect on normal cells.

      Limited caspase 8 expression is a primary factor in limiting to TRAIL mediated cell death in
      some tumors; interferon gamma has been shown to be effective in increasing caspase-8
      expression in tumors and in restoring sensitivity of tumors to TRAIL mediated cell death.

      Objectives:

      To determine the tolerance of the adult maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities
      of lexatumumab in patients with refractory pediatric solid tumors.

      To determine the MTD of lexatumumab in the presence of fixed dosing of interferon gamma 1b at
      25 mcg/m(2) SC three times/week, which is less than the FDA approved dose.

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of lexatumumab or lexatumumab in combination with interferon
      gamma 1b in patients with pediatric malignant tumors refractory to standard therapy.

      Eligibility:

      Patients must be 1-30 years of age with solid malignant tumors refractory to standard
      therapy.

      Design:

      A Phase I dose escalation study with 4 planned dose levels of lexatumumab starting at 30% of
      the adult MTD and escalating up to 100% of the adult MTD, followed by a second dose
      escalation using five lexatumumab dose levels in patients concomitantly receiving interferon
      gamma 1b.

      Three (expanded to six if DLT occurs) patients will be enrolled at each dose level of
      lexatumumab until the adult MTD is reached and 6 patients will be enrolled at the adult MTD
      dose. The MTD cohort of lexatumumab alone and combined regimen will be expanded to include 12
      patients, which should include a minimum of 6 patients less than or equal to 12 years of age.
      Once 6 patients greater than 12 years of age have completed lexatumumab alone, new patients
      greater than 12 years of age will be enrolled in the combined regimen. Similarly, once 6
      patients complete lexatumumab alone who are less than or equal to 12 years of age, new
      patients less than or equal to 12 years of age will be enrolled in the combined regimen. A
      final dose escalation of interferon gamma 1b will be performed with the maximum dose level of
      lexatumumab, to a dose level wherein archival tissue demonstrated upregulation of caspase 8.

        INFORMED CONSENT: All patients or their legal guardians (if the patients is less than18
        years old) must sign a document of informed consent (Pediatric Oncology Branch, NCI
        screening protocol for NIH patients) prior to performing studies to determine patient
        eligibility. After confirmation of eligibility, all patients or their legal guardians must
        voluntarily sign the IRB approved protocol specific informed

        this study and their willingness to receive the therapy and to undergo the research studies
        involved including pharmacokinetic studies. The consent must be signed before any protocol
        related studies are performed (This does not include routine laboratory tests or imaging

        included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal assent. Assent will be obtained
        according to local IRB requirements.

        DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY (DPA): Patients who are greater than or equal to 18 years of age
        will be offered the opportunity to assign a DPA so that another person can make decisions

        BIRTH CONTROL: Patients of childbearing or child-fathering potential must be willing to use
        a medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while they are
        being treated on this study and for 60 days following the last dose.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infections or organ
        dysfunction, which in the judgment of the Principal or Associate Investigators would
        compromise the patient s ability to tolerate the agents in this trial or are likely to
        interfere with the study procedures or results.

        Patients with a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Patients who have
        received autologous stem cell transplantation are eligible greater than 3 months after
        completion of therapy if they meet other eligibility requirements.

        Patients with hepatic tumors or metastases are excluded due to the potential for
        hepatotoxicity with agents that target the TRAIL-R pathway. Patients with primary CNS
        tumors will be excluded due to unknown penetration into the CNS.

        Untreated CNS metastases will render the patient ineligible however patients with a
        previous history of CNS metastases are eligible if: the metastases have been treated with
        surgery and/or radiotherapy, are clinically stable as evidenced by no requirements for
        corticosteroids, the patient has no evolving neurologic deficits and no change in residual
        brain abnormalities without specific therapy over 6 weeks.

        Pregnant or breastfeeding females are excluded because the risks of lexatumumab to the
        developing fetus or nursing child are unknown.

        Patients currently receiving other investigational agents.

        History of any infection requiring hospitalization or parenteral antibiotics within 2 weeks
        of study entry.

        Co-existing medical illness that would place the subject at undue risk.

        On immunosupressant therapy (with the exception of prednisone up to 10 mg/day, or
        dexamethasone up to 4 mg/day), or with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
        or hepatitis B or C. Subjects with immune deficiency are excluded due to their increased
        risk of life threatening toxicity when treated with anticancer agents.
