      The purpose of this study is to perform cardiac evaluation in HIV-1 (predominantly clade
      C)infected children by history, physical examination, echocardiogram and plasma N-terminal
      pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (N-BNP)measurement in order to determine asymptomatic
      abnormalities.

    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection affects nearly 40 million adults and children
      worldwide. Recently introduced new antiviral drugs have significantly improved survival of
      patients with HIV infection. As mortality declines, morbidity becomes a concern. Heart
      disease is present in 20% of children and adults with HIV. The cardiac diseases include left
      ventricular dysfunction, hypertrophy and dilation, pericardial effusion and intracardiac
      masses. Cardiac disease is an independent risk factor for death in these children. The
      reported two-year survival of children with congestive heart failure is zero compared to 17%
      when no heart failure is present. It is thus indicated to perform periodic cardiac
      examinations in these patients, and early recognition of cardiac disease is paramount.

      In addition to the traditional tools to assess cardiac status which include history, physical
      examination, ECG, chest X-ray and echocardiography, we propose to check biochemical markers.
      Brain natriuretic peptide has been shown to be a very sensitive marker for symptomatic and
      asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction, prognosis, severity of the disease and response to therapy
      in adults. Troponin-T is a very good marker for cardiac ischemia. Recently, we have found
      troponin-T to be a good marker for acute cardiac insult in infants and children.

      The aim of this study is to perform screening of children with HIV predominantly clade C for
      cardiac disease using the above mentioned means.
