  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the growth of the lung and how easily gas can be
      taken up by the lung in healthy infants born at full term without any breathing problems and
      infants born prematurely.

      SPECIFIC AIM #1:

      Determine the relationship between parenchymal tissue and alveolar volume with normal lung
      growth early in life.

      We hypothesize that during the first two years of life that parenchymal surface area and
      alveolar volume increase with somatic growth; however, the ratio of surface area to volume
      remains constant, while ventilation within the lung becomes more homogenous.

      SPECIFIC AIM #2:

      Determine the pulmonary sequelae of premature birth and assess the effectiveness of early
      treatment strategies upon the pulmonary sequelae.

      We hypothesize that premature birth impedes growth and development of the lung parenchyma and
      the airways. In addition, initiating continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and a
      permissive ventilatory strategy in very premature infants at birth will improve lung growth
      and lung function compared to treatment with early surfactant and conventional ventilation.

    <description>Group 1: The investigators will recruit 80 healthy infants born at &gt; 37 weeks gestation, and between 2 and 36 months of age. Infants will be excluded for any of the following reasons:
Congenital cardio-respiratory disease
Hospitalization for respiratory illness
Treatment with asthma medications
Small for gestational age at birth</description>

    <description>Group 2: The investigators recruited 4 infants born at &gt; 37 weeks gestation and they were evaluated between 2 and 36 months of age when scheduled for high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging for non-respiratory medical problems. Subjects were enrolled and HRCT of the chest were obtained. Infants were excluded for the following reasons:
Congenital cardio-respiratory disease
Hospitalization for respiratory illness
Treatment with asthma medications</description>

    <arm_group_label>3-Premature Infants</arm_group_label>
    <description>Group 3: The investigators have recruited 45 infants born prematurely at 23-35 weeks gestation. Subjects were evaluated at corrected age at between 2 and 24 months. The subjects had no oxygen requirements, and were clinically stable outpatients when evaluated. Infants were excluded for any of the following reasons:
Congenital cardio-respiratory disease
Severe developmental delay</description>
