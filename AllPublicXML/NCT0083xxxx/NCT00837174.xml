    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of response to the drugs bortezomib
      (Velcade) and vorinostat (Zolinza), when used in combination, in patients with relapsed
      (recurrent) and/or refractory (difficult to treat) non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and to determine the
      safety and tolerability of this regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More selective and less toxic therapeutic strategies are needed to improve cure rates and
      prolong survival in patients with relapsed and/or refractory non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.

      Amongst the multiple new pathways recently studied two have emerged as potentially important
      targets for new agents in lymphoma. These include the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and the
      biochemical reactions that control histone acetylation. The first two agents in each class to
      have been studied in lymphomas are: bortezomib and vorinostat. Bortezomib has been granted
      FDA approval for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and has established activity in a
      variety of B-cell lymphomas including follicular, marginal zone and diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma. Vorinostat or SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) has been FDA approved for the
      treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphomas and has also shown activity in other
      lymphomas.

      Synergistic activity between vorinostat and bortezomib has been observed in different cell
      lines. The proposed study will be a phase II trial of the combination of vorinostat and
      bortezomib at the recommended dose-schedule in patients with recurrent and/or refractory
      lymphomas, indolent and aggressive, and B or T.
