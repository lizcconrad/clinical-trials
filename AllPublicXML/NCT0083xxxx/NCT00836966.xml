      The diagnosis of clinically-significant meniscal tears of the knee remains challenging, and
      it is unknown why only some injuries become painful. The limitations of diagnostic magnetic
      resonance imaging result in arthroscopy that is not always beneficial. Elucidation of
      biochemical pathways underlying pain in this condition may aid patient selection for surgery
      and provide pharmacotherapeutic targets. Cytokines may be involved in pain following meniscus
      injury and diagnostic cytokine assay may help physicians differentiate patients that may
      benefit from arthroscopy from those that may not.

      Lavage of the operative and contralateral knee for comparison was performed under anesthesia
      prior to arthroscopy by the infusion of sterile saline into the knee joint followed by the
      immediate withdrawal into the syringe. Sixteen asymptomatic control subjects also contributed
      knee samples. The concentrations of 17 inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were measured using
      a multiplexed immunoassay panel. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging findings and
      cytokine assay results were compared to &quot;gold-standard&quot; intraoperative findings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with knee pain &lt; 6 months with acute onset who had failed conservative
             treatment and elected for arthroscopic management. Indications for surgery included
             the presence of mechanical symptoms on history, a physical examination positive for
             McMurray's maneuver or joint line tenderness or both32, absence of severe joint space
             narrowing on plain radiography1 33, and the presence of grade III signal changes on
             MRI35 in an anatomic location consistent with the history and physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years old.

          -  Recent (within three months) intra-articular corticosteroid injection and past or
             current medical history of autoimmune disease (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis).

          -  In addition, no patients involved in a worker's compensation claim or personal injury
             litigation were enrolled in the study.
