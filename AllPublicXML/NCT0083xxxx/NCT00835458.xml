      Background: T-shaped tissue anchors have promise to close incisions and perforations of the
      intestines securely. The closure of perforations, gastro-gastric, or intestinal fistulas
      usually requires invasive open or laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia and can be
      complex surgeries due to their reoperative or inflammatory nature.

      Objective: The proposed use of full thickness tissue anchors adds a new surgical aspect to
      the endoscopic treatment of fistulas and perforations by offering a robust suture like
      closure of defects. Instead of a 20 cm abdominal incision or 3 or 4 one centimeter incisions
      with the related postoperative morbidity an endoscopic technique is used which requires no
      postoperative limitation of activities.

      Methods: In this study the investigators propose to use an endoscopic technique that
      eliminates the need for open or laparoscopic surgery and provides a more robust endoscopic
      repair than is possible with traditional endoscopic tools. Patients who are scheduled to
      undergo surgery for intestinal fistulas will be screened for study eligibility. Patients who
      are scheduled to undergo complex polypectomy, or submucosal dissection will be screened for
      study eligibility and informed about all possible therapies in case of an iatrogenic
      perforation (open - laparoscopic surgery, endoscopic clipping, endoscopic closure with tissue
      anchors). A commercially available flexible endoscope will be inserted through the mouth and
      the fistula or perforation will be closed using the Tissue Approximation System (Ethicon Endo
      Surgery, Cincinnati, OH).

      The investigators will initially evaluate the potential benefit, risks and impact on the
      patient's quality of life of this modified surgical technique in 5 patients.

      Expected results: The potential advantages to the patients entered into this study result
      from the avoidance of open or laparoscopic surgery with the related risks (bleeding, injury
      of organs, post operative wound infection, hernia), shorter hospital stay, reduced
      postoperative pain, earlier return to work, and cosmetic advantage.

    <description>The mucosa surrounding the orifice of the fistula will be ablated using standard endoscopic techniques. Remnants of mucosa will be treated with argon-plasma coagulation. The mucosa free orifice of the fistula will be closed using the Tissue Apposition System. Tissue anchors with attached threads will be deployed through the intestinal wall full thickness using delivery needles through the working channel of the endoscope. After two anchors are deployed on both sides of the fistulas' orifice a knotting element will be cinched down to approximate the two sides of the fistulas' orifice. The procedure will be repeated until the fistulas' orifice is securely closed.</description>
