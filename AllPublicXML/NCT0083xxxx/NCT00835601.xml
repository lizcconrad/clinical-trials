      This is a training study in healthy volunteers to characterize gains in lower-body resistive
      strength and cardiovascular capacity with exercise on a Combined Countermeasure Device (CCD)
      we have developed for the National Space Biomedical Research Institute. The CCD is a single
      platform which contains interchangeable modules for cardiovascular stepping exercises and
      lower body resistive exercises including squats, heel raises, abductor and adductor exercises
      and knee extension and flexion. The platform has the capability to tilt, yaw and pitch, and
      to translate in three dimensions in order to challenge the neurovestibular system. The
      underlying goal of the project is to provide a compact and efficient exercise modality that
      will prevent deterioration of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems, and the
      neurovestibular system, in long-duration spaceflights. The goal of the current study is
      simply to test the hypothesis that in healthy volunteers, the exercise prescription proposed
      for the device will improve strength and VO2 max. Subjects are tested for lower body
      resistive strength and V02max at baseline, then are trained for 12 weeks, and tested again at
      followup to test for a change. 36 subjects, allowing for a 20% attrition rate, allows
      sufficient power to detect 95% percent confidence intervals in the changes in the strength
      and V02max measures of roughly 10-20%. If we observe gains in these indices which are similar
      to those reported in the literature for simultaneous cardiovascular and resistive strength
      protocols, then we believe that there is sufficient evidence to test CCD in a bedrest model
      of long-duration spaceflight.
