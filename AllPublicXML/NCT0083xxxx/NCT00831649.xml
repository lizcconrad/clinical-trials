  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      natalizumab in subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving concomitant
      methotrexate (MTX)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The biological effect seen with natalizumab was not sufficient to warrant further development
    in RA.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects will be eligible to begin study participation if they meet all of the following
        inclusion criteria:

          -  Subjects must give written informed consent

          -  Male or female subjects ≥18 to ≤75 years of age (at randomization in Study
             ELN100226-RA201)

          -  Subjects must have been randomized in Study ELN100226-RA201;

          -  Subjects who have completed the Month 6 visit of Study ELN100226-RA201 OR Subjects who
             have an inadequate therapeutic response (defined as a &lt; 20% reduction from baseline
             [Month 0 in Study ELN100226-RA201] for both painful/tender and swollen joint counts)
             after receiving at least 4 infusions of study drug and has not been rescued with other
             RA medications during the treatment phase of Study ELN100226-RA201;

          -  Subjects must be taking MTX at the same dose last used in Study ELN100226-RA201;

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential agreed to use adequate, contraceptive
             methods (either intrauterine device [IUD], oral or depot contraceptive, or barrier
             plus spermicide). Female subjects of childbearing potential used adequate
             contraception for at least 2 months prior to study entry and continued contraception
             for at least 3 months after their last infusion of study drug;

          -  Subjects must be willing and able to complete all planned study procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following exclusion
        criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding or those planning to become pregnant in the
             next 14 months;

          -  Subjects who have experienced anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, clinical syndrome
             diagnostic of serum sickness, or biopsy-proven vasculitis to a previous infusion of
             study drug;

          -  Subjects who received rescue intervention in Study ELN100226-RA201, defined as an
             increase in dose of an existing permitted concomitant treatment of RA or the
             introduction of a new treatment of RA;

          -  Subject who are expected to be unavailable for the duration of the trial, likely to be
             noncompliant with the Protocol, or who are felt to be unsuitable by the Investigator
             for any other reason;

          -  Subjects with a history of a malignancy (other than surgically excised basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin);

          -  Subjects with a history of clinically significant and/or persistent gastrointestinal,
             pulmonary, chronic infection, cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, neurological,
             dermatological, immunological, major psychiatric (including drug or alcohol abusers)
             or hematological illness, which in the opinion of the Investigator places the subject
             at unacceptable risk for participation in the study;

          -  Subjects who intend to donate blood or blood products during the period of the study
             or within one month following completion of the study.
