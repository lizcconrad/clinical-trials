        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Screening Demographics: All volunteers selected for this study will be healthy
             postmenopausal women 45 years of age or older at the time of dosing. The weight range
             will not exceed ±20% for height and body frame as per Desirable Weights for Women -
             1983 Metropolitan Height and Weight Table.

          -  Screening Procedures: Each volunteer will complete the screening process within 28
             days prior to period I dosing. Consent documents for both the screening evaluation and
             HIV antibody determination will be reviewed, discussed and signed by each potential
             participant before full implementation of screening procedures.

        Screening will include general observations, physical examination, demographics, medical
        and medication history, an electrocardiogram, sitting blood pressure and pulse, respiratory
        rate and temperature. The physical examination will include, but may not be limited to, an
        evaluation of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous
        systems.

        Screening will include a Gynecological examination (PAP smear, breast) which does not show
        clinically relevant findings, e.g. a cytological smear classified according to Papanicolau
        (PAP) higher than grade II.

        The screening clinical laboratory procedures will include:

          -  HEMATOLOGY: hematocrit, hemoglobin, WBC count with differential, RBC count, platelet
             count

          -  CLINICAL CHEMISTRY: serum creatinine, BUN, glucose, AST(GOT), ALT(GPT), albumin, total
             bilirubin, total protein, and alkaline phosphatase

          -  HIV antibody, hepatitis GB surface antigen, and anti hepatitis C virus screens

          -  URINALYSIS: by dipstick; full microscopic examination if dipstick positive

          -  URINE DRUG SCREEN: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine
             metabolites, and opiates

          -  Ethyl alcohol will be measured using breath test (alcomat)

          -  FSH (to verify postmenopausal status)

          -  17β-Estradiol (to verify postmenopausal status)

          -  SERUM PREGNANCY SCREEN

        Is female and:

        o Is postmenopausal for at least 1 year and has a serum FSH level greater than or equal to
        30 mIU/mL and a serum 17β-estradiol level less than 30 pg/mL.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Volunteers with a recent history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse.

          -  Volunteers with the presence of a clinically significant disorder involving the
             cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, immunologic, hematologic,
             endocrine, gynecologic or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease (as determined
             by the clinical investigators or co-investigators).

          -  Volunteers whose clinical laboratory test values show clinically relevant deviations
             from normal when confirmed on re-examination.

          -  Volunteers demonstrating a positive hepatitis B surface antigen screen, a positive
             anti HCV screen or a reactive HIV antibody screen.

          -  Volunteers demonstrating a positive drug abuse screen when screened for this study.

          -  Volunteers demonstrating a positive pregnancy screen.

          -  Volunteers with a history of allergic response(s) to medroxyprogesterone acetate or
             related drugs.

          -  Volunteers with a history of clinically significant allergies including drug
             allergies.

          -  Volunteers with a history of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

          -  Volunteers with personal or immediate family (mother, sister, daughter) history of
             breast cancer.

          -  Volunteers with a history of thromboembolic disorder, thrombophlebitis, or history of
             anticoagulant use other than aspirin.

          -  Volunteers with a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to Period I
             dosing (as determined by the clinical investigators or co-investigators).

          -  Volunteers who currently use tobacco products.

          -  Volunteers who have taken any drug known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism
             in the 30 days prior to Period I dosing.

          -  Volunteers who report donating greater than 450 mL of blood within 30 days prior to
             dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after
             completing the study.

          -  Volunteers who have donated plasma (e.g. plasmapheresis) within 14 days prior to
             dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate plasma for four weeks after
             completing the study.

          -  Volunteers who report receiving any investigational drug within 30 days prior to
             dosing.

          -  Volunteers who report taking any systemic prescription medication in the 14 days prior
             to dosing (for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) 4 weeks prior to dosing).
