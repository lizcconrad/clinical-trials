    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare clopidogrel effectiveness between severe
      hemodynamically unstable versus stable patients with acute myocardial infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel exists in oral form only. As a prodrug, it has to be metabolized to the active
      form by cytochrome system in the liver. Both facts could lead to lower efficacy of the drug
      in hemodynamically unstable patients, where splanchnic and liver hypoperfusion is present. We
      hypothesised that clopidogrel efficacy is insufficient in patients with acute myocardial
      infarction and severe hemodynamic instability. Therefore we would like to compare the effect
      of clopidogrel in unstable STEMI patients on mechanical ventilation with stable STEMI
      patients.
