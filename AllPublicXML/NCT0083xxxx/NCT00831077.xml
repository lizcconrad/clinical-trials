          -  Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examinations.

          -  Males between 18 and 45 years (inclusive).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2 (inclusive, BMI = weight/height2).

          -  Weight 55-100 kg (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A predictable poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the investigator
             or study centre personnel.

          -  Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological, urogenital or
             psychiatric diseases as judged by the investigator.

          -  Any condition requiring regular concomitant medication including herbal products or
             likely to need any concomitant treatment during the study.

          -  Susceptibility to severe allergic reactions.

          -  Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study, within 2 weeks
             prior to the first study treatment or less than 5 times a half-life of the medication.
             Possible enzyme inducing drugs will be discussed case-by-case with the sponsor.

          -  Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week (1 unit = 4 cl spirits,
             about 13 g of alcohol).

          -  Current use of nicotine-containing products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day.

          -  Inability to refrain from using nicotine-containing products during the stay at the
             study centre.

          -  Inability to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing beverages during the stay in
             the study centre, e.g. propensity in getting headache when refraining from
             caffeine-containing beverages.

          -  Blood donation or loss of significant amount of blood within 2 months prior to the
             screening visit.

          -  Abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) finding of clinical relevance in supine
             position after resting for 10 minutes at the screening visit, for example:- QTc
             (calculated through the Bazett's formula) &gt; 450msec,- PR &lt; 120 msec or &gt; 210 msec,-
             QRS &lt; 70 msec or &gt; 120 msec.

          -  Heart rate (HR) &lt; 45 beats/minute or &gt; 100 beats/minute in supine position after
             resting for 10 minutes at the screening visit.

          -  At the screening visit, systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg in supine
             position after resting for 10 minutes, diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg in supine
             position after resting for 10 minutes.

          -  Any abnormal value of laboratory, vital signs, or physical examination, which may in
             the opinion of the investigator interfere with the interpretation of the test results
             or cause a health risk for the subject if he takes part into the study.

          -  History of drug abuse or positive result in drug abuse test.

          -  Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus antigen/antibodies (HIVAgAb),
             hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCVAb) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             evaluation of the results or constitute a health risk for the subject.

          -  Participation in a clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the screening visit in
             this study, or earlier participation in a clinical study with ORM-12741.

          -  Exposure to 14C-labelled drugs or diagnostics within 12 months prior to the screening
             visit.

          -  Men who are not practising clinically accepted method of contraception during the
             study and next 3 months after the study treatment administration.
