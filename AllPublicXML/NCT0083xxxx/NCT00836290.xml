      Project PLUS tests an HIV risk reduction/adherence behavioral intervention with HIV-infected
      individuals in Connecticut prisons. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three
      groups: prior to release from incarceration (Group 1), after release from incarceration
      (Group 2), and treatment-as-usual (Group 3). We hypothesize that the intervention groups
      (Groups 1 &amp; 2) will demonstrate significantly greater knowledge regarding drug- and sex-
      related HIV risk behavior and HIV medication adherence, greater motivation to reduce HIV risk
      behavior and improve HIV medication adherence, and enhanced skills for engaging in HIV risk
      reduction behavior and HIV medication adherence vs. the treatment-as-usual group. We will
      also compare these outcomes between Groups 1 and 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Project PLUS is an HIV risk reduction/Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) adherence
      behavioral intervention for persons being released from prisons in Connecticut. The
      intervention is delivered one-on-one to HIV-infected individuals prior to release from
      incarceration (Group 1) vs. after release from incarceration (Group 2) vs. treatment as usual
      (Group 3). The primary hypothesis is that the intervention groups (Groups 1 &amp; 2) will
      demonstrate significantly greater reduction in rates of HIV sexual and drug risk behaviors
      and a significantly greater increase in HAART adherence compared to Group 3 participants at 4
      months following release from prison. (However, those in Group 3 may come back to participate
      in the educational sessions, as non-study participants, after their participation has been
      completed). Based on the IMB model of health behavior change, the primary outcomes of
      interest are HIV risk reduction knowledge, motivation, behavioral skills (Fisher &amp; Fisher,
      1992) and specific event-level partner-by-partner drug and sex risk outcomes including the
      frequency of unprotected sex episodes across different partners categorized by perceived
      HIV-status of each partner, numbers of different sexual partners, changes in the frequency of
      condom use, changes in reported adherence to HIV medication, and changes in reported drug use
      episodes across different partners categorized by perceived HIV-status of each partner.
      Additional outcomes of interest include greater knowledge regarding drug- and sex- related
      HIV risk behaviors and HAART adherence, greater motivation to reduce HIV risk behaviors and
      improve HAART adherence, enhanced skills for engaging in HIV risk reduction behaviors and
      HAART adherence. A comparison between Groups 1 &amp; 2 has never been examined, so an important
      part of this study is to explore this comparison.
