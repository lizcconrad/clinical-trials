  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants from an ongoing observational study (P05319) who have a limited (adequate but
      less than optimal) response to infliximab will be randomized to either increase the frequency
      of infliximab infusions from every 8 weeks to every 6 weeks, or to add weekly methotrexate to
      their current treatment plan. While receiving infliximab study treatment(s), patients in this
      study will attend regularly scheduled office visits for various clinical tests for safety and
      effectiveness evaluations.

  <why_stopped>
    In Amendment 1 of P05319 [NCT 00779675], the option to enroll into this study, was discontinued
    due to low numbers of participants with suboptimal response.

    <measure>Number of Participants With A Psoriasis Area and Sensitivity Index (PASI)-75 Response at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Psoriasis Area and Sensitivity Index (PASI) is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of psoriasis lesions. Each lesion is graded on a 0-4 scale, weighted by the area of involvement, with increasing scores indicating increasing severity. The PASI-75 response indicates the number of participants achieving a 75% reduction in PASI score compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Euro-Qol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Change From Baseline at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system comprised of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Participants are asked to indicate his/her health state by selecting the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This selection results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state. The numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score.</description>

        <description>The PASI score is a measure of the average redness, thickness, and scaliness of psoriasis lesions. Each lesion is graded on a 0–4 scale, weighted by the area of involvement, with increasing scores indicating increasing severity.The PASI-50 response indicates the number of participants achieving a 50% reduction compared to baseline in PASI score.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D is a descriptive system comprised of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Participants are asked to indicate his/her health state by selecting the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This selection results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the participant's health state. The numerals 1-5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score.</description>
