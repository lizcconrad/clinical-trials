  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 0 trial is studying whether 2 weeks of cetuximab and dasatinib will change tumor
      cells in patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases that can be removed by surgery.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the biological effects of cetuximab, dasatinib, or the combination on
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)- and Src-signaling pathways in resected colorectal
      cancer liver metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are initially enrolled in cohort A. Once
      cohort A is completed, additional patients are enrolled and randomized to treatment in either
      cohorts B or C. If a significant biological effect is seen in cohorts B or C, additional
      patients are enrolled in cohort D.

      COHORT A: Patients receive no systemic neoadjuvant therapy between enrollment and the time of
      definitive surgical resection of liver metastases. Liver biopsies were performed at surgery
      since this cohort received no systemic therapy.

      COHORT B: Patients receive 400 mg/m2 cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes on day 1
      and 250 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on day 8. Definitive surgical resection of
      liver metastases will take place on day 15.

      COHORT C: Patients receive dasatinib 100 mg orally once daily on days 1-14. Definitive
      surgical resection of liver metastases will take place on day 15.

      COHORT D: Patients receive 400 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV over 120 minutes on day 1 and 250 mg/m^2
      cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes on day 8 AND dasatinib 100 mg orally once daily on days
      1-14. Definitive surgical resection of liver metastases will take place on day 15.

      Patients undergo tumor tissue (from initial liver tumor biopsies and liver resection
      samples), serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collection periodically for
      biomarker analysis via immunohistochemistry (IHC).

          -  The liver metastases must be considered surgically resectable prior to the initiation
             of study drugs

          -  Prior chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for colorectal cancer is allowed provided that
             toxicities from prior therapy have resolved to Grade 1 or less; no prior anti-EGFR or
             anti-Src therapy is allowed

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 Gm/dL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine transaminase (ALT)(serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) =&lt; 5 x
             institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 institutional ULN

          -  Women must have a negative pregnancy test; women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Although KRAS status will be evaluated in the tumor, wild type KRAS status is not an
             eligibility criterion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cetuximab or dasatinib

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the potential for teratogenic
             or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cetuximab or
             dasatinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             cetuximab or dasatinib

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with cetuximab or dasatinib; appropriate studies will be
             undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients on potent CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors
