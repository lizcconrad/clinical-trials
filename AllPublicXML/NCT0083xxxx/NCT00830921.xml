  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment we are studying is Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). In TMS, an
      electromagnetic pulse is passed into the brain through a coil placed on the head. Previous
      studies have shown TMS to be capable of altering brain activity in specific areas; for
      example it has been used to improve mood in clinical depression. In this study we will assess
      if, by targeting TMS to the brain area responsible for feeling breathless, participants'
      breathlessness will be improved

      This protocol describes an exploratory crossover pilot study to assess whether targeted
      repetitive pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) i.e. targeted at the anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC), affords relief of 'air hunger' in patients with breathlessness
      refractory to maximal medical therapy, compared to 'control' TMS directed at a remote site
      independent of the area of interest (within the lateral right parietal region of the brain).

      12 right-handed patients suffering from refractory dyspnoea will receive pulses of targeted
      TMS or control TMS (crossover design), in a random order. The order will be random and use a
      minimisation procedure for baseline dyspnoea severity and sex. Repetitive targeted TMS (or
      control) pulses at 110% motor threshold at a frequency of 1Hz will be given for a 15 minute
      period1.

      On a second, later, day the same subjects will perform the same protocol after receiving
      inhaled menthol or control (normal, non odorous air), in random order.

      Outcomes will be assessed during the 10 minutes after targeted TMS/control TMS during which
      post stimulation inhibition of neural activity is expected.

    <description>Patients will be identified from the Oxford Pleural Clinic and from referrals within the multi-disciplinary team including palliative care and oncology services.
Screening criteria are based on normal practice and consecutive eligible patients will be offered trial entry. The principal investigator or a nominated member of staff will approach participants who fulfil the criteria for inclusion in the study. Screening logs will be kept.</description>
