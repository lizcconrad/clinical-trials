      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab,
      can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and
      spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to
      them. It is not yet known whether lenalidomide is more effective with or without rituximab in
      treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lenalidomide works when given with or
      without rituximab in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic
      lymphoma who have undergone autologous or syngeneic stem cell transplant.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of consolidation therapy comprising lenalidomide with or
           without rituximab followed by maintenance therapy comprising lenalidomide in patients
           with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma who have undergone
           autologous or syngeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Consolidation phase: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

             -  Group I: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-14. Treatment
                repeats every 21 days for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
                unacceptable toxicity.

             -  Group II: Patients receive lenalidomide as in group I. Patients also receive
                rituximab IV once on the day before the start of lenalidomide and then once between
                days 25-30, 50-55, and 75-80 for a total of 4 doses in the absence of disease
                progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Maintenance phase: Beginning 2 months after completion of consolidation therapy, all
           patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28
           days for 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then annually
      thereafter.
