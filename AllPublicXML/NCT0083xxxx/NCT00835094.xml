      This will be an open-label, randomized, parallel-group comparison of mometasone furoate dry

          -  If the subject is taking inhaled corticosteroids, the daily dose must be &lt;= the upper
             limit defined below:

               -  budesonide &lt;=800 mcg/day

               -  triamcinolone acetonide &lt;=800 mcg/day

               -  beclomethasone dipropionate &lt;=1000 mcg/day

               -  flunisolide &lt;=1000 mcg/day

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine (hCG) pregnancy test on the
             day of randomization (Baseline visit).

          -  Women of childbearing potential (includes women who are &lt;1 year postmenopausal) must
             be using an acceptable method of birth control (eg, hormonal contraceptive, medically
             prescribed IUD, condom in combination with spermicide) or be surgically sterilized
             (eg, hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

          -  Subjects must agree to inform their usual treating physician (if other than the study
             investigator) of their participation in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or are premenarcheal.

          -  Subjects who have required daily or alternate day oral corticosteroid treatment for
             more than a total of 14 days during the 6 months immediately prior to Visit 1, and/or
             subjects who have required a course of systemic corticosteroids within the previous
             month.

          -  Subjects who have had either an asthma exacerbation or a clinically relevant change in
             asthma medication within the last 4 weeks.

             3 months or more than once within the previous 6 months.

             their asthma within the last 5 years.

          -  Subjects who have used any investigational drug in the 30 days prior to Baseline, or
             subjects who have been treated with any investigational antibody for asthma in the 90
             days prior to Baseline.

          -  Subjects who are allergic or have had an idiosyncratic reaction to corticosteroids.

          -  Subjects with any clinically significant disorder of the cardiovascular, neurologic,
             hematologic, gastrointestinal, cerebrovascular, or immunologic system, or respiratory
             disease other than asthma (eg, COPD), or any other disorder which may interfere with
             the study evaluations or affect subject safety.

          -  Subjects with a history of drug abuse, poor motivation, hypochondriasis, or any other
             emotional or intellectual problems that are likely to limit the validity of consent to
             participate in the study.
