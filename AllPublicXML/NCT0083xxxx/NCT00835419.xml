      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of P276-00 in subjects with advanced
      malignant melanoma positive for cyclin D1 expression

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, melanoma is the fifth most common cancer diagnosed in men and the seventh most
      common cancer diagnosed in women.Advanced melanoma has a very poor prognosis.For a vast
      majority of subjects with malignant melanoma, there are no effective therapies.Therefore, the
      development of effective therapies for this subject population remains a priority in
      oncology.In a limited study in melanomas, increased cyclin D1 protein expression, as was
      observed in 33% cases.P276-00 is a novel potent small molecule flavone derived Cyclin
      dependent kinase (Cdk) Cdk 4-D1, Cdk1-B and Cdk9-T inhibitor.P276-00 demonstrated significant
      and selective antiproliferative effect against melanoma cell lines.

             and or IL-2

          4. Subjects with measurable disease [at least one unidimensionally measurable lesion ³ 20
             mm with conventional techniques (CT, MRI, X-ray) or ³ 10 mm by spiral CT scan]

          5. Subject of either sex and 18 years of age or elder
