    <textblock>
      Background: Nasal polyps are found in about 5% of asthmatic patients.A close link exists
      between the upper and lower airways and the concept of the &quot;United Airways&quot; has emerged
      mainly from studies on allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, other upper airway diseases,
      such as chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis may influence lower airway diseases. As for
      nasal polyposis, eosinophils are the major effector cells in asthma and have been associated
      with a worsening of this condition.

      Aim: To compare normal nasal mucosa and nasal polyp biopsies from subjects with nasal
      polyposis with or without asthma.

      Hypothesis: Nasal polyps from asthmatic subjects show a more aggressive pro-inflammatory
      pattern of cytokine expression compared to nasal polyps from non asthmatic subjects, and
      therefore contribute to the development and severity of asthma.

      The study will include 2 visits separated by a maximum of 7 days. During the first visit,
      subjects' characteristics will be documented by a locally validated questionnaire. Allergy
      skin prick tests, spirometry, methacholine inhalation test and induced sputum will also be
      done. Asthma and rhinitis control will be evaluated by locally validated questionnaires, the
      Asthma Control Scoring System (ACSS) and the Rhinitis Control Scoring System (RCSS),
      respectively. Nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF) and oral peak expiratory flow (PEF) will
      also be recorded to obtain the nasal blockage index (NBI). On the second visit, nasal
      biopsies will be taken.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For all subjects:

          -  Non smoking men or women aged 18 to 65 years old.

          -  Subjects will have nasal polyps as defined above.

        For asthmatic subjects:

          -  Subjects will have a history consistent with asthma according to the criteria of the
             ATS[18] defined on the basis of episodic or persistent chest tightness, wheeze or
             cough in the past 6 months. At entry into the study, FEV1 will be over 70% predicted.

          -  Asthma will have been stable for at least 3 months before entering the trial.

          -  Asthma medication will have been stable for at least 1 month prior to the study.

        For non asthmatic subjects:

          -  A methacholine challenge test with a PC20 (provoking concentration of methacholine to
             cause a 20% fall in FEV1) over 16 mg/mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For all subjects:

          -  Smoking (current smoking) or ex-smoking (les than 6 months or history of more than 10
             pack-year of smoking).

          -  Use of anti-leukotriene medication within the last 3 months.

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids within the last 3 months.

          -  Use of anti-coagulant therapy.

          -  Recent (less than 1 month) upper or lower respiratory tract infection, any other
             condition that may interfere with the evaluations.

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding or planned pregnancy during the study. Fertile woman not
             using acceptable contraceptive measures, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Subjects unable to perform or with contraindications to the tests proposed.

          -  Subjects who are, in the opinion of the investigator, mentally or legally
             incapacitated thus preventing informed consent from being obtained.

        For asthmatic subjects:

          -  Unstable asthma shown by respiratory symptoms and B2-agonists need more than 3
             times/week and nocturnal asthma symptoms.
