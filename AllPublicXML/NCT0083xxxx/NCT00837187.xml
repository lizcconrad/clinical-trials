    <textblock>
      In a recent study by Yuen et al it was shown that preoperative intranasal administration of
      dexmedetomidine is a useful alternative for oral midazolam in children. However, there is no
      information on the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine after intranasal administration.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the comparative pharmacokinetics of intranasally and
      intravenously administered dexmedetomidine in healthy volunteers. The absolute
      bioavailability of intranasally administered dexmedetomidine will be calculated. In addition,
      we will report the effects of intranasally and intravenously administered dexmedetomidine on
      plasma catecholamine levels, systemic blood pressure, heart rate and sedation. We will also
      monitor the local and systemic safety and tolerability of intranasally administered
      dexmedetomidine.
