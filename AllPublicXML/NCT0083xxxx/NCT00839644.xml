    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of three airway secretion clearance
      techniques (chest physical therapy, flutter device and high frequency chest wall oscillation)
      on decline in pulmonary function over a three year period in patients with cystic fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Design: Randomized clinical trial with pulmonary function testing obtained every three
      months in each of the three treatment groups. Change in slope of FEV1 will be compared. Days
      of hospitalization and use of oral or IV antibiotics for respiratory tract infection, quality
      of life, subject satisfaction, and compliance will also be compared.

      Sample Size: Enrollment will be completed after 180 subjects have been recruited. Fifteen CF
      centers will participate.

      Subject Selection: Subjects must have the diagnosis of CF, be &gt; 7 years of age and have an
      FEV1 &gt; 45% of predicted.

      Prescribed Therapy: Each subject will receive airway secretion clearance twice a day.

      Outcomes: Change in slope of FEV1; days of hospitalization and use of oral or IV antibiotics
      for respiratory tract infection; quality of life; subject satisfaction; compliance.

    <intervention_name>High frequency chest wall oscillation</intervention_name>
    <description>Therapy prescribed twce daily for twenty minute sessions. High frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) applies sharp compression pulses via an air-pulse generator and inflatable vest. HFCWO generates transient increases in airflow at low lung volumes, cough-like shear forces, and alterations in the consistency of secretions.</description>
