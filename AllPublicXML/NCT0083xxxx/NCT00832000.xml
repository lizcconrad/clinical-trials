  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nondystrophic myotonias (NDM) are neuromuscular disorders caused by genetic abnormalities in
      certain muscle cell membrane proteins. The proteins affect muscle contraction. Individuals
      with NDM experience limited muscle relaxation, which then can cause pain, weakness,
      incoordination, and impaired physical activity and function. Because NDM is very rare,
      information on the best way to treat people with the disorders is lacking, and there are no
      FDA-approved therapies. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the
      medication mexiletine in treating people with NDM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NDM are neuromuscular disorders that are caused by mutations in skeletal muscle ion channels,
      usually voltage-dependent sodium and chloride channels. The poorly functioning channels
      result in impaired muscle relaxation after contraction, which is also called myotonia.
      Mexiletine is an antiarrhythmic medication that has a high affinity for muscle sodium
      channels and may have the ability to correct delayed inactivation of sodium channels. In case
      reports and single-blind clinical trials, mexiletine was shown to reduce symptoms of
      myotonia. Currently, there is no standard strategy for treating people with NDM, and
      effective treatment options are needed. This study will determine the effectiveness of
      mexiletine in treating people with NDM.

      Participation in this study will last 9 weeks and will involve two separate 4-week treatment
      periods, with a 1-week washout period between them. During the first treatment period,
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either mexiletine or placebo, both of which
      will be taken three times a day. This will be followed by 1 week of no treatment. During the
      second treatment period, participants will receive whichever treatment they did not receive
      initially and will follow the same dosing schedule.

      Participants will attend five study visits that will occur at screening and Weeks 0, 4, 5,
      and 9. Screening will include blood and urine sampling, electrocardiography (EKG), and a
      medical history. The remaining visits will include a physical examination, a grip test,
      exercise tests, nerve conduction tests, blood sampling, questionnaires, and electromyography
      (EMG). EKG will be repeated at Weeks 4, 5, and 9. Throughout the study, participants will
      phone in daily to report their symptoms. There will be no follow-up visits.

The INQoL summary score is a weighted average made up of 5 subdomains (activities, social relationships, independence, emotions, and body image) which document the impact of a disease on a patients' quality of life. Scores range from 0-100, and can be interpreted as the percent of maximal detrimental impact on quality of life. A higher score indicates more detrimental impact.</description>
          <population>All participants with INQoL summary score values in either period 1 or period 2 were included in analysis. The treatment-specific group mean is taken from the mixed model. Confidence intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.</population>
