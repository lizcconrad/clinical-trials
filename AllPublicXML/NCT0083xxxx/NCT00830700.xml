  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While telemental health (TMH) programs are increasing nationally to address the inequity of
      access to psychiatric services, there are few reports of their efficacy, particularly with
      children. The current proposal will complete the second stage of our program development. In
      the first stage, we established the feasibility of a TMH service and its acceptability to
      families and PCPs. In the second stage of program development we will conduct a randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) that will determine whether it is possible to use technological advances
      to: 1) improve clinical outcomes for children with ADHD over outcomes achieved in usual PC;
      and 2) adhere to an EBT protocol implemented through TMH. Future studies will examine whether
      other types of complicated psychiatric disorders and EBTs are amenable to delivery via TMH.

      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether an evidence-based model of care can be
      faithfully implemented when delivered using TMH to children with ADHD living in rural areas
      and can improve outcomes over treatment as usual (TAU) in PC. ADHD is an excellent focus for
      assessment of TMH, as PCPs encounter this disorder frequently, EBT guidelines are available,
      pharmacotherapy is the core treatment and is easily delivered in PC through
      videoconferencing, and stabilization may be readily achieved for most youth.

    <description>This intervention is comprised of 6-tandem-sessions of pharmacotherapy and a behavioral intervention conducted over 4-5 months. The telepsychiatrist makes prescribing decisions during the intervention following consensus guidelines for ADHD treatment. The telepsychiatrist also provides education about how neurobiological deficits of ADHD relate to observed behavioral learning and difficulties. After the 6th session, the PCP resumes care of the patient. The behavioral intervention component is delivered by therapists at each participating clinic. The therapists are trained and supervised remotely by a telepsychologist . The 6-session behavioral intervention consists of approaches to managing children's behaviors and coordination with schools and other community agencies to advocate for the child.</description>
