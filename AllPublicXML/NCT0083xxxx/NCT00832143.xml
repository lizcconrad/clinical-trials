  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal mortality rate in Uttar Pradesh, Northern India is 53.6 per thousand, and accounts
      for 8% of global neonatal deaths.It has been argued that prompt and appropriate care-seeking
      for sick neonates can substantially reduce neonatal mortality. This pre and post intervention
      trial was done to assess the impact of a pictorial &quot;Neonatal referral Card&quot; and one-to-one
      counseling of mothers on the qualified medical care-seeking behavior for sick neonates in
      urban Lucknow.

      The study hypothesis was that the counseling on danger signs along with neonatal referral
      card has no impact on availing services of a qualified medical practitioner by caregivers of
      sick neonates.

      The study was conducted in two government maternity hospitals in Lucknow. Neonates enrolled
      in the pre intervention phase were followed up for 6 weeks+15 days but did not recieve the
      study intervention. While, the mothers of the neonates enrolled in the post intervention
      phase recieved the study intervention within 48 hours of institutional delivery.Enrollment
      and follow-up procedures were same in both the phases.
