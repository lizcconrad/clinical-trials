  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this quasi-experiment study, which could also be classified as a prospective
      observational intervention study, is to assess the impact of cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP 2C9)
      and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) testing within a primary patient
      care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is the most common mode of treatment and prophylaxis
      for venous and arterial thromboembolic conditions. Warfarin is metabolized in the liver by
      the cytochrome P450 system, the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP 2C9) isoenzyme specifically, and
      polymorphisms in the CYP 2C9 gene have been associated with changes in metabolic function of
      the translated isoenzyme . These polymorphisms result in reduced metabolism of warfarin as
      compared to subjects having the wild type gene, consequently leading to systemic accumulation
      of warfarin; it is theorized that this leads to higher risk of adverse events. Other allelic
      variations have also been linked to changes in vitamin K conservation through their effects
      on vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1) . The combined impact of CYP 2C9
      and VKORC1 polymorphisms on warfarin's pharmacology have recently been reported.

      It is hypothesized that evaluation of genomic allelic type guided warfarin dosing will reduce
      thromboembolic and bleeding risks associated with warfarin therapy, and that adoption of a
      genetic testing strategy in a primary patient care setting would improve warfarin
      effectiveness and patient safety, and reduce costs to health care payers.

    <description>Historical control group. Patients in this group are drawn from the same plan populations as the intervention group, but they are identified during the 1-year period prior to the start of patient enrollment in the intervention group. The historical control group is closely matched with the intervention group on demographic characteristics, practice patterns, and benefit plan features that may affect resource utilization.</description>

    <description>Concurrent control group. Patients in this group are drawn from different set of plan populations, but they initiate warfarin treatment during the same time period as patients in the intervention group. Outcomes data for the concurrent control group will be used to evaluate whether any differences between the intervention group and the historical control group can be attributed to changes in clinical practice over time. Baseline data for the concurrent control group will help validate the incidence assumptions used in the calculation of statistical power. This use of baseline population norms is an effective means of limiting bias in quasi-experimental studies.</description>

    <description>Active study group. For plans participating in the active arm of the study, enrollment is offered to every patient who initiates warfarin therapy during the enrollment period (beginning in July 2007) and who meets the eligibility criteria. Patients are identified for the active study group if they have a warfarin pharmacy claim and no prior warfarin claims during the preceding 180 days. Only patients who remain eligible for the pharmacy benefit throughout the study period are included in the final sample.</description>
