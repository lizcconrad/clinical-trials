        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of solid tumor with at least one measurable
             lesion of ≥ 10mm.

          -  Tumor must be advanced or recurrent which is refractory to standard therapies or for
             which no alternative, appropriate therapy exists.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0-1

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months

          -  Other inclusion criteria as specified in the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other antibodies.

          -  Residual adverse reactions or effect of prior therapy, which deemed to affect the
             safety evaluation of the study drug by the investigator or subinvestigator.

          -  Two or more synchronous tumors, except for adequately treated basal cell cancer or
             cancer in situ, or superficial bladder cancer, or any other cancers from which the
             patient has been disease-free for at least 5 years.

          -  Patients with any active autoimmune disease or a documented history of chronic or
             recurrent autoimmune disease, or current medical condition that requires systemic
             immunosuppressive doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.
