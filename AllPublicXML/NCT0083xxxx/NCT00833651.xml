  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza (Flu) vaccine is recommended for kidney transplant patients who are at least 6
      months post-transplant. The influenza vaccine stimulates the immune system to builds
      protective antibodies against the flu virus.

      Previous research has shown that adult kidney transplant patients are not able to form as
      much of these protective antibodies as compared to healthy volunteers. Research has also
      suggested that different immunosuppressive medicines may have different effects on antibody
      formation. In this study, we hope to evaluate these differences in more detail.

      In recent years, increasingly effective, but also increasingly complex, immunosuppressive
      regimens have been developed, however, there has been little detailed systematic study of the
      immune changes that occur in response to vaccination with these newer immunosuppressive
      regimens.Current policies on vaccination of transplant recipients are generic and continue to
      be based on old concepts rather than on any new understanding of the effects of these newer
      therapies on the immune system.

      We hope to improve our understanding of the effects of the immunosuppressive regimens in use
      today (calcineurin-inhibitor, or CNI, and sirolimus-based regimens) on immune response to flu
      vaccine. Such knowledge will be critical to helping clinicians develop strategies for getting
      desirable immune responses while not causing rejection.
