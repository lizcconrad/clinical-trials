      OBJECTIVE. Neonatologists consider early feeding at the breast to be too tiring for preterm
      infants, although there is no evidence that this is actually the case. It is also not known
      whether the method of feeding affects energy expenditure. We hypothesized that resting energy
      expenditure (REE) would be higher after breastfeeding than after bottle feeding.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS. preterm ( &gt;32 weeks GA) stable infants who are nourished entirely by
      their mothers' breast milk will be studied when fed expressed breast milk either by bottle or
      at the breast. REE will be measured for 20 minutes after feeding. Breast milk quantity is
      evaluated by pre- and post feeding weighing.

      Most VLBW infants cannot be fed at the breast upon birth, and expressed breast milk by
      gastric tube is thus recommended. Sucking skills mature at around 34 weeks when
      nipple-feeding is introduced. In the absence of evidence-based data to decide the best timing
      to introduce breastfeeding, many clinicians use empiric criteria, such as the infant's
      weight, gestational age, and the ability of infants to bottle feed as proxies of readiness to
      breastfeed. Despite some evidence of physiological benefits of preterm infants feeding at the
      breast, many neonatologists consider direct breastfeeding to be too fatiguing for preterm
      infants. It is not known, however, whether preterm infants who are breastfed expend more
      energy than bottle-fed infants
