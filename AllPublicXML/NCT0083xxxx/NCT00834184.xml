  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if nikkomycin Z is safe when administered at
      different dose levels for 14 days. The study will also determine blood levels and urinary
      excretion of nikkomycin Z in relation to dose administered. Healthy patients will be eligible
      to participate and will be allocated to receive nikkomycin Z (various doses) or a placebo.

    <textblock>
      This protocol will serve as a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of nikkomycin Z.
      Nikkomycin Z has previously been studied in a single dose protocol in healthy male subjects.
      This study is designed to run in parallel to protocol VFCE-2007-001 to provide additional
      data on safety and pharmacokinetics. The study will involve a total of 32 subjects (6
      active/2 placebo per group) with a multiple, rising dose strategy.

    <description>Multiple rising doses. Doses packaged on a unit dose basis in 250 mg capsules. Subjects take 1-3 capsules per dosing block for 14 days unless ADE or study withdrawal. Dose escalation unless a dose-limiting adverse effect is noted. Subjects assigned to BID dosing will receive 28 doses and subjects assigned to TID dosing will receive 42 doses.
250 mg BID (n=6) vs Placebo capsule BID (n=2), 500 mg BID (n=6) vs Placebo capsule BID (n=2), 750 mg BID (n=6) vs Placebo capsule BID (n=2), 750 mg TID (n=6) vs Placebo capsule TID (n=2) At least 4 subjects complete lower dose before randomization includes next higher dose, thus there are 4 arms for active intervention and corresponding placebos.</description>
