      This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors will
      receive investigational study drug ARRY-334543 and docetaxel (with prophylactic growth factor
      support). Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in combination with docetaxel
      in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable
      side effects. Patients will be followed to see what side effects the combination causes and
      what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 30
      patients from the US will be enrolled in this study.

             tumor suitable for treatment with docetaxel.

          -  Tumor recurred or progressed following at least one line of chemotherapy, except if no
             standard of care exists or if the patient refuses standard of care treatment.

          -  Uncontrolled or symptomatic brain metastases (if a patient has brain metastases and is
             on steroids, the steroid dose must be stable for at least 30 days prior to study
             start).

          -  Anti-ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 targeted therapy or anticancer hormonal therapy within 14 days
             prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to or intolerance of docetaxel.

          -  Other criteria exist.
