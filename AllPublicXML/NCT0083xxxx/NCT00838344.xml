  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of a Medication Adherence Program
      (MAP), a systematic telephone call to patients who are overdue for refills, to assess
      individual reasons or barriers to refilling prescribed DM medicines, discuss diabetes care
      progress, and provide intervention to resolve any barriers to taking prescribed medicines.
      The hypothesis for the study is that personalized telephone follow-up by a pharmacist will
      assist people who have missed refilling their prescriptions in taking diabetes medicines by
      resolving medication adherence challenges. Following randomization, the intervention will be
      offered to patients of four Seattle-area Safeway Pharmacies, Inc, who are overdue for
      prescribed DM medicine refills by at least 6 days. Control subjects will receive usual
      pharmacy care at the participating Safeway pharmacies as a comparison. The study will provide
      medication adherence support to intervention subjects for 12 months following enrollment with
      the goal of improving medication refilling and persistence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taking medicines can be a challenge for those with diabetes mellitus (DM) with adherence
      rates to DM medicines as low as 31%. Adherence to DM medicines improves DM by reducing blood
      glucose (ie A1c reduction) but will also result in improved outcomes, reduced cardiovascular
      risks, and reduced costs of diabetes. The most common factors reported to affect medication
      taking in those with DM include difficulty remembering refills and doses, regimen complexity
      (e.g more than one DM drug, need to split tablets, mix products), dosing frequency greater
      than twice daily, depression, and adverse effects or fear of them.

      Pharmacists have immense opportunity to interact with people with DM, who now number over 20
      million in the United States (US). This reality is due to several factors including
      convenience of pharmacies (found in most urban, suburban, and rural communities),
      accessibility of pharmacists for questions and counseling (appointments not usually
      required), and strong rapport that pharmacists and their staff develop with long-term
      patients and their families through their presence in the community. Pharmacists in community
      practices work directly with patients and review refill information about patient medication
      use thus allowing for personalized, immediate, and ongoing promotion of adherence. Currently,
      pharmacists do not routinely call patients who are overdue for prescription refills to
      ascertain if the refill is still needed or proactively work to resolve any barriers to
      refilling. The standard of care is to provide refill and medication adherence support if it
      is requested by a patient and if the pharmacy is able to provide the needed level of support.

      In this study, we will evaluate the impact of a Medication Adherence Program (MAP), a
      systematic telephone call by a pharmacist to patients who are overdue for refills, to assess
      individual reasons or barriers to refilling prescribed DM medicines and provide intervention
      to resolve any barriers.
