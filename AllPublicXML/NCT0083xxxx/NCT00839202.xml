  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel immuno-assay is being evaluated for the measurement of Factor VIII. Current procedure
      measures a rate assay which is subject to much artefact. The hypothesis is that the new assay
      will give a reading of absolute quantities of FVIII which will provide a more suitable
      indicator of FVIII content for clotting factor manufacturers, physicians and patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remnant samples collected in a clinical laboratory are assayed with the new procedure and
      compared with the standard functional activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay. A
      PK study in seven study subjects with hemophilia A is being carried out using five different
      commercially licensed factor VIII concentrates and the blood samples drawn for the PK
      analysis are being measured for FVIII with the novel assay and compared with the standard
      APTT assay. The concentrates used in the PK studies are also being applied to the two assay
      systems to determine each product's specific activity.

    <description>The study is not designed as a therapeutic evaluation, but an assessment of clotting factor VIII timed responses after the infusion of specified doses of licensed clotting factor VIII concentrates. The purpose of the study is to measure the levels of infused licensed clotting factor VIII by standard assay techniques and comparing these standard assays with an experimental assay. Measurements of possible co-factors that might impact the results were also carried out.</description>
