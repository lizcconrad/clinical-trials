    <textblock>
      This protocol is aimed at establishing a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for submyeloablative
      doses of Busulfex ® with the hope that a tolerable, submyeloablative dose can be established
      to test efficacy as alternative therapy for refractory pediatric brain tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric brain tumors remain among the most common malignancies in childhood, second only to
      leukemia, representing 20% of all childhood cancers in the United States (1). Although
      significant strides have been made in therapies for other pediatric malignancies, mortality
      for patients with brain tumors remains high. The mainstay of therapy for CNS tumors has been
      a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. High dose chemotherapy with stem cell
      transplant has been proposed as an alternative to radiation, in very young children and for
      relapsed patients. Stem cell transplantation however is not without significant side effects
      as well as transplant related mortality.

      Busulfan is an alkylating agent and is able to exert its cytotoxic effects through hydrolysis
      and subsequent production of carbonium ions, directly alkylating DNA, interfering with its
      replication, and ultimately leading to cell death (2). Busulfan readily crosses the blood
      barrier, allowing for CNS levels nearly equal to those of plasma levels (5,6).

      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Busulfex ® in children with recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To obtain preliminary data regarding progression free survival (PFS) and event free survival
      (EFS) when Busulfex ® is used at submyeloablative doses in children with recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

      To describe the plasma pharmacokinetics of Busulfex ® in children with recurrent,
      progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors, using a continuous infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Age: Age &gt;2 year and ≤ 21 years Histologic Diagnosis Any histological proven (confirmed by
        institutional pathology report; pathology slides from outside referring outside
        institutions are not required.) recurrent or progressive CNS tumor. (optic pathway and
        brainstem gliomas allowed without histologic verification, but must have diagnostic
        imaging).

        Life Expectancy Patients must have a life expectancy of ≥ 2 months. Prior Therapy There is
        no limit to the number of prior therapies a patient has received

          -  Must be ≥ 3 weeks from myelosuppressive chemotherapy (6 weeks from nitrosoureas) and
             have demonstrated recovery (ANC ≥ 1000/uL) from their last course of chemotherapy

          -  ≥ 6 months following allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          -  Patients taking Itraconazole or Phenytoin will be excluded. Patients must be off of
             these medications for at least 3 days prior to entering this trial. If the patient is
             taking phenytoin for seizures at the time of study enrollment, it must be stopped at
             least 3 days prior to starting therapy and Clonazepam will be substituted during the
             Busulfex ® infusions and for 24 hours following the infusion.
