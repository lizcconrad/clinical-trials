    <textblock>
      This is a single-group, single-center, open-label, one period, bioavailability study. This
      study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of chlorpheniramine in a population of
      children aged 2 to &lt;12 yrs and adolescents aged 12 to &lt;18 yrs. Twelve blood samples (3.0 mL)
      for chlorpheniramine analysis will be drawn at time 0 (pre-dose), and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
      8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of chlorpheniramine will be
      determined. The following primary, single-dose PK parameters for chlorpheniramine will be
      determined using noncompartmental methods: AUCL, AUCI, and Cmax. The following PK parameters
      will also be determined to provide a complete profile of the drug, as appropriate: oral
      clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) and adjusted for body weight (per kg); time to
      reach Cmax (tmax), and apparent elimination constant (Kel) and half-life (t1/2). The PK
      parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals may be enrolled in the study if they meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Males or females between 2 to &lt;18 yrs of age with a minimum weight of 24 pounds and
             within the 5th and 95th percentiles in physical growth characteristics (i.e., height
             and weight) and BMI based on age and gender,

          2. Symptomatic or asymptomatic children/adolescents as follows:

        i.A prior diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and either symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time
        of entry in the study; or ii.Symptoms of an acute Upper Respiratory Infection (URI); or
        iii.No symptoms of an acute URI, but at risk for developing an acute URI as evidenced by
        the following frequency, crowding, and exposure criteria:

          -  Frequency: a history of frequent URIs defined as &gt;6 infections/yr for children aged 2
             to &lt;6 yrs and as &gt;4 infections per year for adolescents aged 6 to &lt;18 yrs;

          -  Crowding: living in a home with ≥4 persons, or sleeping in the same bedroom with ≥3
             persons;

          -  Exposure: the presence of another family member in the household who is ill with a
             URI, or a child in the family that is attending preschool, or attending school with ≥6
             children in the class; c.Except for allergic rhinitis or a URI, children/adolescents
             are in normal physical health (i.e., no clinically significant systemic disease) as
             judged by the Investigator upon physical examination of the subject; d.Subjects do not
             require concomitant medication except for low-dose inhaled glucocorticoids for
             allergic rhinitis or mild concomitant asthma, if dose is stabilized before entry in
             the study (i.e., dose is not changed for one month prior to or during the study), and
             inhaled short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists for concomitant asthma, as needed;
             e.Post menarchal females must be using a reliable method of contraception (i.e., oral,
             transdermal, injectable or implanted contraceptives, IUD, cervical cap, diaphragm,
             condom, abstinence, or surgical sterility); f.Parent/guardian/adolescent provides
             written informed consent and child provides assent, if age appropriate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals are not eligible for entry in the study if any of the following are noted:

          1. The child/adolescent weighs &lt;24 pounds or is below the 5th or above the 95th
             percentiles in physical growth characteristics (i.e., height and weight) and BMI based
