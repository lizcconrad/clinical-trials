      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of
      extended-release (ER) OROS paliperidone in healthy men, and to evaluate the effect of posture
      on the pharmacokinetics of ER OROS paliperidone under fasting conditions. Additionally, the
      safety and tolerability of the treatments in healthy men will be assessed.

      The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the
      to be marketed formulation of ER OROS paliperidone in mobile healthy men, which represents
      the normal conditions. The 12-mg ER OROS paliperidone ER by oral administration single dose
      used in this study does not require prolonged bed rest as a precautionary measure to prevent
      orthostatic hypotension. To support an evaluation of the effect of posture on the
      pharmacokinetics of ER OROS paliperidone under fasting conditions, study medication was also
      administered to healthy men in the fasted state while confined to bed for approximately 36
      hours. The safety and tolerability of the treatments in healthy men will be assessed. 12 mg
      ER OROS paliperidone ER, oral administration, single dose

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m2]) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  A supine (after 5 minutes rest) blood pressure between 100 and 140 mmHg systolic,
             inclusive, and 50 and 90 mmHg diastolic, inclusive

          -  Healthy on the basis of a prestudy physical examination, medical history, 12-lead ECG,
             and the laboratory results of serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis performed
             within 21 days before the first dose. If the results of the serum chemistry,
             hematology, or urinalysis testing are not within the laboratory's reference ranges,
             the male volunteer can be included only if the investigator judges that the deviations
             are not clinically significant. For renal function tests, the values must be within
             the normal laboratory reference ranges.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known drug allergy to risperidone, paliperidone, or any of its excipients

          -  Known history of drug-induced dystonia

          -  Known allergy or history of significant hypersensitivity to heparin, if a heparin lock
             will be used

          -  Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse, a positive test result for the urine
             drug screen at screening or upon admittance to the testing facility, a positive result
             for the alcohol urine test upon admittance to the testing facility

          -  Relevant history or presence of any cardiovascular (including myocardial infarct or
             cardiac arrhythmia), respiratory, neurologic (including seizures), psychiatric, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal (including surgeries, severe gastrointestinal narrowing, and
             malabsorption problems), endocrine, hematologic, or immunologic disease

          -  History of any cancer, with the exception of basal cell carcinomas

          -  History of smoking or use of nicotine-containing substances within the last 2 months,
             as determined by medical history and/or volunteer's verbal report. Volunteers must
             agree to refrain from use throughout the study
