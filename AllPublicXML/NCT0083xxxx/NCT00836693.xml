  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of tadalafil 5 mg
      administered once a day in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) who are naïve to PDE5
      (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitors. Patients may be dose reduced to 2.5mg based on
      tolerability.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12 Week Endpoint in Nocturnal Penile Tumescence (NPT) Pattern: Number of Erectile Events Per Night</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NPT was measured using electrobioimpedance volumetric assessment (NEVA). The NEVA device measures a man's erections during the night. The man wears the device for three nights prior to visit 2 (baseline), visit 5 (end of randomised treatment) and visit 6 (end of follow-up). Data are entered for the 2 nights prior to the visit. During the night the man may have multiple erections. The number of erections is recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>NPT was measured using electrobioimpedance volumetric assessment (NEVA). The NEVA device measures a man's erections during the night.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12 Week Endpoint in the Frequency of Spontaneous Morning Erections Captured by Patient Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The morning erection diary allows the participant to record whether he experienced an erection on waking. The participant is to complete the morning erection diary every morning during the run-in, treatment and follow-up periods. The percentage of mornings the participant reported an erection is analysed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) Questionnaire at 12 Week Endpoint</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The subject questionnaire consists of 11 questions. Each question is rated on a scale of 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 4 (extremely high treatment satisfaction). The EDITS summary score will be obtained by adding each individual result for all questions, dividing by the number of questions answered (mean satisfaction score), and multiplying by 25, thus obtaining a score that ranges from 0 (extremely low treatment satisfaction) to 100 (extremely high satisfaction).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to 12 Week Endpoint in Total and Subdomain Scores of the Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>SEAR measures improvement in self-esteem and relationship satisfaction. Questionnaire consists of two domains, Sexual Relationship (items 1-8) and Confidence (items 9-14). All questions except negatively worded questions 8 and 11 are scored from 1=almost never/never to 5=almost always/always. Questions 8 and 11 were reverse scored, thus a higher score signifies a more favorable response for all 14 items. Overall score is transformed into a 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) scale.</description>

        <description>SEAR measures improvement in self-esteem and relationship satisfaction. Questionnaire consists of two domains, Sexual Relationship (items 1-8) and Confidence (items 9-14). All questions except negatively worded questions 8 and 11 are scored from 1=almost never/never to 5=almost always/always. Questions 8 and 11 were reverse scored, thus a higher score signifies a more favorable response for all 14 items. Overall score is transformed into a 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) scale.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to 12 Week Endpoint in Total and Subdomain Scores of the Self-Esteem and Relationship (SEAR) Questionnaire</title>
          <description>SEAR measures improvement in self-esteem and relationship satisfaction. Questionnaire consists of two domains, Sexual Relationship (items 1-8) and Confidence (items 9-14). All questions except negatively worded questions 8 and 11 are scored from 1=almost never/never to 5=almost always/always. Questions 8 and 11 were reverse scored, thus a higher score signifies a more favorable response for all 14 items. Overall score is transformed into a 0 (least favorable) to 100 (most favorable) scale.</description>
          <population>The ITT analysis set included all randomized subjects who had a baseline and post-baseline observation.</population>
