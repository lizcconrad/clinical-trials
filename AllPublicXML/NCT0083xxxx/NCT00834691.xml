    <textblock>
      Anemia is frequent in patients with heart failure. Few studies have clearly addressed the
      causes of anemia in patients with HF. The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in
      blood concentrations of various substances related to inflammation, oxidative stress, renal
      function and other processes between individuals with 1) heart failure and anemia, 2) heart
      failure without anemia and 3) patients with kidney disease without systolic heart failure.
      This study will help to better understand the reasons why some people with heart failure have
      anemia.

        One hundred and eighty (180) patients will be enrolled in three groups.

        Group 1: This group will involve 80 patients with anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 120g/L in women and
        &lt; 130 g/L in) and systolic heart failure (LVEF &lt; or = 40%; New York Heart Association
        -NYHA- functionnal class II-IV).

        Group 2: This group will include 50 patients with systolic heart failure (LVEF &lt; or = 40%;
        New York Heart Association -NYHA- functionnal class II-IV), but without anemia (hemoglobin
        &gt; or = 120g/L in women and &gt; or = 130 g/L in men).

        Group 3 : 50 patients with at least moderate CRF (eGFR &lt; 60ml/min/1,73m2), and LVEF &gt; or =
        50%, with or without anemia.
