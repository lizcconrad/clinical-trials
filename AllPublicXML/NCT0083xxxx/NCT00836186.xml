      To assess the magnitude and frequency of changes in chemo/cytokine expression in women
      receiving radiation treatment. To asses the impact of race/ethnicity on the magnitude and
      frequency of changes in chemo/cytokine expression during radiation therapy for breast cancer.
      And finally to assess the interaction between radiation-induced chemo/cytokine expression
      changes, and race/ethnicity, with respect to normal tissue reactions to radiation and
      tumor-associated outcomes.

      It is well recognized that the diagnostic and therapeutic gains made in the management of
      breast cancer over the last 2 decades are not fully realized by all groups. African American
      women with breast cancer have greater risk of recurrence, shorter overall survival, shorter
      survival after relapse, worse toxicity and worse cosmetic outcome than their Caucasian
      counterparts.(1-5) These differences in outcome persist even when controlling for age, and
      stage at presentation.(1, 6, 7) Being similarly treated with modern breast conserving therapy
      (lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast irradiation) at recognized centers of excellence does
      little to alleviate the disparities in outcomes.(5, 8) Controlling for socioeconomic factors
      decreases the severity of these disparities, but it does not completely explain them.(4)
      Theories abound as to the cause of outcome inequality. Many of these theories take either a
      psychosocial, or biologic bent. One potential biologic cause may be chemokine and cytokine
      expression.

      Chemokines and cytokines (chemo/cytokines) are proteins and peptides used for cell signaling.
      Primarily secreted by T cells and macrophages, they influence cellular activation,
      differentiation, and function and act as mediators for inflammatory and immune responses.(9)
      There has been substantial research linking some of these chemo/cytokines (TNFα, PDGF, TGFβ,
      Il-6,and IL-8) to tumor promotion and progression. For example, TNFα has been linked to
      greater cell survival despite genomic injury which in turn leads to greater genetic
      alterations and malignant transformation. TNFα has been associated with breast cancer
      progression and metastases.(10) Blocking the receptor for PDGF appears to decrease the
      metastatic potential of breast cancer cell lines.(11, 12) TGFβ inhibits T cell and B cell
      lymphocytes and natural killer cell cytotoxicity.(13) This immuno-suppression has been shown
      to promote tumor progression in mammary cancer cells lines.(13, 14) The ability of TGFβ to
      promote tumor progression is so well recognized that it has become a therapeutic target by
      some researchers.(15, 16) IFNγ has been shown to inhibit mammary cancer cell proliferation
      and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.(17) Clinically, Lyon et al reported significantly
      higher circulating levels of TNFα, Il-6, and IL-8 in women with breast cancer compared to
      women with a negative breast biopsy.(18) Additionally, researchers have directly correlated
      increased levels of IL-6 with the development and progression of breast cancer, and decreased
      overall survival (OAS).(19) Conclusion: Expression of certain chemokines and cytokines is
      associated with development and progression of breast cancer.

    <description>Patients will receive whole breast radiation therapy at a dose of 180-200 cGy per fraction for 23-27 fractions to a total dose of 4600 - 4860 cGy. Additional radiation to the lumpectomy bed (Boost) is at the discretion of the treating physician. The total dose to the tumor bed cannot exceed 6600cGy. Treatments will be given Monday through Friday.</description>

             margin in question cannot be improved. Patients treated with a mastectomy are NOT
             eligible

             surgery
