      This was a 52-week, non-comparative, uncontrolled study of paroxetine in Japanese PTSD
      patients to obtain clinical experience regarding efficacy and safety. In this study, subjects
      received paroxetine 20mg-40mg once daily after an evening meal.

    <description>Subjects will take the treatment phase medication once daily after an evening meal. All subjects will be maintained at Dose Level II (20 mg/day) for the first 2 weeks. If a sufficient clinical response (&quot;1. Very much improved&quot; or &quot;2. Much improved&quot; based on the CGI Global Improvement) is achieved, the subject will continue on the same dose level. When the clinical response is not sufficient but the investigational product is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to Dose Level III (30 mg/day) and then to Dose Level IV (40 mg/day) at intervals of at least 2 weeks until a sufficient response is reached. Once a sufficient response is obtained, the treatment will be continued at that dose. The treatment phase will last for a total of 52 weeks. In those patients receiving Dose Level III or IV, dosage reductions to the next lowest level (Dose Level II or III) consequent to an adverse event are permitted.
Dosage adjustment will be made at the discretion of the PI or Sub-PI</description>

             Scale-DX Current and Lifetime Diagnostic Version (CAPS-DX) will be used.

          -  Disease to Be Treated:

          -  Duration of illness of at least 3 months at Week -1.

          -  Score &gt;= 50 on Criteria B, C and D of CAPS-SX.

          -  Age: &gt;=18 - &lt;65 years (at the time of acquisition of informed consent)

          -  Sex: No restriction

          -  Hospitalization Status: No restriction

          -  Informed consent: Gives his/her informed consent. In case of a subject who is under

             depressive disorders appeared and PTSD is the predominant disorder.

          -  Patients presenting a current major depressive episode that preceded the diagnosis of
             PTSD. However, patients with depressive disorders are allowed to enroll in the study,
             if PTSD was present before the depressive disorders appeared and PTSD is the
             predominant disorder.

             disorder.

             -1.

             to Week -1.

          -  Patients with a history or complication of manic psychosis.

          -  Patients with a history or complication of convulsive disorder (epilepsy, etc.).
