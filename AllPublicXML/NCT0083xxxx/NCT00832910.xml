      Methods: Forty-three RA patients and thirty-nine control patients between 18 and 70 years
      were evaluated. The RA group was made up of individuals with a diagnosis of RA and the
      control group was made up of individuals from the community, paired for gender, age and body
      mass index. The patients were assessed with regard to body image (Body dysmorphic disorder
      examination (BDDE)), self-esteem (Rosenberg self-esteem scale), function (Health assessment
      questionnaire (HAQ)) and quality of life (Short form-36 (SF-36)).
