    <textblock>
      This study uses polysomnographs(PSG) to investigate sleep patterns in patients with bipolar
      depression. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of ziprasidone that is added to
      patients current medications. The objective is to relate changes in slow wave and rapid eye
      movement sleep to changes in mood and overall illness severity. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to add either placebo or ziprasidone to their current treatment regimen.
      Participants make 3 to 4 study visits, over a 1 month period, at which they will be asked
      about their history, mood and sleep quality. Participants will also have three in-home
      overnight polysomnographs.
