  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to validate the current use of FDG PET/CT for the diagnosis of infection
      and inflammation and examine the usefulness of PET/CT applying also other tracers.

      The results should allow us to confirm our primary hypothesis: &quot;FDG-PET/CT is better than
      established methods to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of infection/inflammation&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study include several part projects, each contributing to the evaluation of the value of
      FDG-PET/CT in the diagnosis of infection and inflammation. The aims are to establish the
      diagnostic value in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
      values, interobserver and intraobserver variation.

      Part project A FDG-PET/CT in patients with blood culture positive for staphylococcus aureus
      and unresolved origin of infection.

      Part project B FDG-PET/CT in patients with fever of unknown origin.

      Part project C FDG-PET/CT in patients suspected of vascular graft infection.

      Additionally, we wish to establish an optimal imaging protocol (necessity of fasting,
      consequences of antibiotic therapy prior to imaging, and the need of contrast),
      interpretation criteria, and the value of standard uptake values (SUV).

        Patients are referred for FDG-PET/CT at the Department of Nuclear Medicine, Odense
        University Hospital. Patients are recruited for part project A from the entire hospital
        through a project nurse at the Department of Infectious Diseases. Patients are recruited
        for part project B and part project C among all patients referred for FDG-PET/CT as per
        usual guidelines.
