  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial that uses personal digital assistants (PDAs) to assist in examining the
      relationship between self reported stress, an objective biochemical indicator of stress
      (salivary alpha amylase) and self-reported dietary lapse among type 2 diabetic adults who are
      interested/undergoing in weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the study, all participants will be provided with a personalized ADA-based diet plan and a
      pre-programmed PDA. They will be required to record their mood and activities into the PDA
      whenever PDA prompts, they break their diet plan, and/or and face significant stress. They
      will also be required to collect saliva samples periodically. In addition to this they will
      be administered the Trier Social Stress Test once during the study, where they will perform
      certain stress inducing tasks like delivering a speech and solving maths problems. Salivary
      samples will be collected before and after these tasks. They will also take various
      questionnaires during each of the 15 to 16 visits. The completed questionnaires, PDA records
      and reports of salivary alpha amylase levels will be analyzed to examine the corelation
      between stress, dietary lapse and weight loss.

    <description>Participants will be given personalized diet plan with a 0.5- 1 lb weight loss/week, based on each person's goals. He/she will also be prompted by a pre programmed PDA to enter dietary lapses and stress inducing events. Saliva samples will be collected as per the study plan.</description>
