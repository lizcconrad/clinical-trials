      Objective: Somatization of emotions accounts for excess Emergency department (ED) visits.
      Intensive Short-term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) has methods to diagnose and manage
      somatization. We examined the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of ISTDP
      diagnostic and treatment methods used for patients with repeated ED presentations for
      medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUS)

      Herein we report the methods and outcomes of rapidly-accessed, emotion-focused diagnostic and
      treatment services for patients presenting to the ED with medically unexplained symptoms
      (MUS). Patients who were assessed and referred by ED physicians will serve as a
      non-randomized condition controlling for some relevant variables. Our a priori hypotheses
      were that assessed and treated patients would have a reduction in ED visits and self reported
      symptoms after this intervention and that controls would have a smaller reduction in ED
      visits if any.
