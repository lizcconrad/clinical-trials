    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Dexmedetomidine when used during
      thoracic surgery.

      The primary outcome will be changes in oxygenation as measured the PaO2 during one lung
      ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To collect data on the effects of Dexmedetomidine(DEX)(0.3mcg/kg loading dose followed by an
      infusion of 0.3mcg/kg/hr)on Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction when administered to patients
      during surgery with one lung ventilated thoracic procedures. Dexmedetomidine has both
      vasoconstricting and vasodilatatory effect on peripheral vasculature but its effect on
      pulmonary vessels is not known. If it is predominantly a vasodilator on pulmonary vessels it
      can inhibit hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and will increase shunting of venous blood to
      arterial circulation without oxygenation. If our study proves it to be a vasodilator for
      pulmonary vessels then it will not be wise to use it in thoracic procedure with one lung
      ventilation. If our study proves that it is a vasoconstrictor for pulmonary vessels, then it
      will be an excellent adjunct to other anesthetic agents during one lung ventilation.

               -  Not of childbearing potential, defined as post-menopausal for at least 1 year or
                  surgically sterile due to bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or
                  hysterectomy.

               -  Of childbearing potential but is not pregnant at time of baseline and is
                  practicing one of the following methods of birth control: oral or parenteral

                  sexual intercourse.

          4. Subject requires thoracic surgical procedure .

          5. Subject (or subject's legally authorized representative) has voluntarily signed and
             dated the informed consent document approved by the Institutional Review Board.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has received general anesthesia within 7 days prior to study entry, has
             received any experimental drug within 30 days prior to study drug administration, or
             has been previously enrolled in this study.

          2. Subject has central nervous system (CNS) disease with an anticipated potential for
             increased intracranial pressure, an uncontrolled seizure disorder and/or known
             psychiatric illness that could confound a normal response to sedative treatment.

          3. Subject has received treatment with an alpha-2 agonist or antagonist within 14 days of
             the scheduled surgery/procedure.

          4. Subject for whom opiates, benzodiazepines, DEX or other alpha-2 agonists are
             contraindicated.

          5. Subject has received an IV opioid within one hour, or PO/IM opioid within four hours,

             limit of normal (ULN) within the two months prior to screening, and/or a history of
             liver failure.

          8. Subject has any other condition or factor which, in the Investigator's opinion, might
             increase the risk to the subject.
