      Ear acupressure is commonly applied to treat insomnia in Oriental clinical practice but
      lacking the evidence of the randomized controlled trial (RCT)of ear acupressure on insomnia.
      In this study, a RCT is conducted to investigate the complementary effect of ear acupressure
      on chronic insomnia in old adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even though there have been many advances in the pharmacological treatment of insomnia, many
      patients with insomnia visit complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) specialists for
      help due to fear of the side effects of long-term treatment with hypnotics. Acupuncture is
      commonly used to treat insomnia in the field of CAM. Among the different methods of
      acupuncture, it has been noted that ear acupressure (placing magnetic pellets on the
      auricular points), which has the advantage of being non-invasive and easily carried out,
      shows possible effects whereby there is improvement in the sleep quality of old adults.
      However, it is lacking of the evidence of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ear
      acupressure on insomnia.

      Insomnia is related to homeostatic dysregulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS). Ear
      acupuncture and its related techniques are believed to act through the reticular formation
      and the ANS may thus result in an amelioration of illness.

      In this study, a RCT is conducted to investigate the complementary effect of ear acupressure
      on chronic insomnia in old adults.Besides, the changes of ANS function (measured by heart
      rate variability) are recorded to evaluate the role of ANS in the treatment of insomnia.

    <description>The ear acupressure that is used involved a 0.3 cm-sized magnetic pellet on a 1 cm size sticky patch (Ching-Ming Co., Taiwan), which was placed on the bilateral ear Shenmen points; each of the points were pressed once a second for one minute (60 times) before sleep every night. The time period of the treatment course was four weeks.</description>
