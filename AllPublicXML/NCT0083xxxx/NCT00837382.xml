  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have difficulties adjusting back to
      civilian life. Research shows that symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are
      particularly high in returning Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)
      veterans, and that combat-related nightmares and sleep disturbances are common in veterans
      with PTSD. This is of concern because people with these problems will often use unhealthy
      ways of coping. Although combat-related nightmares and difficulty sleeping are highly
      distressing, there are helpful treatments that do not involve taking medication. One of these
      treatments teaches specific skills to help people improve their sleep habits and to change
      their nightmares so that they are less upsetting. This treatment can be very helpful and
      research shows that people experience decreases in the frequency and severity of their
      nightmares, decreased symptoms of depression and PTSD, and improved sleep quality and
      quantity after completing treatment. However, because this treatment has only been studied
      with civilians, it is not clear how well this treatment works for returning veterans. This
      study tests how well this treatment works in treating combat nightmares in veterans who also
      have PTSD from experiencing a traumatic event.

          6. consenting to be in the pilot study for treatment of PTNM. In addition, patients must
             agree to allow their assessment and therapy sessions to be video/audiotaped for the
             purposes of supervision.
