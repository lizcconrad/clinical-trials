        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having given their written informed consent, prior to participating in the
             trial.

          -  Patients of either sex &gt;= 40 years of age and of sufficient good health that they will
             be able to complete the 6-month follow-up.

          -  Patients with signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of at least one knee:

               -  Diagnosed according to ACR criteria.

               -  Based upon a knee X-ray performed within 6 months prior to Screening, the
                  radiograms must be classified as a Grade II or III for osteoarthritis of the knee
                  according to the Kellgren &amp; Lawrence grading system based upon a radiologist's
                  written report or individual certified for reading knee radiograms. (Sharpening
                  of the tibial spine is not considered to be an osteophyte).

          -  Patients with symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis of the knee for at least 6
             months prior to Screening. These symptoms must include knee joint pain, and may
             include crepitus, swelling and/or effusion of the knee.

          -  At Screening, patients on any analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication should have a
             visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score after walking on a 50 ft flat surface of &gt; 30
             mm but &lt; 90 mm using a 100 mm scale. If patients are not taking any
             analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication or have not taken any pain medication
             (prescription [Rx] or over-the-counter [OTC]) in the previous 3 days from Screening
             then they should have a VAS pain score after walking on a 50 ft flat surface of &gt; 40
             mm but &lt; 90 mm. If bilateral knee pain is present, the investigator will select the
             more painful knee.

          -  At Screening and Baseline, if there is bilateral OA of the knee involvement, patients
             must have a VAS pain score for walking on a 50 ft flat surface of &lt; 30 mm in the less
             painful contralateral knee at the Baseline assessment. A patient scoring an acceptable
             VAS pain score at Screening but failing to meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria
             at Baseline can not be randomized and enrolled.

          -  At Baseline, after all analgesic/anti-inflammatory medications have been discontinued
             for 2 weeks (withdrawal from acetaminophen rescue medication for at least 24 hours
             prior to Baseline assessment), patients should have a VAS pain score of &gt; 40 mm but &lt;
             90 mm immediately after the 50-foot walk on a flat surface. Again, if bilateral knee
             pain is present, the investigator will select the more painful knee and the
             contralateral knee must have a VAS pain score of &lt; 30 mm.

          -  Patients must have had knee pain in the signal knee on at least 50% of the days in the
             month preceding Screening.

          -  Patients who are able to complete efficacy measurement questionnaires and can
             understand and read English or Spanish (Spanish forms will be provided).

          -  Patients who can perform the 50-foot walk test without the support of crutches or
             other assistive devices, except for canes. If patient uses a cane routinely in daily
             activities, then they can use it for their assessments. However, this use must remain
             stable for all assessments.

          -  Minimum flexion of 90 degrees in both knees.

          -  Patients who are willing to discontinue all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs) or other analgesic medication taken for any condition, including their knee
             pain with the exception of acetaminophen, up to 1000 mg (2 tablets) four times a day
             (q.i.d.), as needed (p.r.n.) (maximum 8 tablets or 4 grams per day). These patients
             must be willing to use only acetaminophen as a rescue pain medication for the knee
             pain during the study period and refrain from even acetaminophen use 24 hours prior to
             any office visit. All other analgesic medications for any chronic condition must be
             stopped (see exceptions for acute treatment of transient flares of pain). Patients
             must also be willing to abstain from any intra-articular (i.a.) or peri-articular
             injections to the knee or surgery during the course of the trial, except for the
             assigned study product.

          -  Patients who, if they are currently taking low dose aspirin (325 mg/day or less), are
             willing to remain on a stable dose throughout the study and are willing to refrain
             from any aspirin dose 24 hours prior to any office visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential may not be entered if:

               -  their pregnancy tests (urine test) are positive,

               -  they are nursing,

               -  they do not use an effective method of contraception until all follow-up
                  procedures are complete. (Methods of contraception considered effective are an
                  oral, injectable or implanted contraceptive agent, or an intra-uterine device
                  with a failure rate of 1% per year, and abstinence).
