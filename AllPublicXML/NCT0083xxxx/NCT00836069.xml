  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-site, Phase 3, placebo
      controlled fixed-dose study of PD 0332334 and paroxetine in 528 outpatients with generalized
      anxiety disorder. Subjects will be randomized to the following treatments (132 subjects per
      treatment group):

      PD 0332334 225 mg BID (450 mg/day), PD 0332334 300 mg BID (600 mg/day), placebo or paroxetine
      20 mg QD (20 mg/day).

      [QD: once daily, qAM: each morning, BID: twice daily].

      The study will consist of 3 phases: an initial screening phase which must be completed 7 to
      14 days prior to randomization; an 8-week double-blind treatment phase; and a 2-week
      double-blind dose-tapering follow-up phase. After obtaining written informed consent the
      investigator will initiate washout of prior psychotropic medications. After the washout of
      prior psychotropic medications has been completed the investigator must ensure that the
      subject is no longer taking psychotropic medication for at least 14 days prior to the
      randomization visit. In addition the investigator must ensure that screening visit procedures
      (with the exception of obtaining informed consent) are completed within 14 days of the
      randomization visit.

      Potential subjects will be approached during a regularly scheduled clinic visit, upon
      referral from another physician, or in response to research advertisements. Those who call in
      will participate in a short phone pre-screen. This allows us to determine if the person fits
      the most limiting inclusion/exclusion criteria before requesting they dedicate a longer
      period of time for an in-person screen. Additionally it gives interested individuals the
      opportunity to learn more about the study and to review the consent form with family,
      friends, and other physicians prior to coming in for the screen and making a final decision
      regarding study enrollment. Once the subject has given informed consent, the screening
      process for the study will commence.

      Subjects who fulfill entry criteria will be randomized to receive ONE of the following 4
      treatments in a double-blind fashion: PD 0332334 225 mg BID, PD 0332334 300 mg BID, placebo,
      and paroxetine 20 mg QAM. PD 0332334 will be titrated up in the PD 0332334 225 mg BID and PD
      0332334 300 mg BID treatment groups. The titration of PD 0332334 will be from 125 mg in the
      beginning of the study. In addition the PD 0332334 225 mg BID and PD 0332334 300 mg BID
      treatment groups will be titrated down at the end of the study. The 20 mg daily dose of
      paroxetine used in this study is based on the approved label for the use of paroxetine in
      patients with GAD. Doses were selected for this Phase 3 study based on safety and efficacy
      information known about PD 0332334 and pregabalin (PGB), an α2δ ligand approved for the
      treatment of GAD in Europe

      The subjects enrolled will be men and women ages 18 to 65 who meet DSM-IV criteria for
      generalized anxiety disorder with a preponderance of anxious symptoms over depressive
      symptoms.

      De-identified blood samples will be collected from study subjects at Screening (Visit 1)
      according to the standard Molecular Profiling supplement to the protocol. Participation in
      this component is optional for study subjects. Samples may be utilized in the future to
      investigate GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) genetics, expression metabonomic and protein
      biomarker profiles, drug-response, or other genetic or biomarker questions. [Metabonomics:
      The study of metabolic responses to drugs, environmental changes and diseases. Metabonomics
      is an extension of genomics (concerned with DNA) and proteomics (concerned with proteins). ]

      Additionally, partners of male participants who become pregnant during the course of the
      study, will be requested to participate in order for the sponsor to collect safety
      information and understand the effects, if any, that PD 0332334 may have on her pregnancy or
      the fetus. Details of the this sub-study are described in the separate 'pregnant partner'
      consent form. Pregnant partners will be be asked to sign a separate HIPAA and consent form in
      order to participate.

      The investigators have recently received notification of an SAE (Serious adverse event) at
      another site that has already begun recruitment for this study. The MediWatch report for that
      SAE is included as a Supporting document on WEBRIDGE. Additionally, a protocol change
      clarifying the procedures to collect lab information to calculate the estimate Creatinin
      CVlearance (CLer) has been submitted. This document has been added as a supporting document
      on WEBRIDGE.

          4. Antisocial or borderline personality disorder.

          5. Serious suicidal risk per the clinical investigator's judgment. (Note: The Suicidality
             module of the MINI diagnostic interview and the C-SSRS should be used as aids to the
             assessment of suicidality, but do not replace overall clinical judgment in
             determination of suicidal risk).

          6. Current use of psychotropic medications (ie, drugs normally prescribed for depression,
             mania, anxiety, insomnia, or psychosis) that cannot be discontinued 2 weeks prior to
             randomization. Fluoxetine is prohibited within 5 weeks of randomization. In the event
             of inadvertent administration of psychotropic medications during the 2 weeks prior to
             randomization, continued eligibility will be assessed on a case by case basis by the
             investigator and the medical monitor.

          7. Use of drugs, supplements, prescription or nonprescription, or food that have
             psychoactive properties. In the event of inadvertent use of such products during the 2
             weeks prior to randomization, continued eligibility will be assessed on a case by case
             basis by the investigator and the medical monitor. In addition, following a discussion
             of the individual case between the medical monitor and the investigator, the medical
             monitor may allow minimal anxiolytic medication (for example a benzodiazepine) use for
             subjects who experience significant intolerable anxiety during the final week of the
             study (Days 64-71).

          8. Subjects who have been treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the 14 days prior
             to the baseline visit.

          9. Regular use of benzodiazepines during the 3 months prior to Screening (for at least 5
             out of 7 days per week).

         10. Subjects initiating formal psychotherapy within 3 month prior to screening who intend
             to continue formal psychotherapy during the study. This includes psychodynamic,
             cognitive, and interpersonal therapies.

         11. Positive drug tests at Screening (V1) or Randomization (V2) visits for any of the
             following substances or classes of compounds: amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates,
             benzodiazepines, sedatives and hypnotics, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), cannabinoids,
             or other illegal or illicit drugs. An exception to the exclusion for a positive
             benzodiazepine, opiate, or sedative and hypnotic drug test at the Screening (V1) visit
             may be granted by the Pfizer medical monitor if written evidence of a valid, current
             prescription is presented.

         12. Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

         13. Subjects with a current seizure disorder.

         14. Subjects with a history of life-threatening neoplasms within 5 years prior to study
             entry, other than carcinoma in situ of the cervix or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

         15. Subjects with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, except subjects who are euthyroid and
             have been on stable doses of thyroid replacement for 6 months or more.

         16. Subjects with any clinically unstable hematological, autoimmune, endocrine,
             neurological, renal, hepatic, retinal, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular disorder.

         17. Subjects with uncontrolled narrow angle glaucoma.

         18. Subjects with a known hypersensitivity to paroxetine.

         19. History of allergy or intolerance to paroxetine.

         20. Subjects with a prior history of insufficient response to paroxetine in the treatment
             of generalized anxiety disorder (with an adequate trial of therapy).

         21. Pregnant or nursing females; females of childbearing potential who are unwilling or
             unable to use an acceptable method of contraception for the duration of the study.

         22. Treatment with an investigational drug within 60 days preceding the first dose of
             trial medication.

         23. Estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) &lt;55 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault equation).

         24. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels &gt;3 times the
             upper limit of normal at Screening (V1).

         25. Male and Female subjects with a screening 12-lead ECG demonstrating QTcF (Fredericia's
             correction) &gt;450 msec, if confirmed with an unscheduled repeat 12-lead ECG's at the
             screen visit. In the event of discrepant QTcF values (i.e., &gt;450 msec and &lt;450 msec)
             after repeat unscheduled 12-lead ECG at screen, a decision with regards protocol
             eligibility will be made on a case by case basis between the investigator and medical
             monitor.

         26. History of lack of efficacy for treatment of GAD with, or allergy or intolerance to,
             other α2δ drugs (pregabalin, gabapentin).

         27. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more within 56 days prior to
             dosing.

         28. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.
