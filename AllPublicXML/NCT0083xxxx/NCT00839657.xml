  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals taking warfarin often need frequent dose changes as the international normalized
      ratio (INR) gets too high or too low which could result in a higher risk of thromboembolism,
      bleeding and early discontinuation of a highly useful therapy. This study will compare two
      approaches to warfarin dosing to examine the utility of using genetic information for
      warfarin dosing.

    <textblock>
      The objective of the Clarification of Optimal Anticoagulation through Genetics (COAG) trial
      is to conduct a 1,022 participant, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial comparing two
      approaches to guiding warfarin therapy initiation: 1) initiation of warfarin therapy based on
      algorithms using clinical information and an individual's genotype using genes known to
      influence warfarin response (&quot;genotype-guided dosing&quot;), and 2) initiation of warfarin therapy
      based on algorithms using only clinical information (&quot;clinical-guided dosing&quot;). The study
      hypothesis is that the use of genetic and clinical information for selecting the dose of
      warfarin during the initial dosing period will lead to improvement in stability of
      anticoagulation(AC) relative to a strategy that incorporates only clinical information
      (without genetics) for initial dosing. Each study arm will include a baseline dose initiation
      algorithm and a dose revision algorithm applied over the first 4 to 5 doses of warfarin
      therapy. By comparing the two strategies in this trial, the study will be able to determine
      if genetic information provides added benefit above and beyond what can be gleaned simply
      with clinical information. This study is a proof-of-concept efficacy trial. Efficacy is
      defined as a measure of whether, under optimal application, dosing algorithms will lead to
      improvement in care. The trial will thus answer the question: &quot;can the use of clinical plus
      genetic information lead to an improvement in anticoagulation control above and beyond the
      use of only clinical information during the initiation of warfarin, when applied in a uniform
      and optimal manner to all patients?&quot; Because efficacy has not yet been established for
      genotype-guided dosing of warfarin, it is important to first test whether this approach can,
      indeed, improve anticoagulation outcomes under controlled conditions.
