  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity (best overall response) of
      the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody IMC-11F8 administered in
      combination with mFOLFOX-6 chemotherapy regimen in treatment-naive, locally-advanced or
      metastatic CRC participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response )</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 Months</time_frame>
    <description>CR and PR defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.0 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and PR defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD. Percentage of participants was calculated as: (total number of participants with CR or PR from start of the treatment until disease progression or recurrence) / (total number of participants treated) * 100.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to date of death from any cause up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the duration from the date of first dose to the date of death from any cause. OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants who were alive at the time of the data inclusion cutoff or lost to follow-up, OS was censored at the last contact.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to measured PD or death up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause. Progressive disease (PD) was determined using RECIST v1.0 criteria. PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. PFS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants who had no PD or death at the time of the data inclusion cutoff, PFS was censored at their last tumor assessment prior to the earliest of the following events: 2 or more missed visits, additional cancer treatment or the end of the follow-up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs (SAEs) or Death</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to end of treatment and 30-day post treatment follow-up up to 31 months</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who experienced AEs, SAEs or death during the study and within 30 days of last dose. A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of response to time of measured PD or death up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response was defined as the time from first confirmed CR or PR to the first time of PD or death due to any cause. CR, PR and PD were defined using RECIST v1.0 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR was defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the LD; PD was defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. Participants with CR or PR who had no PD or death at the time of the data inclusion cutoff, the duration of response was censored at their last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Anti-IMC-11F8 Antibody Assessment (Immunogenicity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to last day of treatment plus 45 days after last treatment (127 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was considered to have an anti-IMC-11F8 response if there were 2 consecutive positive samples or if the final sample tested is positive. Participants with a baseline sample positive for anti-IMC-11F8 antibodies were considered unevaluable for immunogenicity. A sample was considered positive for IMC-11F8 antibodies if it exhibited a post-baseline treatment emergent antibody level that exceeded the upper 95% confidence interval of the mean determined from the normal anti-IMC 11F8 level found in healthy treatment-naïve individuals.</description>

85 milligrams per meter square (mg/m²) oxaliplatin IV infusion over 2 hours
400 mg/m² folinic acid
400 mg/m² 5-FU as an IV bolus injection; and immediately followed by
A 46-hour continuous IV infusion of 5-FU at 2400 mg/m² All treatments were administered every 2 weeks until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent or until other criteria for treatment discontinuation were met.</description>

          <description>On Day 1 of each 2-week cycle, each participant received IMC-11F8 (necitumumab) in combination with the mFOLFOX-6 regimen (oxaliplatin/5-FU/FA) in the order shown:
800 mg IMC-11F8 IV infusion over 50 minutes
85 mg/m² oxaliplatin IV infusion over 2 hours
400 mg/m² folinic acid
400 mg/m² 5-FU as an IV bolus injection; and immediately followed by
A 46-hour continuous IV infusion of 5-FU at 2400 mg/m² All treatments were administered every 2 weeks until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance, withdrawal of consent, investigator decision, or until other criteria for treatment discontinuation were met.</description>

Progressive disease (PD) was determined using RECIST v1.0 criteria.

PFS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants who had no PD or death at the time of the data inclusion cutoff, PFS was censored at their last tumor assessment prior to the earliest of the following events: 2 or more missed visits, additional cancer treatment or the end of the follow-up period.</description>
