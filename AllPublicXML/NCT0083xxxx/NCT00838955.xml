      This clinical trial is for patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma that has not responded to standard
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to determine what effects, good or bad, Temsirolimus
      has on Hodgkin Lymphoma. The study will also determine whether Temsirolimus is tolerated in
      patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma who have been previously treated with chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temsirolimus 25 mg IV infusion will be given once weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each
      cycle. Patients will be assessed for response with CT scans after the second cycle, and then
      after every other cycle until disease progression is confirmed.

      Patients will be treated with Temsirolimus until disease progression, or up to six cycles.
      Continuation of therapy beyond cycles is at the discretion of the investigator.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed classical Hodgkin Lymphoma or Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin
             Lymphoma with progressive disease during or at the end of the previous therapy, as
             defined by the IWG criteria.

          -  Patient must have nodular sclerosing, lymphocyte depleted, or mixed cellularity
             Hodgkin Lymphoma (Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma), or Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin
             Lymphoma.

          -  Baseline measurements and evaluations must be obtained within 4 weeks of registration
             to the study.

          -  Abnormal PET scans will not constitute evaluable disease, unless verified by CT scan
             or other appropriate imaging.

          -  A clearly defined, bidimensionally measurable lymph node or tumor mass measuring at
             least 2 cm in diameter on a CT scan.

          -  Patient should have had at least one line of prior chemotherapy. Patients relapsing
             after treatment with radiation therapy alone are not eligible.

          -  Age &gt; than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this
             trial.

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to lack of information about the
             safety of administration of Temsirolimus in pregnant and lactating patients. All
             females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study within 2 weeks
             prior to registration to rule out pregnancy.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use
             an accepted and effective method of pregnancy prevention.

          -  Patient must have a SWOG performance status between 0-2.

          -  Patient must have no prior treatment with an m-TOR inhibitor.

          -  Patient must not have active infections at the time of registration.

          -  Laboratory studies should be obtained within two weeks of study registration except
             where noted otherwise. Allowable laboratory values are listed below:

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; than or equal 1,000/mm3

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; than or equal 8 gm/dL

          -  Platelets &gt; than or equal 75,000/mm3

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; than or equal to two times the upper limit of normal. Creatinine
             should be measured within seven days of registration.

          -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; than or equal to â‰¤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. Total
             bilirubin should be measured within seven days of registration.

          -  AST (SGOT) &lt; than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  ALT (SGPT) &lt; than or equal to 3 times the upper limit of normal.

          -  Fasting total cholesterol &lt; than or equal to 350 mg/dL.

          -  Fasting triglyceride level &lt; than or equal to 400 mg/dL.

          -  Patient must have a life expectancy of three months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have received prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Prior
             autologous stem cell transplantation more than six months prior to registration is
             acceptable.

          -  Patient must not have received prior chemotherapy, biologic therapy or radiation
             within three weeks prior to registration, and should have recovered from toxicities of
             prior therapy (to Grade 0 or 1).

          -  Patient must not have evidence of active CNS disease.

          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled comorbid disease, including hyperlipidemia,
             hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia

          -  Patient must not have a psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Patient must have a life expectancy of three months.
