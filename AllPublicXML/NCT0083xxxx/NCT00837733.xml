  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of endometrial biopsy on increasing
      implantation rate in patients with recurrent implantation failures, 93 women with at least
      two implantation failures were evaluated. In case group endometrial biopsy was obtained from
      48 patients in the luteal phase of previous cycle and implantation and clinical pregnancy
      rate were compared with 45 patients in control group. The results suggest that in vitro
      fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection after endometrial biopsy increase pregnancy
      outcome.

      In a randomized control trial study, 93 women with at least two implantation failures were
      evaluated. In case group endometrial biopsy was obtained from 48 patients in the luteal phase
      of previous cycle and implantation and clinical pregnancy rate were compared with 45 patients
      in control group.

      The implantation rate was determined as 10.9% in biopsy group compared with 3.38% in
      controls. Clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in case group than controls (27.1%
      and 8.9% respectively
