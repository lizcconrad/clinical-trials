    <measure>Sexual Encounter Profile Diary Question 3, the Overall Distribution of Time to Onset by Yes Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days double-blind period</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed was the median time to onset of efficacy (day when 50% of participants have had at least 1 successful intercourse attempt) within the first 4 days of therapy based on a &quot;yes&quot; response to the sexual encounter profile diary question 3: &quot;Did your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse?&quot; Data are based on participants who responded &quot;yes&quot;. For the placebo group, onset of efficacy was not reached within the first 4 days of therapy, therefore, the analysis timeframe was expanded for this group to determine the median time to onset of efficacy.</description>

    <description>Assessed was the cumulative precentage of successful intercourse attempts (successful attempts relative to the total number of intercourse attempts) over the 14-day double-blind treatment period. A successful attempt was defined by a &quot;yes&quot; response to the sexual encounter profile diary question #3: &quot;Did your erection last long enough for you to have successful intercourse?&quot; Data are presented as the proportion of intercourse attempts for which participants answered &quot;yes&quot; relative to the total number of intercourse attempts.
