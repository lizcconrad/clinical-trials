  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both pre- and postconditioning seem to protect cardiomyocytes during reperfusion therapy.
      Investigations both ex vivo and in vivo suggest that a gut derived hormone,
      Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 (GLP-1), is able to reduce reperfusioninjury after myocardial
      ischemia. Results from our own laboratory have shown a marked reduction in infarct size when
      rat hearts in a Langendorf preparation were exposed to the GLP-1 analogue, exendin-4. The
      investigators want to investigate to what extent this effect can be translated to humans in
      the setting of acute STEMI treated with primary PCI when evalutaed by cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging.
