      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture treatment
      on residual insomnia in major depressive patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-blinded controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups. One is the traditional acupuncture treatment group, one is the
      non-traditional acupuncture treatment group and the other is an acupuncture-like placebo
      treatment. Patients will be put into groups and then compared. The chance of getting into
      each group is 1:1:1, i.e. equal chance.

    <description>Patients will be treated at bilateral Ear Shenmen, Sishencong EX-HN1, Anmian, and unilateral Yintang EX-HN3 and Baihui GV20. Acupuncture treatment will be performed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner. &quot;De qi&quot;(an irradiating feeling considered to be indicative of effective needling) is achieved if possible. An electric-stimulator (CEFAR Acus II, Lund, Sweden) is connected to these needles to give an electric-stimulation in continuous wave, frequency of 4 Hz, 0.45 ms square wave pulses and constant current. Surgical tape or hair pin will be adhered to the needles.The needles will be left for 30 min and then removed. Acupuncture treatment will consist of three sessions per week for 3 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated superficially at points away from classic acupoints. The points include bilateral &quot;Deltoideus&quot; [in the middle of the line insertion of Binao LI 14 and acromion], &quot;Forearm&quot; [1 inch laterally of the middle point between Shaohai HE3 and Shenmen HE7], &quot;Upper arm&quot; [1 inch laterally of Tianfu LU 3] and &quot;Lower leg&quot; [0.5 inch dorsally of Xuanzhong GB39]. &quot;De qi&quot; is avoided during needling. The treatment procedure, electric-stimulation, frequency, duration and number of treatment sessions will be the same for the Traditional Acupuncture group.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Placebo Acupuncture</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Placebo needles designed by Streitberger (1998) will be used. The placebo needles are blunt needle that will not penetrate the skin during needle insertion. The handles of these placebo needles will slide over the needle when it is compressed, giving it the appearance of penetrating the skin. The placebo needles are inserted to the site 1 inch beside the acupoints in order to avoid the acupressure effect. The needles are held by a surgical tape or hair pin in hairy region to imitate the retention of needles. The needles are connected to an electric-stimulator with zero frequency and amplitude. The number, duration and frequency of the treatment sessions, and the intervention procedure will be the same for electro-acupuncture and placebo acupuncture.</description>
