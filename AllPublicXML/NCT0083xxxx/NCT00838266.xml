      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a new mouthrinse on dental
      plaque deposits.

      The study is carried out on 50 volunteers that are asked to use the mouthrinse without any
      other oral hygiene measure, during 4 days. It is a double bind, cross-over, randomized
      design: the same subjects test the active product and the placebo.

    <textblock>
      The prevention of oral diseases is mainly targeted at the control of dental plaque. While
      tooth brushing is an effective method to remove plaque mechanically, it is not always
      sufficient and chemical antiplaque agents could be helpful. Some of them are used for their
      antibacterial action, the gold standard being chlorhexidine. Despite the great benefit of
      this bactericidal approach, the search continues for active ingredients that could prevent
      dental plaque formation without affecting the biological equilibrium within the oral cavity.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a mouthrinse, containing red grape
      seed extract and nicométhanol fluorhydrate, in the control of dental plaque deposit in a
      4-days plaque regrowth model.

      The study is a double blind randomized cross-over design, involving 50 healthy volunteers.
      During the treatment periods (4 days) no oral hygiene, measures excepting rinsing with the
      allocated product (active/non active) are permitted.

      On day 1, the subjects receive professional prophylaxis. The mouthrinse is used pure, three
      times per day, after each meal. On day 5, subjects will be scored for disclosed plaque using
      the Quigley Hein index (modified by Turesky).

      After a 2 weeks wash-out period, the subject receives the other product (active/non active)
      and uses it as in the first period.

      On day 5, subjects will be scored again for disclosed plaque
