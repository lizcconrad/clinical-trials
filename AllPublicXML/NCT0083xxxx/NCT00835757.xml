      This study aims to validate magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (MRI/
      DTI) analysis as a non-invasive method for the assessment of myelinated nerve fibers loss in
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

        Two groups of 25 subjects each will be studied: subjects with confirmed diabetic peripheral

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of diabetes mellitus diagnosed for more than 6 months as defined by the World
             Health Organization Classification.

          2. Presence of confirmed DPN as defined below.

          3. Age between 18-70 years.

          4. Have no risk factors for other non-diabetic neuropathies (as determined by medical
             history, family history, history of medications, occupational history, history of
             exposure to toxins, physical and neurological examinations).

          5. Willingness to provide informed consent and cooperate with the medical procedures for
             the study.

        Inclusion Criteria for Healthy Controls:

          1. Age-matched non-obese (BMI &lt; 30) control subjects

          2. Normal glucose tolerance

          3. Normal blood pressure

          4. Normal lipid profile

          5. Free of any causes of neuropathy as described above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Nursing mothers or pregnant women (excluded by a positive pregnancy test).

          2. Patients with a history of previous kidney, pancreas or cardiac transplantation.

          3. Patients with a past history of neuropathy (independent of diabetes), or with a
             disease known to be associated with neuropathy (e.g. end stage renal disease,
             hepatitis C, systemic lupus erythematosus).

          4. Participation in an experimental medication trial within 3 months of starting the
             study.

          5. Subjects with implantable cardioverter defibrillators and other devices that would
             preclude MRI scanning.

          6. Subjects who are unable or unwilling to comply with the experimental protocol.
