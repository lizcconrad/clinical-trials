  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is associated with significant cognitive and functional deficits. As patients
      with schizophrenia grow older, the impact of these deficits at a personal and public health
      level is likely to increase. Cognitive Behavioral and Social Skills Training (CBSST) is a
      recently developed group therapy that increased the frequency of social activities among
      middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. It also increased cognitive insight, a measure of
      the ability to reduce confidence in aberrant beliefs. To date, CBSST has not been studied in
      late-life schizophrenia. In addition, its impact on medications management, an instrumental
      function that is particularly salient in late life, and its interactions with cognition are
      largely unknown. Thus, we propose to study the efficacy of CBSST in improving social skills
      and medications management in patients with late-life schizophrenia, and to study the
      interactions between the patients' cognitive characteristics and their response to CBSST.

      Previous studies show that cognitive deficits are strong predictors of response to CBSST.
      Cognitive Remediation Treatments (CRTs) have been shown to improve cognition in patients with
      schizophrenia especially when combined with psychosocial interventions that focus on function
      such as CBSST. Thus, we also propose to assess the tolerability and impact of CRT on patients
      with late-life schizophrenia.

      Eighty subjects will be randomized into 2 arms, CBSST Group and Treatment as Usual Group.
      Both Arms will run for a total of 52 weeks. The CBSST Group will attend 2-hour weekly
      sessions for 9 months and attend follow up assessments every 4 months. The Treatment as Usual
      Group will continue with their normal psychiatric treatment as usual and also attend follow
      up assessments every 4 months. After subjects in the Treatment as Usual Arm finish, they will
      continue on to the CBSST Group arm.

      After the completion of the CBSST Group Arm, 24 subjects who are willing to consent to CRT
      will continue with an additional 2-hour weekly session of Cognitive Remediation Treatment for
      8 weeks.

    <description>Patients will receive their regular treatment for 24 weeks without CBSST. TAU consists of the standard care that patients receive, including routine visits and contacts with their physicians and clinicians. However, in addition to the standard of care, subjects receiving TAU will have 24 weekly 60-minute non-structured meetings, including half-hour lunch break, to control for non-specific factors associated with group therapy.</description>
