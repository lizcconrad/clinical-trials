  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pruritus is an essential feature for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and may play an
      important part in disease progression. Itching has a significant impact on the quality of
      life of AD sufferers, in particular night-time itching leading to sleep disturbance and
      subsequent poor daytime performance.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether SRD174 Cream is a safe and effective
      therapy for moderate to severe pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females aged 18 years and over moderate to severe AD pruritus

          -  Written signed and dated informed consent

          -  Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically relevant abnormalities

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with active and pruritic AD covering a body surface area (BSA) &gt; 20%

          -  Subject with severe AD defined as an IGA score of 4

          -  Subject with current or recurrent skin disease (except AD) that could affect the site
             of application of action, absorption or disposition of the investigational product, or
             clinical, laboratory assessments.

          -  Subjects with unstable or uncontrolled medical conditions that could require intensive
             treatment during the course of the study.

          -  Subject with known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the Investigational
             products or any of the stated ingredients.

          -  Subject who has a medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or investigational product
             administration or may interfere with interpretation of trial results and, in the
             judgment if the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this
             trial.
