    <measure>Time-weighted SPID30</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>time-weighted SPID30 is the sum of the pain intensity difference (PID) over the 30 minute time period. A pain intensity score of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain) is recorded at pre-dose, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post-dose. The pain score at each assessment time through 30 minutes is subtracted from the baseline pain score to provide the total sum score or SPID30. A higher SPID30 is better and indicates a reduction in pain intensity compared to the baseline score.</description>

    <description>During the Titration Phase, patients titrated to the effective dosage of sublingual sufentanil NanoTab™(20, 30, 40, 60 or 80 mcg). One sublingual sufentanil NanoTab™ was taken as needed for breakthrough pain.
During the Double-Blind Phase, patients were then randomized to one of six treatment sequences, each of which included seven active doses of sublingual sufentanil (dosage determined in Titration Phase) and three placebo doses taken in random order. One NanoTab™ was taken as needed for breakthrough pain.</description>

             malignancy.

          2. Patients must have sufficient pain to require at least the equivalent of 60 mg/day
             oral morphine, at least 25 mcg/hr transdermal fentanyl, at least 30 mg/day oxycodone,
             at least 8 mg/day oral hydromorphone for a week or longer.

          3. Patient is experiencing 1 - 4 episodes of cancer breakthrough pain per day, on average
             but not necessarily every day, requiring use of an additional opioid analgesic.

          4. Patient has a life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          5. Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
             rating &lt; 2.

          6. Patient must be able to provide reliable documentation of pain intensity, pain relief,
             use of rescue medication, and global evaluation of treatment personally or with the
             help of a caregiver.

          7. Patient must be able to enter simple commands on a Palm Pilot device, personally or

        <title>Time-weighted SPID30</title>
        <description>time-weighted SPID30 is the sum of the pain intensity difference (PID) over the 30 minute time period. A pain intensity score of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worse possible pain) is recorded at pre-dose, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post-dose. The pain score at each assessment time through 30 minutes is subtracted from the baseline pain score to provide the total sum score or SPID30. A higher SPID30 is better and indicates a reduction in pain intensity compared to the baseline score.</description>
