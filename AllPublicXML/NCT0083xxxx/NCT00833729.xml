      To describe the response of etanercept after adalimumab has failed to produce a satisfactory
      response in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A total of 10 patients with moderate to
      severe psoriasis who are currently using adalimumab for at least 12 weeks but have a PGA of
      mild or worse will be transitioned to etanercept 50 mg twice weekly (BIW) for 12 wks followed
      by a dose reduction to 50mg once weekly (OW) for an additional 12 weeks.

             administered for at least 3 consecutive months prior to screening, with no treatment
             interruptions exceeding 14 days, at doses of 40 mg every other week (eow) after a
             loading of 80mg sc. The last dose of adalimumab must be greater than 11 days and less
             than 17 days before the first dose of etanercept.

          -  Subject is judged to be in generally good health as determined by the Investigator

             examination performed at screening.

          -  Subject must be able to self-administer or has a qualified designee who can reliably
             administer SC injections.

             the requirements of this study protocol.

          -  Subject has a negative PPD test at within 6 months of screening.

          -  Subject receives or requires:

          -  UVB phototherapy, (other than narrow-band UVB), excessive sun exposure or the use of
             tanning booths within 14 days prior to Baseline visit.

          -  PUVA phototherapy within 14 days prior to Baseline visit.

          -  Systemic non-biologic therapies for psoriasis within 30 days prior to Baseline visit.

          -  High potentcy topical steroids during the study period

          -  Received any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half lives prior to Baseline
             (whichever is longer), or within a duration of its known pharmacological activity.

          -  Subject has other active skin diseases or skin infections (bacterial, fungal, viral or
             parasitic) that may interfere with evaluation of psoriasis.

          -  Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics, IV antivirals, or

          -  History of moderate to severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV), recent
             cerebrovascular accident and any other condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would put the subject at risk by participation in the protocol.

          -  History of CNS demyelinating disease or neurologic symptoms suggestive of CNS
             demyelinating disease.

          -  History of listeriosis, histoplasmosis, chronic or active Hepatitis B infection, human
