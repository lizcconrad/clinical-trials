    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 study of TAK 701 in adult
      patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. This study will be the first to
      administer TAK 701 to humans. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety
      profile, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics profile of TAK-701.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged 18 years or older.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

          3. Diagnosis of a nonhematologic malignancy for which standard curative or lifeprolonging
             treatment does not exist or is no longer effective.

          4. Radiographically or clinically evaluable tumor; however, measurable disease is not
             required for participation in this study (eg, patients with pleural effusion or
             ascites).

          5. Female patients who:

               -  Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or

               -  Are surgically sterile, or

               -  If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice 2 effective methods of
                  contraception, at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent
                  form through 3 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely
                  abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

             Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who:

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study drug
                  treatment period and through 3 months after the last dose of TAK-701, or

               -  Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          6. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who are lactating or have a positive serum pregnancy test during the
             screening period.

          2. Major surgery within 14 days before the first dose of TAK-701 or any
             planned/anticipated surgery during the study period.

          3. Positive test for Hepatitis B or C infection.

          4. Active alcohol abuse

          5. Active infection requiring systemic therapy, or other serious infection.

          6. Antineoplastic therapy (including unconjugated therapeutic antibodies and toxin
             immunoconjugates) or any experimental therapy within 21 days before the first dose of
             TAK-701.

          7. Radiotherapy within 21 days before the first dose of TAK-701.

          8. Nitrosoureas or mitomycin-C within 6 weeks before the first dose of TAK-701.

          9. Autologous stem cell transplant within 3 months before the first dose of TAK-701, or
             prior allogeneic stem cell transplant at any time.

         10. Any prior exposure to anti-HGF therapy (eg, AMG-102, AV-299).

         11. The patient has symptomatic brain metastasis.

         12. Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1,500/mm3; platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3.

         13. Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 50mL/minute

         14. Any of the following clinical laboratory results during screening (ie, within 28 days
             before the first dose of TAK-701):

               -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range (ULN).

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 times
                  the ULN. AST and ALT may be elevated up to 5 times the ULN if their elevation can
                  be reasonably ascribed to the presence of metastatic disease to liver and/or to
                  bone.

         15. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.

         16. Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.

         17. Uncontrolled cardiovascular condition, including ongoing cardiac arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure, angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.

         18. Patients having QTc &gt; 470 msec on a 12-lead ECG obtained within 28 days before first
             study drug administration.

         19. Presence of serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer or bone fracture.
