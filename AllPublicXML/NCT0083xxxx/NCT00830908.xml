  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether the stimulation of vascularization and cellular
      metabolism on the scalp by use of the HairMax LaserComb will produce improvement in the
      condition of scalp seborrheic dermatitis.

      This is an open label pilot study to evaluate the effects of the low-level laser light on
      seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. Dandruff assessment scores for scalps with seborrheic
      dermatitis will be assessed at baseline with monthly evaluations during treatment, until
      final assessment at end of treatment at week 12.

      The trial will involve 10 patients aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of seborrheic
      dermatitis. Patients will use the LaserComb device three times per week on non-consecutive
      days for 12 weeks. No other seborrheic dermatitis products will be used during treatment. The
      investigator will conduct measurements of dandruff at each study visit, as a measure of
      efficacy.

      The trial consists of 4-5 study visits (screening/baseline, week 4, week 8 and week 12).
      Dandruff evaluation and adverse event assessments will be performed at each visit.

      Safety analysis will be assessed based on the reports of adverse events during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp

          -  PGA of 2 (mild) or greater at baseline

          -  TDSS score at baseline of 2 or greater, for both scaling and inflammation

          -  Must agree to use of non-medicated shampoos during study period; must refrain from use
             of other medicated scalp products during the trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any topical or oral products that would affect assessment of the scalp SD
             condition, in the opinion of the primary investigator, within the following periods
             prior to baseline:

               -  Medicated shampoos within 2 weeks of baseline

               -  Topical scalp medications within 2 weeks of baseline

               -  Oral medications affecting the scalp within 4 weeks of baseline

               -  Other medications determined by the investigator to potentially affect the
                  assessment of SD = washout to be determined by the investigator, as appropriate
                  to the known medication properties

          -  Any current or past medical condition, including active dermatitis or any other
             dermatological condition, which might interfere with assessment of dandruff

          -  Patients using any medications that may increase photosensitivity, and thus pose a
             risk when undergoing LaserComb therapy

          -  Patients with known adverse reactions, allergy or hypersensitivity to laser light
             components/light sensitivity conditions

          -  Patients who have received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study
             entry.
