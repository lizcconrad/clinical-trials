      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide in adult
      patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. All patients
      will receive lenalidomide per oral daily (starting dose is 25 mg/d). Cohorts of 3 patients
      (to be expanded up to 6 if 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed among the first 3
      patients) will be sequentially allotted to progressively higher dose levels of lenalidomide
      on the basis of the presence and severity of lenalidomide-related toxicity or lenalidomide
      related serious adverse reactions encountered in the first cycle. For the purpose of this
      study, patients' enrollment will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be
      determined and characterized.

             ineligible for intensive treatment. Ineligibility for intensive treatment has to be
             documented within the case report forms (Medical/Oncologic History).

          -  Age &gt; 60 years relapsed/refractory AML in medically fit patients and newly diagnosed
             AML (including de novo, s- AML,t-AML) in medically unfit patients

          -  Age 18-60 years: second or higher relapse of AML, not eligible for intensive therapy

          -  WBC &lt;20x109/l, pretreatment with hydroxyurea is allowed to lower WBC

          -  Prior chemo-immunotherapy and other study-medications must have been completed 2 weeks
             before study treatment start. Treatment with hydroxyureas should be discontinued 1 day
             before initiating dosing with lenalidomide

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits,treatment plan, laboratory
             tests and other study procedures

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must agree to use two reliable forms of
             contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from - FCBP must have
             two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to starting
             study drug.

             childbearing potential while participating in the study and for at least 28 days
             following discontinuation from the study even if he has undergone a successful
             vasectomy.

             of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient
