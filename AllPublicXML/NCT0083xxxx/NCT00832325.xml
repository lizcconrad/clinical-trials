  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how the illness has affected the identity
      and what needs the survivor may have. We hope that this information will help us provide
      better care to future adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current age greater than and including 15 and up to and including 25 years of age at
             time of consent

          -  Diagnosis of a first cancer &gt; or = to 14 and up to and including 21 years of age

          -  At least 6 months post-treatment according to participant's self-report.

          -  Able to provide informed consent (or parent or legal guardian consent and participant
             assent for those participants under 18 years of age)

          -  Able to speak English. This inclusion criterion is included because study assessments
             were designed and validated in English and many of them are not currently available in
             other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require
             reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures. Therefore, participants
             must be able to communicate in English to complete the assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Will exclude survivors with severe cognitive impairment that precludes them from being
             able to give information consent and/or complete the questionnaires.
