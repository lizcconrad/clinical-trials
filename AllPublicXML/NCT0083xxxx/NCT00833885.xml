    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators will try to assess the tolerability and measurability of
      the efficacy of non pharmaceutical measures to prevent seasonal influenza in individual
      households. Households with an identified index case of influenza will be randomised into one
      of three intervention arms: 1. group, where the household will receive general information
      about transmission of influenza virus and means to prevent it (Controls); 2. group, which
      will receive surgical masks and be asked to wear them whenever they are in close contact with
      the index case or other persons of the household that became ill during the observation
      period; 3. group, which will be given and asked to wear surgical masks as well as to execute
      intensified hand hygiene.

      In addition to assessing the secondary attack rate as our primary outcome measure, the
      investigators will also try to evaluate compliance to those interventions by questionnaires.
