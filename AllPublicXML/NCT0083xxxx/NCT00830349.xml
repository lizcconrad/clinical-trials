             least 6 months ago.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects to whom any of the following applies will be excluded from the study:

             cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, immunologic, psychiatric or metabolic disease.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality found during medical screening.

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical subinvestigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.

          -  Abnormal laboratory tests judged clinically significant.

          -  Subjects who do not tolerate venipuncture.

          -  Positive urine drug screen at screening.

          -  Subjects who use tobacco in any form will not be eligible to participate in this
             study. Three months abstinence before screening is required.

          -  Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV at screening.

          -  ECG abnormalities (clinically significant) (PR interval greater than 225 msec or QTc
             segment greater than 450 msec) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure
             lower than 100 or over 160 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure lower than 60 or over 96;
             or heart rate less than 60 bpm) at screening.

          -  History of cardiac disease or family history of cardiac disease.

          -  Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the
             medical subinvestigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in this study.

          -  History of allergic reactions to risperidone.

          -  Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism, use of an
             investigational drug or participation on an investigation study within 30 days prior
             to the administration of the study medication.

          -  Use of prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration of study
             medication or over-the-counter products within 7 days prior to administration of study
