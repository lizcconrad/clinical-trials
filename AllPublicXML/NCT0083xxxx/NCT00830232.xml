      The goal of the proposed study is to contrast the relative efficacy of closed-cell stents
      versus open-cell stents in preventing periprocedural cerebral embolization in high-risk
      patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis undergoing carotid
      artery stenting (CAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is responsible for more than 10% of all deaths and much severe disability in developed
      countries. In the United States, approximately 600,000 new strokes are reported annually, of
      which 150,000 are fatal, and more than 4,000,000 surviving stroke victims are affected by
      significant disability. Seventy-five percent of strokes occur in the distribution of the
      carotid arteries and are considered of a thromboembolic etiology, most of which originate in
      carotid lesions. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) with cerebral embolic protection is currently
      the preferred treatment of carotid stenosis in high risk surgical patients, i.e., those with
      significant comorbidities or a hostile neck from previous surgical procedures or radiation.
      Although several predictors of adverse outcomes after CAS have been identified, the effects
      of device characteristics, including stent design, on neurologic adverse events have not been
      established.

      The proposed study will be a randomized prospective controlled trial designed to test the
      hypothesis that the implantation of closed-cell stents for carotid lesions in high-risk
      patients will be associated with a reduced perioperative cerebral microembolization, as
      detected by transcranial Doppler and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the
      brain, and reduced 30-day stroke, myocardial infarction, and death rates when compared with
      the implantation of open-cell stents.

    <measure>Transcranial Doppler Counts of Micro-embolic Signals in the Ipsilateral Middle Cerebral Artery.</measure>
    <time_frame>First 24 hours after implantation of carotid stent</time_frame>
    <description>Bilateral transcranial Doppler scan monitoring of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries was performed using a PMD150-ST3 digital transcranial Doppler pulsed-wave ultrasound scan system (Spencer Technologies, Seattle, Wash) with 2-MHz probes located over the temporal bones above the zygomatic arch. Isolated microembolic signals (MES) were identified from Doppler spectras according to the criteria given by the Consensus Committee of the Ninth International Cerebral Hemodynamic Symposium. If the number of MES was too high to be counted separately, heartbeats with microemboli were counted as microembolic showers. To avoid confusion, MES detected during contrast injection were excluded from the analysis. For analysis purposes, the procedure was divided into the following phases: lesion crossing, filter deployment, IVUS examination, predilation, stent deployment, postdilatation (when applicable), and filter removal.</description>

          <title>Transcranial Doppler Counts of Micro-embolic Signals in the Ipsilateral Middle Cerebral Artery.</title>
          <description>Bilateral transcranial Doppler scan monitoring of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries was performed using a PMD150-ST3 digital transcranial Doppler pulsed-wave ultrasound scan system (Spencer Technologies, Seattle, Wash) with 2-MHz probes located over the temporal bones above the zygomatic arch. Isolated microembolic signals (MES) were identified from Doppler spectras according to the criteria given by the Consensus Committee of the Ninth International Cerebral Hemodynamic Symposium. If the number of MES was too high to be counted separately, heartbeats with microemboli were counted as microembolic showers. To avoid confusion, MES detected during contrast injection were excluded from the analysis. For analysis purposes, the procedure was divided into the following phases: lesion crossing, filter deployment, IVUS examination, predilation, stent deployment, postdilatation (when applicable), and filter removal.</description>
