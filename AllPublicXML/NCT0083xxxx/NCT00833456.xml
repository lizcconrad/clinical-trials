      The purpose of the study is to monitor the general functional changes among patients with
      schizophrenia, treated with atypical antipsychotics dosed once daily for a period of 6
      months.The primary study objective is to compare general functioning of patients with
      schizophrenia treated with Seroquel SR between baseline and the last study visit. The
      secondary study objectives are to compare general functioning of patients with schizophrenia
      treated with other atypical antipsychotic medicinal products administered once daily between
