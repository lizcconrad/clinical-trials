  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of near-infrared fluorescence
      imaging in subjects with acquired or hereditary lymphedema, in subjects with lipidema and
      other lymphovascular disorders and in normal health subjects; in order to attempt to
      correlate imaging phenotype(s) with genotype(s).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no method to assess lymphatic function in persons with acquired
      (developed following surgery or trauma) lymphedema, hereditary lymphedema or other
      lympho-vascular disorders. The causes of these disorders, and the means to distinguish
      between them, is not available from existing diagnostics. A method to monitor lymphatic
      function could assist in the development of new therapies, the prediction of a patient's
      susceptibility to develop these disorders, and the evaluation of patient's conditions or
      responses to therapy and treatment. In this Phase I/II trial, we inject Indocyanine Green
      (ICG) off-label as a lymph contrast agent and use a custom designed fluorescence imager to
      conduct near-infrared fluorescence imaging to dynamically follow lymphatic trafficking in
      subjects. Blood is also collected for DNA analysis. The resulting images are analyzed, and
      the phenotypes observed in both normal and diseased subjects are used to correlate to
      mutations of specific genes reported to be associated with lymphatic development.

        Inclusion Criteria for Participation in NIRFLI with ICG (Group 1):

          1. Negative urine pregnancy test within 36 hours prior to study drug administration, if
             female of childbearing potential.

          2. Females must complete the Female Enrollment Form. Those subjects of childbearing
             potential must agree to use one of the medically accepted methods of contraception
             listed on the form for a period of one month following the study. Female subjects of
             non-childbearing potential, defined as physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             must meet the criteria listed on the Female Enrollment form, but are not restricted to
             the use of contraception following study participation.

             up to a total of 60 minutes.
