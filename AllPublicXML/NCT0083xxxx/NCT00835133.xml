      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood and tissue from family members of patients
      with cancer to test in the laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is collecting blood and tissue samples from family members of
      patients with pancreatic disease, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To collect clinical history, family history, and blood and/or tissue samples from family
           members of patients diagnosed with pancreatic diseases, pancreatic cancer, or melanoma.

        -  To learn whether inherited factors increase the risk of pancreatic diseases, pancreatic
           cancer, or other cancers.

      OUTLINE: Study participants undergo collection of blood and/or tissue samples as well as
      survey data for inclusion in a familial data and tissue registry. Participants complete two
      baseline surveys regarding their personal, family, health, and environmental exposure
      histories and regarding their opinions on cancer and cancer screening. Patients also complete
      a follow-up survey at 1 year and undergo review of their medical records.
