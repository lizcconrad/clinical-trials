      The purpose of this study is to better understand why some vein bypass grafts develop
      narrowing. Evidence suggests that there is a relationship between inflammatory markers in the
      blood and the narrowing that occurs in blood vessels. In this study, we will look at
      inflammatory markers in the blood and how well the vein graft functions.
