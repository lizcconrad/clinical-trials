  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective study that investigates only daily practice. The
      prescription of anti-cancer medicine is separated from the decision to include the patient in
      this study. In addition, the assignment of the patient to a particular therapy or therapeutic
      strategy is not decided in advance by this study protocol, but falls within current practice.

      The patient who fulfils eligible criteria will be enrolled when starts to receive the
      second-line EGFR-TKI therapy. The frequency of tumor response evaluation by RECIST criteria
      follows the investigator's discretion as daily practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC of adeno histology

          -  Locally progressed or metastasized on or after first-line chemotherapy. The imaging
