  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles at steady-state of the
      test product, Tramadol HCl Once-A-Day (OAD) 200 mg tablets and the reference product,
      Tramadol HCl 50 mg (IR) tablets (Ortho-McNeil Ultram®). For this purpose, the extent of
      absorption of tramadol and formation of O-desmethyltramadol (measures of systemic exposure)
      after multiple administration of 50 mg 6-hourly at 07:30, 13:30, 19:30 and 01:30 (reference
      product) and 200 mg 24-hourly at 07:30 (test product), were compared.

             consider a disqualification for participation in the study

             (e.g., AST, ALT) &gt; 3 times the upper boundary of the normal range.
