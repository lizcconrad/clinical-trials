    <measure>Change From Baseline for Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Pain Scores at Endpoint-LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) Relative to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 15 or study discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in mean NRS-Pain scores at endpoint-LOCF. Daily pain scores were assessed on an 11-point numerical rating scale &lt;(NRS)-Pain&gt; ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 15 or study discontinuation</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC was defined as participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale; range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Change was defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse) , 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) on the scale.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were administered placebo tablet in single blind manner and evaluated for the inclusion/exclusion criteria during the 1-week screening phase. Participants who demonstrated a high response to placebo, i.e., &lt;=30% decrease on the VAS, were discontinued from the study at the end of the screening phase.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Pregabalin was administered twice a day at the starting dose of 150 mg/day in the first week and escalated to 300 mg/day at the end of Week 1. Pregabalin dose was titrated to 450 mg/day at the end of Week 2 based on the participant’s individual response and tolerability to pregabalin. Treatment period was 15 weeks that consisted of 3-week dose optimization phase and 12-week fixed dose phase.</description>

Consists of 9-item overall sleep problems index (length of time to fall asleep, how many hours of sleep each night during past 4 weeks); The MOS Sleep Disturbance subscales rated 1 (all the time) to 6 (none of the time). Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score) divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100; total score range = 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater intensity of sleep disturbance. Change = mean scores at observation minus mean scores at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale at Endpoint- Awaken Short of Breath or With a Headache</title>
        <description>MOS: participant-rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Consists of 9-item overall sleep problems index (length of time to fall asleep, how many hours of sleep each night during past 4 weeks); The MOS Awaken Short of Breath or With a Headache subscales rated 1 (all the time) to 6 (none of the time). Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score) divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100; total score range = 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater intensity of the symptom. Change = mean scores at observation minus mean scores at baseline.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 postbaseline pain score on study medication. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale at Endpoint- Overall Sleep Problems Index</title>
        <description>MOS: participant-rated questionnaire to assess sleep quality and quantity. Consists of 9-item overall sleep problems index (length of time to fall asleep, how many hours of sleep each night during past 4 weeks); The MOS Overall Sleep Problems Index subscales rated 1 (all the time) to 6 (none of the time). Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score) divided by possible raw score range multiplied by 100; total score range = 0 to 100. A higher score indicates greater intensity of overall sleep problems. Change = mean scores at observation minus mean scores at baseline.</description>

        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication and had at least 1 postbaseline pain score on study medication. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used.</population>

        <description>FIQ is a 20-item patient-reported outcome instrument designed to assess health status, progress, and outcomes in patients with fibromyalgia (10 subscales; 11 questions). Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more impairment. Change = mean FIQ scores at observation minus mean scores at baseline.</description>
