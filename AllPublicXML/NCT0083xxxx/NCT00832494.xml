  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to test the addition of DMXAA (now known as ASA404) to carboplatin
      and paclitaxel in patients with NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>

      The study was designed to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DMXAA in
      combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced and metastatic
      (Stage IIIb and IV) non-small cell lung cancer. The phase Ib part of the study evaluated dose
      levels of DMXAA at 600 mg/m2, 1200 mg/m2 and 1800 mg/m2. In the phase II part of the study,
      patients were randomized to receive carboplatin and paclitaxel alone or in combination with
      ASA404 1200 mg/m2. An additional single-arm study was undertaken to evaluate further patients
      at the 1800 mg/m2 dose level.

             palliative) within the previous 4 weeks.

          2. A known history of hypersensitivity to carboplatin, paclitaxel or any of their
