      BEADI is a dissemination trial, on standards of care of premature babies. The main objective
      of BEADI is to assess whether an innovative 'active' strategy for the dissemination of
      neonatal information (evidence reviews, interactive training workshop, benchmarking and
      feedback, and ongoing support) is more likely to lead to changes in policy and practice than
      the traditional (more passive) forms of dissemination in English neonatal units.

      BEADI will focus on three areas of neonatal care for premature (22+0 to 26+6 weeks'
      gestation) babies born in England: timing of surfactant therapy, staffing for resuscitation
      at delivery, and temperature control (in line with the main Project 27/28 findings ).
      However, the approach is applicable to a wide variety of clinical policies and practice.

      The BEADI study has been granted ethical approval by MREC to use a subset of data collected
      by EPICure2 up until 31st December 2006 (pre-intervention data). For the post-intervention
      data, ethical approval has been granted for CEMACH to continue data collection against the
      three clinical areas using a subset of data items captured in the PN:E2 form, for the three
      month period between 1st January - 31st March 2007. Local research and development
      departments of each trust have also been contacted.
