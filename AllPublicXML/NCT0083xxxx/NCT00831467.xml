    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy of prostate cancer is a promising approach for the treatment of advanced or
      recurrent forms of prostate cancer. Recently, immunotherapy of prostate cancer has been
      facilitated by the identification of a number of prostate specific antigens that are
      expressed in healthy and tumor prostate tissues. For prostatectomized patients, such antigens
      offer ideal targets for immunotherapy as they are only present in tumor but not in healthy
      tissue. The use of prostate specific antigens in a cancer vaccine is one attractive option
      for cancer immunotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             to trial participation

          -  Male and age ≥ 18 years (Phase I and II) and ≤ 75 years (Phase II only)

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason Score
             available

          -  Patients must have been treated with hormonal therapy and may have been treated with
             surgery and/ or radiation therapy

          -  Progressive disease as defined by hormone-refractoriness and rise in PSA:

        Hormone-refractoriness: Defined by a rise in PSA and/or RECIST-based progression of
        evaluable lesions, and/or increased number of hotspots on a bone scan, while the patient
        has a castrated level of testosterone. This castrated level may have been obtained by
        orchiectomy, or LH-RH analog ± antiandrogen. Antiandrogen must be discontinued for at least
        4 weeks before study entry to exclude a withdrawal effect.

        Rise in PSA: Defined by a rise in PSA levels at three consecutive time points (PSA rise
        over nadir, separated by &gt; 1 week, PCWG2 criteria)

          -  Presence of metastatic disease is acceptable

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 to 1

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 12 months as assessed by the investigator

          -  Adequate organ function :

        Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/µL; Platelet count ≥ 100000/µL Hepatic: AST and ALT ≤ 2.5
        times upper limit of normal (ULN); Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN Renal: Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or
        creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min

          -  Concomitant LH-RH therapy continuation is acceptable

          -  May have had local palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis involving less than 25%
             of bone marrow

          -  Patients requiring bisphosphonates at the time of registration into the trial are
             eligible (therapy initiated at least 28 days prior to first study treatment
             administration) and must be continued at a constant level during the study period.

          -  Patients of child-producing potential must agree to use contraception while enrolled
             in the study and for one month after the last immunization.
