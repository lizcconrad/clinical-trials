        <title>CLCR After Administration of a Single Oral Dose of 20 mg of MK-0941 to Participants With Moderate Renal Insufficiency Versus Matched Controls</title>
        <description>CICR was evaluated among participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and moderate renal insufficiency that received 20 mg of MK-0941 versus controls with normal renal function that received 20 mg of MK-0941. Moderate renal insufficiency was defined as a 24-hour CLCR of 30 to 50 mL/min/1.73m^2.</description>
