      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an effect on the eye pressure from
      extreme weight loss by bariatric procedures. The hypothesis is that excess fat in the orbit
      of the eye compresses on the outflow system, which causes an elevated eye pressure. This can
      have many consequences, including the risk for glaucoma. We hope to establish if there is an
      effect between eye pressure and weight.

        Patients who are included in this study will have been evaluated for bariatric surgery and
        will meet the current eligibility requirements for bariatric surgery. These requirements
        include that the patient must have failed dietary therapy and have a BMI(body mass index)
        greater than 40 kg/m2 without associated comorbidities or have a BMI greater than 35 kg/m2
        with associated comorbidities. Eleven subjects who will be evaluated for bariatric surgery
        but choose not to undergo the surgery will be recruited to serve as controls and to verify
        the changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) are due to the weight loss. It is expected that
        the IOP of the control patients will be relatively stable, assuming the patients will not
        have any other surgery or intervention which could affect the IOP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of systemic steroids

          -  Any systemic medication which is unstable and can affect IOP

          -  History or evidence of glaucoma

          -  Any ocular trauma or ocular surgery

          -  Outside normal range of corneal thickness (500-600 microns)

          -  Unable to follow-up for 3 years

          -  Participating in any investigational device or medication study within 30 days of
