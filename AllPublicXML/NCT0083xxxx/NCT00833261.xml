      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill
      tumor cells. Giving cetuximab and cisplatin together with radiation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cetuximab and cisplatin together
      with radiation therapy works in treating patients with recurrent head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate whether treatment with cetuximab, cisplatin, and intensity-modulated
           radiotherapy improves the overall survival of patients with recurrent squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the progression-free survival and local-regional progression in these
           patients.

        -  To identify and estimate the incidence rate of acute and late toxicities associated with
           this treatment regimen.

        -  To determine the pattern of disease progression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 60-120 minutes once weekly in weeks 1-7. Patients also
      receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes once weekly and undergo intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      once daily 5 days a week in weeks 2-7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
