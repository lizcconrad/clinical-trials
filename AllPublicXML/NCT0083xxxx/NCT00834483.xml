  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barbed sutures offer several potential advantages in layered wound closure of hip and knee
      replacement surgeries. It use is gaining increased acceptance across many of the other
      surgical disciplines at this time. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of Quill
      as part of our layered closure compared to using our traditional sutures. The study timeline
      begins at the time of the surgical procedure and continues through the routine follow-up of
      total joint replacements at 2, 6, and 12 weeks, and will conclude at the six month
      post-operative office visit.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of wound closure in primary hip and knee
           replacements using a bidirectional barbed suture (knotless) compared to a traditional
           layered (vicryl) wound closure.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Establish the all around (intra-operative and post-operative) cost-savings potential in
           using a knotless wound closure compared to that of a layered vicryl closure (our
           standard suture protocol).

        -  Assess the overall cosmesis of the wound/scar as well as perceived presence of
           subcutaneous surgical knots, when using the knotless wound closure versus our
           traditional layered suture closure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed a prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of using a
      bidirectional barbed suture compared with traditional sutures in the deep closure of primary
      total hip (25) and knee (35) arthroplasties. Complications, time to closure, and length of
      surgery were evaluated. Closure was noted to be significantly faster (9.3 vs 13.6 minutes, P
      b .005) in the barbed suture group. Wound-related complications were similar (3 cases) in
      both groups at 3-month follow-up. Although this study supports the use of barbed technology
      as a functionally comparable and more efficient modality of wound closure with the potential
      for costs savings based on reduced operative time, the cost-effectiveness of its adoption is
      institution dependent and will rely on the optimization of all other perioperative factors.

    <measure>Cost-analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Cost savings included the material costs and then we factored in the time savings in the OR. The OR time was based upon the average cost per minute to work in one of our ORs</description>

    <measure>Visual Analog Score, Cosmesis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall cosemesis was graded by patient and surgeon. This is based on a 1-6 scale, with a 6 being a perfect score based upon satisfaction with the wound cosmesis.
1 is an unacceptable or poor perspective in regards to wound cosmesis.</description>

        <title>Closure Time</title>
        <description>We performed a prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of using a bidirectional barbed suture compared with traditional sutures in the deep closure of primary total hip (25) and knee (35) arthroplasties. Complications, time to closure, and length of surgery were evaluated.</description>
        <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
        <population>A power analysis was performed based on mean closure times by the 2 surgeons and determined that a sample size of 23 patients in each group would provide 90% power to detect a 50% difference in closure time.

          <description>We performed a prospective, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of using a bidirectional barbed suture compared with traditional sutures in the deep closure of primary total hip (25) and knee (35) arthroplasties. Complications, time to closure, and length of surgery were evaluated.</description>
