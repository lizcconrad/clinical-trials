      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of measuring body composition by air
      displacement plethysmography (ADP) in rapidly growing, medically stable late gestation [32-35
      weeks post-menstrual age (PMA)] premature infants.

      1. To assess the feasibility of measuring body fat deposition by ADP in medically stable
           late gestation (32-35 weeks), premature infants during a period of rapid postnatal
           growth.

        2. To test the relationship between %BF by ADP to %BF by DXA, as well as characterize the
           relationship between these fat measures with bone measures by quantitative ultrasound
           and serum levels of insulin, IGF-1, IGF binding proteins, adiponectin and leptin.

        3. To perform inter- and intra-rater testing of anthropometric, ultrasound, and ADP
           measurements.

        4. Compare growth, body composition and bone strength between infants born preterm to
           infants born full term.
