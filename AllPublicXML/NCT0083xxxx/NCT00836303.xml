  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effectiveness of a culturally-responsive intervention to increase
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening among Latino immigrants in a primary care clinic setting of
      a large municipal Hospital in New York City. propose a randomized, control trial to determine
      if a video-based intervention, that educates and activates the patient and the provider via
      the patient, will increase rates of CRC screening referrals compared to a control group.

      Colorectal cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers among the general population, as
      well as in the Latino population, in the United States. There are serious disparities in CRC
      screening rates between different races and socio-demographic populations (American Cancer
      Society: Colorectal Cancer Facts and Figures - Special Edition 2005). Latino immigrants are
      one of the populations most affected by the lack of screening, reducing their relative
      benefit from preventive CRC services. This study will use a modified version of an
      intervention developed and studied by Pignone (11), with changes made to be tailored
      specifically to the Latino immigrant population. The outcomes measured will include referral
      for CRC screening and adherence with providers' referrals. In addition, the investigators
      will measure screening rates for other cancer screening tests to assess if the CRC
      intervention displaces or facilitates other cancer screening. A sample of Latino immigrants
      seeking care at the primary care clinic of Bellevue Hospital will be accrued through a
      process of consecutive sampling until reaching the proposed sample size of 101 patients in
      each group (alpha 0.05 and power of 80%). To analyze the effectiveness of the intervention
      the investigators will use the z-test and will report the difference in proportion between
      the intervention and the control group with a 95% CI, adjusting for intra-class correlations
      and covariates. A repeated measurement analysis with logistic regression will be used to
      examine the effects of covariates.

    <description>Research assistants showed intervention patients a colorectal cancer educational video in Spanish on a portable personal digital video display device while the patients were waiting for their visit. The 11-minute video was developed by the National Alliance for Hispanic Health and was accompanied by a brochure with key information from the video {http://www.hispanichealth.org/publication/}. Intervention patients were also given a one-page reminder to hand to their physicians notifying them 1) of their patients' eligibility for colorectal cancer screening, and 2) of their patients' receipt of CRC educational material.</description>
