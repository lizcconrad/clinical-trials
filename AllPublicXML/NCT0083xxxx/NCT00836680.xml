  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the device is supplying sufficient diagnosis
      results of an internal rectal prolapse, of a pelvic floor ptosis and for the determination of
      an interal hernia into the Douglas pouch, as well as to determine the technical success of
      using the device at the patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing diagnosis methods are inadequate, inaccurate, complicated or can only made
      intraoperatively. The new device should enable a fast and easy examination procedure well
      tolerated by the patients. The diagnosis results, received with the device, should assist in
      the accurate selection of patients for operations as well as to avoid any unnecessary
      operations.

    <description>Diagnosis of an internal rectal prolapse:
The device will be introduced and placed into the patient via a proctoscopic procedure. After that the doctor can measure and determine the internal rectal prolapse. After the diagnosis results have been received, the device will be removed from the patient via proctoscopic examination. The whole procedure will take approx. 5 minutes.
An additional X-ray examination procedure with the use of contrast media will be made for the determination of a pelvic floor ptosis and for the determination of an internal hernia into the Douglas pouch.</description>
