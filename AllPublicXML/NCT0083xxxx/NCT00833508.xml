    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of preoperative chemoradiotherapy on exercise capacity
      as measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemoradiotherapy is associated with adverse effects. Patients with certain colorectal
      cancers undergo chemoradiotherapy prior to surgical resection. We intend to assess patient
      exercise capacity before and after chemoradiotherapy to assess whether this deteriorates. If
      there is a deleterious effect, this may affect operative outcome.

    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing involves cycling on an exercise bicycle whilst oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide generation are measured from expired gases. This is used to calculate patient fitness from their peak oxygen consumption and their anaerobic threshold.</description>
