             least 6 months ago.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant illnesses within 4 weeks of the administration of study
             medication.

          -  Clinically significant surgery within 4 weeks prior to the administration of the study
             medication.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormality found during medical screening.

          -  Any reason which, in the opinion of the medical sub-investigator, would preven the
             subject from participating in the study.

          -  Abnormal laboratory tests judged clinically significant.

          -  Positive urine drug screen at screening

          -  Positive testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV at screening.

          -  ECG abnormalities (clinically significant) or vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood
             pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mmHG, or diastolic blood pressure lower than 50 or
             over 90 mmHg; or heart rate less than 50 or over 100 bpm) at screening.

          -  Subjects with BMI ≥ 30.0.

          -  History of significant alcohol abuse within six months of the screening visit or any

             (PCP) and crack) within 1 year of the screening visit.

          -  Any food allergy, intolerance, restriction or special diet that, in the opinion of the
             medical sub-investigator, contraindicates the subject's participation in this study.

          -  History of allergic reactions to sertraline or other related drugs (e.g. fluoxetine
             hydrochloride, fluvoxamine hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride).

          -  Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples of
             inducers: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, glucocorticoids, rifampin/rifabutin;
             examples of inhibitors: antidepressants, cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin,
             ketoconazole, MAO inhibitors, neuroleptics, verapamil, quinidine), use of an
             investigational drug or participation in an investigational study within 30 days prior
             to administration of the study medication.

          -  Use of prescription medication within 14 days prior to administration of study
             medication or over-the-counter products (including natural products, vitamins, garlic

             administration of study medication.

          -  Donation of plasma (500 mL) within 7 days. Donation or loss of whole blood prior to
             administration of the study medication as follows: less than 300 mL of whole blood
             within 30 days or; 300 mL to 500 mL of whole blood within 45 days or; more than 500 mL
             of whole blood within 56 days.

          -  Positive alcohol breath test at screening.

          -  Subjects who have consumed food or beverages containing grapefruit (3.g. fresh,
             canned, or frozen) within 7 days prior to administration of the study medication.

          -  Past history of bipolar affective disorder or other active psychiatric diagnosis.

          -  History of seizures.
