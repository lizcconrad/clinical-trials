  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to thoroughly examine the role of V.A.C. NPWT in the further
      salvage of the diabetic foot once it has undergone partial amputation. To determine this,
      measures of healing, quality of life, and utilization costs associated with this approach
      will be analyzed. KCI believes that information obtained from this study will show V.A.C.
      NPWT can support efforts involving limb salvage of the diabetic foot, helping an effective,
      cost-efficient healthcare solution.

      Primary objective is to compare time required to achieve wound bed preparation between
      Subjects randomized to receive V.A.C. NPWT or MWT. Subjects with ALL the following are
      eligible for clinical trial enrollment:

      Evidence of therapy controlled diabetes, as defined by the American Diabetes Association
      (ADA) of HbA1C less than or equal to 10%, within 90 days of screen or at time of screening,
      greater than or equal to 18 years of age, forefoot amputation less than or equal to 10 days
      old distal to the transmetatarsal level, not extending beyond the Lisfranc joint, receiving
      MWT allowed in the protocol for treatment of the study wound, Wound surface area measured as
      length x width of greater than or equal to 10 cm2, Subject is willing and able to provide
      written informed consent and comply with follow-up visit schedule and maintain a treatment
      diary, Adequate nutrition to enable wound healing as evidenced by a prealbumin level of
      greater than or equal to 16 mg/dl or an albumin level of greater than or equal to 3 g/dl
      within 7 days of screening or at the screening visit, Adequate perfusion in the affected
      extremity as evidenced by grade 1 or 2 PVR waveform as confirmed at screening, Non-pregnant
      female Subject of childbearing potential confirmed negative by serum HCG or surgically
      sterilized or unable to conceive.
