      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a patient's white blood cells (dendritic cells) and a specific
      leukemia antigen (Wilms tumor antigen-1) may induce an effective immune response to kill
      residual leukemic cells and/or prevent leukemia relapse.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the feasibility, safety and efficacy of
      intradermal mRNA-transfected dendritic cell vaccination therapy in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia.

    <textblock>
      Autologous dendritic cell (DC) vaccination is a promising strategy for adjuvant cancer
      therapy in the setting of minimal residual disease (MRD). We performed a phase I/II trial in
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where patients received intradermal injections of
      autologous DC loaded with mRNA coding for the Wilms' tumor protein (WT1). WT1 is highly
      overexpressed in leukemia and the level of WT1 RNA in peripheral blood is a useful biomarker
      for molecular diagnosis en follow-up in the MRD setting. We want to prospectively monitor WT1
      RNA expression in the peripheral blood of vaccinated and non-vaccinated AML patients in order
      to evaluate its predictive value as a biomarker for relapse and to assess the clinical
      efficacy of DC vaccination in acute myeloid leukemia patients. We believe, on the basis of
      already available evidence, that the use of WT1 both as a target for immunotherapy as well as
      a biomarker not holds promise to assess the efficacy of new experimental therapeutic
      interventions such as DC vaccination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Tumor type: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) according to the WHO criteria (ea at least
             20% blasts in the marrow). All FAB subtypes except M3. Patients with Myelodysplastic
             Syndrome, category of Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts (RAEB): RAEB I (WHO:
             medullary blast count ≤ 10% and a peripheral blast count ≤ 5%) and RAEB II (WHO:
             medullary blast count &gt; 10% and/or &gt; 5% peripheral blasts) can be included in the
             study in absence of other non-experimental treatment modalities.

          2. Extent of disease: remission (partial or complete) or smouldering course. Complete
             remission (CR) is defined as no blasts in the peripheral blood and no more than 5%
             blasts in the bone marrow. This definition is related to the hematological remission
             if it is not specified. Partial remission (PR) is defined as a decrease of at least
             50% in the percentage of blasts to 5 to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. Smouldering
             course is defined as a relatively low marrow blast count and slowly progressive
             disease.

          3. Overexpression of WT1 RNA (&gt;50 copies of WT1 per 1000 copies ABL in bone marrow or &gt;2
             copy/1000 copies ABL in peripheral blood) as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR at the
             time of presentation.

          4. Prior treatments : Patients must have received at least one prior antileukemic
             chemotherapeutic regimen and must be more than 1 month past the last treatment and/or
             6 months past allogeneic/autologous stem cell transplantation.

          5. Age: ≥ 18 years

          6. High risk of relapse because of (and/or)

               -  Age &gt; 60 years (if &lt;60 y, no sibling allotransplant donor available)

               -  Poor risk cytogenetic or molecular markers at presentation

               -  Hyperleukocytosis at presentation

               -  Second complete remission after relapse

          7. Performance status: WHO PS grade 0-1 (Appendix B)

          8. Objectively assessable parameters of life expectancy: more than 3 months

          9. Prior and concomitant associated diseases allowed with the exception of underlying
             autoimmune disease and positive serology for HIV/HBV/HCV

         10. No concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs

         11. Adequate renal and liver function, i.e. creatinin and bilirubin = 1.2 times the upper
             limit of normal

         12. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

         13. Women of child-bearing potential should use adequate contraception prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with concurrent additional malignancy (with exception of Non-melanoma skin
             cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix)

          2. Subjects who are pregnant

          3. Subjects who have sensitivity to drugs that provide local anesthesia

          4. Age &lt; 18 years
