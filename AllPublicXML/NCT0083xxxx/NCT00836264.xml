  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous (IV) morphine requirement for immediate postoperative pain control depends upon
      the complex interplay of patient history, wound severity, environment, and genetics. Even for
      relatively uniform stimulus intensity, such as that associated with tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy (T&amp;A), there can be marked individual variability in response to morphine. Some
      patients are refractory to standard doses and need increased amounts. Others are sensitive,
      require less drug to attain acceptable pain levels, and/or experience unwanted side effects
      that limit dosing. A significant number must be switched to different analgesics altogether.
      Despite the long clinical history of morphine as a postoperative analgesic, researchers have
      only begun to examine the origins of response variability.

      The investigators will look at 2000 retrospective Tonsillectomy and Adenoidectomy cases and
      using this data and incorporating additional patient, surgical, and environmental factors
      that may contribute to response variability, the investigators then propose a prospective
      genome-wide association (GWA) study of 1500 children ages 4 to 18 y treated with IV morphine
      sulfate for day surgery T&amp;A.

      Morphine Tonsilectomy and Adenoidectomy (T&amp;A) Pharmacokinetics (PK) study will be done as a
      part of the larger institutional Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) project entitled &quot;A Study
      of the Genetic Causes of Complex Pediatric Disorders&quot; (GCPD study), as approved by the
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) IRB, 2006-7-4886. By combining Genome Wide
      Association (GWA) and PK data, we wish to conduct a Pharmacogenomic (PG) study of IV morphine
      administered as standard of care during and after pediatric day surgery T&amp;A. Because we
      expect several genes to play a role in the morphine response, we must use a large, relatively
      uniform pediatric surgical population such that for T&amp;A. Through observation and minimal-risk
      blood sampling of this cohort of children, we hope to identify genetic variants that predict
      analgesic response to (and serum levels of) morphine sulfate. Pediatric patients ages 4-18 y,
      presenting with significant tonsillar/adenoidal tissue hypertrophy, sleep disordered
      breathing and/or recurrent infection, and requiring T&amp;A are eligible. Morphine is the most
      common IV analgesic used for T&amp;A at CHOP. As is necessary for accurately defining analgesic
      response phenotype, morphine will be administered in a structured manner consistent with
      standard of care at this institution. As defined below, children resistant to morphine (MR)
      and those sensitive to it (MS) will be identified as specific phenotypes to be compared with
      normal responders (NR) in a GWA study.

      This study begins with a retrospective electronic database query of 2000 day surgery T&amp;A
      cases between 11/1/2005 and 10/31/2008 in which morphine was used as the sole IV analgesic.
      Data from this portion of the study will help us refine phenotype parameters, should robust
      subpopulations of response types emerge, and provide background information required for
      eventual project funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The prospective portion
      of the study will follow an additional 1650 children newly enrolled in the CAG study and now
      presenting for T&amp;A.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent enrollment in the GCPD study (IRB 2006-7-4886)

          2. Scheduled for day surgery T&amp;A with expected same day discharge at CHOP Main in
             Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA) or the CHOP Ambulatory Surgical Facilities (ASFs) in
             Chalfont, PA; Exton, PA; or Voorhees, New Jersey (NJ)

          3. Male or female, age 4 - 18 y, all races and ethnic backgrounds

          4. Able to self-report pain on the Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R).

          5. Informed consent as addendum to GCPD consent document

          6. Assent for children ≥7 y of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Parents/guardians or subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may be
             non-compliant with study schedules or procedures

          2. Non-English speaking subjects or parents. The reliability of the morphine analgesic
             requirement phenotype could be adversely affected by subtle communication differences
             between subjects and nursing staff assessing pain and administering morphine during
             patient recovery should language barriers exist. Parents must also be fluent in
             English as they will be at the bedside shortly after their child's arrival in recovery
             and could influence how their child understands pain scoring and how they interact
             with the nursing and research staff.

          3. Those parents/guardian or subjects not consenting to, or willing to participate in the
             GCPD study (IRB 2006-7-4886)

          4. Patients &lt; 4 y of age were excluded to improve phenotype reliability. Due to a higher
             empirical risk of postoperative obstruction following T&amp;A, children &lt; 4 y of age are
             admitted for overnight observation. The titration of morphine is more difficult in
             these patients as clinicians generally follow more restrictive dosing regimens and the
             total morphine dose is drawn out over an extended period. Furthermore, the self-report
             Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) has been validated for children ≥ 4 y and will be
             used to corroborate the morphine response phenotypes that are primarily based on
             morphine doses administered to achieve low Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability
             (FLACC) scores. The latter behavioral scoring is required for early morphine
             administration as children and adolescents emerging from anesthesia may have
             difficulty expressing themselves in the first 30 min. In addition, it is important for
             our statistical analysis to have a sequential scoring system over time that is
             applicable to all ages. Finally, the incidence of emergence agitation/delirium, a
             clinical phenomenon that shares some features of pain, but becomes distinct over 15-30
             min, is higher in younger patients. (Sikich, 2004; Vlajkovic, 2007) By excluding
             children &lt; 4 y we decrease the proportion of subjects whose FLACC scores may be high
             on the basis of emergence agitation/delirium.

          5. Significant comorbid conditions requiring a non-standard anesthetic regimen such as a
             history of severe post-operative nausea and vomiting requiring propofol infusion, a
             total intravenous anesthestic (TIVA) technique and/or mandating planned post-operative
             hospital admission

          6. Documented allergy or adverse reaction to morphine in the patient

          7. Use of opioids (e.g. codeine, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone) within the previous
             month

          8. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents or acetaminophen in the 3 days preceding
             the T&amp;A. No acetaminophen will be included in the premedication regimen on the day of
             surgery.
