      This is a study of PEGPH20 in human subjects and is designed to evaluate the safety of
      PEGPH20 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose of PEGPH20. All patients will receive
      PEGPH20. Each group of patients will receive a higher dose than the previous group. This will
      continue until the group with the highest planned dose completes the study or until a group
      has major side effects from their assigned dose.

             solid tumor.

          -  Patients who have experienced disease progression after receiving appropriate standard
             / approved chemotherapy and for whom no further standard or palliative treatment
             measures exist, or who have chosen to decline standard or palliative treatment.

          -  Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 70%.

          -  Recovery from any toxic or other effects of all previous therapy, including radiation,
             chemotherapy and surgery.

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test result in women of childbearing potential.

          -  For men and women of child-producing potential, agreement to use effective
             contraception (hormonal or barrier birth control or abstinence) from the time of
             screening before study entry and throughout study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other conditions
             including psychiatric illness) that could compromise protocol objectives in the
