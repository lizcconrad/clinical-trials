    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open label study is designed to evaluate the safety of Kuvan® and its
      effect on neurocognitive function, blood Phe concentration, and growth in children with PKU
      who are 0-6 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rigorous control of diet is typically advocated in children 4 years and under with PKU
      because brain sensitivity to high Phe concentrations is expected to be greatest during these
      years of rapid neurocognitive development.

      Prolonged high blood Phe concentrations are neurotoxic and lead to impairment of intelligence
      and other brain functions (such as attentiveness). Reduction of blood Phe concentrations
      through dietary control is an important determinant of long-term neurologic outcome in PKU
      patients, and reduction of blood Phe concentrations in patients with PKU has been shown to
      decrease the long term risk of neurologic injury.

      It is difficult for many patients to maintain reduced blood Phe, and many patients with PKU
      experience some degree of neurological impairment despite efforts to maintain dietary Phe
      control.

      The strongest determinant of intelligence quotient (IQ) and cognitive function is compliance
      with blood Phe control. Several clinical studies with Kuvan have already demonstrated
      efficacy in reducing blood Phe in subjects older than 4 years. This study will examine
      whether addition of Kuvan to the standard of care at an early age in children with well
      controlled diets can lower blood Phe levels (ie, reach and maintain a goal of ≤ 240
      micromole/L) and preserve neurocognitive functioning. In addition, this study will provide
      data on Kuvan exposure, rate of uptake, half life, and clearance in young children.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Established diagnosis of PKU with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) documented in the
             medical record by at least 2 blood Phe concentrations greater than or equal to 360
             micromole/L (6 mg/dL) taken at least 3 days apart

          -  Documented blood Phe control (defined by the standard used at each treatment center)
             prior to study enrollment, if applicable (eg, the subject is old enough for these data
             to be collected); blood Phe concentrations for subjects &lt; 6 months old at Screening
             must be considered controlled and stable by the Investigator
