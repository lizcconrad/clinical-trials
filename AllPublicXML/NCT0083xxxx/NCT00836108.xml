    <textblock>
      Controlling the way people with lung problems breathe during arm exercises may reduce their
      breathlessness during activities of daily living that require them to lift their arms (i.e.
      brushing their hair, putting groceries away on high shelves). The main aim of this study is
      to determine the effects of specific breathing strategies during arm exercise on dyspnoea in
      patients with chronic lung disease. Coordinating inspiration with the action of arm elevation
      will reduce dyspnoea during a rhythmic overhead arm activity

    <description>Subjects will practice a rhythmic overhead arm exercise, during which they will be taught to inspire when they elevate their arms or they will be taught to expire when they elevate their arms or, a third group, will practice a rhythmic overhead arm exercise, during which they will not be provided with any instruction regarding a specific breathing pattern. The arm exercise practiced by all groups will be identical.</description>
