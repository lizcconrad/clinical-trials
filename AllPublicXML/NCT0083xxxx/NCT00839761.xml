      Background: How best to improve iron status among infants in low-income settings is of
      continued concern in many countries, including Brazil

      Objective:

      Design: In a double blind, 5-mo, home-based trial in Brazil, mildly anemic 6 - 24 month-old
      children (n=175) were randomly assigned to receive either Ultra Rice (URG) fortified with
      23,4, mg Fe as micronized ferric pyrophosphate (MFP) and a placebo solution of iron drops, or
      identical non-fortified rice (CG) and a solution of iron drops. Parents were instructed on
      the correct dosage of iron drops and to feed their children (including whether and how much
      rice) as they normally would. Iron status and hemoglobin (Hb) were measured at baseline and
      at 5 mo.

    <measure>Before, the prevalence of ID and anemia in sample were 73.1% and 100%, respectively. At 5-mo, increases occurred in serum ferritin (SF) and hemoglobin (Hb). SF and Hb were observed in both groups. Increases in both measures were seen in the URG group.</measure>
