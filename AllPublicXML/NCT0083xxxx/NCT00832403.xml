    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study, involving patients with atrophic rhinitis, that underwent Gore
      tex® implants in the nasal fossa.

      The Fetid Rhinitis or Atrophic Ozena is a chronic illness characterized by yellowish
      secretion in the initial phase and the other phases with fetid crusts and atrophy of the
      mucous bone covering. Diverse theories exist that try to explain the appearance of this
      pathology, such as: hereditary factors, immunological alterations, viral infection and
      nutritional lack. Currently, its etiology remains unknown. As there isn't any ideal treatment
      already established, this technique improves the options of treatment.

      All patients have improved after the procedure.
