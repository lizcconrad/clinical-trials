    <textblock>
      University Reproductive Associates is conducting a pilot study to study the technique of egg
      freezing. Your participation in this study will provide us with important information to
      allow us to offer this technology for women wishing to freeze their eggs before cancer
      treatments. Your participation will include a standard IVF cycle with your eggs being frozen
      for a brief period of time and then transferred back to you as usual. You will receive a
      significant reduction in your IVF cycle cost.

    <description>All oocytes retrieved will be vitrified (rapidly frozen) after egg retrieval. The oocytes will then be warmed on the same day and fertilized per standard IVF-ICSI. Resulting embryos will be transferred back to the patient as per protocol.</description>
