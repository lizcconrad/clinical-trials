  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women come into pregnancy with diabetes that is controlled with either Metformin or diet
      control; however, the current standard of care for the treatment of preexisting diabetes in
      pregnancy is insulin. Metformin is widely used in the non-pregnant population for glycemic
      control, and has been used in pregnancy for other indications without adverse maternal or
      fetal outcomes. What remains unproven is the ability of Metformin to adequately control
      glucose in women during pregnancy.

      Our goal is to randomize 100 women who enter pregnancy with diabetes that is controlled by
      either diet or an oral agent and women who are found to have an abnormal glucose challenge
      test at less than 20 weeks to either standard treatment with weight based Regular and neutral
      protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or Metformin. Our hypothesis is that Metformin will provide
      glycemic control that is equivalent to insulin in these women.

    <description>Women randomized to the Experimental arm will receive standard diet and glucose self-monitoring education. They will be initiated on Metformin 500 BID if they were medication naïve, or will be continued on their current dosage of Metformin if they were taking it prior to pregnancy. At each clinic visit fasting and one hour post prandial glucose values will be reviewed, and dosage will be titrated to a maximum of 2250mg/day to achieve target glycemic control. If glycemic control can not be achieved with Metformin as a single agent insulin will be added.</description>
