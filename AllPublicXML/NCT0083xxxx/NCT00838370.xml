  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to prospectively determine whether capecitabine and
      5-FU-induced toxicity is preventable by dose reduction prior to start of the first
      administration in patients heterozygous or homozygous mutant for DPYD*2A, and to determine
      whether this strategy is cost-effective. Secondly, an individualized treatment algorithm for
      capecitabine and 5-FU therapy in DPYD*2A mutant patients will be developed and the
      pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine and 5-FU will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients exhibiting a genetically determined disorder (DPYD*2A) in the metabolic degradation
      of the frequently used anticancer agents capecitabine and 5-FU (fluoropyrimidines) are at
      high risk of development of severe and life-threatening toxicity during standard treatment
      with these compounds. Treatment and recovery of this fluoropyrimidine-induced severe toxicity
      often requires prolonged periods of hospitalization.

      Screening for DPYD*2A in patients to treat with fluoropyrimidine drugs with subsequent dose
      adjustments in mutant individuals prior to start of therapy will possibly reduce the number
      of severe toxicity events. Furthermore, by reducing the frequency and/or duration of
      hospitalization, substantial medical costs can be saved, making this a cost-effective
      strategy.

    <description>Patients to treat with capecitabine/5-FU will be screened prior to start of therapy for DPYD*2A. Patients heterozygous or homozygous mutant for DPYD*2A receive dose reductions of capecitabine/5-FU of at least 50% in the first two courses. In case this dose is tolerated well, doses will be increased.
In addition, the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine/5-FU and their metabolites will be assessed in these patients.</description>
