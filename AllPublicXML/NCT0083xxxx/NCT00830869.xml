    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of IXAZOMIB. The primary
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, establish the maximum tolerated
      dose, and inform the phase 2 dose of IXAZOMIB administered intravenously in patients with
      nonhematologic malignancies.
