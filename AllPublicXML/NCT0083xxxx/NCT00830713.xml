  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitiligo, the melanocytes are lost from the skin in certain areas. One treatment for
      vitiligo takes the melanocytes from areas of normal skin and places them on areas of that
      same person's body which have lost their color. This is called the melanocyte-keratinocyte
      transplantation procedure (MKTP). This procedure has been used successfully in over 3000
      cases in India and Saudi Arabia. The purpose of this study is to see if it is effective when
      performed at the investigators' institution.
