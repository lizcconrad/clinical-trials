      This will be a single center, open label study comparing baseline characteristics of
      recovered sputum cells (collected on screening day) to those of cells recovered 6 hours after
      inhalational challenge with 20,000 EU Clinical Center Reference Endotoxin (CCRE, a component
      of air pollution)) within each group as well as cross group comparisons between individuals
      with allergic asthma (AA's)and normal volunteers (NV's). The primary objective of this study
      is to test the hypothesis that persons with allergic asthma will have an increased neutrophil
      response to challenge with 20,000 EU CCRE compared to normal volunteers. Secondary objectives
      include post CCRE comparison between AA's and NV's with regard to changes in airway cells and
      blood as well as changes in mucociliary clearance (MCC) in response to inhalation of 20,000
      EU CCRE.

      This will be a single center, open label study of allergic asthmatic and normal volunteers.
      The protocol will compare baseline characteristics of recovered sputum cells (collected on
      screening day) to those of cells recovered 6 hours after inhalational challenge with CCRE
      within each group as well as cross group comparisons between AA's and NV's. The following
      information indicates procedures to be performed at each visit as well as the anticipated
      duration of visits. Subsequent to this description are details regarding specific study
      procedures.

      Visit 1: Baseline Visit (5 hours)

        1. Consent will be obtained, review of subject's medical history, current medications and
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.

        2. Vital sign measurements (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure), oxygen
           saturation, and symptom scoring

        3. Urine pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential

        4. Spirometry

        5. Venipuncture for CBC with differential and baseline blood analyses

        6. Physical exam of the ears, nose, throat and chest

        7. Post challenge venipuncture (blood draw) for CBC with differential and post CCRE blood
           analyses

        8. Collection of exhaled breath for measurement of nitric oxide level.

        9. Four hours post challenge, subject will have MCC evaluated

       10. After MCC is assessed, sputum induction will be performed.

       11. After completion of the sputum induction, subjects will have brief MCC scan (&lt; 10

      Post Challenge Observations/Reporting (5 minutes)

      1. Subjects will be contacted for phone call follow-up 48-96 hours after challenge (see
      script Appendix 4 of accompanying protocol)

      Study discontinuation visit within 10 days of the challenge dose: (15 minutes)

        1. Vital signs, O2 saturation, symptom score, spirometry

        2. If any findings are abnormal, medical evaluation as directed by the study physician will
           be undertaken Appendix 1 of the accompanying protocol provides a summary table regarding
           procedures performed at each subject study visit
