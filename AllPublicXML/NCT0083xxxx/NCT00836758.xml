    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of a CPAP (continuous positive airway
      pressure) device to a clinical polysomnography (PSG) in identifying breathing events in
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

    <measure>Evidence of diagnostic agreement between breathing events identified by the CPAP device compared to a simultaneous PSG confirmed by using accepted sleep disordered breathing severity groupings (AHI &gt;5, AHI &gt;15 and AHI &gt;30). [AHI is apnea-hypopnea index]</measure>
    <time_frame>one night</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo an attended PSG using the CPAP device at a sub-therapeutic pressure in order to induce breathing events. The breathing event outputs for both the PSG and CPAP device will be compared to determine if the apnea-hypopnea indices are in diagnostic agreement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21-75

          2. Diagnosis of OSAHS with a baseline AHI ≥ 15 events/hr of sleep assessed January 01,
             2007 or later

          3. CPAP prescription of 8cm of H20 or higher

          4. Able and willing to provide written informed consent

          5. Native English speaker

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in another interventional research study within the last 30 days

          2. Major medical or psychiatric condition that would interfere with the demands of the
             study and adherence to PAP. Examples include unstable cardiovascular disease (Class
             III / IV CHF), neuromuscular disease, cancer, and renal failure.

          3. Chronic respiratory failure or insufficiency with suspected or known neuromuscular
             disease, moderate or severe COPD or other pulmonary disorders, or any condition with
             an elevation of arterial carbon dioxide levels (&gt; 45 mmHg) while awake, or subjects
             requiring continuous oxygen therapy.

          4. Surgery of the upper airway, nose, sinus, or middle ear within the previous 90 days

          5. Surgery at any time for the treatment of OSAHS such as uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
             (UPPP)

          6. Presence of untreated or poorly managed,non-OSAHS related sleep disorders:

               1. moderate to severe periodic limb movements(≥ 30/hr with symptoms or arousals)

               2. arousals associated with periodic limb movements &gt; 10 per hour or

               3. anyone experiencing chronic and severe insomnia.

          7. Consumption of ethanol immediately prior to the research PSG
