      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Progression-Free Survival (PFS) time of
      Sorafenib in combination with FOLFIRI regimen used as in the second front treatment in
      patients with advanced CRC after failure of oxaliplatin treatment.

      This is a phase Ⅱ open label, non randomized study, in which sorafenib is used in combination
      with irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil in patients with advanced colorectal cancer
      after failure of oxaliplatin treatment.The aim of this study is to determine the
      Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of Sorafenib used in combination with FOLFIRI regimen as a
      second front treatment in patients with advanced CRC after failure of oxaliplatin treatment,
      defined as the time from treatment to disease progression or death due to any cause. The
      other secondary endpoints are disease control rate, defined as complete response, partial
      response, and stable disease.Response rate,overall survival, and safety are also evaluated.
