    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this observational study is to collect safety data on reformulated
      BeneFIX as prescribed in routine clinical practice conditions in France. The secondary
      objectives are to collect data on the clinical course of individuals treated with
      reformulated BeneFIX and on the ease of reformulated BeneFIX.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Prior to Safety Amendment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 3.5</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs which occurred prior to safety amendment. Prior to safety amendment, only AEs/SAEs deemed related to BeneFIX as per participating physician were collected.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) by Relationship After Safety Amendment</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 3.5 up to 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. A treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug as per participating physician. AEs included SAEs as well as non-serious AEs which occurred after the safety amendment. After the safety amendment, all AEs/SAEs were collected irrespective of their relationship to BeneFIX.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Events of Special Interest</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Events of special interest included allergic reactions, red blood cell (RBC) agglutination phenomena, lack of efficacy/low recovery, thrombotic events and onset of factor IX (FIX) inhibitor. Participants may be represented in more than 1 category.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Number of bleeding episode during prophylaxis and on demand period were reported. All periods with at least one injection per week were considered as prophylaxis period. All prophylaxis periods of less than a month were reviewed and cross-checked with the treatment scheme planned at the previous visit to confirm if they were real prophylaxis periods or preventive injections periods. On demand treatment period included the total duration of follow up excluding duration of both prophylaxis and preventive injection treatment scheme. Efficacy population included only those participants who were previously treated with BeneFIX. Here, 'n' signifies participants evaluable for this measure during the specified treatment period. Participants may be represented in more than 1 category.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes Requiring Treatment by Injection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Number of injections (1, 2, 3 or greater than or equal to [&gt;= 4]) required to treat the bleeding episodes during prophylaxis and on demand period were reported. All periods with at least one injection per week were considered as prophylaxis period. All prophylaxis periods of less than a month were reviewed and cross-checked with the treatment scheme planned at the previous visit to confirm if they were real prophylaxis periods or preventive injections periods. On demand treatment period included the total duration of follow up excluding duration of both prophylaxis and preventive injection treatment scheme.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Consumption of BeneFIX</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Total consumption of BeneFIX included consumption during prophylaxis, on demand, during bleeding episodes, preventive injections, surgeries or immune tolerance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Assessment of Efficacy by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed efficacy of BeneFIX as very good, good, moderate and bad at each follow-up visit. Results were summarized for the latest (most recent), worst and best assessment of BeneFIX done by the participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose Per Injection of BeneFIX</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Dose per injection during prophylaxis and on demand period were reported. All periods with at least one injection per week were considered as prophylaxis period. All prophylaxis periods of less than a month were reviewed and cross-checked with the treatment scheme planned at the previous visit to confirm if they were real prophylaxis periods or preventive injections periods. On demand treatment period included the total duration of follow up excluding duration of both prophylaxis and preventive injection treatment scheme. Participants may be represented in more than 1 category.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Assessment of Efficacy by Physician</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Participating physician assessed efficacy of BeneFIX as very good, good, moderate and bad at follow-up visit. Results were summarized for the latest (most recent), worst and best assessment of BeneFIX done by the physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Assessment of Ease of Use by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Year 4.75</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed ease of use of BeneFIX as very good, good, moderate and bad at each follow-up visit. Results were summarized for the latest (most recent), worst and best assessment of BeneFIX done by the participant.</description>

        <description>Number of injections (1, 2, 3 or greater than or equal to [&gt;= 4]) required to treat the bleeding episodes during prophylaxis and on demand period were reported. All periods with at least one injection per week were considered as prophylaxis period. All prophylaxis periods of less than a month were reviewed and cross-checked with the treatment scheme planned at the previous visit to confirm if they were real prophylaxis periods or preventive injections periods. On demand treatment period included the total duration of follow up excluding duration of both prophylaxis and preventive injection treatment scheme.</description>
