  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dimension of diagnostic procedures and therapy of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases
      largely depends on the degree of mucosal inflammation. Video colonoscopy is currently the
      gold standard in the evaluation of the mucosa in patients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC).
      PillCam Colon Capsule was developed by Given Imaging, Israel, as possible alternative imaging
      modality to evaluate mucosal changes in patients with UC. The colonic mucosa can be
      visualized and recorded by video while the colon capsule passes the colon.

      Many patients suffering from UC ask their physician for possible alternative diagnostic
      imaging because they are uncomfortable with conventional colonoscopy.

      The primary aim of the present study is to compare the new Pillcam Colon Capsule with
      standard colonoscopy with respect to assessing mucosal disease activity and localization of
      inflamed colonic mucosa in patients with known UC.

    <description>PillCam Colon Capsule: The PillCam Colon capsule has two cameras that enable the device to take video images from both ends. It is 31.11 mm in size and takes pictures at a rate of 4 frames per second. The delay mode allows recording of images from the esophagus and the stomach for 5 minutes before the capsule switches into sleep mode for 2 hours to save energy.</description>
