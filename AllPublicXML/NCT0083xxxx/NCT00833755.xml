    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare pain threshold, pain tolerance, and wind up, as
      measured by QST, before and after a single dose of ketamine infusion under two clinical
      conditions: chronic pain patients on opioid therapy and chronic pain patients without opioid
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>

      We hypothesize that:

        1. Chronic pain patients on chronic opioids would have a lower pain threshold and lower
           pain tolerance when compared to opioid naïve patients (patients with chronic pain with
           non-opioids treatment)., as measured by QST in a non-affected neutral limb;

        2. Chronic pain patients on chronic opioids would have an increased response to painful
           stimulation, so called &quot;windup&quot; as demonstrated by QST;

        3. Both &quot;wind-up&quot; and altered pain threshold and tolerance would be indicative of the
           presence of opioid-induced hyperalgesia;

        4. Intravenous ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, could be used to differentiate
           between opioid-induced hyperalgesia and opioid tolerance.

    <measure>Change in Temperature of Pain Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at visit 1, post inufsion at visit 1, and at visit 2 which was 1 week after visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>We measured the change in pain threshold using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). QST refers to a set of quantitative testing of individual responses to mechanical, thermal, and/or electrical stimulation. In this study, pain threshold was the thermal stimulation intensity (in°C) first perceived as painful. To measure this, a contact thermode was attached onto the dorsal surface of the forearm. By pressing a computer mouse button, each subject was able to stop stimulation when they first perceived a painful stimulation from the thermode as the temperature increased 1°C/s.
This test was repeated 3 times and an average temperature was calculated. The temperatures could range from a minimum of 0°C to 53°C.</description>

    <measure>Change in Temperature of Pain Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at visit 1, post inufsion at visit 1, and at visit 2 which was 1 week after visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>Using QST, we measured the change in pain tolerance which was the maximum thermal stimulation intensity (in °C) tolerable. In this test, the subject was instructed to press the computer mouse to stop stimulation when the thermode reached the maximal tolerable temperature.
This test was repeated 3 times and an average temperature was calculated. The temperatures could range from a minimum of 0°C to 53°C.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Duration of Supra-threshold Pain Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline at visit 1, post inufsion at visit 1, and at visit 2 which was 1 week after visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>Using QST, we detected the duration (seconds) of tolerance to supra-threshold heat pain stimulation. In this test, subjects were asked to tolerate, as long as he or she could, heat stimulation preset at 47°C for a maximum of 60 seconds. They were given the computer mouse to stop the test if they reached their limit before 60 seconds. If they stopped the test before the 60 seconds, the time that they stopped it was recorded.
This test was repeated 3 times and an average duration was calculated. The duration could range from a minimum of 0 seconds to a maximum of 60 seconds.</description>

             been no changes in the type and amount of opioid dose for at least one month. Only
             patients with a minimal daily dose of at least 60 mg morphine equianalgesic dose will
             be included.

        <title>Change in Temperature of Pain Threshold</title>
        <description>We measured the change in pain threshold using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). QST refers to a set of quantitative testing of individual responses to mechanical, thermal, and/or electrical stimulation. In this study, pain threshold was the thermal stimulation intensity (in°C) first perceived as painful. To measure this, a contact thermode was attached onto the dorsal surface of the forearm. By pressing a computer mouse button, each subject was able to stop stimulation when they first perceived a painful stimulation from the thermode as the temperature increased 1°C/s.
This test was repeated 3 times and an average temperature was calculated. The temperatures could range from a minimum of 0°C to 53°C.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline at visit 1, post inufsion at visit 1, and at visit 2 which was 1 week after visit 1</time_frame>
        <population>Only subjects who experienced pain relief after the infusion were scheduled for visit 2. This is why the overall # of participants analyzed differs from the # of baseline participants.</population>

        <title>Change in Duration of Supra-threshold Pain Tolerance</title>
        <description>Using QST, we detected the duration (seconds) of tolerance to supra-threshold heat pain stimulation. In this test, subjects were asked to tolerate, as long as he or she could, heat stimulation preset at 47°C for a maximum of 60 seconds. They were given the computer mouse to stop the test if they reached their limit before 60 seconds. If they stopped the test before the 60 seconds, the time that they stopped it was recorded.
This test was repeated 3 times and an average duration was calculated. The duration could range from a minimum of 0 seconds to a maximum of 60 seconds.</description>
