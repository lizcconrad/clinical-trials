    <textblock>
      This trial will explore the efficacy and safety of 250ng Juvista per Linear cm, administered
      by intradermal injection following the excision of ear lobe keloids. Keloids commonly occur
      after ear piercing and are usually bilateral.One ear lobe will be treated with Juvist and one
      with placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects aged 18-85 years who have given written informed consent.

          -  Subjects with bilateral ear lobe keloid scars of comparable size and suitable for
             surgical excision which will result in a single wound on each ear lobe no greater than
             2cm long and restricted to the skin, fat and fibrous tissue of the ear lobe.

          -  Subjects with, in the opinion of the investigator, clinically acceptable results for
             the laboratory tests specified in the trial protocol (see Protocol Section 6.3.2). All
             laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days of the first trial dose
             administration.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential who are using a highly effective method(s)
             of contraception and agree to do so from at least the screening visit until one month
             after administration of the final study dose. For the purposes of the protocol, highly
             effective method(s) of contraception will be defined as consistently and correctly
             used implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, sexual abstinence or a
             vasectomised partner.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had ear lobe keloids treated with irradiation, cryosurgery,
             corticosteroids, or other pharmacological agents in the three months prior to the
             first trial dose administration.

          -  Subjects with a history of a bleeding disorder.

          -  Subjects who on direct questioning and/or physical examination have past or present
             evidence of eczema or psoriasis local to the site of administration, uncontrolled
             diabetes (fasting plasma glucose concentration consistently at or above 7.0mmol 1-1
             (126 mg dl-1), severely immunocompromised patients and/or malignant skin tumours e.g.
             melanomas, squamous or basal cell carcinomas.

          -  Subjects with a skin disorder, not related to the keloid disease, that is chronic or
             currently active and which the Investigator considers will adversely affect the
             healing of the acute wounds or involves the areas to be examined in this trial.

          -  Subjects with a history of malignancy in the last 5 years.

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the drugs or dressings used in
             this trial.

          -  Subjects who are taking, or have taken any investigational product or participated in
             a clinical trial in the three months prior to first trial dose administration.

          -  Subjects undergoing investigations or changes in management for an existing medical
             condition.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are unlikely to complete the trial
             for whatever reason.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subjects with a creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 80ml/min or less. Creatinine clearance
             will be determined from the serum creatinine level at pre-study screening using the
             following formula.

        CLcr = 140 - age (years) x Weight (kg) 72 x serum creatinine mg/dL [ x 0.85 for females]

          -  Subjects who are not able to undergo MRI scanning due to their medical history or
             physical condition.

          -  Subjects who have previously received treatment with Juvista (Avotermin).
