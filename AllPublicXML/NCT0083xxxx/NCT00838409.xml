    <textblock>
      This study will be a cross-sectional study. The primary aim of this study is to compare the
      relationship between neurological function, metabolic measures and health-related behaviors
      between normal weight and overweight/obese perimenopausal women.

      To examine physiological and behavioral factors that may help determine health in
      perimenopausal middle age women. Neuroendocrine function will be measured by broad assessment
      of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. We will also assess metabolic profiles and
      behavioral and emotional function. We plan to determine correlations between these measures
      and nutritional state. Other measures may include insulin, glucose, leptin, IGF-1,
      triglycerides, free fatty acids, and ghrelin and eating attitudes and physical reactivity.
