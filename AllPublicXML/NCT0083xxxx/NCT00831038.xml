    <textblock>
      Infants less than 2 years old who have been newly diagnosed with problems swallowing will
      have pulmonary function tests performed to try to detect the presence of chronic lung
      disease. Six months later after the infants have received appropriate therapy for their
      swallowing problems, pulmonary function tests will be performed again to see if there has
      been any change in their chronic lung disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five infants between the ages of 1 month and 24 months who have just been diagnosed
      with dysphagia via a modified barium feeding study will be recruited into the study. The
      infants will be sedated with chloral hydrate and have pulmonary functions measured (pre- and
      post-bronchodilator spirometry and lung volume) using the infant pulmonary laboratory.
      Treatment for the infants' dysphagia/chronic aspiration will be treated as determined by the
      primary care physicians. Six months later the infants will again be sedated and have
      pulmonary functions measured. Results of the two sets of tests will be compared
      statistically.
