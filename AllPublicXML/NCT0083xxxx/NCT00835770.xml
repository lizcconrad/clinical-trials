    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety profile of BG00012
      (dimethyl fumarate). Secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy of BG00012 using clinical endpoints and disability progression, to evaluate further
      the long-term effects of BG00012 on multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions on magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans in participants who had MRI scans as part of Studies 109MS301
      (NCT00420212) and 109MS302 (NCT00451451) and to evaluate the long-term effects of BG00012 on
      health economics assessments and the visual function test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial BG00012 dosage for the extension study (240 mg BID or 240 mg TID) was the same as
      that used in the Phase 3 Studies 109MS301 (NCT00420212) and 109MS302 (NCT00451451).
      Subsequent to the initiation of this study, BG00012 was approved in several countries for the
      treatment of MS at a dose of 240 mg BID. For this reason, all participants continuing in this
      study will receive the currently marketed dose of 240 mg BID.

    <description>Progression of disability is defined as at least a 1.0 point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS 1.0 that is sustained for 24 weeks or at least a 1.5 point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS =0 that is sustained for 24 weeks. The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist.</description>
