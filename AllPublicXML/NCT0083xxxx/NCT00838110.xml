  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled safety study conducted in
      2 study cohorts. In Cohort 1, subjects with Alzheimer's disease (n=250) will receive Dimebon
      20 mg or placebo TID for 26 weeks. In Cohort 2 AD subjects (n=500) will be treated with
      Dimebon 20 mg or placebo TID for 12 weeks After completion of the randomized portion of the
      study, subjects in both Cohorts will have the opportunity to enroll in a Dimebon open label
      extension study.

          -  If on existing anti-dementia therapy, have been on a stable dose of anti-dementia
             therapy (cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine) for at least 60 days prior to
             dosing in study.

          -  If not taking existing anti-dementia therapy, have not received therapy with
             cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine within 60 days prior to dosing in this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have major structural brain disease (e.g., ischemic infarcts, subdural hematoma,
             hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, brain tumors, multiple subcortical ischemic lesions, or a
             single lesion in a critical region [e.g., thalamus, hippocampus]).

          -  Have any major medical illness or unstable medical condition within six months of
             screening that may interfere with the patient's ability to comply with study
             procedures and abide by study restrictions.

          -  Have not been on a stable dose of anti-dementia therapy for at least 60 days prior to
             dosing or intend to start anti-dementia therapy during the double blind portion of the
             study.

          -  Reside in a nursing home or assisted care facility with need for 24-hour care and
             supervision.
