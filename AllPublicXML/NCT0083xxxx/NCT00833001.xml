      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the PROLIFT system with
      a new lighter-weight mesh in repair of vaginal prolapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal prolapse (a feeling of bulge in the vagina) may cause some distressing symptoms such
      as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with women's sex
      life. There are a number of different surgical procedures which are used to repair prolapse.
      Sometimes a mesh is placed in the pelvis to support the weakened tissues. There is a lot of
      research going on to find the most suitable type of mesh to repair vaginal prolapse. The
      GYNECARE PROLIFT + M* Pelvic Floor Repair system is similar to a mesh already used for this
      procedure called ULTRAPRO*, but is lighter in weight. Currently, ULTRAPRO* is only approved
      for use in hernia repair and is not licensed for gynecological procedures. This study will be
      the first clinical investigation of this mesh in vaginal prolapse.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidates with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse of ICS POP-Q Stage III or IV,
             suitable for surgical repair. Perineal repair, vaginal hysterectomy and/or mid
             urethral sling procedures for incontinence may be performed concurrently.
