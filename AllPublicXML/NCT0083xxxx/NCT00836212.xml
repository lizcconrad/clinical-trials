      Background

      Low concentrations of protease inhibitors (PIs) or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors (NNRTIs) are associated with an increased risk of virological failure. Likewise,
      excessive antiretroviral drug concentrations increase the risk of toxicity. Therapeutic drug
      monitoring (TDM) may identify and correct excessively high or low PI and/or NNRTI
      concentrations, and thus minimize toxicity and risk of treatment failure. Treatment
      guidelines only recommend using TDM to help optimize ARV therapy in selected patients, and
      there are no clear recommendations to guide the clinician who decides to adjust drug doses.
      Prospective studies have demonstrated the relationship between EFV plasma concentration and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms. Moreover, EFV is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 2B6 and its
      concentration was reported to be associated with the CYP2B6 516GrT genetic polymorphism.

      For drugs such as EFV or LPV/r, lower doses than the ones validated for standard clinical use
      have demonstrated efficacy in dose-ranging studies.

      The investigators will use a standardised algorithm to reduce doses in patients with plasma
      EFV or LPV/r concentration above percentile 75. This algorithm is based on a Bayesian
      approach from the pharmacology unit in Lausanne. The investigators hypothesize that a dosage
      individualisation is feasible and safe.

      2.2 Study Aims

      The investigators aim at testing a simplified algorithm for dose reduction in patients with
      documented virological efficacy, treated by a stable LPV/r or EFV based regimen with elevated
      plasma concentration of these drugs.

      Study Design

      Prospective open label study in which all eligible patients screened with a plasma drug
      concentration of either EFV or LPV/r above percentile 75 will be included. After confirmation
      of the results at baseline, patients will be offered to decrease drug dosage by a third or a
      half according to a standardised algorithm. All patients will undergo HIVRNA, biochemistry
      and validated questionnaires after 3 and 6 months to assess the safety and the benefit of
      this strategy.
