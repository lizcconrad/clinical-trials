    <textblock>
      The purpose of this first-in-man trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      ascending single and multiple doses of LEO 22811 in healthy male subjects as well as to
      determine the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of LEO 22811 in healthy female
      subjects. The trial will be performed in two parts. In Part 1, single doses of LEO 22811 will
      be administered to healthy male and female subjects. In Part 2, multiple doses of LEO 22811
      will be administered to healthy male subjects.
