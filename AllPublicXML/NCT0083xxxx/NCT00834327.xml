  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to be conducted at multiple sites in the USA. Patients diagnosed
      with moderate to severe Restless Legs Syndrome will be randomly allocated to one of 5
      treatment arms in the study. The 5 arms include 4 arms with different doses of aplindore MR
      tablets and 1 placebo arm. The treatment will be taken once a day. The study is blinded and
      neither patients, nor the investigators, will know what treatment the patient is receiving.
      Patients will be assigned a dose and will be maintained at that dose for several weeks (2
      treatment arms include a short titration period). The entire study will take about 6 weeks.
      The study will measure how effective aplindore is in decreasing symptoms of Restless Legs
      Syndrome, and will also assess the safety and tolerability of aplindore.

      Two hundred and thirty patients will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment arms in
      this outpatient study. Of the four aplindore arms, two arms will be titrated over a brief
      period until the targeted dose is achieved, and then as with the other arms, will be
      maintained for several weeks. Dosing will take place over a total of about 4 weeks.
