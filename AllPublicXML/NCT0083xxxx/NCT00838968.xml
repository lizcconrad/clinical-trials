      The purpose of the study is to determine whether interferon-alpha is effective in the
      treatment of p48 Positive patients with HCC after curative resection.

      BACKGROUND: Postoperative interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy improved survival in patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). P48 is a predictive marker for outcome of postoperative
      interferon-alpha treatment in patients with HCC. Our study is to identify the Efficiency of
      Postoperative IFN-Alpha Treatment in p48 Positive Patients With HCC.

      METHODS: An immunohistochemical study of P48 was performed on specimens that were collected
      from patients who underwent a curative resection of HCC. These patient with p48 Positive were
      randomized divided into a treatment group who received postoperative IFN-alpha therapy and a
      comparison group who not received. Besides the side effect, the overall survival rate and the
      disease-free survival rate will be observed.

      Anticipated RESULTS: IFN alpha treatment improved the overall survival of p48 Positive
      patients with HCC after curative resection, probably by postponing recurrence.

    we have found another marker (microRNA26) which is more sensitive to evaluate the effect of
    postoperative IFNa treatment in patients with HCC
