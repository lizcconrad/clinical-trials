  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      WBI-1001 is a synthetic,new, non-steroid, small molecule being developed as a candidate drug
      for the topical, cream treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. As such, it affects T-cells
      through inhibition of T-cell activities including their infiltration processes, and it shows
      direct anti-inflammatory manifestation in the mouse edema model. This was a 28 day study
      (plus one follow-up week) on patients with Atopic Dermatitis, and 36 patients were treated
      randomly, BID with either 0.5%, 1.0% or placebo. Blood samples were taken weekly for PK
      analysis.

      A double-blind, single-centered, vehicle-controlled, randomized Phase IIa study of WBI-1001
      on patients with mild to moderate Atopic Dermatitis (AD). All body areas were treatable
      except face, scalp, groin and genital areas. Cream applied BID between 6.00 and 10.00am and
      7.00 and 10.00pm daily for 4 weeks. Blood draws for PK analysis were taken weekly at the
      study centre prior to the morning cream application. Patients returned to the study centre
      approximately one week later for a follow-up visit.
