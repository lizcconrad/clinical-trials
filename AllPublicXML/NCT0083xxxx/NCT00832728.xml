    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, concurrent control study of subjects with FHF.
      Subjects meeting the eligibility requirements of the study will be randomly assigned in a 2:1
      ratio to receive either standard medical therapy for FHF plus the ELAD® system, or standard
      medical therapy alone, with the latter defined as conventional therapy for FHF determined to
      be clinically appropriate by the treating physician.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Therapy will generally include treatment of hepatic encephalopathy using lactulose with or
      without oral antibiotics, antibiotics as indicated to treat infection, volume resuscitation
      and vasopressors as indicated to treat hypotension. In addition general medical treatment
      such as glucose control and renal replacement therapy will be used as necessary. Subjects
      with a clinical diagnosis of hepato-renal syndrome may be treated with midodrine and
      octreotide or terlipressin, if considered appropriate therapy.

      Immediately prior to treatment initiation, subject eligibility will be confirmed. Treatment
      with ELAD® will continue for a minimum of 3 days and up to a maximum of 30 days, until, in
      the Investigator's opinion, clinical status improves relative to entry; until the subject
      undergoes OLT; or until the continued use of ELAD® is contraindicated, as described in
      Section 5.5. Subjects will be followed until discontinuation or 30 days has elapsed since
      study enrollment (control) or 30 days has elapsed since cessation of ELAD® therapy (ELAD®
      group), whichever comes first.
