  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The estimated recurrence rate of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is 23-50% after the first
      episode, and the optimal treatment remains unknown. In the recently published British
      Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment
      for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate of
      this procedure was as high as 25-30%, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.

      Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way
      to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous
      pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients. Many chemical irritants (tetracycline,
      talc, and minocycline) have been used to decrease the rate of recurrence in spontaneous
      pneumothorax. Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer
      available. Talc insufflation of the pleural cavity is safe and effective for primary
      spontaneous pneumothorax. However, it should be applied either with surgical or medical
      thoracoscopy. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in
      inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional
      minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure to decrease the rates of
      ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In
      the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in
      patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration. The
      primary goal is to test if intrapleural minocycline can reduce the rate of recurrence. The
      secondary goals are to evaluate the safety profile, short-term results, and long-term effects
      of minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration. The sites of study include National
      Taiwan University Hospital and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. A total of 300 patients (150
      patients in each arm) will be included for this study.
