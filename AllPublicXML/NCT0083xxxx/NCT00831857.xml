  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of 89Zr-bevacizumab PET
      imaging as a biomarker before and during treatment with sunitinib or bevacizumab plus
      interferon in patients with RCC. 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging will be regarded a promising
      biomarker if the target for treatment (VEGF) can be visualised and if uptake changes after
      institution of treatment.

      -  To explore if 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging can differentiate RCC patients with
           progressive disease from patients with non-progressive disease during treatment with
           sunitinib or bevacizumab plus interferon.

        -  To explore relationships between VEGF pathway related biomarkers and 89Zr-bevacizumab
           PET response.

        -  To explore effect of 2 weeks off treatment in the sunitinib arm on pharmacodynamic
           biomarkers and 89Zr-bevacizumab PET response.

          -  no treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor during the last 4 weeks

          -  measurable disease with x-ray or CT scan, at least one site of disease must be
             unidimensionally measurable as follows: X-ray &gt; 20 mm, Spiral CT scan &gt; 10 mm,
