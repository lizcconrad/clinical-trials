  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad; rituximab,
      ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (RICE) followed by gallium nitrate, rituximab and
      dexamethasone (GARD) have on diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

      This research is being done to try to find a more effective treatment for this type of
      cancer. We want to know whether treatment with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and
      etoposide (RICE) then followed by gallium nitrate, rituximab and dexamethasone (GARD) will
      improve survival.

      Rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide (RICE) are part of the usual treatment for
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      Gallium nitrate, rituximab and dexamethasone (GARD) in lymphoma is experimental.

      This is a Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of adding the combination of GaRD x 2 cycles
      following 3 cycles of the standard salvage regimen of RICE for the treatment of relapsed or
      refractory diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study will include patients who have
      relapsed after 1 prior treatment regimen or who are refractory to initial chemotherapy. We
      will evaluate patients for response rate (both partial and complete), toxicities, as well as
      overall and progression free survival. Eligible patients will receive standard RICE x 3
      cycles followed by GaRD x 2 cycles. Patients who would otherwise be eligible, may then
      proceed to autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).
