      The MotHER Pregnancy Registry is a United States (U.S.)-based, prospective, observational
      cohort study in women with breast cancer who have been or are being treated with a
      trastuzumab (herceptin)-containing regimen with or without pertuzumab (perjeta) or
      ado-trastuzumab emtansine (kadcyla) during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception
      (regardless of cancer stage at the time of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, or ado-trastuzumab
      emtansine exposure).
