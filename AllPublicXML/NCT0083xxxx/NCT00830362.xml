      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of propranolol versus placebo on
      responses to cocaine cues in cocaine dependent individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ cocaine-dependent individuals to investigate the acute effects of
      propranolol vs. placebo, administered immediately after a retrieval session of cocaine cue
      exposure, on the subjective and physiological responses occurring during a subsequent test
      session of cocaine cue exposure. Participants (N=52) will be randomly assigned to receive 40
      mg propranolol or placebo immediately after the first of two cocaine cue exposure sessions
      scheduled to occur on consecutive days of an inpatient stay at MUSC's General Clinical
      Research Center (GCRC). The first session will serve as a retrieval session where cocaine cue
      exposure will putatively elicit retrieval and reconsolidation of memories about the
      association between the cues and cocaine administration; the second session of cocaine cue
      exposure will be a test session to examine the potential modulatory role of propranolol on
      the reconsolidated memories putatively elicited during the previous cue exposure session. It
      is assumed that changes in craving and physiological reactivity during the test session will
      reflect propranolol's effects on memory reconsolidation processes elicited by cue exposure
      during the retrieval session. Medications will be administered in a double-blind fashion.
      Craving and physiological arousal (heart rate, skin conductance, blood pressure) will be
      obtained at baseline and at regular intervals during and after both cue exposure sessions.
      Approximately 7 days following discharge from the inpatient stay at the GCRC, participants
      will return to the GCRC to undergo a 1-week follow-up cue exposure session that will be
      identical to the previous two sessions (no medications will be administered). The goal of the
      follow-up will be to examine if any craving and/or physiological reactivity differences
      identified during the test session were sustained and to assess if the groups differed in
      their cocaine use during the intervening 7-day period.

    <measure>Single Item Craving Test Session Difference Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Both days of cue exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Mean of the difference of Session 1 and Session 2 cocaine craving scores (Session 2-Session 1). Found by using our Single Item Craving (SIC) scale. A study team member asks the participant to verbally report the level of craving they were experiencing using values between 0 and 100, with 0 representing no craving and 100 extreme craving. The difference score was found by subtracting session 1 mean SICs during cue exposure from session 2 mean SICs during cue exposure. Therefore the mean of the difference could have ranged anywhere from -100 to 100. Negative mean difference scores reflect a decrease in craving for cocaine from session 1 (test) to session 2 (retrieval). The lower the mean difference score, the greater the decrease in craving.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Individuals who met DSM-IV criteria for current cocaine dependence (within the past month) but who were not dependent on any other substance, with the exception of nicotine, served as participants. The primary method of recruitment was media advertisement (radio, local papers) which ran from January of 2009 until July of 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Exclusion criteria included severe psychiatric comorbidity (e.g., psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, severe major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation) or medical illness or use of medications that might interact with propranolol. Individuals with other substance dependence (with exception of nicotine) were also excluded at initial visit.</pre_assignment_details>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Lack of a “no retrieval” control group. Lack of determination of plasma propranolol levels following the medicated retrieval session. The sample size was insufficient to assess the more distal effects at 1-week follow-up.</limitations_and_caveats>
