  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to assess the rate of patients with psycho-cognitive
      troubles among hospitalised elderly patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      It also aims to assess this rate among patients 1) when the geriatrics mobile unit is
      involved in the screening of these troubles and 2) when it is not.

      All the patients (75 and older) hospitalised in the internal medicine department of a
      suburban Parisian hospital are included in the study and their psycho-cognitive functions
      assessed by a geriatrics physician, using 3 validated tests.

      The result of this screening provides the rate of psycho-cognitive troubles among patients
      that would not have been tested by a geriatrics physician in usual care. It assesses the
      interest of a systematic evaluation of elderly patients by the geriatric mobile unit.
