    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the glycemic control during and following aerobic
      exercise using either an open or closed-loop insulin delivery system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, randomized crossover study evaluating the performance
      of a closed-loop insulin delivery system using a subcutaneous glucose sensor and an external
      insulin pump and comparing it to an open-loop delivery system during aerobic exercise.
      Subject participation will be for a maximum of 16 weeks including an outpatient study (up to
      6 days) and two inpatient studies (one closed-loop; the other open-loop). The closed- and
      open-loop visit consists of approximately 67 hours over 4 days and 3 nights.

          <description>Four day inpatient visit during which insulin administration was dictated by standard of care. Subject determines basal rate, meal bolusing, and any correction boluses using her/his normal regimen. Health Care Provider intervention only when dictated by protocol or determined necessary by the Health Care Professionals monitoring the study.</description>

          <description>Four day inpatient visit during which insulin administration was determined autonomously by a glycemic control algorithm, with the exception of pre-meal bolus determined by study protocol. Subject performs no adjustment to insulin dosage.
