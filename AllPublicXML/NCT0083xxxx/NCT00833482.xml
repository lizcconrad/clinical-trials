  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effects of voriconazole, 200 mg, administered twice daily (BID), on
      the steady-state pharmacokinetics of atazanavir administered as atazanavir/ritonavir, 300/100
      mg once daily (QD), in healthy participants with functional CYP2C19 alleles. The study also
      reviews the effects of atazanavir/ritonavir, 300/100 mg QD, on the pharmacokinetics of
      voriconazole, 200 mg, BID in healthy participants with functional CYP2C19 alleles.
