    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is twofold. First, we will attempt to examine the role that
      emotion regulation and self-presentation play as potential moderators in the expressive
      writing paradigm. We hypothesize that expressive writing participants who demonstrate greater
      abilities to regulate their emotions at baseline will improve more on our outcome measures.
      We also hypothesize that those expressive writing participants who demonstrate higher levels
      of self-presentation at baseline will improve less on our outcome measures.

      The second aim of the study has two related objectives. First, we will attempt to investigate
      whether the expressive writing intervention can increase and enhance an individual's emotion
      regulation abilities. Related to this, we will then go on to examine whether emotion
      regulation can be looked at as a potential mechanism of action in the expressive writing
      procedure. Related to these two objectives, we hypothesize that in comparison to the control
      group, participants in the expressive writing condition will show increases in their ability
      to regulate their emotions from baseline to four week follow up. Moreover, we predict that
      greater gains in emotion regulation abilities for the expressive writing participants will be
      significantly related to greater gains in outcome measures.
