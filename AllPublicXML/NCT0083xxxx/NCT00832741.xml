  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether secretion of incretin hormones is intact
      and to what extent endogenous as well as exogenous GLP-1 controls postprandial glucose
      excursions in patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus.

    <textblock>
      GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones secreted from specific endocrine celles in the gut.
      Stimulus for secretion is prescence of carbohydrates, fat and protein in the gut. The
      incretin hormones controls postprandial glucose excursions through stimulation of
      insulinsecretion as well as inhibition of glucagon and gastric emptying.The effects of GLP-1
      on insulin secretion and glucagon inhibition are glucose dependent and the risc of
      hypoglycemia is therefore negligible when the hormone is administered in supra physiological
      concentrations.Furthermore, some animal studies suggest that GLP-1 has a trofic effect on the
      betacells and the hormone has been shown to replenish intracellular stores of insulin.
      Because the main bloodglucose lowering effect of GLP-1 has been thought to be due to
      increased insulin secretion, analouges of the hormone has been developed for the treatment of
      type-2 diabetes. So far, relatively little is known about the effect of GLP-1 in type-1
      diabetes.It possible, that GLP-1 in combination with insulin (possibly mainly through its
      effect on glucagon inhibition and gastric emptying) could reduce the need for exogenous
      insulin with a concomitant reduced risc of hypoglycemia. Without compromising the target
      glucemic control. This study focuses of the postprandial bloodglucose lowering effects of
      endogenous as well as exogenous GLP-1 in patients with type-1 diabetes according to residual
      betacell function and glycemic control.Furthermore, the endogenous secretion of incretin
      hormones in patients with type-1 diabetes mellitus will be compared to that of matched normal
      controls.
