    <textblock>
      This study is to follow-up with workers from a local company that had exposure to TCE that
      may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease. We hope to learn more about TCE exposure and
      Parkinson's disease. Eligible participants will be those who participated in previous
      research study entitled &quot;Survey of Selected Exposures and Neurologic Symptoms in an
      Industrial Population&quot;
