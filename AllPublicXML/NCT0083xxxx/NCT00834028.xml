    <textblock>
      This project will include at least 40 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who will
      receive transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) as a sole method for the management.
      The serum is collected before and at the 3rd and 7th day after TACE. The serum levels of
      vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin 2, endostatin and cathepsin L are
      determined. All patients will be evaluated according to the TNM system for the cancer staging
      before and 3 months after each session of treatment. The vascularity of tumor, the drug and
      the dose used for embolization, and the area of infarction will be recorded. These data will
      be compared with the clinical courses of the patients to obtain the most suitable way in the
      management of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the traditional method for the palliative
      management of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This method will cause tissue
      hypoxia in area of embolization. Several proangiogenic factors will be induced by the
      condition of hypoxia. This may have the possibility to promote the proliferation of the
      residual cancer cells. However, there is no study to clarify this issue. This project will
      determine the serial changes of serum proangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth
      factor, angiopoietin 2), antiangiogenic factor (endostatin) and cathepsin L before and after
      TACE. These data will be compared with the clinical courses of the patients to obtain the
      most suitable way in the management of these patients.

      This project will include at least 40 patients with HCC who will receive TACE as a sole

      cathepsin L are determined. All patients will be evaluated according to the TNM system for

      tumor, the drug and the dose used for embolization, and the area of infarction will be
      recorded.
