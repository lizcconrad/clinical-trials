  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the automated data
      collection in the Zephyr device as compared to manual testing results for atrial and
      ventricular pacing thresholds. The secondary objectives include: to compare the in-clinic
      time needed to retrieve and document the automated device measurements for all tests to the
      additional time needed to manually measure sensing, impedance and thresholds for the same
      patient; to compare the accuracy of the automated device test results to manual testing
      results; evaluate the percentage of patients who are recommended for ACapTM Confirm
      utilization.

      The Primary Hypotheses are:

        1. The values reported from ACapTM Confirm will be within 0.125 V of the value that is
           obtained manually in clinic.

        2. The values reported from VentricularAutoCaptureTM will be within 0.125 V of the value
           that is obtained manually in clinic.
