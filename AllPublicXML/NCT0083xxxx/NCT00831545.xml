    <textblock>
      The study implies a 2 step study design. Patients are enrolled into 3 separate groups for
      melanoma, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. In the first step, 21 patients per disease
      group are enrolled. If &gt;=2 objective responses (SD, PR, or CR) out of 21 evaluable patients
      are observed, enrollment continues for other 45 patients as a whole, where response will be
      positively evaluated if &gt;=10 patients will respond. If &lt;2 objective responses out of 21
      evaluable patients per disease group are observed, this(ese) group(s) will no longer be
      treated with temozolomide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytological/histological diagnosis of either melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and
             breast;

          -  Brain metastases &gt;=1 cm presenting or in progression following &gt;=4 weeks time interval

             therapies;

          -  Magnetic resonance imaging suspected brain metastases; patients with brain lesion(s)
             not univocal as brain metastases must have negative radiolabeled leukocyte brain scan
             to rule out infectious non-malignant disease; all neuroradiological studies (baseline
             and treatment outcome evaluation), except for emergency exams must be performed after
             10 days of unchanged schedule of dexamethasone, and obtained in the
             axial-coronal-sagittal planes in T1 and T2 before and after gadolinium enhancement.

          -  Presence of al least one bidimensionally measurable and not previously irradiated
             metastasis.

          -  Age &lt;=70 years.

          -  Performance status 0-2 (ECOG-WHO scale).

          -  Blood leukocytes &gt;=3.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt;=100 x 10^9/L.

             during the first 2 months of treatment.

          -  Previous whole brain irradiation.

          -  Brain metastases eligible to neurosurgery or stereotactic radiation therapy.

          -  Previous or current malignancies at other sites with the exception of adequately
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or basal and squamous carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Acute infection requiring intravenous antibiotics.

          -  Severe vomiting or medical condition which could interfere with oral medication
