  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Effective use of Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT)
      depends on the accuracy and safety of RDT based treatment practices and on factors related to
      the health delivery system. We propose to study the accuracy and safety of RDT based
      diagnosis and treatment of febrile illness, health system determinants of effective use of
      RDTs and the public health outcomes of RDT based ACT for malaria.A cluster randomised trial
      of RDT based versus clinical judgment based treatment of febrile illness on the incidence of
      malaria in &lt;48 month old children will be conducted. Health Centres will be randomly
      allocated to RDT based treatment or clinical judgment based treatment arm and children under
      2years of age from the catchment area of each health centre will be followed for 2 years. The
      cost effectiveness of RDT based approach will be compare with the clinical judgement based
      treatment.

      Two-stage, four component study Stage I - Component A: Accuracy of RDT and the outcome of
      treatment based on RDT results Primary outcome:What is the sensitivity and specificity of
      Paracheck cassettes in Ghana to diagnose malaria?

      Stage 1 - Component B: delivery system determinants of effective RDT based ACT Primary
      outcome: What are the delivery system determinants of effective RDT based ACT?

      Stage 2 - Component A: effects of restricted use of ACTs based on RDT results: a randomised
      controlled trial Primary outcome: Incidence of malaria (fever + any level of parasite
      density) in &lt; 48 month-old children

      Stage 2 - component B: Cost effectiveness analysis:

      Primary outcome:What is the cost effectiveness of RDT based ACT for treatment of children
      under 4 years compared with ACT based on clinical judgement?

    <description>Study children attending RDT+ACT HCs with a febrile illness will be tested with an RDT to confirm malaria and treated with ACT only if they have a positive test for malaria parasite. However if there are signs suggestive of other co-morbidities they will be treated with appropriate medicines in addition to AS+AQ.</description>
