      Background:

        -  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs when the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells
           (beta cells) in the pancreas, resulting in their death.

        -  Insulin injections currently are the best method for controlling blood sugar in
           individuals with T1D. However, animal studies have shown that the drugs sitagliptin and
           lansoprazole can help reverse beta cell damage or develop new beta cells. In addition,
           Diamyd has been shown to weaken the immune process that attacks pancreatic beta cells.

      Objectives:

        -  To find out whether a combination treatment of sitagliptin, lansoprazole, and Diamyd
           will help maintain functioning beta cells and/or cause new beta cells to form.

        -  To determine how the drug combination affects insulin doses and blood sugar control.

        -  To determine whether the drug combination affects the immune response involved in T1D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the end result of immune mediated beta-cell destruction. It is
      generally accepted that at the time of T1D is diagnosed, an individual has lost most (60-80%)
      of his/her beta cell function. The loss of insulin-producing beta cells is believed to occur
      over a period of months to years and individuals can retain some endogenous insulin
      production even years after clinical diagnosis of diabetes. The presence of residual beta
      cell mass may signify a complex interplay between the auto-destructive immune response and
      the capacity for limited beta cell regeneration. When initiated at T1D onset,
      immunosuppression has been shown to preserve beta cell function, but with significant and
      limiting toxicities. Selectively targeting the pathogenic T-cells involved in T1D development
      and progression could achieve the same objective with less toxicity. Various studies of the
      non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes have demonstrated
      that administering glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), a beta cell autoantigen, can prevent
      the immune destruction and delay or prevent diabetes onset. Preclinical studies have also
      identified several growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), glucagon-like
      peptide 1 (GLP-1), and gastrin, that appear to promote beta cell proliferation. We seek to
      test the potential for preserving beta cell function early in the disease course of T1D by
      combining antigen-specific immunomodulation with regenerative stimuli.
