    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and initial indications of efficacy resulting
      from multiple doses of CAVATAK injected directly into solid tumours of the Head and Neck that
      have been confirmed to express ICAM-1 and DAF.

      CAVATAK (Coxsackievirus A21) is a naturally occurring common cold virus that preclinical
      research indicates can preferentially infect and kill cancer cells expressing the receptors
      ICAM-1 and/or DAF. This virus is known to cause self limiting upper respiratory infections
      and has been used previously to challenge therapies against the common cold. The virus is not
      generically modified.

      The study proposes to administer CAVATAK to three cohorts each of three patients. The first
      cohort will receive a single dose, the second cohort will receive three doses, and the final
      cohort will receive six doses. There will a 48 hour interval between repeated doses.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of CVA21 given by
      intratumoural injection in the treatment of recurrent, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma
      of the head and neck by measuring primary and field tumour status and adverse effects.

      Secondary objectives of the study are:

        1. Indirect measurements of efficacy by measuring appropriate biomarkers in serum and
           tumour biopsy samples for viral replication, induction of apoptosis and anti-tumour
           immune responses.

        2. To determine the time course of potential primary and secondary viraemia.

        3. To characterise the time course of the anti-CVA21 antibody response after administration
           of CVA21

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate
             in the study.

          2. Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma
             of the head or neck currently documented as &quot;progressive disease&quot;

          3. Head and neck cancer patients with at least one tumour mass where the tumour mass is
             accessible for intratumoural injection and can be measured at periodic intervals for
             tumour size using callipers and/or ultrasound.

          4. All patients to have histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
             neck (excluding nasopharyngeal) that had recurred or relapsed after surgery and/or
             radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.

          5. The longest diameter of the target injectable tumour being no greater than 6 cm or no
             less than 1 cm in the longest diameter.

          6. The tumour mass to be intratumourally injected to be easily accessible for injection
