    <textblock>
      Treatment in stroke units compared with treatment in general medical wards reduces the odds
      of being dead or disabled. Little is known about which components of acute stroke care that
      is responsible for this benefit.

      Early mobilisation is one of the features of stroke unit care. In Scandinavia, any
      intervention aimed to reduce the time to the first out of bed episode has been focused in
      order to prevent complications.

      However, therapeutic interventions for cerebral revascularisation and a more intensive unit
      approach for observation may postpone mobilisation. The aim of the present study is to
      identify whether early mobilisation (&lt; 24 hours after admittance to hospital)reduce
      disability and mortality compared with mobilisation after 24 hours.

      The study is a prospective, randomised controlled study with blinded assessment at the end of
      follow up. Patients admitted to the Stroke Unit, Akershus University Hospital less than 24
      hours after stroke during 2009 - 2011 are screened for recruitment. Patients are randomly
      assigned to either mobilisation out of bed within 24 hours from admittance to hospital or
      mobilisation after 24 hours. Except early contra late mobilisation all patients receive
      standard stroke unit care.

      Patients with modified Rankin Scale 0 and 1, patients with a secondary intracerebral
      hemorrhage, patients receiving thrombolysis or patients requiring palliative care are
      excluded.

      All patients are assessed at admittance, discharge and 3 months poststroke. Investigations at
      admittance include standard blood sample, CT/MRI scan, EKG and ultrasound of carotid
      arteries.

      Main outcome is mortality and disability 3 months poststroke. Secondary outcome measures are
      neurological deficits (NIH), morbidity, complications, cognitive function reflected by Mini
      Mental State Examination and emotional function (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale) .

      Results from this study may add important knowledge about how and when to start mobilisation
      of patients with acute stroke.
