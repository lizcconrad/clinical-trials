  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of an antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) regimen consisting of raltegravir (RAL) and darunavir (DRV)/ritonavir (RTV) as
      first-line therapy in treatment-na√Øve participants.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the remarkable strides made in the treatment of HIV-1-infected persons over the last
      decade, current first-line ART regimens are imperfect. The ideal combination, unlike some
      current first-line options, would have uncompromised efficacy in the presence of transmitted
      drug-resistant variants. The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative
      proportion of ART-naive participants experiencing virologic failure at or prior to week 24
      after initiating raltegravir (RAL) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/RTV).

      The study will last 52 weeks. All participants will follow the same treatment schedule and
      take RAL plus DRV/RTV orally daily for the duration of the trial.

      After entry, all participants will have scheduled visits at weeks 1, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, and
      52. Medical/medication history, blood and urine collection, and liver function tests will
      occur at screening. A targeted physical exam and concomitant medications history will occur
      at all study visits. Blood and urine collection and liver function tests will occur at most
      study visits. For females, a pregnancy test will occur at screening and study entry.

      RAL and DRV were provided by the study. RTV was not provided by the study.

    <measure>Proportion of Participants With Virologic Failure After Initiating RAL Plus DRV/RTV at or Prior to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of study treatment to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic failure is defined as: at week 12, confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 1000 copies/ml or confirmed rebound from the week 4 value by &gt;0.5 log10 copies/ml (for subjects with week 4 value &lt;= 50 copies/ml, confirmed rebound to &gt;50 copies/ml); at week 24 or later, confirmed value &gt; 50 copies/ml. Viral load confirmation was scheduled 7-35 days after initial virologic failure. The proportion was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. An adaptation of Greenwood's variance estimate was used in constructing the confidence interval.</description>

        <description>Plasma trough concentrations (ng/ml) of Darunavir (DRV) below the detection limit (50 ng/ml) were replaced by half the corresponding lower limit of quantitation. Geometric mean of trough concentrations obtained within the prescribed trough time (within 20-28 hours after the last DRV dose) was computed for each participant. For participants who experienced virologic failure (see primary outcome measure definition), only those concentrations on or before virologic failure confirmation were used in the geometric mean computation.</description>
