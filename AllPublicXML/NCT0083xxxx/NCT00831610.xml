      The purpose of this study is to quantify the skin sensation of the anterior abdominal wall of
      the post-bariatric patients submitted to anchor-line abdominoplasty without flap undermining.

      Additional purposes were: quantify topographically the abdominal skin sensation of the Normal
      weight, Morbid Obese and Former Morbid Obese after bariatric surgery (before and after the
      abdominoplasty - excess skin surgical removal without flap undermining -&gt; Anchor Line
      Abdominoplasty).

      Abdominoplasty performed in post-bariatric patients presents more post-operative
      complications than in non post-bariatric patients. Surgical techniques that provokes less
      complications are required.

      Anchor-line abdominoplasty is a technique published in the years 1950 as well the first
      bariatric proceedings. Abdominoplasty without flap undermining is feasible in pendular
      abdominal wall of the former morbidly obese women with scarred abdomen.

      Classical abdominoplasty (with flap undermining) is known to impair significantly the skin
      sensation. Post-bariatric abdominoplasty without flap undermining keeps the skin sensation
      unaltered since the early post-operative period.

      Now that the post-bariatric anchor-line abdominoplasty improves the abdominal wall contour by
      removing the exceeding, pendular and striated skin saving the perforant skin sensory nerves.
      Could this technique improve the skin sensation of the anterior abdominal wall of the
      post-bariatric patients?
