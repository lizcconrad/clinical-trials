      Background:

        -  Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and associated complications are major contributors to the global
           disease burden. T2D is already a major health threat in populations in developed
           countries and is rapidly taking hold in the developing world.

        -  It is believed that understanding the complex interplay between genetic and lifestyle
           characteristics in the etiology of T2D and related complications will lead to the
           development of better preventive and therapeutic strategies. In Addition, the results of
           this project will facilitate our understanding of causes of diabetes in African
           Americans, other US and world populations

      Objectives:

        -  To conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify susceptibility genetic
           variants for diabetes among the Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria.

        -  To enroll and examine 300 unrelated cases of T2D and 300 ethnicity-matched Yoruba
           controls.

        -  To conduct resequencing of positional candidate gene/loci to identify likely functional
           variants in a subset of the cohort.

        -  To conduct replication studies of the top-100 scoring variants in three independent
           African and European ancestry samples.

        -  To investigate whether diabetes-associated variants discovered in European populations
           increase diabetes risk in West Africans.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients 25 years of age with confirmed T2D who are newly diagnosed or on treatment of
           Yoruba ethnicity in Ibadan, Nigeria. Control subjects are nondiabetics ethnically
           matched to patients.

      Design:

        -  The study design for both patients and controls consists of the following steps:

        -  Discuss informed consent process and obtain signed informed consent form. Informed
           consent will be administered by trained clinic staff.

        -  Assign study ID (barcode)

        -  Administer questionnaires

        -  Obtain spot urine sample

        -  Measure blood pressure

        -  Obtain anthropometric measurements including body composition

        -  Perform finger prick for blood glucose level

        -  Obtain venous blood samples

        -  Perform eye examination

        -  On the following day, perform confirmatory blood glucose for the small subset of
           participants requiring confirmation of previous test result DNA extraction of stored
           samples will be done at either the National Institutes of Health or the laboratory in
           Nigeria.

        -  GWAS will be conducted using publicly available software packages.

      This research protocol is designed to study the genetic basis of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in a
      broad range of populations in the United States and abroad. This project takes advantage of
      the well established infrastructure and success of Dr. Rotimi s international genetic
      epidemiology study of T2D funded as an R01 grant by NIDDK while he was at Howard University.
      This parent project is ongoing in four major ethnic groups in Nigeria (Yoruba and Ibo) and
      Ghana (Akan and Gaa). At completion in 2013 and given current projections, we anticipate
      enrolling about 2,000 cases and 2000 controls from the five centers in West Africa (Enugu,
      Ibadan and Lagos in Nigeria; Accra and Kumasi in Ghana). However, current projection
      indicates that the enrollment of Yoruba cases and controls will be short by about 300 cases
      and 300 controls. It is critically important to supplement the enrollment of Yoruba
      participants from another community in the Ibadan metropolitan area in Nigeria. Therefore,
      the original goal of the current project is to enroll additional 300 cases of T2D and 300
      ethnically matched Yoruba controls to facilitate the conduct of genome-wide association study
      (GWAS) and candidate gene/loci studies in West Africans. Other current and future projects
      will increase the number of subjects for future genome-wide association studies (GWAS),
      linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, and functional studies in different ethnically-defined
      populations. Each project will aim to enroll ethnically balanced cases and controls with the
      goal of facilitating the conduct of GWAS and candidate gene/loci studies in a broad range of
      populations. Overall, these studies aim to further (or in some cases be the first) such
      large-scale efforts to understand the genetic basis of T2D in individuals of varying
      backgrounds including African and Mexican ancestries. Identified candidate genes/loci will be
      investigated by re-sequencing and functional studies will be conducted to identify
      susceptibility variants for diabetes and associated complications including obesity,
      hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy. Additionally, these samples will be
      used to study genetic variation in the context of how participants of different ancestry
      respond to drugs and other environmental factors and how this variation may have shaped
      population history. Given past activities, it is also anticipated that this resource will
      form the basis of multiple collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH intramural
      researchers and non-NIH scientists. Each subsequent population that is added to this study
      over time will use the same procedures that were originally approved for ongoing work among
      West Africans.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Cases Men and women with confirmed type 2 diabetes mellitus that are either on treatment
        for diabetes or newly diagnosed with blood sugar reading on more than one occasion
        exceeding or equal to 126 mg/dl. These persons must be above the age of 25 years. In this
        regard, all newly diagnosed participants will be required to visit the clinic on the
        following day to perform a fasting blood glucose test to confirm previous results.

        Controls Men and women with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) less than 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l).
        Controls must be above age 25 years and should be ethnically matched to the cases. Enrolled
        cases and controls have to be unrelated. Therefore, only one person may be enrolled from
        each family unless they are husband and wife.

        Attempts will be made to enroll an equal number of men and women. To ensure that ethnic
        distribution is maintained in each study, we are proposing to enroll ethnically-matched
        participants relevant to each study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        People who do not meet the above criteria (e.g., younger than 24, without the blood sugar
        requirements, etc). No more than one non-spouse member of each family. No prisoners,
        pregnant women or fetuses will be included in this study.
