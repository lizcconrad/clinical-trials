        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Non-institutionalized subjects consisting of university students and members of the
             community at large.

          -  All subjects selected for this study will be males 18 to 45 (inclusive) years of age.
             Weight of the subjects shall not be more than 15% ± from the normal for height and
             body frame (Metropolitan Life, 1993, Height, Weight, Body Chart).

          -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 21 days of
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood
             pressure, general observations, and history.

        At the end of the study the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of interim
        history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements.

        Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 21 days before the beginning of
        the first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.

        Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following:

        Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white blood cell
        count (with differential)

        Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, and alkaline
        phosphatase

        Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood,
        and cells

        HIV Screen: (pre-study only)

        Hepatitis-B, C Screen: (pre-study only)

        Drugs of Abuse Screen: (pre-study and at each dosing period check-in)

        Subjects will be selected if all above are normal. Electrocardiograms of all participating
        subjects will be recorded before initiation of the study and filed with each subject's case
        report forms.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption, drug addiction, or serious
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy,
             asthma, diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal
             range may be retested. If the clinical values are outside the range on retesting the
             subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical
             investigator deems the result to not be significant.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             should be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects who use tobacco in any form will not be eligible to participate in the study.
             Three months abstinence is required.

          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at each dosing period
             check-in. Subjects found to have urine concentrations of any of the tested drugs will
             not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to the first dosing of the study.

          -  Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the
             first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects who have been exposed to known hepatic enzyme inducing or inhibiting agents
             within (30) days prior to dosing will not be allowed to participate.
