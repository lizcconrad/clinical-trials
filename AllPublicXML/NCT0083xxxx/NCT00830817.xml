  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate primarily the safety and tolerability and
      secondarily the efficacy of topically applied WBI-1001 cream in patients with mild to
      moderate psoriasis. Double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study of 36 patients,
      treated for 28 days plus a 7 day follow-up.in which the patients were divided into six
      cohorts: Cohort 1 at 0.5% QD;Cohort 2 at 0.5% BID; Cohort 3 at 1.0% QD; Cohort 4 at 1.0% BID;
      Cohort 5 at 2.0% QD; Cohort 6 at 2.0% BID.Efficacy assessed by PGA,target lesion assessment
      and BSA. Safety assessed through vital signs, ECG, AEs and Plasma PK via Cmin, Cmax,Tmax and
      AUCo-t.

      Patients initiated screening within 4 weeks of commencing study treatment. Based on
      progression of the study, at day 0 patients were assigned to one of six treatment Cohorts.
      Patients were randomized to treat all areas except the face, scalp, groin and genital areas.
      Patients in Cohort 1 were treated on one side with a thin layer of active cream and the other
      with placebo; in the absence of significant AEs by 14 days after the last treatment in the
      Cohort escalation to the next Cohort was allowed, and each Cohort respectively.

      During the treatment period patients visited the study centre weekly for safety, tolerability
      and efficacy assessment. On these study visit days blood draws were done between 7.00 and
      10.00am prior to that morning's application of cream.

      The study enrolled healthy male and female patients aged 18-65 y.o. with clinical diagnosis
      of stable plaque psoriasis for &gt;months affecting a maximum of 6% of BSA with a minimum of
      0.5% BSA on each side of the body and a minimum of one plaque at least 2x2 cm on each side
      excluding elbow and knee.
