  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of istaroxime in patients
      hospitalized for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) not requiring inotropic
      therapy.This will be done by comparing the hemodynamic effect of a 24-hour infusion of three
      different doses of the drug versus placebo. Efficacy will be measured as a change in
      Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure from pre-infusion to 6 hours after infusion start.
      Secondary objectives will include the evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety through
      assessment of cardiovascular and renal tolerability as well as changes in biological markers
      such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin I (TNI), and the neurohormones renin and
      aldosterone and also to assess the pharmacokinetics of istaroxime and its metabolites.

      The 32-day study includes a 48-hour screening period, a 30-minute to 2-hour pre treatment
      period, a maximum 2-hour period for randomization and measurement of baseline values, a
      24-hour treatment period, and a 96-hour post-treatment period. A 25-day follow-up period
      including a visit on Day 30 will take place after the active phase of the study When
      considered to be eligible, a first cohort of 88 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to
      receive 24-hrs treatment with istaroxime 0.5 μg/kg/min or placebo. If after the continuous
      safety monitoring and interim analyses the DMC determines that there are no safety issues
      with this dose, a second cohort of 88 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive
      24-hrs treatment with istaroxime 1.0 μg/kg/min or placebo. If after the continuous safety
      monitoring and interim analyses of the second cohort the DMC determines that there are no
      safety issues with this dose, a third cohort of 88 patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio
      to receive 24-hrs treatment with istaroxime 1.5 μg/kg/min or placebo. In all cohorts,
      patients will receive standard of care therapy.
