  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether sclerotherapy using a 25% dextrose and 1%
      lidocaine solution is an efficacious treatment for patients with chronic Achilles
      tendinopathy who have failed a home based, heavy load eccentric training program.

      The purpose of this research project is to optimize the clinical outcome of patients with
      Achilles tendinopathy. Patients who fail a standardized physical therapy regiment (eccentric
      training protocol) will be randomly allocated into two groups with one group receiving an
      injection of hypertonic glucose and Lidocaine (sclerosing solution) and the other receiving
      an injection of Lidocaine (control). Neovascularisation (growth of new blood vessels and
      nerves into a damaged area of the tendon) appears to be associated with pain and subsequently
      a decrease in function and use of the affected tendon. Results of an observational study in
      Sweden revealed that in all patients for which eccentric training was unsuccessful
      neovascularisation was present. Sclerosis of neovessels appears to be successful in removing
      the pain associated with Achilles tendinopathy in both mid-portion and enthesitis patients.
      However, there are no studies that have administered this technique to a homogenous patient
      population in a prospective, controlled and randomized manner. In addition, there are no
      studies that have compared the effects of eccentric training in healthy individuals versus
      patients with painful Achilles tendinopathy in a controlled longitudinal study. It is
      expected that patients for whom eccentric training is unsuccessful and who subsequently
      receive sclerosing therapy will show a statistically significant improvement in pain and
      function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults 18 years of age and older with a minimum of 3 months of clinically determinant
             history and symptoms (pain) consistent with unilateral Achilles tendinopathy
             (enthesitis or mid-portion) as diagnosed by a sport medicine physician.

          -  Participants are not required to have tried other treatments, however, those who have
             tried other treatments (except injection treatments) including, but not restricted to,
             oral NSAIDs, topical NSAIDs, shoe modifications, and physical/athletic therapy will
             not be restricted from the study

          -  Provide informed consent for the controlled longitudinal study and RCT

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with physical ailments precluding them from performing the eccentric
             training program

          -  Worker's Compensation Board (WCB) and elite athletes (varsity, national and
             professional level).

          -  Individuals younger than 18 years of age will be excluded from this trial due to the
             complicating factors of musculoskeletal immaturity and the lack of relevant research
             of Achilles tendinopathy and neovascular bundles in this population.

          -  Previous Achilles tendon rupture of the tendon in question

          -  Individuals that have received any type of injection in or around the Achilles tendon

          -  Known allergy to dextrose based sclerosing agent or other contraindications

          -  Known allergy to Lidocaine
