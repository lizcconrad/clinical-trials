      The purpose of the study is to determine if a program of regular exercise can help reduce
      asthma symptoms and also reduce the inflammation caused by asthma. If successful, this would
      allow regular exercise to be recommended as a therapy for people with asthma, which could
      possibly reduce the amount of medicine that people with asthma need to control their asthma
      symptoms.

      This is a randomized, controlled, parallel-design study of the effectiveness of exercise
      therapy as add-on therapy in the treatment of mild to moderately severe asthma.

      105 men and women between the ages of 18-50 years with asthma will be randomly assigned to
      one of two treatment groups: exercise therapy or control. The exercise therapy protocol is
      detailed below. The control group will receive usual asthma care. The control group will be
      instructed to maintain their current sedentary activity level, i.e. not to begin a formal or
      informal exercise program. In order to standardize contact with study personnel between the
      two groups the control group will be seen three times a week for clinic visits (exercise
      group will have sessions three times a week). The primary outcome measures are asthma control
      (asthma symptom score) and asthma-related inflammation. Secondary outcomes include
      exacerbation rate, asthma-related quality of life, generic quality of life, lung function,
      airways hyper-reactivity, and cardiovascular fitness. The effect of exercise therapy on
      inflammatory markers in blood, and sputum will be assessed by comparing results obtained at
      study completion versus those obtained at baseline.
