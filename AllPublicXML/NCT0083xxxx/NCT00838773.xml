      This grant involves 24 social networks of young men who have sex with men, Roma, and young
      high-risk heterosexual adult men and women living in Hungary, Bulgaria and Russia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For over 4 years, our international collaborative research team has carried out a social
      network HIV prevention intervention trial with community populations of young men who have
      sex with men (YMSM), disadvantaged ethnic minority Roma (Gypsies), and high-risk heterosexual
      adult (YHA) women and men in Hungary, Bulgaria and Russia. Eastern Europe has seen a sharp
      increase in HIV incidence, and social network interventions are high in cultural relevance
      because post-communist populations have a long history of trusting and relying upon their
      personal networks more than their governments. Across the three countries represented in our
      research during the past funding period, we enrolled social networks of YMSM, Roma, and YHAs.
      This study will renew our international collaboration to extend this network intervention
      approach. Our study, to date, has worked with very small independent friendship groups
      (usually composed of 5-6 people) as &quot;egocentric&quot; social networks.

    <description>All study participants (including those in control condition networks) receive HIV/AIDS/STD risk reduction counseling at baseline, as well as testing and treatment or treatment referral for STDs and HIV infection. STD/HIV testing and treatment or treatment referral are provided at each followup point. This constitutes the control intervention.</description>

    <description>Leaders of networks in the experimental condition will participate in a 9-session intervention training program that will inspire and assist leaders to communicate HIV prevention risk reduction messages with their immediate friends. The first five sessions will focus on HIV risk predictors including HIV/AIDS knowledge, safer sex peer norms, condom attitudes, condom use intentions, and self-efficacy in remaining safe. The remaining four sessions will reinforce the leaders for continuing their HIV prevention communications and remind them of the topics during the main sessions.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:Members of a friendship group will be eligible for enrollment if they
        are of legal age to independently consent to participate in this study. In its review and
        approval of this protocol, the IRB at BotkinHospital, St. Petersburg, Russia verified and
        confirmed in writing to us that the age of research participation consent is 15. In its
        review and approval of this protocol, the IRB at the Health and Social Development
        Foundation determined that the age of research participation consent in Bulgaria is 16. In
        Hungary, the IRB at the Institute of Sociology at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences
        determined that the age of independent consent to participate in this study is 14.

        Exclusion Criteria:Individuals will be excluded from enrollment into the study if they are
        below the age for providing independent consent or are not capable of providing informed
        consent based on impairment due to the presence of sever psychopatology, substance use, or
        similar conditions observed at the time of informed consent. Social networks will be
        excluded from the study if: (1) more than 33% of named network members do not agree to
        participate; (2) fewer than 50% of members report occurrence of unprotected intercourse
        during the past 3 months at baseline; or (3) more than 10% of a network's members are also
        members of another network enrolled in the study.
