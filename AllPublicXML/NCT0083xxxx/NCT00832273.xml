  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VTI had established other clinical protocols to study the effects of ELAD® plus standard
      therapy compared with standard therapy alone in patients with acute on chronic (AOCH)
      (VTI-201, VTI-206) and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) (VTI-202) and acute alcoholic
      hepatitis (AAH). However, liver failure (LF) patients who do not qualify for other protocols
      may benefit from ELAD use. In order to accommodate physician requests for the use of ELAD in
      LF patients who do not qualify for open Protocols, without the need to resort to individual
      Emergency Use INDs for each case, VTI has developed a Treatment Protocol with Cost Recovery
      to provide for expanded access to ELAD for those with LF. This uncontrolled Treatment
      Protocol has been designed to provide expanded access to ELAD in subjects with LF while
      assuring that sufficient data are collected to adequately monitor ELAD safety when used in
      this setting at multiple centers in the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ELAD® therapy is designed to provide continuous liver support to a subject with compromised
      liver function, allowing time for the subject's native liver to regenerate to a healthy
      state, or to stabilize the subject until a suitable donor organ can be found for
      transplantation.
