  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if tetraplegic individuals with incomplete spinal
      cord injury (SCI) who remain unable to move their arms normally 1 year after their SCIs are
      able to sense and move the affected arm(s) better after 10-13 weeks of treatment with a new
      robotic therapy device.

      The hypothesis is that using the AMES device on the arm(s) of chronic tetraplegic subjects
      with incomplete SCI will result in improved strength, sensation, and functional movement in
      treated limb(s).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) affects over 200,000 people in the USA, with several
      thousand new injuries each year. Most recovery, following SCI, occurs in the six months
      following surgery. Further recovery after 12 months is unusual.

      In this study 20 subjects, more than 1 year post injury, will be enrolled to test the safety
      and efficacy of a new type of robotic therapy device known as the AMES device. The aim of
      this Phase I/II study is to investigate the use of assisted movement and enhanced sensation
      (AMES) technology in hand rehabilitation of incomplete SCI subjects.

    <description>The AMES device rotates the fingers-thumb and the wrist over a range of 30 degrees while vibrators stimulate the tendons attached to muscles that move the hand. A treatment consists of 20 minutes of fingers-thumb movement, followed by 10 minutes of wrist movement. The subject's task is to assist the motion of the device.</description>
