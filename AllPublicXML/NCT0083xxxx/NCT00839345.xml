  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine, whether the resistance to clopidogrel could be
      affected by higher doses of this drug, or by replacement of clopidogrel with another
      ADP-antagonist ticlopidine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation have to be
      treated by dual antiplatelet therapy, which standard part represents clopidogrel. The
      response to clopidogrel in population exhibits wide interindividual variability. According to
      some recent works, patients with clopidogrel resistance are in higher risk for recurrence of
      myocardial infarction in comparison with the patients with sufficient clopidogrel
      effectiveness. The treatment of clopidogrel resistance is still unknown. Our project should
      contribute to the better understanding of the clinical impact of clopidogrel resistance and
      its genetical determination. We will test the hypothesis, whether the clopidogrel resistance
      could be influenced by higher dose of this drug or by replacement to ticlopidine (ADP
      antagonist with different biotransformation in the liver). Therefore, 500 pts. will be tested
      to clopidogrel resistance. We expect 5-10% of resistent pts. This pts. will be treated by
      higher dose (150mg or 225mg/day) with repeated tests of clopidogrel effectiveness after each
      dose enhancement. If 225mg/day will be insufficient, clopidogrel will be replaced by
      ticlopidine with repeated test. We expect, that better definition of clinical and and genetic
      correlate of clopidogrel resistance will improve our knowledge of this disorder.
      Nevertheless, the achievement of sufficient effect of clopidogrel in some still resistant
      patients will lead to the improvement of the treatment

    <description>The intervention will involve the change of dosage or change of drug. The traditional maintenance dose of clopidogrel is 75 mg per day. We will test in non-responders to this classical dose higher doses up to 225mg per day. In patients,who will not respond to this 3times higher dose,clopidogrel will be replaced by ticlopidine.</description>
