      Primary Endpoint:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat + radiation therapy (RT) in
      patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. To assess the efficacy of vorinostat + RT in patients with LAPC as estimated by median
           overall survival.

        2. To determine the radiological response as assessed by regular computer tomography (CT)
           and/or dynamic contrast enhanced computer tomography (DCE-CT) among patients treated
           with vorinostat and RT.

        3. To evaluate the occurrence of symptoms and correlate to disease progression and
           tolerance to treatment using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Gastrointestinal Module
           (MDASI-GI) self-reporting tool.

        4. To correlate serum cytokine levels with symptoms and treatment outcomes.

      The Study Drugs:

      Vorinostat is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells.

      Study Drug Dose Level:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will begin receiving
      vorinostat. The dose you receive will be based on how many participants have been enrolled
      before you, and on the safety data available. The first group of 3 enrolled participants will
      be given low doses of vorinostat. If no intolerable side effects occur, the next group of 3
      will be enrolled at a higher dose level. The study doctor will tell you what dose you will be
      receiving and how it compares to the doses other participants have received. Up to 3 dose
      levels will be tested.

      Study Drug Administration:

      On each day that you receive radiation, you will take vorinostat (as a capsule taken by
      mouth) in the morning with food.

      Radiation:

      You will receive radiation once a day on Monday through Friday, except for holidays. This
      schedule will be continued for 5 1/2 weeks or 28 doses total. Each radiation treatment will
      usually last about 10-15 minutes.

      Surgical Evaluation:

      After completing radiation therapy, you will come back for a follow-up visit about 6-12 weeks
      later.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain on study for up to 5 1/2 weeks. You will be taken off-study early if the
      disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.

      This is an investigational study. Vorinostat is FDA approved and commercially available. The
      use of vorinostat for pancreatic cancer and in combination with radiation is investigational.
      At this time, this combination is being used in research only.

      Up to 37 patients will take part in the study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          2. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age. There will be no upper age restriction.

          3. Cytologic or histologic proof of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Patients can have
             tumor originating in any part of the pancreas. Islet cell tumors are not eligible.
             Only patients with non- metastatic, unresectable disease (American Joint Committee on
             Cancer (AJCC) 2002 stage T4 NX M0) are eligible. Patients who cannot undergo resection
             because of underlying medical problems are also eligible. Patients with regional nodal
             disease are eligible.

          4. All patients must be staged with a physical exam, chest x-ray/CXR, and
             contrast-enhanced helical thin-cut abdominal CT. Unresectability is defined by CT
             criteria: a) evidence of tumor extension to the celiac axis or superior mesenteric
             (SM) artery, or b) evidence on either CT or angiogram of occlusion of the SM vein or
             SM/ portal vein confluence. If a tumor does not meet this definition and is found to
             be unresectable at surgical exploration, then that tumor is considered unresectable.

          5. Patients may have received prior chemotherapy but not prior radiation therapy to the
             upper abdomen.

          6. Bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/ul. Platelets
             &gt;100,000/ul.

          7. Hepatic function: Total bilirubin less than 1.5mg/dL. If the patient required an
             endobiliary stent and/or external biliary drain, the bilirubin level must have
             declined on consecutive measurements indicating adequate biliary decompression;
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 5 times the upper limit of normal.

          8. Renal function: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &lt;/= 30 mg% and creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 mg%

          9. Patients must be willing to sign informed consent indicating that they are aware of
             the investigational nature of the study, and are aware that participation is
             voluntary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior abdominal radiotherapy.

          2. Participation in any other experimental drug study in the 30 days preceding initiation
             of treatment on the current study.

          3. Prior treatment with HDAC inhibitors (except valproic acid with a 30-day washout
             period)

          4. Prior history of cancer within the last five years except for basal cell carcinoma of
             the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix. Patients with previous malignancies but
             without evidence of disease for 5 years will be allowed to enter the trial.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential with either a positive or
             no pregnancy test at baseline. Women / men of childbearing potential not using a
             reliable contraceptive method (oral contraceptive, other hormonal contraceptive,
             intrauterine device, diaphragm or condom). (Postmenopausal women must have been
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential).
             Patients must agree to continue contraception for 30 days from the date of the last
             study drug administration.

          6. Serious, uncontrolled, concurrent infection(s) requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotics
             or nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be
             jeopardized by the complications of this therapy.

          7. Current treatment of active hepatitis virus or HIV infection with interferon,
             ribavirin, telbivudine, entecavir, lamivudine, adefovir, efavirenz, zidovudine,
             tenofovir, emtricitabine, or ritonavir.

          8. Psychiatric disorders rendering patients incapable of complying with the requirements
             of the protocol.

          9. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.
