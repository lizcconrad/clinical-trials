  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare health care delivery outcomes and costs achieved by
      two different approaches to health care delivery. The investigators will compare health
      outcomes for groups of adult patents with diabetes. One group will be managed by our
      traditional approach to diabetes care. The second group's care delivery is structured
      according to a design consistent with the Chronic Care Model (CCM).

      The study is comparing the effect of an intervention targeting a subset of the diabetic
      patients within a primary care practice on the resource utilization of resources and disease
      outcomes on the entire population of patients with diabetes in that practice. The effect will
      also be compared across the entire panel of patients assigned to the physicians in the 2 arms
      of the study.

    <description>The traditional arm is composed of primary care physicians who continue the health care delivery model existing for the 5 years prior to the study. The traditional includes the physician, a pool of resources including random assignment of diabetic educators and includes the entire panel of patients assigned to the PCP.</description>

    <description>The care management team is organized according to the chronic care model for health care delivery. They are supported by an information registry for diabetes, receive instruction in self-management, have redesigned their work flow to include delegation of functions to care managers who follow specific guidelines and protocols for managing diabetes</description>
