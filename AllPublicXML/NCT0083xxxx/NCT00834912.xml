  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the rate and extent of absorption of two Tramadol
      Contramid® OAD 300 mg controlled-release tablets from two different manufacturing sites,
      administered as 1 x 300 mg controlled-release tablet under fasting conditions. The effect of
      food on the to-be-marketed formulation was also assessed.

    <description>The area under the plasma concentration (AUC) curve was estimated by extrapolating to infinity AUC0-t. The extrapolation to infinity was done by regression with the last log-transformed data to estimate the terminal area by means of the line that maximized R'2 (coefficient of determination). The units are ng.h/mL.
