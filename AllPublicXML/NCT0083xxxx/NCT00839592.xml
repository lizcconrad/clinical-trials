      Acupuncture is potential to be an alternative treatment for primary insomnia. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture treatment on primary
      insomnia. This is a randomized single-blinded controlled trial. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to the electro-acupuncture group or the placebo acupuncture group. Patients will be
      put into groups and then compared.

    <description>Acupoints will be treated at bilateral Ear Shenmen, Sishencong (EX-HN1), Anmian, and unilateral Yintang (EX-HN3) and Baihui (GV20).
Acupuncture will be performed by a registered Chinese medicine practitioner. &quot;De qi&quot;(an irradiating feeling considered to be indicative of effective needling) is achieved if possible. An electric-stimulator (CEFAR Acus II, Lund, Sweden) will be connected to these needles to give an electric-stimulation in continuous wave, frequency of 4 Hz, 0.45 ms square wave pulses and constant current. The needles will be left for 30 min and then removed. Acupuncture treatment will consist of three sessions per week for 3 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Placebo Acupuncture</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Placebo needles designed by Streitberger (1998) will be used. The placebo needles are blunt needle that will not penetrate the skin during needle insertion. The handles of these placebo needles will slide over the needle when it is compressed, giving it the appearance of penetrating the skin. The placebo needles are inserted to the same acupoints as stated in the electroacupuncture group. The needles are held by a surgical tape or hair pin in hairy region to imitate the retention of needles. The needles are connected to an electric-stimulator with zero frequency and amplitude. The number, duration and frequency of the treatment sessions, and the intervention procedure will be the same for electro-acupuncture and placebo acupuncture.</description>
