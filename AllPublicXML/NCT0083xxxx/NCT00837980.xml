  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to generate a library of functional imaging and anatomical
      imaging for patients with head and neck cancers for evaluation of new radiotherapy strategies
      and planning techniques including IMRT. Secondary aims would be to observe the changes in the
      cancers as the treatment progresses as well as to define the biologically most active part of
      the tumor (biological target volume) which could be given more intensive treatment. Tumor
      volumes seen on different imaging modalities will be compared with a hope of finding an
      optimal imaging methodology for accurate visualization of the head and neck cancers

      Adult patients who have a head and neck cancer and are planned to receive chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy will be invited to participate in the study. Patients who are not in very good
      health, have diabetes or kidney failure will not be considered for the study. Also patients
      who can not undergo MRI scan or are allergic to contrast injection given prior to the scan or
      have had any other form of cancer (except skin cancer) will also be excluded from the study.
