  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is part of a program of research to improve management of type 2
      diabetes (T2DM) through a community-academic partnership that addresses cultural factors in
      disease management. Specific aims are to: 1. Strengthen a community-academic partnership with
      the immigrant Chinese community in San Francisco to improve diabetes management; 2. Adapt and
      test a behavioral diabetes intervention, Coping Skills Training, to addresses family and
      cultural issues in immigrant Chinese patients with T2DM; and 3. Disseminate the adapted
      Coping Skills Training Program findings via the community-academic partnership to the
      immigrant Chinese American community through service programs, ethnic media, and
      professional/scientific publications. A mixed-methods CBPR approach will be used to
      interpretively adapt a behavioral intervention to be culturally appropriate, and test its
      efficacy using a repeated measures design. Two historically significant social service and
      health agencies serving immigrant Chinese in San Francisco are collaborating with this
      nurse-led interdisciplinary research team.

      The goal of the culturally adapted Chinese Coping Skills Training (CCST) is to increase
      immigrant Chinese patients' skills and mastery in diabetes management by identifying and
      diminishing non-constructive coping responses to difficult social situations, while expanding
      the repertoire of positive coping responses and disease management behaviors. The CCST
      comprises a series of six small-group sessions focused on the topics of social problem
      solving, communication skills, cognitive behavior modification and conflict resolution. It
      also includes a review of basic diabetes management information.
