      This research study is designed to investigate the approaches to noninvasive detection and
      assessment of coronary vascular dysfunction in women by comparing the testing results from
      the invasive standard care diagnostic procedure Angiogram and from the additional noninvasive
      diagnostic procedure CMR Imaging. The investigators want to specifically study 375 female
      patients who have signs or symptoms suggestive of heart disease but don't have obstructive
      coronary artery disease. Two study sites (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and University of
      Florida) are recruiting participants.

      The standard of care procedures include demographics, review of recent clinical symptoms,
      review of medications being taken, a physical exam, pre-angiogram blood collection, chest
      x-ray, ECG and heart angiogram. The research procedures for this study are the cold pressor
      testing, blood/urine collection, health questionnaire, the post-angiogram ECG and cardiac
      MRI.

      Patients will be asked to undergo heart angiogram testing to test for abnormalities in their
      heart arteries. If the heart angiogram shows that the patients do not have blockages in major
      heart arteries, then the patients will have coronary flow reserve measurement test (as part
      of the heart angiogram) to determine whether the patients have abnormally functioning of the
      small heart arteries. This test will be performed by infusing the three drugs: adenosine,
      acetylcholine and nitroglycerin. The three drugs are naturally occurring substances and have
      been used for routine heart angiograms.

      Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging may help us more easily and non-invasively detect
      abnormalities in the inner layer of the heart muscle resulting from the abnormal function of
      the heart arteries. All the 375 participants will undergo baseline CMR imaging test and a
      subgroup of 200 participants will undergo a second CMR imaging test at their at least 1-year
      followup visit.

      Patients will be followed up using phone questionnaires at 6 weeks, 6 months for 5 years, and
      than annually for 20 years thereafter. Other procedures in this study include obtaining
      informed consent, review of demographics, physical examination, ECG, blood and urine tests,
      clinical symptoms, medications, questionnaires, etc. The core laboratories include Blood,
      Lipoprotein, Chemistry Core Lab, Reproductive Hormone Core Lab, Inflammatory Marker Core Lab,
      Oxidative Stress Core Lab, and Angiographic Core Lab. Additionally, GCRC at Cedars Sinai will
      process, store and ship samples as needed/required.
