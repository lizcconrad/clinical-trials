      This is a Phase 4, non-comparative, open-label, multi-center study. It is designed to
      determine the effectiveness of regular intranasal steroid use in alleviating allergic
      rhinitis nasal symptoms, when used alone or in combination with an oral antihistamine.
      Subjects will receive 200 mcg (2 puffs in each nostril) of mometasone furoate once a day. An
      oral antihistamine at the discretion of the physician may be added at Day 28 (Visit 2), if
      patients fail to improve nasal symptoms.
