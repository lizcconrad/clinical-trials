  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mobilization of fluid from the legs with the Normatec pump in patients with right heart
      failure, may empty the &quot;reservoir&quot; in the legs from excessive fluid, enabling fluid overload
      to collect there rather than in the liver or in other third spaces. Thus, we hypothesize that
      patients will lose weight, feel better, look better, be less prone to infections in their
      legs and to congestion of the liver.

      The protocol will be divided into 2 parts:

        1. The initial pumping phase will be an in-hospital study, short term study. Patients will
           be randomly assigned to conventional/conservative treatment or to pump therapy. Within
           24 hours of admission patients assigned to pump therapy will be recruited for the study
           and will begin therapy according to the protocol outlined in the table below. These
           patients will not be given diuretics unless required to because of shortness of breath
           with suspected left heart failure. Individualized programs regarding pumping frequency
           and pump parameters will be set for each patient and will be adjusted during the first
           few days and maintained throughout the study unless there is a reason to modify them.

           Data on both the conventional/conservative and the pump arms of the study will be
           collected at similar intervals. The duration of the in-hospital period will not be
           extended because of the study and is expected to be 3-7 days.

        2. An intermediate-term study in which the patients from the phase 1 study will be
           ambulatory. During this phase of the study the effect of continuous maintenance and
           optimization will be monitored. Patients will come to the hospital for their pumping
           session at which time the protocol tests will be performed. Patients that were assigned
           to the conventional/conservative arm in phase 1 will be examined as per protocol at 1, 2
           and 3 weeks after admission but BNP levels will be repeated only after the 3rd week.

        3. At 3 and 6 months after admission, the &quot;long term&quot; phase of the study, a systematic
           investigation regarding repeat hospitalizations and their causes will be carried out by
           telephone interview and by a review of admission data from hospital records.
