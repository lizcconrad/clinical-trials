  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Ketamine seems an obvious choice in the setting of an emergency department

        -  Ketamine leads to increased production of salivary and tracheal secretions

        -  Antisialagogues(atropine)therefore have been recommended as a routine adjunct

        -  We compare atropine with placebo as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children
           undergoing primary closure of lacerated wound

      The degree of secretion was significantly less in the atropine group compared with the
      control group at the end of the procedure (VAS score: 16.5 ± 9.9 vs. 27.0 ± 15.9, atropine
      vs. control, p = 0.00). The change in the degree of secretion between the start and end of
      the procedure was significantly greater in the atropine group than in the control group (p =
      0.00) (Fig. 2). However, the frequency of hypersalivation as predefined (VAS score ≥50) did
      not differ between the groups (p = 0.06).

      The only complication that differed significantly between the two groups was tachycardia (p &gt;
      0.05). Complications such as aspiration, laryngospasm, and apnea were not documented in the
      hospital. There were fewer interventions for hypersalivation in the atropine group, but the
      difference was not significant (p &gt; 0.05). As interventions, O2 administration and
      endotracheal intubation were not needed. After discharge, the control patients tended to have
      more complaints of nausea, vomiting, and ataxia, although the difference was not significant
      (p &gt; 0.05) Heart rate was increased significantly in the atropine group (p = 0.00). The
      frequency of tachycardia according to patient age was also significantly higher in the
      atropine group than in the control group (p = 0.00)
