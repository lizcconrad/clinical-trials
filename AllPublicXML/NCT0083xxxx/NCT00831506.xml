    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to confirm, in healthy subjects, the lack of a clinically
      important pharmacokinetic interaction between Dimebon, at the proposed maximum commercial
      dose of 20 mg TID (administered every 8 hours), and digoxin (LanoxinÂ®) 0.125 mg QD, a
      sensitive P-gp substrate recommended by FDA.

             endocrine,pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric,
             neurologic, or allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated,
             asymptomatic,seasonal allergies at time of dosing) disease or clinical findings at
             screening.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women; women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are unwilling
             or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception as outlined in the protocol
