    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, single-dose, two-way crossover evaluation is to compare the
      oral bioavailability of a test benazepril HCl formulation (TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries
      Ltd.) to an equivalent oral dose of the commercially available benazepril HCl (Lotensin®,
      Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation) in a test population of 40 adults under fasting
      conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sex: Male and Female; similar proportions of each preferred.

          -  Age: At least 18 years.

          -  Subjects must have a minimum weight of at least 110 pounds.

          -  Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by
             medical history, complete physical examination, and laboratory tests, all obtained
             within four (4) weeks prior to study start. The subject may not have a history of
             significant past illness expected to affect the investigation. The normal status of
             subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:

               1. Laboratory Tests: Hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC, differential count, serum
                  electrolytes (Na, K, Cl), fasting blood glucose, BUN, bilirubin, creatinine, AST,
                  ALT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and urinalysis. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C,
                  and drugs of abuse testing will be done for screening purposes only. Laboratory
                  values which are greater than ± 20% of the normal range will not qualify unless
                  specifically accepted (with comment) by the Principal Investigator. Results of
                  HIC, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and drugs of abuse must be negative or
                  non-reactive for the subject to qualify for the study. Additional drugs of abuse
                  testing will be done at check-in for each period. Tests are to be negative as a
                  requirement for dosing. Female subjects will have a urine pregnancy test done at
                  screening and prior to each study period at check-in.

               2. Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead electrocardiogram will be obtained for all subjects.
                  The original tracings, plus interpretation, will be included in the case report
                  form packet.

          -  Subjects must read and sign the Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects no complying with the above inclusion criteria must be excluded from the
             study.

          -  In addition one of the conditions listed below will exclude a subject from the study:

               1. History of treatment for alcoholism, drug abuse, or substance abuse within the
                  past 24 months.

               2. History of malignancy, stroke, diabetes, cardiac, renal or liver disease, or
                  other serious illness.

               3. History of treatment for asthma within the past five (5) years.

               4. History of treatment for any gastrointestinal disorder within the past five (5)
                  years.

               5. History of neutropenia.

               6. History of hyperkalemia.

               7. History of angioedema.

               8. History of impaired renal function.

               9. History of persistent nonproductive cough.

              10. Females who are pregnant or lactating.

              11. History of hypersensitivity to benazepril HCl, or any angiotensin-converting
                  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

          -  Conditions upon screening which might contraindicate or require that caution be used
             in the administration of benazepril HCl, including:

               1. Sitting systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg, or diastolic pressure below 50
                  mmHg.

               2. Heart rate less than 50 beats per minute after a 5-minute rest in a seated
                  position.

          -  Inability to read and/or sign the consent form.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational drug during the four (4) weeks prior to
             enrollment into the study.

          -  Subjects who have donated blood within four (4) weeks prior to entry into the study.
