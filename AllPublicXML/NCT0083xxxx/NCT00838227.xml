  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label 8-week trial of modafinil up to 400 mg daily added to a stable
      antipsychotic regimen to evaluate the effect modafinil on cognition, sedation, and weight in
      patients with chronic schizophrenia. We hypothesize that modafinil, a wake-promoting agent,
      will lead to improved cognition, increased wakefulness, and decreased weight in patients with
      schizophrenia who are on stable antipsychotic regimens
