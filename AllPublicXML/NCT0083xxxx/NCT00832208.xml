  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II/III open, comparative dose trial to find the lowest single dose of
      AmBisome for the treatment of primary, symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis(VL), in HIV
      negative patients. In this trial, the minimum effective dose will be determined in a
      sequential step, dose escalation design, which minimises the number of patients exposed to
      low, potentially inadequate doses and provides contemporaneous comparative data against the
      manufacturer's recommended dose schedule in this indication.
