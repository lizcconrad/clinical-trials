      -  Determine whether VI-0521 has an effect on the electrical activity of the heart in
           healthy subjects.

        -  Find out how much VI-0521 is in the blood and any potential side effects on ECG's of

      This three-arm, parallel group, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled study comparing
      VI-0521 at a potential therapeutic dose of PHEN/TPM 7.5/46 and PHEN/TPM 22.5/138 , a
      supra-therapeutic dose, with placebo. A single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin is included
      as a positive control in terms of the effect on cardiac repolarization. The three treatment
      regimens are defined as follows:

      Group 1: 56 subjects to receive active study drug (VI-0521) at steady state, PHEN/TPM 7.5/46
      (a potential therapeutic dose), escalating to PHEN/TPM 22.5/138 (a supra-therapeutic dose);

      Group 2: 28 subjects to receive placebo preceded by a single oral dose of moxifloxacin on Day
      2;

      Group 3: 28 subjects to receive placebo followed by a single oral dose of moxifloxacin on Day
      24;

      A total of 112 healthy subjects (with an approximate 1:1 female:male ratio) are planned to be
      randomized.Subjects will check into the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1. Day 1 will be
      a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) profile day (all groups). Active dosing for Group 1 with
      VI-0521 will commence on Day 2. VI-0521 dose will escalate every 2-3 days until steady-state
      is achieved on Day 10 for the therapeutic dose PHEN/TPM 7.5/46. A full ECG assessment day
      will be performed (all groups, blinded); enabling the comparison of VI 0521 PHEN/TPM 7.5/46
      with the placebo (pooled Groups 2 and 3).Subsequently, VI-0521 doses will be escalated until
      subjects in Group 1 reach a dose of 22.5/138, and then continue at this dose level until Day
      22. On Day 22, when the active group has reached a steady state for the supratherapeutic dose
      level, another ECG assessment day will be performed (all groups, blinded); enabling a
      comparison of supratherapeutic VI-0521 with placebo (pooled Groups 2 and 3). Groups 2 and 3
      will receive VI-0521 placebo on Days 2 to 22.
