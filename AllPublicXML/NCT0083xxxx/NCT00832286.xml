  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the human intestinal microbiota (microbes that live
      inside and on human bodies) in healthy adults over a 6-month period and to study the effect
      of an antibiotic on the intestinal microbiota. Participants will include up to 60 healthy
      adult subjects, ages 18-45 years, from the Baltimore and University of Maryland communities.
      Study procedures will include providing multiple stool samples throughout the study.
      Participants will take a licensed antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin, for 3 days. Participants may be
      involved in study related procedures for up to 7 months.

      The purpose of this study is to describe the intestinal microbiomes of a cohort of healthy
      adult subjects over a 6-month period of time. Many questions about the human microbiota
      exist. Previous studies have shown that the differences among individuals are greater than
      the differences among different sampling sites in a single individual. Up to 60 healthy adult
      subjects, ages 18-45 years, from the Baltimore and University of Maryland Baltimore
      communities will be recruited and screened to document their health status. A brief medical
      history, including recent travel and antibiotic use, will be recorded. Subjects will provide
      a stool specimen for genomic analysis of the intestinal microbiome over a 6-month period at
      the following intervals: Day 0, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 13,
      Week 14, Week 15, Week 16, Week 20, and Week 24. At Week 12, subjects will receive a 3-day
      course of oral Ciprofloxacin 500 mg every12 hours. Weekly stool specimens will be obtained
      beginning with the first day of antibiotic use and for 4 Weeks thereafter. Then monthly
      specimens of stool and other sites will be resumed at Week 16. The primary objective is to
      define the human intestinal microbiome in healthy adults in a longitudinal fashion. The
      secondary objective is to define the re-colonization of the intestine after treatment with a
      broad-spectrum antibiotic using comprehensive genomic techniques. Each subject will
      participate in the study for up to 7 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Male or female, ages 18 to 45 years, inclusive. -Healthy as determined by screening
        medical history, medication history, and absence of acute illness such as gastrointestinal
        or respiratory infection. -Capable of understanding, consenting and complying with the
        entire study protocol. -Provide voluntary written Informed Consent. -Females of
        childbearing potential are required to utilize an appropriate method of contraception
        [abstinence, oral contraceptives, IUD, condoms with spermicidal foam, surgical
        sterilization depots and injectable contraceptives, or diaphragms with spermicidal jelly or
        cream] 30 days prior to the Week 12 visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Chronic diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or other
        gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal surgery (except appendectomy, polypectomy, or
        herniorraphy), or severe chronic illness such as major organ failure, diabetes, HIV/AIDS.
        -Female who is pregnant or lactating; or a female subject with a positive urine pregnancy
        test determined at the Week 12 visit. -History of hypersensitivity to Ciprofloxacin, any
        member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents, or any compound of the product.
