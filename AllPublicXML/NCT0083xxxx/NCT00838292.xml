  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether food supplementation of malnourished HIV-infected
      adults (both pre-ART and ART) in resource constrained settings improves their nutritional
      status, clinical status, effectiveness of treatment, quality of life, functioning, and
      survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition remains a significant problem among HIV-infected populations, even among those
      with access to ART. In patients with HIV infection, poor nutritional status is associated
      with significant reduction in survival rates, accelerated disease progression, diminished
      response to therapies including ART, increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections,
      and reduced work capacity and quality of life. However, there is not evidence whether delay
      or reversal of weight loss improves life expectancy, nor is there evidence about the specific
      benefits food supplementation has on people with HIV infection. As antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) services continue to scale up in sub-Saharan Africa, there is a critical need for
      information about the impacts of appropriate food supplementation on the effectiveness of
      ART, on the health status of clients, and on the progression of the disease.

      Malnourished adult ART and pre-ART clients at six clinical sites in Kenya are randomly
      allocated either to a group that receives nutrition counseling only or a group that receives
      nutrition counseling and supplementary feeding for six months. All patients continue to
      receive medical treatment (ART and other medicine) according to their condition. Baseline
      measures of socioeconomic and demographic status are collected. Measures of both nutritional
      and non-nutritional clinical outcomes are collected at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
      Clients beginning ART are treated as one arm and randomized between food and non-food, and
      clients not yet eligible for ART (pre-ART) are treated as a second arm and randomized between
      food and non-food. Within each arm, outcomes of subjects receiving supplemental food will be
      compared with outcomes of those who are not.
