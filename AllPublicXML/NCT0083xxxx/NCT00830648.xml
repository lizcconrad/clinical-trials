      The objective of the present study is to assess and document the safety of a second dose of
      Varicella Biken vaccine administered at 4 to 6 years of age in healthy children having
      previously received a first dose of Varicella Biken vaccine.

      All subjects will receive a second dose of Varicella vaccine (Varicella Biken) at 4 to 6
      years of age.

      The expected total duration of follow-up (first visit to last visit) for each subject will be
      one month.
