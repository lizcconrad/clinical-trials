          2. Has a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis for at least 2 years

          3. Has sensitivity to grass pollen demonstrated by a positive response to skin prick
             testing

          4. Has a positive Radio Allergen Sorbent Test (&gt; or = class 2) for grass pollen during
             the previous 12 months or at screening

          5. Is otherwise healthy, that is, free from clinically significant illness or disease as
             determined by medical history, physical examination and laboratory tests, including a
             normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

          6. Has no conditions which would make the subject unlikely to be able to remain in the
             allergen challenge chamber for 4 hours

          7. Is available to complete all study procedures

          8. Is able to provide written informed consent, including compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

          2. History of chronic nasal or upper respiratory tract symptoms or disorders other than
             allergic rhinitis

          3. History of nonallergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis or severe asthma

          4. Has a nasal condition likely to affect the outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal
             perforations, nasal polyps, sinus disease, chronic nasal obstruction, or other nasal
             diseases

          5. Is currently taking regular medication, whether prescribed or not, including
             corticosteroids, vitamins, macrolides, anti-fungal agents and herbal remedies, e.g.
             St. John's Wort. Paracetamol (&lt; or = 2g/day) and as needed use of short-acting
             B2-agonists are allowed.

          6. Has taken a prohibited medication within the specified interval prior to Visit 1:

               -  Corticosteroids (depot, 90 days; systemic, 30 days; dermatologic 14 days)

               -  Chromones (14 days)

               -  Antihistamines (nasal and long-acting oral, 10 days; shorting-acting oral, 2
                  days; ocular, 3 days)

               -  Immunotherapy (12 hr)

          7. Is currently being treated with a medication that induces or inhibits cytochrome P450
             (CYP)3A
