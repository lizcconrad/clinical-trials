    <textblock>
      The syndrome of extremely restricted emotional competence, alexithymia, was originally
      conceptualized in psychoanalytic research and is now empirically and experimentally studied
      in clinical psychology and psychological medicine within the context of emotion regulation
      using neuroscientific techniques. Alexithymia refers to an individual's inability or impaired
      ability to name or express feelings and to distinguish them from the physical consequences of
      an acute or chronic stress reaction. Modern &quot;brain-body-interface&quot; research suggests that
      alexithymia represents a complex deficiency in cognitive processing and emotional regulatory
      processes. The neurobiological basis is assumed to be a preconscious, automatic and
      involuntary information transfer to the amygdalae of acquired representations of emotional
      contents stored in ventromedial prefrontal cortical areas.

      Alexithymia is not just &quot;emotional coldness&quot;, i.e. a limited emotionality, but essentially
      the detachment of feelings from language. In alexithymia the link between affective phenomena
      and language, understood as media-supported sign practices, is insufficient or even absent.

      The purpose of our observational study is to better understand the neurobiological and
      neuropsychological as well as linguistic and gestural processes and determinants of this
      phenomenon
