      Objective:A few case reports on the use of aripiprazole in neuroleptic-induced tardive
      dyskinesia have demonstrated positive effects. However its effectiveness in treatment of TD
      was still inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy of
      aripiprazole in management of pre-existing neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia.

      Method: Subjects with pre-existing neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia were chosen from
      Taoyuan psychiatric center. Patients recruited would be treated with aripiprazole for
      cross-titration with previous antipsychotics in 8 weeks. We use AIMS, SAS, &amp; BAS to assess
      the severity of TF and EPS. We record subjects' age, sex, and other factors which have
      influence at the treatment response. Subjects are assessed every two weeks in the first month
      and then monthly until six months.
