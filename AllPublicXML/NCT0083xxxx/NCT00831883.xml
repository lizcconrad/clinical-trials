  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a partner-specific HIV risk reduction
      intervention for currently or recently incarcerated adolescents who report problematic
      substance use.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incarcerated adolescents represent a group at high risk for health consequences associated
      with risky sexual behaviors. Condom use is more common with non-main than main sex partners
      and substance use in conjunction with sexual risk also appears to vary by partner type. The
      research team will conduct a small randomized trial to pilot test a partner-specific HIV risk
      reduction intervention for currently or recently incarcerated adolescents who report
      problematic substance use. Participants will be randomized to a 5 session HIV risk reduction
      group intervention based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model, or a 5
      session healthy lifestyles psychoeducation intervention, and then reassessed 3 months after
      their access to the general community is reinstated. The main hypothesis is that participants
      in the HIV risk reduction intervention condition will have lower levels of sex-related HIV
      risk behavior and of substance use in conjunction with sexual risk, relative to those in a
      healthy lifestyles psychoeducation intervention.
