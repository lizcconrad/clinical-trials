  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK249320 is a humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds with high specificity to
      myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and antagonises or neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition
      and has been shown to improve functional recovery after stroke in pre-clinical models,
      possibly by promoting neuroregeneration and plasticity. The present study is the first in
      patients with stroke. The main aim of this study is to select tolerated doses of GSK249320
      that can be used in future trials to evaluate its efficacy in improving clinical function in
      patients recovering from stroke. This clinical trial is designed as a placebo-controlled,
      single-blind, multicenter study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of escalating repeat IV doses of GSK249320. Three sequential dose
      escalation cohorts (1, 5 and 15 mg/kg) are planned, with 8 patients on placebo and 8 on
      active in cohort 1 and 4 patients on placebo and 8 on active in cohorts 2 and 3. Each patient
      will receive 2 repeat IV doses 9 ± 1 days apart and assessments will extend to at least 16
      weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 5), Day 30, 60, 90, 112</time_frame>
    <description>Gait velocity is an objective, quantitative, reliable, valid and sensitive measure of lower extremity motor recovery in the stroke population. Changes in gait velocity correlates with physical functioning and quality of life. Gait velocity was assessed over a level, indoor 10 meter distance. The time (in seconds) it takes the participant to travel the 10 meter distance was recorded. Participants was asked to walk at their usual or normal pace and may use their normal assistive devices. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Berg Balance Scale (BBS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 5), Day 30, 60, 90 and 112</time_frame>
    <description>BBS is a performance based measure of balance. It is reliable, valid and responsive to change in the stroke population. BBS is a staff-assessed measure that requires the participant to perform 14 activities that evaluate ability to maintain balance. The BBS typically takes 10-15minute to complete. Participants were not allowed to use assistive devices while performing the activities. Each activity was evaluated by direct observation of the participant's performance and was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (0-4) where a score of 0 represents inability to perform the activity and a score of 4 represents independence in the activity. The minimum total score on the BBS was 0 and maximum was 56. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <description>The FM assessment is a staff-assessed, disease specific, quantitative measure of impairment that is used to assess recovery of sensorimotor function post stroke. The FM is designed to assess the domains of motor function, balance, sensation and joint function. For this study, only the motor function domain was assessed. The motor domain scale takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and evaluates both the upper and lower extremities by direct observation of the participant's performance of 50 items that measure movement, coordination, and reflex action. Each item was scored from 0-2 for a minimum total score of 0 (hemiplegia) and a maximum total score of 100 (normal motor performance). Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <description>The Box and Blocks test is an objective, gross manual dexterity test that is reliable and valid in individuals with upper limb impairments. Box and Blocks was a staff-assessed, participant completed test that required the participant to move small wooden blocks from one side of a partitioned box to the other. The score was determined by the number of blocks transferred within a 60 second time period. More number of blocks transferred as compared to Baseline indicated improvement. Both the impaired and normal limbs were tested, starting with the normal limb. The number of blocks transferred were recorded. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <description>Grip strength is an objective measure of arm motor recovery in stroke participants and correlate with functional status and predict recovery. Grip strength was evaluated by a hand grip dynamometer. Three replicate trials was collected for both the impaired and normal hand, starting with the normal hand. Each trial was separated by a resting period of approximately 15-30 seconds. Participants was instructed to squeeze as hard as possible while using a standardized position of grip and the resulting dynamometer reading (in kg) was recorded. The grip strength measures was conducted within approximately 5 minutes. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 10, 30 and 90</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a staff-assessed, 15 item, standardized, disease-specific, deficit scale which measures neurological impairment and is used to quantify participant status by measuring the severity of the stroke. The total NIHSS score ranged from 0 (No impairment) to 42 (severe impairment). Approximately 15 minutes were needed to complete the NIHSS. The NIHSS will be collected as part of the eligibility requirements to exclude participants who have a deficit that is either too mild or too severe. Only NIHSS certified study personnel recorded the NIHSS. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 and 90</time_frame>
    <description>MoCA was an examiner-administered, screening instrument with good validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive dysfunction. The MoCA had been studied in stroke participants and was recommended as a tool to monitor and measure cognitive changes post stroke as part of the 2006 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke - Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards. The MoCA assesses eight cognitive domains of visuospatial skills, executive function, language, attention, concentration, working memory, memory, and orientation. Participants were asked to complete 14 activities which the examiner scored according to the standardized scoring instructions. While there was no set time limit imposed on a participant. The total MoCA score ranges from 0-30, where 0= worsening and 30 reflects normal cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Mean Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 and 90</time_frame>
    <description>The short form GDS is a measure of depression developed specifically for use in elderly population and is sensitive and valid in the stroke population. The GDS was a participant-completed, 15 item questionnaire where each question referenced how the participant felt over the past week. Each question was answered with either a 'yes' or 'no' response. Of the 15 questions, 10 of them indicate depression when answered 'yes' (questions 2-4, 6, 8-10, 12, 14-15) and 5 indicate depression when answered 'no' (questions 1, 5, 7, 11, 13). Each question received a score of 1 point when the response was indicative of depression. Total score ranged from 0 to 15. the total score ranged from 0-15, where 0 implies no symptoms and higher score implies more severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulations (TMS) Evaluated by Peak to Peak MEP by % Stimulation Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 30 and 112</time_frame>
    <description>TMS is an electrophysiological technique that was used to measure neurologic changes associated with recovery from stroke via alterations in the excitability of the motor system. Motor threshold measures reflect global excitability of the corticospinal pathway, including large pyramidal cells, excitatory/inhibitory interneurons, and spinal motorneurons. Motor threshold was recorded as the lowest stimulus intensity (in percent) eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post -randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

          -  occupation or activity that may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic materials or
             embedded metal fragments in the head. Subjects can be cleared by a head computed
             tomography scan.

          -  concomitant use of drugs that substantially lower seizure threshold (e.g., tricyclic

          -  Contraindication to MRI, such as:

          -  have metal present, such as implanted cardiac pacemaker, implanted prosthetic heart
             valve, medication pump or line, metallic implant or clip in the head/neck, electrical,
             mechanical or magnetic implants, neuro-stimulation device, or orthodontic work
             involving ferromagnetic materials, permanent tattooed metallic eye-liner

          -  occupation or activity that may cause accidental lodging of ferromagnetic materials or
             embedded metal fragments in the head. Subjects can be cleared by a head computed
             tomography scan.

          -  claustrophobia

          -  Participation in any investigational rehabilitation paradigm targeting stroke recovery
             during the duration of this study.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

        Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Subjects considered unwilling or unable to comply with the procedures and study visit

        <description>Whole brain MRI scans were performed by appropriately qualified personnel at those specified visits (Day 1, 10 and 60 or at early withdrawal [if participant withdrew from study before Day 60 MRI]). Required pulse sequences of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), T1, and T2 FLAIR was performed to measure lesion volume and to look for the presence of any new acute inflammatory lesions. The investigator or other medically qualified study team member evaluated the Day 10 and 60 scans for any new abnormalities or clinically significant worsening. Digital data for each MRI was sent to a central MRI laboratory for an over-read of the MRI scan and calculation of the lesion volume. Number of participants with change in white matter and demyelination on Day 10 compared to Day 1, Day 60 compared to Day 1 and Day 60 compared to Day 10 were reported.</description>

        <description>The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by standard non-compartmental analysis using Win Nonlin Pro 4.1. All calculations of non-compartmental parameters were based on actual sampling times. AUC0-t was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. AUC(0-inf) were calculated, where data permit, as the sum of area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval from 0 to Day 10 ±1 day (AUC0-10d) and C10d/z, where C10d is the observed plasma concentration at day 10 and z is the terminal phase rate constant calculated after the second dose.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Mean Gait Velocity</title>
        <description>Gait velocity is an objective, quantitative, reliable, valid and sensitive measure of lower extremity motor recovery in the stroke population. Changes in gait velocity correlates with physical functioning and quality of life. Gait velocity was assessed over a level, indoor 10 meter distance. The time (in seconds) it takes the participant to travel the 10 meter distance was recorded. Participants was asked to walk at their usual or normal pace and may use their normal assistive devices. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Berg Balance Scale (BBS) Total Score</title>
        <description>BBS is a performance based measure of balance. It is reliable, valid and responsive to change in the stroke population. BBS is a staff-assessed measure that requires the participant to perform 14 activities that evaluate ability to maintain balance. The BBS typically takes 10-15minute to complete. Participants were not allowed to use assistive devices while performing the activities. Each activity was evaluated by direct observation of the participant’s performance and was scored on a 5-point ordinal scale (0-4) where a score of 0 represents inability to perform the activity and a score of 4 represents independence in the activity. The minimum total score on the BBS was 0 and maximum was 56. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Total Fugl-Meyer Motor (FM) Assessment</title>
        <description>The FM assessment is a staff-assessed, disease specific, quantitative measure of impairment that is used to assess recovery of sensorimotor function post stroke. The FM is designed to assess the domains of motor function, balance, sensation and joint function. For this study, only the motor function domain was assessed. The motor domain scale takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and evaluates both the upper and lower extremities by direct observation of the participant’s performance of 50 items that measure movement, coordination, and reflex action. Each item was scored from 0-2 for a minimum total score of 0 (hemiplegia) and a maximum total score of 100 (normal motor performance). Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 5 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Total Box and Blocks Transferred on Affected Side</title>
        <description>The Box and Blocks test is an objective, gross manual dexterity test that is reliable and valid in individuals with upper limb impairments. Box and Blocks was a staff-assessed, participant completed test that required the participant to move small wooden blocks from one side of a partitioned box to the other. The score was determined by the number of blocks transferred within a 60 second time period. More number of blocks transferred as compared to Baseline indicated improvement. Both the impaired and normal limbs were tested, starting with the normal limb. The number of blocks transferred were recorded. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Grip Strength on Affected Side</title>
        <description>Grip strength is an objective measure of arm motor recovery in stroke participants and correlate with functional status and predict recovery. Grip strength was evaluated by a hand grip dynamometer. Three replicate trials was collected for both the impaired and normal hand, starting with the normal hand. Each trial was separated by a resting period of approximately 15-30 seconds. Participants was instructed to squeeze as hard as possible while using a standardized position of grip and the resulting dynamometer reading (in kg) was recorded. The grip strength measures was conducted within approximately 5 minutes. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)</title>
        <description>The mRS was a 6 point scale that measured participant handicap by evaluating limitations in activity and changes in lifestyle. The mRS was staff-assessed and scored from 0=no symptoms at all, 1=no significant disability, 2=slight disability, 3=moderate disability, 4=moderate severe disability, 5=severe disability (severe disability, bedridden, incontinent and requiring constant nursing care and attention). The structured interview was used to administer the mRS. The mRS took approximately 15 minutes to complete when using the structured interview. Number of participants with mRS were reported as per the category of the score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</title>
        <description>The NIHSS is a staff-assessed, 15 item, standardized, disease-specific, deficit scale which measures neurological impairment and is used to quantify participant status by measuring the severity of the stroke. The total NIHSS score ranged from 0 (No impairment) to 42 (severe impairment). Approximately 15 minutes were needed to complete the NIHSS. The NIHSS will be collected as part of the eligibility requirements to exclude participants who have a deficit that is either too mild or too severe. Only NIHSS certified study personnel recorded the NIHSS. Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post-randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Mean Barthel Total Score</title>
        <description>The Barthel was a staff-assessed, 10 item activities of daily living index that evaluated feeding, grooming, dressing, excretion (bowels, bladder and toilet skills), bathing, and mobility (transfers, walking, stairs). The total Barthel score ranged from either 0-20 or 0-100 depending on which scoring algorithm was used where 0= unable or dependent and 20 or 100= independent to perform daily activities. For this study, the 100 point scoring algorithm was used. The Barthel takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete with the participant.</description>

        <title>Mean Total Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score</title>
        <description>MoCA was an examiner-administered, screening instrument with good validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity for mild cognitive dysfunction. The MoCA had been studied in stroke participants and was recommended as a tool to monitor and measure cognitive changes post stroke as part of the 2006 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke – Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards. The MoCA assesses eight cognitive domains of visuospatial skills, executive function, language, attention, concentration, working memory, memory, and orientation. Participants were asked to complete 14 activities which the examiner scored according to the standardized scoring instructions. While there was no set time limit imposed on a participant. The total MoCA score ranges from 0-30, where 0= worsening and 30 reflects normal cognitive function.</description>

        <title>Mean Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)</title>
        <description>The short form GDS is a measure of depression developed specifically for use in elderly population and is sensitive and valid in the stroke population. The GDS was a participant-completed, 15 item questionnaire where each question referenced how the participant felt over the past week. Each question was answered with either a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response. Of the 15 questions, 10 of them indicate depression when answered ‘yes’ (questions 2-4, 6, 8-10, 12, 14-15) and 5 indicate depression when answered ‘no’ (questions 1, 5, 7, 11, 13). Each question received a score of 1 point when the response was indicative of depression. Total score ranged from 0 to 15. the total score ranged from 0-15, where 0 implies no symptoms and higher score implies more severity of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulations (TMS) Evaluated by Peak to Peak MEP by % Stimulation Level</title>
        <description>TMS is an electrophysiological technique that was used to measure neurologic changes associated with recovery from stroke via alterations in the excitability of the motor system. Motor threshold measures reflect global excitability of the corticospinal pathway, including large pyramidal cells, excitatory/inhibitory interneurons, and spinal motorneurons. Motor threshold was recorded as the lowest stimulus intensity (in percent) eliciting motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Baseline assessments were recorded at Day 1 of the study. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline values from the individual post -randomization values. If either the Baseline or post-randomization value was missing, the change from Baseline was set to missing as well.</description>
