  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a retinal disorder characterized by an accumulation
      of serous fluid under the retina. Although acute CSC tends to spontaneously resolve on its
      own with minimal sequelae, chronic CSC tends to persist and lead to irreversible visual loss.
      The pathogenesis of CSC is complex; however, systemic androgens have been implicated.
      Finasteride is an anti-androgen medication that is widely used in the treatment of various
      conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the safety and potential efficacy
      of oral finasteride as a treatment for chronic CSC.

      Five participants with chronic CSC were enrolled into this uncontrolled, unmasked, Phase I/II
      study. An oral dose of finasteride, 5 mg daily, was administered to all participants for
      three months.

      Following this, finasteride was withheld and participants were observed for another three
      months. If a participant experienced a beneficial effect during the period in which he
      received finasteride and then experienced a relapse during the observation period,
      finasteride was re-instituted for the remaining period of the study. Relapse was defined as a
      return to the baseline maximum lesion height and/or return to baseline lesion volume.

    <measure>Change in Visual Acuity at Month 3 Compared to Baseline.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. This acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters the Snellen measurement is 20/20.</description>

        Participant-Level Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participant must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Participant must understand and sign the protocol's informed consent document.

          3. Female participants of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or breast-feeding,
             must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and must be willing to undergo
             monthly pregnancy tests throughout the study.

          4. Female participants of childbearing potential must agree to practice two* acceptable
             methods of birth control throughout the course of the study and for three months after
             their last oral dose of finasteride. Acceptable methods of birth control include
             hormonal contraception (birth control pills, injected hormones or vaginal ring),
             intrauterine device, barrier methods with spermicide (diaphragm with spermicide,
             condom and spermicide) or surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, tubal ligation or
             vasectomy in a partner).

             *Participants with hysterectomy or vasectomy are exempt from using two methods of
             birth control. However female participants with a tubal ligation are not exempt and
             are required to practice another acceptable method of birth control.

          5. Participant agrees to take the appropriate precautions to ensure that persons who are
             pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential do not handle the finasteride tablets.

        Participant-Level Exclusion Criteria

          1. Participant is in another investigational study and actively receiving study therapy.

          2. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits.

          3. Participant has evidence of ocular disease other than CSC in either eye that may
             confound the outcome of the study (e.g., diabetic retinopathy with 10 or more
             hemorrhages or microaneurysms, uveitis, pseudovitelliform macular degeneration,
             moderate/severe myopia, etc.).

          4. Participant has evidence of CNV.

          5. Participant has abnormal liver function testing as defined by elevated alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels that are greater
             than twice the respective upper limits of normal (ULN), i.e., ALT &gt; 82 U/L and/or AST
             &gt; 68 U/L. If a participant has ALT or AST levels greater than twice the ULN, the
             participant can be enrolled if cleared by hepatology.

          6. Participant is expected to need ocular surgery during the course of the trial.

          7. Participant is on steroid medication (oral, topical or inhaled).

          8. Participant is on ocular or systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina
             or optic nerve.

          9. Participant has a systemic condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             preclude participation in the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood
             pressure and glycemic control).

        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria

          1. Eligible participants must have chronic CSC in at least one eye as defined by all of
             the following criteria:

               1. The presence of subretinal fluid, as determined by spectral domain OCT, AND

               2. The subretinal fluid must have been present for at least three months, or there
                  is a recurrence of subretinal fluid within the past three months, AND

               3. The presence of characteristic fluorescein angiographic or autofluorescence
                  features of CSC, such as one or more pinpoint leaks and/or diffuse retinal
                  pigment epitheliopathy. This eye will be referred to as the &quot;study eye.&quot;

          2. Participant must have a steady fixation in the study eye in the foveal or parafoveal
             area and media clear enough for good quality photographs.

          3. Participant must have visual acuity between 20/25 and 20/400 in the study eye.

        <title>Change in Visual Acuity at Month 3 Compared to Baseline.</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. This acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters the Snellen measurement is 20/20.</description>
