    <description>The therapeutic goal of normal tension glaucoma treatment includes lowering IOP to prevent progression of damage in optic nerves or vision. In this trial, IOP was measured with the same tonometer throughout the study. A decreased IOP from baseline is considered an improvement.
IOP was measured in both eyes and the eye with the higher IOP was used for the participant.</description>

        <description>The therapeutic goal of normal tension glaucoma treatment includes lowering IOP to prevent progression of damage in optic nerves or vision. In this trial, IOP was measured with the same tonometer throughout the study. A decreased IOP from baseline is considered an improvement.
IOP was measured in both eyes and the eye with the higher IOP was used for the participant.</description>
