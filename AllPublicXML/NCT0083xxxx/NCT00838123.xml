    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to explore which cognitive function would affect the job tenure
      among people with schizophrenia. The investigators plan to recruit 60 people diagnosed with
      schizophrenia and divide into two groups, employment and unemployment. The investigators will
      use several cognitive function tests to collect their cognitive functions and PANSS to
      evaluate their psychotic symptoms. And then the investigators will compare and analysis the
      data through statistic software. Finally, the investigators will have the answer about if
      cognitive functions would affect the job tenure among people with schizophrenia. And the
      investigators hope that we could get the predict factor of cognitive function to predict the
      successful employment in future.
