    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is threefold: investigating 1) specific cognitive impairments in
      patients with congestive heart failure, 2) whether cognitive impairments in patients with
      decompensated heart failure improve after medical recompensation and 3) whether cognitive
      functioning is related to the long-term prognosis (mortality, rehospitalisation) of those
      patients.

      The daily routine in clinical settings often shows cognitive impairments in patients with
      congestive heart failure. Recent studies reported declines in cognitive functioning such as
      executive functions, episodic memory, perceptual speed and attention. However, less is known
      regarding the differential impairments of cognitive functioning in patients with
      decompensated heart failure.

      Study objectives:

        1. Identifying specific cognitive impairments in patients with congestive heart failure
           compared to healthy controls

        2. Evaluating the influence of acute decompensation in congestive heart failure on
           cognitive functioning

        3. Investigating the effects of medical treatment on cognitive functioning in patients with
           decompensated heart failure

        4. Exploring long-term effects of cognitive and physiological status on hospitalisation
           and/or mortality

      Study design:

      Cognitive functions of patients with decompensated heart (NYHA III-IV) failure are compared
      to age and gender matched patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA III-IV) without
      symptoms of cardiac decompensation and with healthy controls. Decompensated patients are
      tested before and after medical recompensation. For matched patients and controls, the
      pretest-posttest timing is based on the recompensation time of the respective patient with
      decompensated heart failure.

      The neuropsychological test battery includes measures of episodic memory, working memory,
      short-term memory, executive functions, perceptual speed and intelligence. In addition, the
      study applied standardized questionnaires of self assessed quality of life and depression.
      Relevant physiological data, such as left ventricular systolic function and N-terminal pro
      brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), are recorded.
