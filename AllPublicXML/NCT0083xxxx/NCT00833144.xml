  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients often arrive to the Emergency Department with the chief complaint of shortness of
      breath. The cause of the shortness of breath may be due to many things, such as pneumonia,
      emphysema, a heart attack, heart failure, and others. It is often very difficult for the
      physician to determine the cause of the shortness of breath in the first two hours in the
      Emergency Department. This ambiguity makes treating the patient very difficult. Although a
      patient could benefit from treatment upon arrival, the emergent treatment of the condition
      must wait until a final diagnosis is made.

      Recently, emergency physicians have been using portable ultrasound at the patient's bedside
      to diagnose numerous conditions, including trauma, blood clots, kidney stones, etc. Recent
      research suggests that heart failure, one of the causes of shortness of breath, may be
      diagnosed within 5 minutes or less using ultrasound. Most of these studies come from the
      intensive care and cardiology. However, no research has yet been performed to determine if
      emergency physicians can effectively use ultrasound to quickly diagnose and treat heart
      failure within the first few minutes of a patient's arrival to the emergency department. The
      hypothesis of this study is to evaluate the ability of residents in emergency medicine to use
      ultrasound to diagnose patients in heart failure who presented with the chief complaint of
      shortness of breath. The final diagnosis of the patient upon discharge from the hospital will
      be compared to the preliminary diagnosis based on the portable ultrasound findings.
