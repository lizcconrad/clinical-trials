    <textblock>
      This study is a modular intervention that is intended to improve treatment adherence among
      individuals with bipolar disorder on atypical antipsychotic therapy who have been identified
      as having treatment adherence problems.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, prospective project of the effects of customized adherence enhancement
      (CAE) when added to the medical management (usual care) of outpatients with bipolar disorder
      (BPD) who are patients at University Hospitals of Cleveland Case Medical Center, and who are
      known to be at risk for treatment non-adherence. In the proposed trial, CAE is supported by
      manuals delivered as a series of four modules whose use will be determined based upon an
      individual's identified treatment adherence vulnerabilities. The modules are components of a
      single, customized intervention. Although some participants may receive a different
      combination or number of modules, the participants are neither analyzed separately as a
      subpopulation nor compared as subpopulations. Therefore participants are all part of a
      solitary study arm. The effectiveness of the entire customized intervention system is of
      interest.

      All individuals will continue to receive treatment as usual with their regular provider.
      Those who are enrolled in the study intervention will participate in a series of 4 in-person
      meetings with the study interventionist over a 4-week time period and 1-2 telephone
      follow-ups. These meetings with the interventionist will consist of whatever modules were
      assigned at baseline that are customized to that particular participant's treatment adherence
      vulnerabilities. A total of 3 to 4 assessment meetings with the research assistant will occur
      over a three-month time period.

      Primary objective The aim of this project is to test the use of a modular-based intervention
      in a pilot feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy study of customized adherence
      enhancement (CAE) in a vulnerable population with BPD. We hypothesize that CAE will be: 1)
      feasible to administer within a academic medical center; 2) acceptable to participants with
      BPD; and 3) associated with improvements in treatment adherence.

      Secondary objectives Individuals who receive CAE will have improvements in BPD symptoms,
      global psychopathology, overall treatment attitudes and in functional status.

    <description>Participants will be assigned to receive one or more of the study interventions based upon the participant's responses on the Attitudes toward Mood Stabilizers Questionnaire (AMSQ) and reasons for non-adherence on the Rating of Medication Influences (ROMI).
Individuals will participate in a series of 4 60-minute sessions over a 4-week period, with the study therapist who will implement the module-based intervention. The number of modules may differ depending on the baseline adherence profile of the participant.
An intervention manual developed by the investigators will provide explicit guidelines regarding how modules may be co-administered in single or multiple sessions to minimize redundancy as well as time and effort burden on study participants. The manual for each module will specifically address how any module could be combined with the other modules.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD) Type I or Type II determined by a
             standardized diagnostic interview, the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview
             (MINI) (Sheehan 1998);

          -  Demonstrated history of poor adherence as per either self-report or clinician report.
             In this study, self-reported treatment non-adherence will be identified with Tablet
             Routines Questionnaire (TRQ). Poorly adherent individuals will be defined as those who
             miss 20% or more of medication within either the past week or past month (those
             missing 20% or more within past week will be considered to be non-adherent over the
             past month).

          -  BPD for at least two years duration;

          -  Treatment with atypical antipsychotic medication to stabilize mood for at least six
             months;

          -  The ability to participate in psychiatric interviews and to give written, informed
             consent for study participation; and

          -  Age 18 or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable/unwilling to participate in psychiatric interviews based on the clinical
             opinion of the investigator or the treating clinician. Individuals who are grossly
             psychotic may be excluded at this point if the treating clinician feels that the
             prospective participant is unable to participate in the interviews or study
             procedures;

          -  Unable/unwilling to give written, informed consent to study participation;

          -  High risk for suicide (e.g., active suicidal ideation and recent suicide attempt;
             active suicidal ideation and current intent or plan). In the interest of patient
             safety, individuals who are acutely suicidal will be excluded from study
             participation; or

          -  Individuals who are non-English speaking will be excluded as study assessment tools
             are not available in other languages and would be impractical to develop in this
             small, exploratory study.

            <description>Participants will be assigned to receive one or more of the study interventions based upon the participant's responses on the AMSQ and reasons for non-adherence on the ROMI.
Individuals will participate in a series of 4 60-minute sessions over a 4-week period, with the study therapist who will implement the module-based intervention. The number of modules may differ depending on the baseline adherence profile of the participant.
An intervention manual developed by the investigators will provide explicit guidelines regarding how modules may be co-administered in single or multiple sessions to minimize redundancy as well as time and effort burden on study participants. The manual for each module will specifically address how any module could be combined with the other modules.</description>

            <description>Participants will be assigned to receive one or more of the study interventions based upon the participant's responses on the AMSQ and reasons for non-adherence on the ROMI.
Individuals will participate in a series of 4 60-minute sessions over a 4-week period, with the study therapist who will implement the module-based intervention. The number of modules may differ depending on the baseline adherence profile of the participant.
An intervention manual developed by the investigators will provide explicit guidelines regarding how modules may be co-administered in single or multiple sessions to minimize redundancy as well as time and effort burden on study participants. The manual for each module will specifically address how any module could be combined with the other modules.</description>
