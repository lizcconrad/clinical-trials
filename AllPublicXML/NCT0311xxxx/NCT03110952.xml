    <textblock>
      The potential synergistic effect of administering 2 dengue vaccine candidates that were
      previously shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans will be evaluated in this study. A
      prime-boost study of tetravalent dengue virus purified inactivated vaccine (TDENV-PIV) with
      the GSK AS03B adjuvant and tetravalent dengue live attenuated virus (TDENV-LAV) vaccine
      Formulation 17 (F17) will gather data to help better understand the human immune response to
      dengue vaccination and infection.

      This study is being done to evaluate the safety and immune reaction of administering one dose
      of dengue purified inactivated vaccine and one dose of dengue live attenuated vaccine
      compared to two doses of inactivated vaccine.
