    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-labeled gastrin-releasing peptide receptor
      (GRPR) antagonist BAY86-7548 (68Ga-RM2) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed
      tomography (CT) works in detecting regional nodal and distant metastases in patients with
      intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer. 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT scan may be able to see smaller
      tumors than the standard of care CT or magnetic resonance imaging scan.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT for detection of intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer
      prior to prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 68Ga-RM2 intravenously (IV). Within 45-60 minutes, patients undergo a PET/CT
      scan. Patients may undergo a second PET/CT scan immediately after the first scan for
      attenuation correction. Patients may undergo also a repeat 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT scan after the
      completion of their treatment to evaluate response to therapy, if requested by the treating
      physician.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24-48 hours and within 3-12 months.
