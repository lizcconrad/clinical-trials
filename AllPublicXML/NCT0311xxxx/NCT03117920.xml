  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MinPAC aims to see if the drug Minnelide can slow down tumour growth in patients with
      pancreatic cancer that is not responding to treatment. Minnelide is designed to rapidly
      release the anti-tumour molecule triptolide in the bloodstream and has been shown to slow
      cancer cell growth and induce cancer cell death. Minnelide is currently being investigated in
      other early phase trials and has shown promising response data.

      There are strict eligibility criteria for this trial. Broadly speaking, patients with
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to other organs and has progressed on one or more
      chemotherapy regimens are eligible. Participants will receive Minnelide on days 1-21 of each
      28 day cycle until their cancer stops responding to treatment. After that participants will
      be followed up 3 monthly for the collection of disease status and survival data.

      MinPAC includes biological and imaging studies. Participants will be asked to donate tumour
      and blood samples and will be asked to undergo additional PET Scans. The study is being
      carried out in 4 sites in the UK and USA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MinPAC is an open label, international, multicentre phase II trial that aims to evaluate the
      effects of Minnelide treatment in patients with refractory pancreatic cancer. Eligible
      patients will receive Minnelide until disease progression unless there is evidence of
      unacceptable toxicity or the patient requests to be withdrawn from the study treatment. Once
      disease progression is documented, patients will enter a follow up phase during which data
      will be collected on further disease and survival status. If patients are unable to attend
      hospital visits during the follow up period then data will be collected either via telephone
      or via national registries with the patient's consent. The efficacy of Minnelide will be
      assessed on CT/MRI scan images and tumour and/or blood samples collected at baseline, during
      treatment and on completion of treatment.
