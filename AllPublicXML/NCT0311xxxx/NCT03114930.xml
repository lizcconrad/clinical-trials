  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the HAS recommendations of March 2014, the &quot;mother - newborn&quot; couple was discharged
      from the maternity home at 4 days after delivery by AVB and 5 days after caesarean section.

      The stay in maternity allowed a follow-up of the newborn whose weight gain and the occurrence
      of a jaundice; And monitoring of the mother whose milky ascent and psychological feelings.

      In March 2014, the HAS published new recommendations on maternity leave arrangements for the
      &quot;mother - newborn&quot; couple, the organization of postpartum follow - up for the mother and
      pediatric follow - up for the newborn. The HAS then defines so-called &quot;optimal&quot; conditions
      for so-called &quot;standard&quot; outputs, with 9 criteria to respect respectively for the mother and
      the newborn.

      If the mother-to-newborn couple respects these so-called optimal conditions and is eligible
      according to the respective criteria, the latter leaves at home after 72 hours and before 96
      hours for an AVB and after 96 completed hours and Before 120 hours for caesarean delivery.

      As no pediatric discharge was done in the afternoons at the maternity hospital of Amiens, an
      arbitrary choice was made to allow a &quot;standard&quot; release to the &quot;mother-newborn&quot; couple only
      if the child was born between 00H00 and 11H59 so that his clinical examination of exit is
      carried out at 72 hours of the birth as recommended by the recommendations of the HAS.

      These recommendations being recent (2014), no study has studied the impact and consequences
      on the triad &quot;father / mother-newborn&quot; of these exits including the occurrence of possible
      complications or events: re-hospitalizations again The early termination of breastfeeding,
      and whether the follow-up procedures advocated by the HAS are being followed.
