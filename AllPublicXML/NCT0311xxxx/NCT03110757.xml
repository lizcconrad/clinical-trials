      The study will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, double blind Phase 1b
      dose-escalating clinical trial in up to 60 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females
      living in the S. mansoni-endemic area of Americaninhas, Brazil. The primary objective of this
      trial is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of ascending doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®
      (10mcg, 30mcg, or 100mcg) vaccine with or without AP 10-701 given as three doses administered
      on Days 1, 57, and 113.

      The study will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, double blind Phase 1b
      dose-escalating clinical trial in up to 60 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females
      living in the S. mansoni-endemic area of Americaninhas, Brazil. The study will recruit up to
      60 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females to test two formulations of Sm-TSP-2 vaccine
      (adjuvanted wtih Alhydrogel® only, or with Alhydrogel® plus AP 10-701), each at 3 different
      doses of antigen: 10mcg, 30mcg, and 100mcg. The study will use a dose-escalation cohort
      design, in which escalation to the next dose cohort will be determined based on evaluation of
      pre-defined escalation criteria requiring 7 day safety data to be examined after all subjects
      in the current cohort have received their first dose of vaccine. Cohorts will be enrolled
      sequentially. For each Cohort (1-3), an initial 5 subjects (2 Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®, 2
      Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®/AP 10-701, and 1 Euvax B Hepatitis B vaccine) will be enrolled,
      randomized, vaccinated, and have completed Visit 02 (Day 2), before enrolling the rest of the
      cohort. As with dose-escalation decisions, evidence of significant reactogenicity will
      require further review prior to proceeding. The primary objective of this trial is to assess
      the safety and reactogenicity of ascending doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10mcg, 30mcg, or
      100mcg) vaccine with or without AP 10-701 given as three doses administered on Days 1, 57,
      and 113. The secondary objectives used to evaluate the immunogenicity are: (1) to assess the
      IgG antibody response to Sm-TSP-2 using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      at Day 127, (2) to assess the IgG antibody response to Sm-TSP-2 using an indirect ELISA at 14
      days after dose one and two and Days 203, 293, and 478 (3, 6, and 12 months after the third
      dose) of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10mcg, 30mcg, or 100mcg) with or without AP 10-701, and (3) to
      assess the duration of the IgG antibody response to Sm-TSP-2 using an indirect ELISA
      following receipt of three doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10mcg, 30mcg, or 100mcg) with or
      without AP 10-701.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures.

          2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for all
             study visits.

          3. Male or non-pregnant female aged 18 to 50, inclusive at the time of enrollment.

          4. Are in good health, as determined by vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood
             pressure), medical history, and brief physical examination at screening.

             -Existing medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion
             Criteria) must be deemed as stable chronic medical conditions. A stable chronic
             medical condition is defined as no change in prescription medication, dose, or
             frequency of medication in the last 3 months (90 days) and health outcomes of the
             specific disease are considered to be within acceptable limits in the last 6 months
             (180 days). Any change due to change of health care provider, or that is done for
             financial reasons, as long as in the same class of medication, will not be considered
             a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to
             improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion
             criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed medications if, in the opinion of
             the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no
             additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity.
             Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of corticosteroids as
             outlined in the Subjects Exclusion Criteria), vitamins, and contraceptives are
             permitted.

          5. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure) are all within normal
             protocol-defined ranges.

             -The normal protocol-defined ranges for vital signs include (a) oral temperature less
             than 38.0°C, (b) pulse 50 to 100 bpm, inclusive, (c) systolic blood pressure 85 to 150
             mmHg, inclusive, and (d) diastolic blood pressure 55 to 90 mmHg, inclusive. Pulse rate
             &lt;50 is acceptable for 2nd and 3rd vaccinations if the subject is otherwise healthy
             with documented sinus bradycardia at baseline.

          6. Laboratory tests (alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, white blood cell count,
             hemoglobin, and platelets) are all within protocol-defined reference ranges.

             -The protocol-defined ranges for laboratory tests include (a) alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) of less than 1.25-times the upper reference limit, (b) creatinine less than 1.25
             times the upper reference limit (c) white blood cells (WBC) between 3.3 x10^3/uL and
             10.4 x10^3/uL, inclusive, (d) hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL or greater for females or 12.1 g/dL
             or greater for males, (e) platelets greater than 130 x10^3/uL. Laboratory test results
             for 2nd and 3rd vaccinations may be at Grade 1 if considered unrelated to study
             product.

          7. Urinalysis with no greater than trace protein and negative for glucose.

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice highly effective
             contraception for a minimum of 30 days prior to study product exposure and for 30 days
             after last vaccination.

               -  Female subjects who are surgically sterile via tubal sterilization, bilateral
                  oophorectomy or hysterectomy or who have been postmenopausal for greater than 1
                  year are not considered to be of childbearing potential.

               -  Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as having low failure rates
                  (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly and may
                  include, but are not limited to, abstinence from intercourse with a male partner,
                  monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, male condoms or diaphragm
                  with spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.

         10. Able to correctly answer all questions on the informed consent comprehension
             questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has the intention to become pregnant within 5 months after enrollment in this study.

          2. Female subjects who are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed at any given time from the
