  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether changes in energy balance alter regional neuronal
      activation of brain regions associated with food intake in individuals screened to be either
      resistant or prone to obesity. Specifically, it will determine whether foods of &quot;hedonic&quot;
      value elicit changes in regional neuronal activity in the fasted and fed state in
      &quot;obese-resistant&quot; and &quot;obese-prone&quot; men and women in varying states of energy balance.
