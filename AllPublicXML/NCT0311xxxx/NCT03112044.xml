  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study HCV negative recipients will be transplanted with HCV positive lungs.
      Investigators will attempt to decrease infectivity rates by performing Normothermic Ex vivo
      Lung Perfusion (EVLP), which is an approved method of donor lung preservation, assessment and
      treatment, and could be an excellent platform to reduce/eliminate hepatitis C virus. Patients
      will be treated by the standard approved direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) if infection occurs.
      It is planned to enrolled 20 patients from the Lung transplant wait list in this study.
      Patients will be followed for 6 months. This will be a single center pilot study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The success of lung transplantation (LTx) is significantly hindered by the lack of sufficient
      number of available donors. Many potential donor lungs cannot be utilized in clinical
      transplantation because donors have chronic viral infections such as hepatitis C (HCV)
      infection. This study will test the possibility of safely transplanting lungs from HCV
      positive donors. Donor lungs will be subjected to Normothermic Ex vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP)
      for 6 hours for organ assessment and reduction of viral load prior to transplantation. After
      transplantation, recipients will be carefully monitored for HCV infection and if infection
      occurs, they will be promptly treated with highly effective antiviral therapy using newly
      approved DAAs. The aim of the study is to show that transplantation of lungs from HCV
      positive donors is safe in the era of DAAs. The hypothesis is that the rate of HCV
      transmission to recipients will be lower than previously described due to EVLP pre-treatment
      and any HCV transmission that does occur will be readily treatable and curable. If
      successful, the knowledge from this study can have a large impact to patients with end stage
      organ diseases by providing a large novel source of donors for lung and potentially other
      organ transplantations.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators aim to transplant 20 HCV- recipients with end-stage lung disease from transplant wait-list using lungs from HCV+ donors. Donor lungs will be selected based on usual donor selection criteria evaluating blood gas analysis, chest imaging, bronchoscopy findings, and assessment in the operating room. Once lungs meet criteria for transplantation, they will be retrieved in standard fashion, transported to Toronto General Hospital in cold static preservation, placed on EVLP for 6 hours, and transplanted to consented recipients.</intervention_model_description>
