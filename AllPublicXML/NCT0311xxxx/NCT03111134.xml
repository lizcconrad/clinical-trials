  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, open-type abdominal surgery is routine access into the abdomen. Median incision
      is the common choice with open-type abdominal surgery. Layered abdomen-closing is often used
      at the end-time of the surgery. There are some common postoperative complications, such as
      incision pain, surgical site infection, surgical incision dehiscence and incisional hernia.
      The key to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications depends on safe and reliable
      technology of abdomen-closing.

      It's usually difficult to close the abdomen after the incisional hernia surgery, and the
      recurrence of incisional hernia is high. But the recurrence fell off observably when
      component separation technology was applied to abdomen-closing of incisional hernia.

      Based on this, we hypothesis that modified-CST applied to abdomen-closing in routine
      abdominal surgery may improve the quality of wound-healing.

      In this prospective single-blind randomized controlled trial, traditional abdomen-closing
      technology and modified-CST will be used to gastric cancer surgery, and the quality of
      wound-healing will be evaluated to confirm which kind of abdomen-closing technology better.
