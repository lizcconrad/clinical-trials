  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to empirically evaluate a web-based intervention to reduce heavy
      drinking among college women with a history of sexual assault who display elevated levels of
      psychological distress. College women with a history of sexual assault often report more
      heavy drinking and psychological distress than women without a history of assault. Moreover,
      women with assault histories often have difficulty regulating their emotions and tolerating
      distress which can lead to a pattern of drinking to cope distress. Trauma exposure, negative
      mood, and poor coping strategies have been associated with poor treatment outcomes and
      relapse following alcohol treatment. Incorporating distress tolerance and emotion regulation
      skills with an alcohol intervention may enhance treatment effects among women with a history
      of sexual assault by decreasing their motivation to drink to cope with depression or anxiety
      and by building adaptive coping strategies. Therefore, the web-based intervention will
      include cognitive behavioral skills for reducing alcohol consumption and incorporate emotion
      regulation and distress tolerance skills from Dialectical Behavior Therapy.

      For the small randomized controlled trial, heavy drinking college women with a history of
      sexual assault will be recruited and randomized to receive the intervention or an assessment
      only control. Online surveys will be administered at baseline, and post-treatment as well as
      1-month and 6-months post-treatment.
