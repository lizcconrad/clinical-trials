  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the impact of the new organisational models developed in the framework of
      the BeyondSilos pilot service in order to provide ICT supported integrated health and social
      care to elderly patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the evaluation carried out in BeyondSilos is to identify the differences
      introduced by implementing ICT supported integrated care in different domains according to
      the MAST evaluation framework, including safety, clinical and social outcomes, resource use
      and cost of care, user/carer experience and organisational changes.

      The focus of the evaluation will be the impact of so called &quot;horizontal&quot; integration, which
      is the integration between social care and health care, and the changing organisational
      models for elderly patients.

      The hypothesis in this study is that integrated care (IC) will lead to a more personalised
      and coordinated care, improve outcomes for elderly patients, deliver more effective care and
      support, and provide more cost efficient health and social services.
