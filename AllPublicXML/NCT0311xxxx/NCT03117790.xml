  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances frequently occur in elderly patients after major surgery; and their
      occurrence are associated with worse outcomes including increased incidence of delirium.
      Previous studies showed that, for elderly patients admitted to the ICU after non-cardiac
      surgery, low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion improved to some degree the quality of sleep and
      reduced the incidence of delirium. The investigators hypothesize that, for elderly patients
      after major non-cardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia can also improve the
      sleep quality. The purpose of this randomized controlled pilot study is to investigate the
      impact of dexmedetomidine supplemented analgesia on the sleep quality in elderly patients
      after major non-cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances usually develop in elderly patients after major surgery, which are
      manifested as prolonged sleep latencies, shortened sleep duration, frequent wake-up,
      disordered circadian rhythm, abnormally increased stages 1 and 2 non-rapid eye movement (N1
      and N2) sleep, and decreased or absent slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM)
      sleep. Occurrence of sleep disturbances is harmful for the recovery of both physiological and
      mental functions after surgery, and may even lead to the development of postoperative
      complications. For example, study showed that postoperative sleep disturbances were
      associated with increase risks of delirium, cardiovascular events and infections, prolonged
      durations of stay in ICU and hospital, increased medical expenses and high mortality rate.
      However, methods that may effectively improve the quality of postoperative sleep are still
      lacking.

      Multiple factors are responsible for the development of sleep disturbances after surgery.
      These include (1) environmental factors, such as noises, lights, medical and nursing
      activities, etc.; (2) comorbid diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, inflammatory
      reaction, infections, etc.; (3) stress response and pain stimulation provoked by surgery,
      especially major surgery; (4) mechanical ventilation. Studies found significantly disordered
      circadian rhythms, fragmented sleep and absent REM sleep in mechanically ventilated patients;
      and (5) multiple medications, such as benzodiazepines, opioids, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs, and glucocorticoids,.

      Dexmedetomidine is a high selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist which produces hypnosis and
      sedation by activating the alpha 2 adrenoceptor in the locus coeruleus of the brain; it is
      well known that the locus coeruleus is the key part to adjust sleep and awakening. The study
      of Nelson et al. showed that dexmedetomidine induces the expression of c-Fos in the locus
      coeruleus nucleus and ventral lateral nucleus in rats' brain, which is similar to the
      expression of c-Fos during non-rapid eye movement sleep. They presumed that dexmedetomidine
      activates the endogenous sleep-promoting pathway to produce sedative effects, which is
      totally different from benzodiazepines and opiates on the mechanism.

      A recent study of the investigators showed that, in elderly patients who were admitted to the
      ICU after surgery and did not require mechanical ventilation, low-dose dexmedetomidine
      infusion (at a rate of 0.1 ug/kg/h, for 15 hours) prolonged the total sleep time, increased
      the percentage of N2 sleep (and reduced the percentage of N1 sleep), increased the efficiency
      of sleep and improved the subjective sleep quality. Another study of the investigators showed
      that low-dose dexmedetomidine infusion in elderly patients who were admitted to the ICU after
      non-cardiac surgery improved the subjective sleep quality and reduced the daily prevalences
      of delirium during the first 3 days after surgery. We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine
      supplemented analgesia can improve the structure and circadian rhythm of sleep, and reduce
      the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after major non-cardiac surgery.
