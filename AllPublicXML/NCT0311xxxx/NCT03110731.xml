  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of strength training on sleep quality and
      daytime sleepiness in institutionalized adolescents (14 to 19 years of age). Thirty-one
      adolescents were randomly assigned in two sample groups: intervention group (IG, n = 19) and
      control group (CG, n = 12). Anthropometric measures were performed (height and body mass) and
      BMI was determined. Sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed using the
      questionnaires, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESE), and
      total sleep time by accelerometer. Physical training (2x / week) was performed for 12 weeks.
      The OMNI Perceived Exertion Scale for Resistance Exercise (OMNI-RES) scale was used to
      control the effort intensity and the exercises followed an alternate pre-follow-up.
