  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, sequential single
      dose escalation safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study of subcutaneous and
      intramuscular TMB-607 administered to HIV-negative volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a sequential dose-escalation design for single dose subcutaneous and
      intramuscular administrations in HIV-negative volunteers. The study investigates seven
      TMB-607 dose groups: Cohort 1: 200 mg subcutaneously (Arm A), 500 mg subcutaneously (Arm B)
      and 1,000 mg subcutaneously (Arm C); Cohort 2: 100 mg intramuscularly (Arm A), 400 mg
      intramuscularly (Arm B), 800 mg intramuscularly (Arm C) and 1,500 mg intramuscularly (Arm D).
      Five participants will be enrolled in each dose group, and will be randomly assigned in a 4:1
      ratio to receive TMB-607 or placebo in a double-blinded fashion (four participants per group
      assigned to active TMB-607; one participant per group assigned to placebo). In each group, a
      single dose injection of TMB-607 or placebo will be administered at Day 0. The first three
      Day 0 injections administered in each dose group must be given at least 24 hours apart.
      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially so that a maximum of three subjects in each Cohort is
      dosed within any 24-hour period. All subjects will be monitored for 24 hours after study drug
      administration, with vital signs and ECGs checked hourly, and intensive pharmacokinetic
      samples collected during this period. Study drug will only be administered on Mondays to
      prevent weekend days from interfering with the daily assessments closest to the time of
      dosing. Participants will be followed for 10 weeks after receiving study drug.

    <intervention_model_description>Five qualifying participants will be enrolled into each of seven dosage Arms - three escalating subcutaneous dosages (Cohort 1), and four escalating intramuscular dosages (Cohort 2). Enrolling participants will be randomized to receive active TMB-607 or placebo. Beginning with the lowest dosage group, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review available data after four participants have completed two weeks of post-dose follow-up to determine whether escalation to the next dosage group may proceed</intervention_model_description>
