  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of Rhythmic
      Reading Training (RRT), a computer-assisted intervention method that combines sublexical
      reading exercises with rhythm processing, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      on reading abilities of a group of Italian undergraduate students with dyslexia. Two
      experimental conditions (active vs. sham) will be compared. Finally, the effects of the
      intervention on other cognitive functions involved in the process of reading (i.e., rapid
      automatized naming, verbal working memory, rhythm perception abilities) will be measured.

    <description>RRT is a computerized reading training program designed for Italian students with dyslexia. The main feature of this intervention is the integration of a traditional remediation approach (sublexical treatment) with rhythm processing. Therefore, all reading exercises are characterized by a rhythmic accompaniment with gradually increasing speed.</description>

    <description>tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) is a noninvasive weak-current brain stimulation technique that can facilitate (anodal electrode) or inhibit (cathodal electrode) cortical activity, thus offering exciting possibilities for the enhancement and treatment of impaired cognitive abilities.</description>
