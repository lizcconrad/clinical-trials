      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the test product, eslicarbazepine acetate
      800 mg tablets (test 1, To be marketed (TBM) Treatment A), and the reference product,
      eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg tablets (current Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) source
      - Marketed formulation (MF)) (Reference, Treatment C), are bioequivalent and to demonstrate
      dose equivalence between eslicarbazepine acetate 4 x 200 mg tablets (test 2, TBM Treatment B)
      and eslicarbazepine acetate 800 mg tablet (Reference).

      The study will comprise:

        -  Screening period of maximum 21 days before the first administration of the
           investigational medicinal product (IMP);

        -  Three treatment periods (each of which will include a profile period of 72 hours)
           separated by a wash out period of 7 calendar days (minimum number of days based on
           half-life of the analyte) to 14 calendar days (maximum number of days based on
           logistical arrangements) between consecutive administrations of the IMP, and

        -  A post study visit within 1 and 2 weeks of completion of the last treatment period of
           the study or within 72 hours of termination or withdrawal.

      Subjects will be assigned randomly to treatment sequence according to randomization schedule,
      before the first administration of IMP.

      Subjects will be admitted to the study center on Day -1 and will be allowed to leave 24 hours
      after dosing. Subjects have to return for the subsequent blood sample collections up to 72
      hours after dosing.
