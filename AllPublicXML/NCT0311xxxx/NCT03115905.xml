  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a staged registry study of early treatment strategy management of acute aneurysmal
      subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) among different economic development levels areas in China.

      First stage, the study will investigate and register the basic information of emergency
      treatment management for the acute aSAH in 20 different grade centers located in different
      economic levels districts including Northeast part, Northern, Eastern, South-central,
      Northwest, Southwest and Qinghai-Tibet of China. Comparing the the outcome of acute aSAH to
      find the critical factors to affect it by statistical analysis. Then,the investigators will
      offer some suggestions to adjust the measures to improve the efficacy of emergency medical
      service for acute SAH.

      Second stage, to evaluate the outcome after applying the new suggestion of self-control
      methods.

      The investigators hypothesis that there is an appropriate green pathway in different
      districts to shorten the rescuing time, improve the curative effects.

      For this study, the investigators consulted and hired professionals and experts about data
      collection, data analysis and methodology. So it has an intact systematic Project Steering
      Committee for the whole project, including Data Monitoring Committee, Data Management
      Committee, Project Academic Committee, Executive Group, Project Manager, Project
      Statistician,Technical Support Center. Also the project have a scientific regulations system.

      Steering Committee: To monitor and supervise the progress of the Registry Study for Emergency
      Medical Service of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage With Different Economic Development
      Levels Areas in China toward its interim and overall objectives.To consider recommendations
      of the data monitoring committee and local ethics committees. To promote the publicity and
      presentation of all aspects of this trial.

      Project Manager and Executive Group: To ensure the successfully implementation of this
      project, including charging the daily operations of the study in 20 different research
      hospitals, organizing the monthly meeting to consider issues raised during the monthly
      progress of the study, liaising with the steering committee,the data management centre and
      statistical centre.

      Data management Committee: To be responsible for setting up and maintain the Electronic Data
      Capture (EDC) System according to the paper Case Report Form(pCRF) designed by principal
      investigators. To collect and save the pCRF coming from sub-centers. To entry the data into
      EDC system and keep the same with CRF. To organize training for the investigators about the
      rules in filling the EDC and pCRF.To determine the frequency of the Data Management Report
      and to fed it back to the steering committee every three months.

      Data Monitoring Committee: To determine the frequency of the data monitoring including the
      source data(Medical records) accuracy, completeness and representativeness comparing the
      external data(EDC, pCRF) in 20 centers. To report the results after the monitoring back to
      the steering committee about the missing data, non-reported and other problems about the
      study. To make a Standard Operation Procedure(SOP) from getting data to using data.

      Academic Committee: To supervise the academic issues including patient recruitment, protocol
      deviation, adverse events evaluating. To settle down the question and problem in the process
      of the study.

      Project Statistician: The investigators cooperate with the statisticians of Medical Research
      &amp; Biometrics Center National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, China to get the
      professional statistical report.

      Technical Support Center: To provide technical support during the process of the study.
