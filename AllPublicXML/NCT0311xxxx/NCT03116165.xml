  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of modified prolonged exposure therapy in trauma patients
      recently exposed to trauma in an emergency room to prevent the onset of post-traumatic stress
      disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates if prolonged exposure is an effective treatment in reducing PTSD
      symptoms people who have recently experienced trauma. The study will also investigate
      predictive markers of PTSD, moderators of successful treatment and health economic aspects of
      the intervention.

      Participants will first undergo an evaluation session that will include an interview
      (Immediate Stress Reaction Checklist) and questionnaires. Participants will subsequently be
      randomly assigned to receive either modified prolonged exposure therapy or attention control,
      starting the assigned intervention immediately. Participants in each arm will receive three
      weekly treatment sessions. Treatment will involve psychoeducation about common reactions to
      trauma, imaginal exposure (revisiting memories of a recent trauma out loud with a therapist
      and audio-recording these for review at home), exposure in vivo and breathing retraining. All
      participants will undergo assessments 2, 6 (primary endpoint) and 12 months after the
      intervention by blinded assessors. Patients unable to come to the clinic for follow-up
      assessments will be interviewed via telephone or skype. Source data will be quality monitored
      by an independent party (Karolinska trial alliance) according to the Helsinki Declaration.
