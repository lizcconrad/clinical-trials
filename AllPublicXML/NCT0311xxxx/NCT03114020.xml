      The study primarily aims to establish desmosine and isodesmosine concentrations in plasma,
      sputum and urine measured as markers of elastin degradation systemically in the lung and also
      markers of inflammation and fibrinogen. Assessment of vital signs, lab tests, carbon monoxide
      diffusing capacity, oxygen saturation, pulmonary function tests, ECGs, physical exams and
      adverse events.

          4. Evidence of emphysema on radiographic imaging.

          5. A ratio of pre-bronchodilator FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC) of ≤ 80% at
             screening

          6. FEV1 ≥ 30% and ≤ 79% (post-bronchodilator) of predicted normal at screening

          7. Clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count, serum chemistry, and urinalysis)
             within normal limits or clinically acceptable to the PI and sponsor at screening

          8. Women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active must agree to use an
