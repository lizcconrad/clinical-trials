      This study has been conducted with University students in Turkey. The selected 70 students
      were associated with obesity risk factors about obesity (owerveight or normal weight and they
      were in the risk group in terms of obesity according to the risk rating scales, and between
      19-24 years old) and randomly assigned to the experimental (35 students) and control group
      (35 students). Applications for the experimental group for 11 weeks about nutritional habits,
      practices for physical activity, and motivational messages sent via social media.

      Primary Outcome Measure: Nutrition-Exercise Attitude Score, Nutrition-Exercise Behavior
      Score, Exercise Benefit / Obstacle Score. We used some scales for evaluate the primary
      outcomes (The Scale of Nutrition-Exercise Attitude-Behavior, The Scale of Exercise Benefit /
      Obstacle).

      Bady Mass Index, Waist / Hip Ratio and Body fat percentage are secondary outcomes.

    <masking_description>In the RCT, blindness was done in terms of data collectors and statistician. The data were collected by another investigator (assistant investigator) who did not know who was in the experiment and control group, and the data were recorded by the assistant investigator on the computer, without specifying the experiment and control group.
Experimental and control groups were coded by an assistant investigator. Analysis of the data encoded by groups was done by a statistician.
After the statistical analyzes were made and the research report was written, the assistant investigator explained the coding for the experiment and control group.
In this way, data gathering, statistical analysis and reporting have been blinded.
Note: Two assistant researchers received support from the research process. One of the assistant researcher is a coach who is a graduate of the Faculty of Sport Sciences other than Ph.D. Student of the Department of Public Health Nursing</masking_description>
