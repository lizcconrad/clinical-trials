  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term sitting has been associated with multiple health risks. To reduce sitting time for
      office workers in a Dutch insurance company, an intervention will be implemented. The goal of
      this study is to evaluate this intervention on the short term (3 months) and long-term (12
      months).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large volumes of sitting time have been associated with multiple health risks such as
      diabetes, heart disease and premature death. Especially, in office workers sitting time per
      day can accumulate to over 10 hours a day. To reduce sitting time for office workers in a
      Dutch insurance company, an intervention will be implemented. The intervention contains the
      introduction of alternative workstations, intervention sessions with an occupational
      physiotherapist and an activity tracker with a self-help program booklet. The goal of this
      study is to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of this intervention on the short term (3
      months) and long-term (12 months). The primary outcome is objectively assessed sitting time.

      In a cluster randomized controlled trial 250 employees of an insurance company will
      participate in the study. After baseline measurements, matched departments will be randomly
      assigned to the control or intervention group. The evaluation includes an economic and
      process evaluation.

    <description>The intervention consists of the introduction of sit-stand workstations and desk bikes in the participants work environment in a ratio of 1:2 with traditional desks and chairs. Employees will receive a half hour intervention session at the start of the intervention from an occupational physiotherapist, who will provide further intervention support in the ensuing 12 weeks. Intervention participants will also receive an activity tracker which provides feedback on sitting time and physical activity levels.</description>
