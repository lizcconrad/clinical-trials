      This study is the clinical study of Apatinib combined with Capecitabine compared with
      Apatinib in the treatment of advanced non-resectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma, the object is
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,its purpose is to observe and evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Apatinib Mesylate Tablets combined with Capecitabine in the treatment
      of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, its main primary endpoint is TTP (time to
      progression) while the secondary endpoint is OS (overall survival), ORR (objective response
      rate), DCR (disease control rate), serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and quality of life.
      170 patients will be enrolled and 1:1 randomized into two groups: Apatinib combined
      Capecitabine and Apatinib alone. Major safety indicators are Vital signs, laboratory
      indicators, adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), drug-related AE and SAE, and
      specific AE (such as hypertension, proteinuria, and hand-foot syndrome), according to
      NCI-CTCAE.
