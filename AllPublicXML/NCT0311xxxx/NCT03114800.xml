  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this work is to develop and test an automated movement detection monitoring tool
      that could lead to reduced burden on clinicians and in-turn reduce pressure ulcer incidence
      rates. Ten healthy participants will perform video-recorded bed movements while weight
      distribution and interface pressures at bony prominences on the pelvis are recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence rate and subsequent costs of preventable pressure ulcers is astounding.
      Although pressure ulcer risk assessment tools and prevention approaches have been a topic of
      research and for many years, the incidence rate has remained relatively consistent. One
      reason that progress has not been made to lower the incidence rate is that there is no
      objective monitoring tool to determine how much a person is moving or is being moved in their
      bed. Current practices are time-intensive and have not yet leveraged intelligent monitoring
      technology that could reduce clinical burden and increase accuracy of the risk assessment and
      efficacy of prevention protocols. The goal of this work is to develop and test an automated
      movement detection monitoring tool that could lead to reduced burden on clinicians and
      in-turn reduce pressure ulcer incidence rates. This monitoring tool will be an extension of
      our intelligent bed sensor we developed named the Embedded Scale, or E-Scale. The E-Scale
      currently has software modules that detect bed exit, individual weight, and multi-person
      weight. The project described here would develop a movement module for the E- Scale to
      monitor people's movements in bed in an attempt to eventually reduce incidence of pressure
      ulcers in clinical care.
