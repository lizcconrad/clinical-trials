  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital arrest can occur from multiple etiologies. In patients without an obvious
      reason for the sudden-death event, diagnostic evaluation is not clear. This study is to
      determine if early imaging with a head-to-pelvis CT scan may improve diagnostic accuracy,
      speed of diagnosis and potentially clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Best practices for survivors of out-of-hospital sudden death are underdeveloped and untested.
      Early diagnosis in sudden death survivors is challenging due to patient intubation and
      obtundation, limited history, and imprecise standard of care testing. Sudden death without an
      obvious cause (termed &quot;idiopathic sudden death&quot;) is primarily caused by cardiovascular
      disease although a large number of cases result from non-cardiac disease. Improvements in
      computed tomography (CT) technologies provides a means to identify up to 86% of idiopathic
      causes of sudden death, including cardiovascular and coronary artery disease, cerebral
      disease, pulmonary embolism and abdominal catastrophe4 as well as secondary injury from
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation. To date, use of early CT scans on consecutive sudden death
      survivors has not been reported. The innovation of this pilot trial is to be first to test
      whether a comprehensive head-to-pelvis, ECG-gated contrast CT scan (CT-First) can identify
      the majority of causes for idiopathic sudden death. The significance of CT-First approach is
      potentially reducing diagnostic errors, treatment delays and inappropriate treatments to
      potentially improve clinical outcomes in this very high risk population. The expertise of the
      medical centers involved, combined with the highly respected Medic One service, provide an
      unusual opportunity to test this diagnostic paradigm with cutting edge CT technologies. The
      data generated from this study will be used to plan larger randomized trials of early
      contrast CT scanning versus invasive coronary angiography in sudden death survivors and may
      be extrapolated to other patient populations such as possible acute coronary syndrome or
      after trauma.
