        Inclusion:

          1. Subject understands the study procedures, is willing to comply with the study
             procedures and required visits, and agrees to participate by giving written informed
             consent. Subjects with a legal guardian, must have the written informed consent of the
             legal guardian.

          2. Subject (or legal guardian) must be willing to authorize use and disclosure of
             protected health information collected for the study.

          3. Subjects must have 5 or more AK lesions that are non-hypertrophic and
             non-hyperkeratotic, contained within a single contiguous approximately 5 cm x 5 cm (25
             cm2) region of face and/or scalp.

          4. Subjects must be 18 years of age or older. Male and female subjects can be enrolled.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception during the
             study which can include abstinence with an adequate secondary option should the
             subject become sexually active. All women of childbearing potential must complete a
             urine pregnancy test at the Baseline Visit (Visit 2) and the test result must be
             negative to be eligible for enrollment.

             A female is considered of childbearing potential unless she is:

               1. postmenopausal for at least 12 months prior to study product administration;

               2. without a uterus and/or both ovaries; or has been surgically sterile (i.e., tubal
                  ligation) for at least 6 months prior to study product administration.

             Reliable methods of contraception are:

               1. hormonal methods or intrauterine device in use more than 90 days prior to study
                  product administration; or

               2. barrier methods plus spermicide in use at least 14 days prior to study product
                  administration.

               3. partner has had a vasectomy at least 3 months previous to study product
                  administration.

               4. Essure

             Exception: Sexually inactive female subjects of childbearing potential are not
             required to practice a reliable method of contraception and may be enrolled at the
             investigator's discretion provided that they are counseled to remain sexually inactive
             for the duration of the study and understand the possible risks involved in getting
             pregnant during the study. An abstinent female must agree that if she becomes sexually
             active during the study she will use an acceptable form of contraception.

          6. Subjects must agree not to use any product on the treatment area during the entire
             course of study except for Investigator-approved cleanser, sunscreen, wash, and
             non-medicated make-up. Subjects should continue to use these Investigator-approved
             products for the duration of the study and should avoid any changes in these consumer
             products.

          7. Subjects must be willing to comply with sun avoidance measures for the face including
             use of Investigator-approved sunscreen and/or hats, have limited sun exposure time,
             and have no tanning bed use.

          8. Subjects must be in good general health as determined by the Investigator and
             supported by the medical history, and normal or not clinically significant abnormal
             vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate). Subjects are eligible if:

               -  Systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 160 and &gt; 85 mmHg

               -  Diastolic BP &lt; 100 and &gt; 50 mmHg

        Exclusion:

          1. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             (NSAID) or any component of the formulation of the study medication, including a
             history of asthma, urticarial, or other allergic-type reactions after taking aspirin
             or other NSAIDs.

          2. Known or suspected allergy to sulfonamides.

          3. Clinical evidence of severe, uncontrolled autoimmune, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, hematological, hepatic, neurologic, pulmonary or renal disease.

          4. Recent (within 6 months) or planned coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

          5. Significant history (within the past year) of alcohol or drug abuse.

          6. Participation in any clinical research study within 30 days of the Baseline Visit.

          7. Concomitant use of cosmetics or other topical drug products on or near the selected
             treatment area, except for Investigator-approved cleanser, sunscreen, wash, and
             non-medicated makeup.

          8. Cosmetic or therapeutic procedures (e.g. laser, peeling, photodynamic therapy) within
             2 weeks and within 2 cm of the selected treatment area.

          9. Other skin conditions within the selected treatment area (e.g. rosacea, psoriasis,
             atopic dermatitis, eczema, basal or squamous cell carcinoma or albinism).

         10. Any systemic cancer therapy or diagnosis within 6 months of the Baseline Visit.
