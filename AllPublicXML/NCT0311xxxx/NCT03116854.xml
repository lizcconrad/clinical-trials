  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta Blocker therapy is a mainstay of treatment following acute coronary syndromes (ACS),
      particularly acute myocardial infarction (MI). Studies have repeatedly demonstrated the
      benefit of Beta blocker therapy following either ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction
      (STEMI) or non-ST-segment elevation ACS,and Beta blocker therapy has been a performance
      measure used to grade hospital performance by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
      and Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.Although the benefit of
      Beta blocker therapy has been clearly demonstrated, the doses that have been used in many of
      these studies are significantly higher than those typically used currently in clinical
      practice.The benefit of Beta blockers has been ascribed to dose-related heart rate
      reduction,although alternative mechanisms for their benefit have also been proposed.In
      addition, the classical Beta blocker trials were performed decades ago, before the modern
      therapeutic era,which includes reperfusion therapy, potent antithrombotics, and statins. This
      raises the question of whether titration of Beta blocker therapy to the high doses that had
      been previously studied provides substantial incremental benefit in current clinical practice
      over the more frequently prescribed and clinically tolerated doses of Beta blockers.Moreover,
      a recent study has reported that high-dose Beta blockers were not superior to low-dose Beta
      blockers,aprovocative finding requiring validation. And until now, there has been no registry
      on patients with ACS about Between Beta-blocker Treatment in Henan, the most populated (about
      100 million) and predominantly rural (66%)province in central China.

      This multicenter, prospective, observational study is aimed to analyze the application status
      and long-term prognostic beneﬁt of beta-blockers in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      1. Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology is responsible for design, data quality
           control and statistical analysis.

        2. Data were collected using a uniformed Case Report Form(CRF) by trained staff at each
           hospital.

        3. Sample size estimation: Based on retrospective observational cohort of ACS patients,
           1-year mortality in beta-blocker recipients and non-beta-blocker recipients were 2.5%
           and 5.6%, respectively. To achieve a precision of 5% with an α of 0.05, the loss ratio
           of following-up is 15%.The investigators would need a sample of 3000.

        4. Statistical analysis plan: the investigators will report summary statistics for patient
           characteristics, comorbidities, treatment strategies and outcomes. the investigators
           will also undertake the following prespecified subgroup analyses: age, sex, STE-ACS or
           NSTE-ACS, history of diabetes, history of hypertension, smoking.and analyze the
           association Between Beta-blocker Treatment and Long-term Mortality.

        5. Quality assurance plan 1)Diagnosis of ACS is according to the third universal
           definition.2)Before registry, a training program on study objectives, data collection,
           and ACS management is given to the primary investigator and related staff at each
           participating center.3)Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology will regularly
           monitored at least 10% of CRFs for accuracy against medical records. If the CRFs are not
           completed with 98% accuracy, all CRFs are considered unqualified and this staff will be
           retrained.4)Before entering into the computer, data is queried for invalid and illogical
           values by research staff in Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology. Participating
           centres who has the high error rate of data, and no change in 6 months shall be deemed
           abandoned automatically; participating centres who has the high quality of data will be
           issued a certificate to reward.5)Investigator meeting will be annually held to conclude
           the progress, solve existing problems and strengthen program training.
