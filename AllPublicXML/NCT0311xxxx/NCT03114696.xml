             investigator's judgement

          3. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score 6-15 at V1

          4. Body mass index (BMI) 18.5-29.9 kg/m2

          5. Generally in good health without clinically significant findings at V1

          8. Written informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known sensitivity to any components of the investigational product

          3. Substantial daily sleepiness as per investigator's judgement

          4. Less than 5 hours sleep per night on average, self-reported at V1

          5. Any medical condition associated with sleep disorder as per investigator's judgement
             (e.g. sleep apnoea, restless legs syndrome, neurological / psychiatric disorder)

          6. Any lifestyle and other factors potentially associated with sleep problems as per
             investigator's judgement (e.g. excessive caffeine intake, shift work, long-distance
             travelling, significant stressors such as active grieving etc.)

          7. History and/or presence of clinically significant dis-ease, which per investigator's
             judgement could interfere with the results of the study or the safety of the subject:

               -  Eating disorders such as anorexia

               -  Untreated or non-stabilised metabolic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus

               -  Significant gastrointestinal diseases

               -  Any other known significant or serious condition / disease that renders subjects
                  ineligible (e.g. history of malignancy within the past 5 years prior to V1, any
                  clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, liver disease etc.)

          8. Use of drugs/supplements which could interfere with the results of the study as per
             investigator's judgement (e.g. melatonin and melatonin derivatives, stimulants,
             neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnotics) within the last 4 weeks
             prior to V1 and during the study

          9. Behavioural intervention for sleep difficulties in the past 6 months and during the
             study as per investigator's judgement

         10. Deviation of laboratory parameter(s) at V1 that is:

               -  clinically significant or

               -  &gt;2x ULN (upper limit of normal), unless the deviation is justified by a
                  previously known not clinically relevant condition, e.g. Gilbert's syndrome)

         11. Alcohol abuse (men: ≥21 units/week, women: ≥14 units/ week; 1 unit equals
             approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits)

         12. Drug abuse

         13. Participation in another study during the last 4 weeks prior to V1 and during the
             study
