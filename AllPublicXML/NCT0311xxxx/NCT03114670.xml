  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML) recurred after the allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) have a dismal prognosis.The investigators developed
      donor-derived chimeric antigen receptor modified-T cell(CART) to target CD123 for the
      treatment of AML. The investigators start the Phase I study aimed to treat recurred
      post-transplantation AML patients using donor-derived CAR-T. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allo-HSCT is increasingly being used for AML, however, leukemia relapse remain a main problem
      for decades.Recently the investigators have witnessed great progresses in cancer therapy with
      chimeric antigen receptors modified T cells(CAR-T), especially for B-cell malignance.
      preclinical data about anti-CD123 CART have shown raised serious safety concerns of human
      anti-CD123 CAR-T for severe impairment of normal hematopoiesis in NSG mice.Patients with AML
      recurred after allo-HSCT have a dismal prognosis.The investigators developed donor-derived
      CART to target CD123 for the treatment of AML. The investigators start the Phase I study
      aimed to recurred post-transplantation AML patients using donor-derived CAR-T. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD123 CAR-T cells in patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and Female subjects with CD123+ acute myeloid leukemia as confirmed by
             immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry;

          2. Patients must have received an allogenic stem cell transplantation(Allo-HSCT). The
             leukemia relapsed. There are available donor or enough cryopreserved donor-derived
             PBMCs for CART preparation and subsequent Allo-HSCT. In the previous case, the donor
             should have adequate venous access for apheresis.

          3. Karnofsky score greater than 70%;

          4. patients more than 18 years of age

          5. Expected survival time &gt;16 weeks;

          6. Bilirubin &lt;3.0 mg/dL,

          8. Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide(DLCO) and forced expiratory volume
             in one second(FEV1)&gt;45% of predictive value.

         11. failed production release testing: CAR+ T cells &lt;30% or T cell expansion less than
