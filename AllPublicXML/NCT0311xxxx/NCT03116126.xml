  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NorAD is a clinical trial funded by the UK National Institute of Health Research. In this
      trial the investigators will assess whether a long-acting preparation of guanfacine, a drug
      used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in children, can improve thinking
      (particularly attention) in Alzheimer's Disease when it is added to the standard
      NICE-approved drugs that are normally used in this condition.

      This is a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of extended-release
      guanfacine as an add-on therapy in AD, and whether it improves cognition compared to standard
      cholinergic therapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence suggesting that both noradrenaline and acetylcholine have key roles to play
      in attention. Guanfacine acts by increasing levels of noradrenaline, a substance in the brain
      which is closely linked with attention, both noradrenaline levels and attentional performance
      have been shown to be reduced in Alzheimer's Disease.

      In this study the investigators propose that modulation of the noradrenergic deficit that has
      been described in Alzheimer's Disease in addition to standard cholinergic treatment could
      have significant positive effects on cognition, particularly in those patients who suffer
      from attentional impairments. The investigators want to assess whether long-acting guanfacine
      should be used in addition to NICE-approved drugs that are currently being used in AD as part
      of combination therapy.

      It is a single-centre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind controlled Phase 3 trial to
      compare the efficacy of standard cholinergic therapy (Donepezil, Rivastigmine or Galantamine)
      plus extended release guanfacine (2mg GXR) versus standard cholinergic therapy plus placebo
      on Cognition (as measured by the ADAS-Cog) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      Disease.

      The trial, which will recruit 160 patients (80 randomised to GXR add-on therapy and 80
      randomised to placebo), based at Imperial College London - Imperial College Healthcare NHS
      Trust.
