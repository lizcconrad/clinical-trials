  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contextualization: Trigger points are muscle nodules found in muscles. We can observe five
      different types of trigger point, in clinical practice two of them stand out, the active
      trigger point; Which is painful; And latent; Asymptomatic; Both of which are sensitive to
      palpation. Once the individual present these muscle nodules can develop pain and motor
      dysfunction. Studies indicate that the prevalence of trigger points is 95% of individuals
      with chronic musculoskeletal pain, but this prevalence is not yet clear in individuals with
      low back pain.

      Objective: To compare the pain and function levels of patients with acute and chronic low
      back pain who, when asymptomatic, had trigger points compared to the pain and function levels
      of patients with acute and chronic low back pain who, when asymptomatic, had no trigger
      points.

      Study design: Cohort study, two arms, blind evaluator, prospectively enrolled at baseline.

      Location: This research will be conducted in the physiotherapy department at the
      Rehabilitation Center of the Brotherhood of Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo (ISCMSP).

      Patients: 400 asymptomatic individuals Follow-up: Asymptomatic individuals will be assessed
      at baseline and over 3 years. You will be asked to contact the research department within 6
      weeks of low back pain (acute) and after 12 weeks of low back pain (chronic). Participants
      will be allocated to two groups, trigger point group (n = 200) and group without trigger
      point (n = 200).

      Outcomes: The pain intensity, function level and trigger point pain intensity outcomes will
      be evaluated at the baseline, within 6 weeks for the patient to present pain in the lumbar
      (acute) and after 12 weeks the pain persists (chronic)
