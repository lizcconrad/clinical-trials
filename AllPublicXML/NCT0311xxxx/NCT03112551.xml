  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the investigators assume that magnesium sulphate for treating eclampsia can be safely reduced
      from 24 hours to shorter duration of therapeutic anticonvulsant effect for 12 hours. Short
      duration of drug exposure is suitable for low resource setting where there is little tools or
      busy staff for monitoring drug toxicity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The idea of using 12 hours duration of magnesium sulphate for treating eclampsia may be
      effective and attractive, especially in settings with limited resources and where there is no
      availability of tools to monitor the serum level of magnesium sulphate. This is because the
      most common reported maternal adverse effects of magnesium sulphate are minor and may be
      confused with other symptom of eclampsia of even labor.The administration of Magnesium
      sulphate for 24 hours in the absence of monitoring of the serum magnesium sulphate might be
      life threatening in a resource- challenged situation , thus the current study is planned to
      be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of shorter duration (12 hours) of
      magnesium sulphate therapy in preventing development of convulsions in cases of eclampsia.
