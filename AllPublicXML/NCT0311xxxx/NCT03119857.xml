      Summary

      In patients with prostate cancer (PC) who have only biochemically relapsed disease after
      curative treatment (or some locally advanced PC patients), hormonal therapy remains a de
      facto standard of care treatment. Adding docetaxel-based chemotherapy to a standard-of-care
      hormonal therapy has an increased potential to treat prostate cancer cell clones resistant to
      androgen withdrawal and to possibly shorten the duration of therapy needed to control the
      disease.

      This clinical trial is designed on the basis of an unmet clinical need, as well as other
      factors including: 1) a consensus among investigators on endpoints for studies of patients
      with a rising PSA, 2) the ability to identify subjects at high risk for developing
      radiographic metastases, 3) the fact that hormonal therapy has already been shown to improve
      survival when applied early in the natural history, and 4) the availability of chemotherapy
      such as docetaxel that can improve survival in subjects with advanced disease.

      It is our hypothesis that a more appropriate group of patients who may benefit from the
      curative potential of systemic chemo-hormonal modality is that with minimal, but detectable
      disease who have a high probability of developing metastatic disease, clinical symptoms and
      eventually death from prostate cancer in a defined time frame. The investigators hypothesize
      further that the approach is likely to be more effective at a time of minimal tumour burden,
      resulting in minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality of life while
      on treatment.

      This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy to hormonal
      therapy alone in the population of subjects with a rising PSA. Two therapeutic approaches
      will be compared in this two-arm randomized clinical trial. The control Arm A provides
      antiandrogen (bicalutamide 150 mg x 1) alone. The experimental Arm B involves treatment with
      docetaxel for 8-10 cycles and antiandrogen (bicalutamide 150 mg x 1) treatment. For the
      schematic representation of study design please see Section 7.3.1.

      Subjects with a rising PSA following definitive local curative therapy will be eligible, if
      their PSA doubling time is &lt; 12 months. Also PC patients planned for anti-.androgen therapy
      are eligible, with the same criteria. Subjects with radiographic metastases will be excluded.
      The primary endpoint of the trial is progression-free survival of subjects that do not
      experience biochemical failure at 60 months from the start of therapy.

      Based on the yearly number of prostate cancer patients who undergo definitive local therapies
      and the estimated probabilities of relapse, upwards of 400 men (if +15% improvement) in the
      Scandinavian countries are potential candidates for this approach.

    <description>Progression free survival defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documentation of:
PSA progression PSA progression is considered to occur when PSA is +2.0 ng/ml above nadir. A confirmatory PSA must be taken no less than 6 weeks following the first rising PSA above nadir +2.0 ng/ml. If that confirmatory PSA also exceeds the above parameters, then progression has occurred. If the confirmatory PSA fails to confirm progression, then the patient will remain on study.
Radiographic progression Outcome in patients who develop radiographically metastatic disease while on study will be defined as progression independent of their respective PSA values.
These patients will be followed for evaluation of survival.
