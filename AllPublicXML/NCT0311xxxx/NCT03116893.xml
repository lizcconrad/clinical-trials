  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the relative bioavailability of BI
      685509 given alone under fasted conditions (Reference, R) compared to the intake after a high
      fat, high caloric breakfast (Test 1, T1), to combined administration with itraconazole under
      fasted conditions (Test 2, T2) and to combined administration with rifampin under fasted
      conditions (Test 3, T3).

      The secondary objective is the evaluation and comparison of several pharmacokinetic
      parameters between the treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BI 685509 is a substrate of the drug transporters P-gp and Organic anion transporting
      polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1/OATP1B3). Inhibition of these transport proteins may result
      in an increased drug exposure which might impact the safety of the patients. Therefore this
      trial should investigate whether and to what extent the inhibition of P-gp (mediated by
      itraconazole) and the inhibition of OATP1B1/OATP1B3 (mediated by rifampin) affects kinetics
      of BI 685509. Itraconazole and rifampin are recommended probe drugs to test in-vivo
      inhibition of P-gp and OATP1B1/OATP1B3.

      Furthermore the food effect will be investigated in this study.
