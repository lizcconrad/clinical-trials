  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The infection rate after Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is about 1%. It is a serious condition,
      with high morbidity, sometimes fatal, requiring costly treatment.

      The treatment is difficult because &quot;biofilm&quot; forms very early after the bacterial
      contamination of the prosthesis.

      Prevent infection means reduce or prevent the formation of bacterial biofilm and controlling
      protein response to allow osseous-integration of the prosthesis.

      A new prosthesis was developped, grafted by PolyNaSS (polysodium styrenesulfonate). This
      bioactive polymer allows to substantially reduce bacterial adhesion, biocompatibility,
      bio-integration in preclinical studies. This first clinical study aims to compare the
      osseous-integration of this prosthesis to the same prothesis with no grafting.

      No previous clinical trial
