      The investigators primary objective is to determine the safety and toxicity of incorporating
      blinatumomab into the post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) maintenance
      setting for patients with CD19+-B-cell malignancies (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia [ALL],

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-B ALL, low and high grade NHL who underwent an alloHSCT using posttransplant CY
             GVHD prophylaxis (Pt-Cy alone or combination with MMF/tacrolimus or sirolimus) as
             follows:

               -  Pre-B ALL patients in CR1 with high-risk features such as adverse cytogenetics
                  including t(9;22), t(4;11) or other MLL rearrangements, t(8;14), complex
                  karyotype (≥5 chromosomal abnormalities), hypodiploidy (&lt;44 chromosomes), low
                  hypodiploidy (30-39 chromosomes)/near triploidy (60-68 chromosomes), high WBC
                  count at presentation (≥30,000), lack of achievement of complete remission after
                  standard induction chemotherapy (but achieved CR1 following salvage or
                  consolidation), or persistence of detectable disease after induction and
                  consolidation (intensification) or pre-transplant as documented on any of routine
                  clinical tests (morphology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics or molecular studies) OR
                  all Pre-B ALL patients in second and higher CR

               -  Low and high grade NHL following a nonmyeloablative (reduced-intensity
                  conditioning) transplant irrespective of pre-transplant disease status

          -  Patients should be at least 60 but not more than 180 days from transplant with
             documented count recovery (ANC &gt;1 x109/L, and non-transfused platelets &gt;30x109/L) and
             no evidence of disease progression

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  In agreement to use an effective barrier method of birth control (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) to avoid pregnancy during the study and for a

             experience unacceptable toxicities with prior blinatumomab administration. If patient
             was refractory (no response) to blinatumomab in the past, patient will be eligible if
             there was no evidence of CD19 loss on leukemia cells.

             Parkinson's disease, cerebellar disease, psychosis, or other significant CNS
             abnormalities. A history of treated CNS leukemia or lymphoma will be allowed if recent
             imaging and CSF studies confirm the absence of active CNS disease at the time of study
