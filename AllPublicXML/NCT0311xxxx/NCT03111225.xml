    <textblock>
      This study examines the prevalence of trigger points in muscles in the thorax in upper limb
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) patients, compared to healthy subjects. In addition, we
      will examine if adding treatment to muscles in the thoracic area (to the regular physical
      therapy treatment) will alleviate some of the sensitivity in the upper limb in CRPS patients.

      This study examines the prevalence of trigger points in muscles in the thorax in upper limb
      Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) patients, compared to healthy subjects. The muscles
      that will be examined are: Subclavius, Pectoralis minor, Rhomboids, Infraspinatus and
      Serratus superior posterior.

      In addition, we will examine if adding treatment to muscles in the thoracic area (to the
      regular physical therapy treatment) will alleviate some of the sensitivity in the upper limb
      in CRPS patients.This will be examined in an A-B-A design: at first the patients will be
      examined. Then they will recieve conventional physiotherapy treatment for a month. After a
      month, they will be examined again, and then they will recieve soft tissue massage to the
      thoracic area for 15 minutes in addition to the conventional physiotherapy treatment. After a
      month of the combined treatment, the patients will be examined a third and final time.
