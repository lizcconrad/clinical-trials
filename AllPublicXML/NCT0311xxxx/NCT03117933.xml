  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will compare the drugs olaparib and cediranib with standard chemotherapy in BRCA1/2
      mutated platinum resistant ovarian cancer. Patients will be randomised to one of three
      treatment groups: olaparib only, olaparib and cediranib and the control group paclitaxel. The
      aim is to compare efficacy of the 3 treatments and also how well each treatment is tolerated
      including the participants quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor which targets BRCA1/2 mutated tumour cells and cediranib is an
      anti-angiogenic drug which reduces blood supply to the tumour, suppressing tumour viability.
      Phase I/II trials of both drugs have shown these are well tolerated alone or in combination
      in ovarian cancer.

      The trial aims to compare the efficacy of the combination and of olaparib alone with
      paclitaxel chemotherapy and whether the olaparib/cediranib combination is better tolerated
      thus improving quality of life. Secondly standard paclitaxel chemotherapy must be
      administered weekly at hospital whereas the olaparib/cediranib combination can be
      administered at home potentially also improving patient quality of life.

      Participants will have a BRCA1/2 mutation and their tumour be resistant to platinum based
      therapies. Participants will be randomised into one of the 3 treatment arms after
      stratification for prior PARP/anti-angiogenic treatments. Participants will be on trial up to
      18 months.
