  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety with
      transfer of embryos selected by next generation sequencing (NGS) versus conventional
      morphological criteria. Subjects with 3 or more blastocysts on day 5 of embryo culture will
      be randomized to the PGS or IVF group. A Freeze-all strategy and a single frozen blastocyst
      transfer will be performed in both PGS and IVF groups. The primary outcome is the cumulative
      live birth after transfers of up to 3 single blastocycsts in both groups.

      This is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety with
      transfer of embryos selected by next generation sequence (NGS) and morphologic criteria
      versus by morphological criteria alone. Subjects who obtain 3 or more good-quality
      blastocysts will be randomized to PGS or IVF group. All embryos will be frozen and a single
      thawed blastocyst will be transferred in both PGS and IVF group. Subjects in the PGS group
      will have 3 blastocysts sequenced and euploid embryos will be subsequently transferred.
      Subjects in the IVF group will have blastocysts selected by morphology assessment. The
      cumulative live birth rate will be counted after transfers of all euploid embryo in the PGS
      group and 3 blastocysts in the IVF group within 1 year after randomization.

    <description>Live birth is defined as the delivery of any viable infant at 28 weeks or more of gestation after our interventions, and cumulative live birth rate is calculated by dividing the number of women achieving live birth after transfers of all study-specific embryos (up to 3 transfers of single blastocycst within 1 year after randomization), by the total number of women randomized to the specific group.</description>
