  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women who require thyroid hormone replacement medication, the investigators will compare 2
      ways to adjust thyroid medication during pregnancy to determine superiority in maintaining
      optimal blood levels of thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone requirements increase significantly
      in pregnancy and it is important that blood levels of thyroid hormone remain normal so the
      fetus, which cannot make its own thyroid hormone has enough for early prenatal development.
      This trial compares 2 methods for adjusting thyroid medicine during pregnancy in women with
      known thyroid disease. Pregnant women (age 18 to 45) who take thyroid medication will be
      randomized to either 1) a 2-dose per week increase in thyroid medicine once pregnancy is
      confirmed, followed by dose adjustments every 2-4 weeks, or 2) adjustments in thyroid
      medication every 2-4 weeks in micrograms per day based on results of blood tests. The
      investigators will compare thyroid hormone levels throughout pregnancy between the groups of
      mothers to determine which method is superior in meeting the increased thyroid hormone
      requirements during pregnancy.

    <description>Patients in this group will increase pre-pregnancy thyroid hormone dose by 2 doses/week (extra dose on Wednesday and Saturday). Further dose adjustment are made every 2-4 weeks based on serum TSH, as shown below:
TSH&gt;10mIU/L, increase by 3 doses/week
TSH 5.0-9.9mIU/L, increase by 2 doses/week
TSH 2.0-4.9mIU/L, increase by 1 dose/week
TSH 0.4-1.9mIU/L, no change
TSH&lt;0.4mIU/L, decrease by 1 dose/week
TSH&lt;0.1mIU/L, decrease by 2 doses/week
Thyroid hormone dose will NOT be decreased due to TSH&lt;0.4mIU/L during the 1st trimester unless patient also has elevated circulating T4 and/or T3 levels, indicate of true hyperthyroidism.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group adjust thyroid hormone dose based on Visit 1 TSH and pre-pregnancy thyroid hormone dose. Further dose adjustments are made every 2-4 weeks based on serum TSH, as shown below:
TSH&gt;10mIU/L, increase dose by 50mcg/day if dose &lt;125mcg/day or increase by 75mcg/day if dose &gt;125mcg
TSH 5.0-9.9mIU/L, increase dose by 25mcg/day if dose &lt;125mcg/day or increase by 50mcg/day if dose &gt;125mcg
TSH 2.0-4.9mIU/L, increase dose by 12.5mcg/day if dose &lt;125mcg/day or increase by 25mcg/day if dose &gt;125mcg
