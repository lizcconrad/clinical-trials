  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a frequent heart rhythm disorder, responsible for the formation
      of cardiac thrombi, which can embolize in the systemic circulation, responsible for strokes
      (Cerebrovascular accidents). AF increases the risk of stroke and stroke-related disability.
      Preventing the thromboembolic risk associated with FMD is therefore a public health issue.
      The reference treatment is oral anticoagulation but this treatment is contraindicated in
      patients with a history of intracranial hemorrhage. The percutaneous closure of the auricle
      is a recent technique which makes it possible to exclude this appendix from the left atrium
      where the majority of thrombi are formed in the framework of the AF. Comparative studies have
      shown the effectiveness of this technique, appearing to be similar to that of
      anticoagulation. However, in view of the per-procedural risk, the indication of closure was
      retained by the health authorities only in the event of a contraindication to oral
      anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular AF with a high thromboembolic risk. Patients
      with a history of intracranial hemorrhage are therefore candidates for this technique, but
      there are few studies where these patients were included. The risk-benefit must be
      demonstrated over the long term, in terms of ischemic, hemorrhagic recurrence and becoming
      functional and cognitive.
