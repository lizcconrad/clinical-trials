  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OMP-31M32. OMP-313M32 is
      an experimental anti-TIGIT antibody that was developed to block TIGIT from binding PVR
      allowing the body's T-cells to destroy cancer cells.

      This is an open-label, Phase 1a dose escalation study of OMP-31M32 administered as a single
      agent to evaluate the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study consists of a screening period,
      a treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients will be followed
      for survival for up to 2 years. Subjects will be enrolled in two stages: a dose escalation
      stage and an expansion stage.

             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications.
