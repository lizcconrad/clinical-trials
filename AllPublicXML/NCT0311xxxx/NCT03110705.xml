      Background: within the components of Scuba diving there are similarities with meditation and
      mindfulness techniques. Perceived stress is known to be diminished during meditation
      practice. This study evaluates the benefits of scuba diving on perceived stress and mindful
      functioning.

      Method: A recreational diving group, composed of 37 subjects, was compared with a multisport
      control group, composed of 30 subjetcs, on perceived stress, mood, well-being and mindfulness
      by answering auto-questionnaires before and after a one-week long course. For the diving
      group, stability of the effects was evaluated one month later using similar
      auto-questionnaires.
