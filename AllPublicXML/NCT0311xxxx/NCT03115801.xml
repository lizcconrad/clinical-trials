      The trial is open to patients who have metastatic renal cell carcinoma/urothelial (bladder)
      carcinoma with at least 2 measurable sites of disease. All eligible patients will be randomly
      assigned to immunotherapy(nivolumab/atezolizumab) versus immunotherapy
      (nivolumab/atezolizumab) plus radiotherapy, 10 Gy x3 (conformally or by intensity modulation
      radiation therapy/Image-guided radiation therapy (IMRT/IGRT) to maximally spare normal
      tissue), to one of their measurable lesions.

      The trial is open to patients who have metastatic renal cell carcinoma/urothelial (bladder)
      carcinoma with at least 2 measurable sites of disease. All eligible patients will be randomly
      assigned to immunotherapy(nivolumab/atezolizumab) versus immunotherapy
      (nivolumab/atezolizumab) plus radiotherapy, 10 Gy x3 (conformally or by IMRT/IGRT to
      maximally spare normal tissue), to one of their measurable lesions. For patients assigned to
      the immunotherapy plus radiotherapy arm, immunotherapy treatment starts with the first
      radiotherapy fraction. Nivolumab will be given every 2 weeks for patients with metastatic
      renal cell cancer and atezolizumab will be given every 3 weeks for patients with metastatic
      urothelial cancer. Patients will be re-imaged at 9 week (year 1) or 12 week (years 2-3)
      intervals and evaluated for response (defined as an objective response of measurable
      metastatic sites outside the radiation field). This response will be evaluated with CT scans
      in non-irradiated measurable metastatic sites per RECIST version 1.1. Patients will continue
      to receive their respective immunotherapies for up to three years or until disease
      progression or until a dose limiting toxicity is reached.
