      The aim of this observational study registry is to assess the safety of a Non-ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) rapid rule-out strategy as proposed by European Guidelines in
      patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome to the emergency department.

      Design: mono-center observational study in a University chest pain unit

      Duration: 12 months recruitment period starting June 2016 with end of recruitment July 2017.
      In the first 6 months assessment of situation, January 2017 introduction of fast protocols,
      i.e. 0/1 h as standard, observation of trend changes, utilization rates, safety from January
      1st until July 2017. Another 90 days follow-up after last patient in.

      Background: Several rule-out protocols recommended by 2015 European Society of Cardiology
      (ESC) guidelines, evidence supported by prospectively validated studies. However, no real
      life experience with ultilization rates and safety.

      Particularly overcrowded emergency departments (EDs) or CPUs are likely to benefit most from
      fast rule-out protocols in order to discharge a substantial proportion of low risk patients.

      Study group: consecutive patients presenting to CPU with suspected acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) based on chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms

      Inclusion criteria: eligible to consent, &gt; 18 years

      Exclusion criteria: rule-in, observational zone, chronic hemodialysis, no consent, atrial
      tachyarrhythmias with chest pain or equivalent.

      Data collection on: demographics, rule-out diagnostic protocol (instant cardiac
      troponin+Copeptin, instant at Limit of Detection, 0-1h, 0-3 h, 0-6 hour, other; time of
      second sample from admission; turnaround time for first and consecutive sample(s); rates of
      echo, computed tomography (CT) coronary or CT pulmonary artery, CT chest or CT triple
      rule-out, chest X-ray, stress test performed or recommended within 3 working days; length of
      stay in ED, length of stay in hospital including initial referral; rates of admission,
      discharge or referral; rates of in-hospital percutaneous coronary Intervention (PCI) or
      coronary artery Bypass graft (CABG), coronary angiography findings based on a definition of
      obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) ≥ 50% stenosis.

      Specific data: Number of patients seeking attendance in CPU per day (crowding index), GRACE
      score, secondary risk factors present or not (leftventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40%,
      glomerular filtration rate&lt; 60 ml/min, Diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction
      (MI), previous CABG, prior PCI, ST segment depression). Rule-out protocols are stratified by
      hour ± 30 min, i.e. 0-1 h (±30 min), 0-2 h (±30 min), 0-3 h (±30 min) etc.

      Clinical work-up results: stress test before discharge positive or negative, transthoracic
      echocardiography: wall motion abnormalities, LVEF, valvular heart disease, structural heart
      disease, Endpoint(s): primary safety endpoint defined as survival free of all-cause death,
      secondary endpoints: survival free of death or MI, survival free of
      death/MI/re-hospitalisation for ACS, survival free of death/MI/rehospitalisation for
      non-elective revascularization

      Follow-up: 30 days and 3 months follow-up (FU) for all-cause death, MI, re-hospitalisation
      for ACS, re-hospitalisation for non-elective PCI or CABG Statistical plan: no sample size
      calculation, Student´s T-test, ANOVA, Kaplan Meier survival, Cox proportional regression
      analysis

      Milestones: Start immediately after contract for a recruitment period 9/16 - 9/17 (12 months)
      plus 3 months FU after last patient in. Additional 3 months for completion of files and FU
      data.
