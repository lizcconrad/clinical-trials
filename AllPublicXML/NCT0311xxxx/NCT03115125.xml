  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe sepsis and septic shock are the most severe forms of sepsis (which associates a
      systemic inflammatory response with infection). These are serious pathologies with a
      lethality estimated at almost 40% at 28 days (after the onset of sepsis).

      After a first pro-inflammatory phase, a second compensatory phase called Compensatory
      Anti-Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CARS) takes place quickly. Patients then show signs of
      immunosuppression and profound alterations in immune functions. It is during this phase that
      the vast majority of deaths occur, far from the onset of the shock, which is related to the
      inability of the immune system to eliminate the initial infectious agent and / or a greater
      susceptibility Important to develop secondary infections (nosocomial infection, latent virus
      reactivation ...).

      The CARS phase has been the subject of studies focusing on measuring the plasma concentration
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as Interleukin (IL) -10), the percentage of regulatory T
      lymphocytes (Treg), Or the percentage of monocytic expression of HLA-DR in septic patients.

      The investigator proposes to carry out the first study on a newly described regulatory
      lymphocytic subpopulation: regulatory B lymphocytes (Breg) from a quantitative and functional
      point of view in severe septic states.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with severe sepsis or septic shock diagnosed less than 24 hours
             (defined as D0) and hospitalized in the medical resuscitation department of the
             Amiens-Picardie University Hospital.

          -  The definitions of severe sepsis and septic shock are the result of the consensus of
             the Société de Réanimation de Langue Française dating from 2005:

               -  Sepsis refers to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the presence
                  of suspected or identified infection. Sepsis is said to be severe when lactate&gt; 4
                  mmol / L or arterial hypotension prior to filling or organ dysfunction is present
                  (one is sufficient): hypoxemia with a PaO2 / FIO2 &lt;300 ratio, renal failure with
                  Hepatic insufficiency with INR&gt; 4 or bilirubin&gt; 78 μmol / l, thrombocytopenia
                  (platelets &lt;100 000 / mm3) and hepatic insufficiency&gt; 176 μmol / l, coagulation
                  disorders with INR&gt; 1.5 Disorders of higher functions with a Glasgow Coma Score
                  &lt;13.

               -  Finally, septic shock is defined as a severe sepsis condition with persistent
                  hypotension despite a well-conducted vascular filling (20-40 ml / kg isotonic
                  saline).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with active neoplasia, immune deficiency, autoimmune disease or autoimmune
             disease.

          -  Patient under tutorship or curatorship

          -  Taking an immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment at the time of the study or
             the year prior to hospitalization for sepsis.

          -  Antecedent or haematopoietic graft in progress.

          -  Pregnancy in progress.

          -  Known history of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 or 2 or with
             hepatitis B or C virus

          -  Patient with agranulocytosis (defined as neutrophils &lt;0.5 G / L).
