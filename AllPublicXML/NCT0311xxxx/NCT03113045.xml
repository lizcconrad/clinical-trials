  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine the 90% effective seated time after intrathecal injection of
      hyperbaric bupivacaine to avoid hypotension in patients undergoing cesarean delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a Biased Coin Design (BCD), up-and-down sequential method, to determine
      the ET90 for absence of hypotension during Cesarean delivery. In this methodology, the first
      patient will be assigned an a priori initial seated time. Any other patient will be assigned
      a seated time based on the presence or absence of hypotension in the previous patient. If the
      previous patient developed hypotension, then the new patient will be seated for a longer
      time, which will be equal to the seated time of the previous patient plus a pre-determined
      time increment (up to an also pre-determined maximum allowed time). If no hypotension
      occurred to the previous patient, the new patient will be assigned one seated time from two
      choices: The same seated time that has been assigned to the previous patient, or a seated
      time shorter than that of the previous patient by a pre-determined time decrement (the
      pre-determined time increment and decrement are the same). The choice will be determined from
      a biased coin result, with a probability of 0.9 for assigning 'the same as previous' seated
      time and a probability of 0.1 for assigning a 'shorter seated time'.
