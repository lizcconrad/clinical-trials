    <textblock>
      This trial is a pivotal, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, adaptive trial
      conducted in subjects with DM and CLI Rutherford Category 4. Minimisation will be used to
      assign eligible subjects in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single intra-arterial administration of
      Rexmyelocel‑T or matching placebo into the index limb.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Type I or II DM, established more than one year ago.

          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt; 9%.

          -  Subjects with poor or no (surgical or endovascular) revascularization option
             classified as CLI Rutherford Category 4.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is controlled on medical therapy
             indicated for CLI (unless there is a documented contraindication or intolerance) and
             pain management is optimized.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (i.e., fertile, following menarche and until becoming
             post-menopausal unless permanently sterile) must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening. Men and women who are sexually active shall use effective contraceptive
             methods for the duration of their participation in this study if the partner of the
             male participant, or if the female participant is of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Advanced CLI defined as presence of major tissue loss as significant
             ulceration/gangrene proximal to the metatarsal heads (CLI Rutherford Category 6).
             Significant ulceration/gangrene means any ulceration that extends beyond the
             subcutaneous tissue layer, or any gangrene or tissue necrosis proximal to the
             metatarsal heads.

          -  CLI Rutherford Category 5.

          -  Uncontrolled or untreated proliferative retinopathy.

          -  Failed surgical or endovascular revascularization on the index leg within 10 days
             after the procedure.

          -  Subjects in whom arterial insufficiency in the lower extremity is the result of acute
             limb ischemia or an immunological or inflammatory or non-atherosclerotic disorder
             (e.g., thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's Disease), systemic sclerosis (both
             limited and diffuse forms).

          -  Clinical evidence of invasive infection on index leg defined as major tissue loss at
             the mid-foot or heel involving tendon and/or bone, and/or when intravenous antibiotics
             are required to treat the infection according to the Investigator.

          -  At screening, the presence of only neuropathic ulcers on the index leg.

          -  Amputation at or above the talus on the index leg.

          -  Planned major amputation within the first month after randomization.

          -  On the index leg, use of concomitant wound treatments not currently approved for
             ischemic wound-healing within 30 days prior to screening or plans to initiate new,
             nonstandard-of-care treatments to the index leg during the trial.

          -  Blood clotting disorder not caused by medication (e.g., thrombophilia).

          -  Severe hypertension according to the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
             Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.

          -  A platelet count &lt; 50,000/ μL.

          -  International normalised ratio (INR) &gt; 1.5.

          -  Evidence of moderate to severe hepatocellular dysfunction according to the treating
             physician.

          -  Positive test for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV 1), HIV 2, hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or Treponema pallidum.

          -  Subjects who may not be healthy enough to successfully complete all protocol
             requirements including BM collection, or who are not expected to survive more than 12
             months, or in whom results may be particularly difficult to assess, as assessed by the
             Investigator.
