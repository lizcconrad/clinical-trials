  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) procedure is known to be one of the most successful
      treatments for morbid obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and has been shown to decrease
      appetite, energy intake, body weight and glycemia both in the short and long term. A number
      of reports hypothesise that these changes may be driven, at least in part, by positive shifts
      in food preferences following surgery. However, findings are drawn from self-reported dietary
      intakes which are beset with measurement bias, thus precluding definite conclusions. The One
      Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (OAGB), or mini-gastric bypass, is another variation on the RYGB
      with one surgical connection (anastomoses) rather than two. Initial data has shown similar,
      or even slightly higher, weight loss and better resolution of diabetes post-surgery than the
      traditional RYGB, however as the technique was first reported in 2001 more long-term data is
      needed.

      The current work aims to directly observe food intake to test the hypothesis that after
      gastric bypass (traditional RYGB and OAGB) food intake changes in a manner which leads to
      beneficial outcomes on body weight when compared to weight stable control participants.
      Patients (n=32; n=16 traditional RYGB, n=16 OAGB) with a planned gastric bypass procedure
      will be recruited from Phoenix Health (Ireland and England) and Letterkenny University
      Hospital (Ireland), alongside control participants (n=16) with no planned weight loss. All
      subjects will attend the Human Intervention Studies Unit (HISU), Ulster University on four
      occasions (1-month pre-surgery and 3, 12 and 24 months post-surgery, with controls being
      time-matched). Study visits will be fully residential involving two overnight stays within
      the facility during which participants' 24-hour food intake will be covertly measured
      (7am-11pm Day 2 and breakfast Day 3) and the following procedures undertakenÍ¾ basal metabolic
      rate, body composition, bone health, assessment of liking/wanting high fat foods (Visit 1, 2
      &amp; 4 only) and post-meal gut hormone responses. On each study visit participants will have ad
      lib access to a range of foods of varying macronutrient composition and which are compatible
      with their stated food preferences (assessed prior to the start of the study). Changes in all
      ingestive behaviours will be evaluated over time as compared to the control participants and
      between groups ((traditional RYGB vs OAGB).
