  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, observational study will assess 100 subjects in the post-anesthesia care
      unit (PACU) at Parkland Hospital. Upon arrival to the PACU, patients' train-of-four (TOF)
      ratio will be calculated using the StimPod NMS450 accelerometer to determine the presence of
      any residual paralysis. Any patient with a TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 will be reassessed every 10
      minutes until the ratio is ≥0.90. The time it takes to reach a TOF ratio ≥0.9 will be
      recorded. Subjects will be classified according to BMI categories: lean as &lt;30 kg/m2, obese
      as 30≤BMI≤39.9 kg/m2, and morbidly obese as BMI ≥40 kg/m2. This data will serve as a baseline
      to assess the incidence of residual NMB that currently occurs in our PACU so that we may use
      this pilot data to design future studies that aim to reduce the incidence of residual NMB.

      Upon arrival to the PACU, patients enrolled in the study will be evaluated for residual
      paralysis with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation using the StimPod NMS450 accelerometer set to
      30 mA. Any patients who have residual paralysis will be assessed Q10 minutes until the TOF
      ratio is ≥0.9. The time to achieve a TOF ratio ≥0.9 will be recorded. Any adverse events
      (e.g., hypoxia, reintubation, aspiration) that arise during the patient's PACU stay will be
      documented.
