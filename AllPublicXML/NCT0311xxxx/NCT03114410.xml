  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a cluster-level randomized controlled design to evaluate the efficacy of
      Re:MIX in reducing the incidences of early sexual behavior, unprotected sex, oral sex,
      pregnancy, and STIs. Re:MIX is a comprehensive in-school health curriculum and teen pregnancy
      prevention program for adolescents covering a broad range of topics related to sexual health
      and youth development, including healthy relationships, communication, gender, consent,
      reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexual decision making, clinics, parenthood, and life
      planning. Re:MIX also aims to connect students and peer educators with community resources
      and service linkages. The Re:MIX curriculum teaches mixed-gender groups of students in grades
      8 to 10 to delay sex and use protection if they have sex. A co-facilitation team of peer
      educators (who are young parents) will deliver the information with professional health
      educators using non-traditional approaches, such as game-based tools, technology, and
      storytelling. Youth receive roughly nine hours and 10 minutes of group sessions during the
      school day over one semester (55 minutes per week for 10 weeks). Participants will be 8th,
      9th, and 10th graders attending three public charter schools in Travis County, Texas.
      Comparison classes will either receive an alternative program that focuses on health,
      nutrition, and fitness, or business as usual. This study is being conducted as a Rigorous
      Evaluation of New or Innovative Approaches to Prevent Teen Pregnancy funded by the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Adolescent Health.
