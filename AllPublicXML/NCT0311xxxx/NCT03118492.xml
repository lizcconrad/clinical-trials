    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the side effects of combination chemotherapy, total body
      irradiation, and donor blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with secondary
      myelofibrosis. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving combination chemotherapy and total body irradiation before a donor blood stem cell
      transplant helps to stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal
      blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of reduced-intensity (FM) haploidentical
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (Haplo-HCT) followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide
      (PTCy) in patients with advanced myelofibrosis (MF), as assessed by the evaluation of
      toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To summarize and evaluate hematologic (neutrophil and platelet) recovery. II. To estimate
      graft failure-free survival (GFS) at 100-days post-transplant. III. To estimate overall
      survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and cumulative incidence (CI) of
      relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days, 1-year, and 2-year post
      transplant.

      IV. To estimate the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), grade
      II-IV, at 100-days post-transplant (per Keystone Consensus modification of the Glucksberg
      criteria).

      V. To estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD at 1-year and 2-year post transplant
      (per National Institutes of Health [NIH] Consensus Criteria).

      VI. To characterize the severity and extent of acute and chronic GvHD.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct correlative studies and describe inflammatory cytokine levels and GVHD
      biomarker levels in plasma and T cell differentiation/functions in patients enrolled onto the
      trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -5, fludarabine IV over
      30-60 minutes on days -5 to -2. Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) on day -1 and
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) on day 0. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over
      1-2 hours on days 3 and 4. Starting on day 5, patients receive tacrolimus IV then orally (PO)
      for 6 months followed by a taper, mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) until day 35,
      and glycosylated recombinant human G-CSF AVI-014 (G-CSF) IV daily until absolute neutrophil
      count &gt; 1,500/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unexpected toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.
