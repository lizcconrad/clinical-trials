  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A person's dependency is defined as the total or partial inability to perform without helps
      the necessary activities of daily life due to activity limitations in the usual environment.
      The consequence is a restriction of participation. In physical and Rehabilitation Medicine
      (PRM), dependency impacts the healthcare team activity at several levels: patient's referral
      and care plan, conditions of home return and resumption of course of life, burden of care
      assessment and care teams management...

      The main goal of this project is the validation of a score assessing physical and cognitive
      activities of patients in follow-up care and rehabilitation (FRC) departments based on the
      ICF model (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) : the SOFMER
      Activity Scale (SAS).

      We want to propose a French generic scale allowing quantifying precisely the dependence and
      burden of care of patients in FRC departments. This scale needs to be valid, easy to apply,
      easy to learn, reproducible, sensitive to change and common to adult subjects, children and
      elderly.

    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The construct validity will be determined by an exploratory factor analysis and confirmed on an independent sample.
Criterion validity will be studied by comparison of scores obtained from SAS to scores obtained from references scale (FIM, WeeFIM, ADL, IADL, BREF, BREV, MMSE and items of WISC IV).</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the reliability of SAS.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>For the inter rater reliability study, patients will be rated on the same day by two groups of therapists.
For the test-retest reliability study, patients will be rated twice during their hospitalization, within a time frame sufficiently close so that their dependency should not change.</description>

    <measure>Study of SAS responsiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity to change will be studied on patients hospitalized in a FRC departments for obesity, spinal cord injuries, post-stroke rehabilitation or cardiorespiratory rehabilitation after cardiac surgery. The change between scores of SAS at entry and exit (or at maximum 6 months after inclusion) of hospitalization will be studied.</description>

    <description>Invariance of SAS will be determined between three age classes (&lt;18 years, 18-75 years,&gt; 75 years) using three confirmatory factor analyzes</description>
