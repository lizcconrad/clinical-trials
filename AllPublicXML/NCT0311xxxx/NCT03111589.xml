  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a substitution in
      the Î² chain of hemoglobin (Hb) which causes hemoglobin S to polymerize when deoxygenated. SCD
      patients present immune abnormalities that have always been attributed to functional
      asplenia. It it is now being recognized that patients with SCD have a pro-inflammatory
      condition with altered immune system activation contributing to the pathology of SCD.
      Increased levels of neutrophils, monocytes or cytokines have been reported in SCD patients.

      SCD is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate support.
      Actual strongly recommended therapies include chronic blood transfusions (CT) and hydroxyurea
      (HU). In addition, episodic transfusions are recommended and commonly used to manage many
      acute SCD complications.There is strong evidence to support the use of HU in adults with 3 or
      more severe vaso-occlusive crises during any 12-month period, with SCD pain or chronic
      anemia, or with severe or recurrent episodes of acute chest syndrome. HU use is now also
      common in children with SCD. Some patients receive chronic monthly RBC transfusion with the
      objective to reduce the proportion of HbS to &lt; 30 %. Long-term RBC transfusions prevent and
      treat complications of SCD decreasing the risk of stroke and the incidence of acute chest
      syndrome (ACS).

      Therapeutic complications, such as alloimmunization against RBC in 20-50% of patients or
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) graft rejection, constitute an immune-based
      clinical issue in SCD. Poorly understood RBC alloimmunization is responsible for serious
      hemolytic transfusion reaction associated with severe mortality and morbidity underlying the
      need for a better understanding of the immunology of SCD to improve SCD transfusion
      support/outcome. Little evidence exists about HU effects on immune functions in SCD. HU
      treatment doesn't appear to have deleterious effects on immune function and appears to
      decrease the abnormally elevated number of total WBC and lymphocytes, while CT does not.

      Patients with SCD are at higher risk of infections and prophylactic vaccination is strongly
      recommended. Recent data suggest that vaccinal response to pneumococcal antigens in SCD
      patients is identical to healthy control while controversy concern the stability of the
      immune protection after vaccination of SCD patient. Antibody levels declined over the year
      and the need for more frequent vaccination in SCD patient should be investigated. Currently,
      there is no evidence whether HU may interfere with pneumococcal immune response. Purohit
      showed that immune response to inactivated influenza A (H1N1) virus vaccine was altered in
      patient with SCD receiving CT but little is known on immune response to vaccination in
      patients with SCD receiving HU.

      Recent data suggest that not only inflammatory status but also humoral immune response to
      antigens in SCD patients may differ according to treatment. Yazdanbakhsh reported an
      imbalance between regulatory T cell (Treg) and effector T cell (Teff) in alloimmunized SCD
      patients with as consequence an increase in antibody production. In a model proposed by the
      authors, the balance between Treg and Teff is dictated by the monocyte control of cytokines
      expression. Altered activity of monocyte heme oxidase-1 (HO-1) would be responsible of a
      decrease in IL-12 and an increase in IL-10 cytokines secretion impacting the Treg/Teff cells
      ratio and promoting antibody production by B cells.

      The objectives of the project are to assess whether different humoral immune responses to
      vaccines or to erythrocyte alloantigens are related to the type of treatment administered to
      patients with SCD. We also aim to study if these differences might be related to different
      expressions of HO-1 by monocytes.
