      This study investigates the effects of nutritional counseling versus standard nutritional
      care on nutritional status and quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer
      submitted to radiotherapy.Half participants will receive intensive nutritional counseling
      while the other half will receive standard care.

      Considering that head and neck cancer patients usually present reduced food intake with
      consequent involuntary weight loss and significant worsening of quality of life, this study
      investigates the effects of nutritional counseling versus standard nutritional care on
      nutritional status and quality of life in patients with head and neck cancer submitted to
      radiotherapy.

      Half participants (45) will receive intensive nutritional counseling, that is, once they are
      admitted to the study and once a week during radiotherapy, following the protocol of
      nutritional care to cancer patients in radiotherapy proposed by the American Dietetic
      Association (ADA).

      The other half (45) will receive standard care, that is, nutritional counseling / education
      performed by hospital nurses and nutritional care performed by the hospital nutritionist
      (when there is a demand, usually 1 to 2 times during oncologic treatment).
