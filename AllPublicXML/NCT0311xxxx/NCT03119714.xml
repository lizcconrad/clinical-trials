  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the influence of the non-steroidal candidate-drug
      pemirolast on allergen-induced airway obstruction and inflammation in allergic subjects with
      asthma. Pemirolast is an orally available inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators.
      The study will therefore test the hypothesis that global inhibition of the mast cell,
      resulting in decreased production of most of its mediator molecules, will provide a highly
      significant anti-asthmatic effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a crossover randomized double blind, placebo-controlled study where the early and
      late response to allergen inhalation challenge will be compared during two treatment periods,
      with pemirolast 200 mg bid for 14 (to 16) days and matching placebo, respectively.
      Non-smoking female and male subjects (n = 12-15) with intermittent atopic asthma, requiring
      only β2-agonists to treat their asthma, will be recruited. A total of twelve subjects who
      demonstrate an early and a late asthmatic response to inhaled allergen challenge are required
      to complete the study for the primary end-point. The sample size is sufficient according to
      experience from a large number of studies and published power calculations of the model. The
      effects of pemirolast have never been studied before in an allergen provocation model.
      Primary variable is the effect of treatment on the mean maximum fall in forced expiratory
      volume in one second (FEV1) during the early and the late asthmatic reactions induced by
      allergen. Secondary variables are the effect on mast cell activation and airway inflammation
      measured as the urinary excretion of metabolites of prostaglandins and other lipid mediators
      and the percentage of sputum eosinophils, respectively. Tertiary variables are the effect of
      treatment on airway responsiveness expressed as the provocative dose of methacholine causing
      20 per cent decrease in FEV1 (PD20FEV1), as well as biomarkers of airway inflammation in
      saliva, sputum, exhaled air and blood.
