      This study will engage hospitals working with the New Mexico Perinatal Collaborative (NMPC)
      on implementing immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception programs. All
      hospitals in New Mexico interested in implementing immediate postpartum LARC programs will be
      eligible to participate in the NPMC program evaluation. The study will evaluate the
      components of this implementation program at several New Mexico hospitals using a stepped
      wedge design,with components being introduced to each hospital one at a time
