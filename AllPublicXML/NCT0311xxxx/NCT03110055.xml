  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause
      of cancer-related deaths in the world. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common underlying
      cause of cirrhosis and HCC in the western world. Most patients with HCC present with either
      non-resectable tumor and/or severe underlying liver dysfunction, and are not suitable
      candidates for curative treatments by resection or transplantation. Thus, for the majority of
      patients with HCV related HCC, the only option is prolongation of life without a chance for
      cure. These patients generally have a poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1
      year. Arterial obstruction of branches of the hepatic artery and simultaneous infusion of
      chemotherapy (Trans-arterial chemo-embolization or TACE) induces ischemic tumor necrosis with
      a high rate of objective tumor responses (30-60%). Overall, the median survival after TACE
      for intermediate HCC is about 20 months, an improvement over supportive care. Treatment with
      Grazoprevir/Elbasvir showed excellent results in phase 3 studies for patients with HCV
      genotype 1 (a and b) and genotype 4 infection and is approved for HCV treatment in the USA,
      Europe and Israel. Anti-HCV therapies may influence HCC biology by decreasing inflammation
      and may thus alter the tumor microenvironment.

      Single center, open label, prospective pilot study. The study will include 20 HCV genotype 1
      (a and b) cirrhotic patients (Child Pugh A compensated cirrhosis) with advanced,
      un-resectable HCC who are eligible for TACE. This pilot study will have one arm which will be
      compared to historical controls. All patients participating in the study will receive
      Grazoprevir/Elbasvir treatment according to established guidelines together with regular TACE
      treatments. The historical controls will refer to patients who received regular TACE
      treatments alone (standard of HCC care). Follow up will be for up to 24 months from TACE
      initiation.
