  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are involved in a clinical protocol driven 12 week medical weight loss
      intervention will be randomized to receive either a placebo or 600 mg of an ashwagandha root
      extract. The study endpoints are primarily the patients self-reported perception of life
      stress and sleep quality. The working hypothesis of this study is that the addition of
      aschwagandha to .the medical weight loss program will improve the self-reported perception of
      life stress and sleep quality

    <intervention_model_description>If the PSS score is than 20, those patients who are interested in participating are consented to the Ashwagandha study. The patients will then be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a 31 day supply of study capsules which will be either Ashwagandha 300mg twice a day or identical placebo capsules in a 1:1 ratio. They will be given careful directions into the use of the study capsules and will be asked to mark a daily log (See addendum #3: Treatment Log) of taking the capsules in the morning and at night.</intervention_model_description>
