  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in the emergency room is under documented and pain relief suboptimal. Data on nurse
      driven analgesia in emergency department waiting rooms is lacking. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine the proportion of patients in pain receiving pain therapy
      administered by the triage nurse (prevalence study). The secondary objectives are to 1)
      describe nursing practices in analgesia and adherence to the dedicated protocol; 2) to
      determine the factors associated with the non administration of painkillers and for these
      factors, to estimate the strength of the association
