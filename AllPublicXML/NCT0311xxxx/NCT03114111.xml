    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the treatment of seborrheic
           dermatitis.

        2. To determine how PDT alters the skin microbiome in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis
           before and after treatment.

        3. To determine how PDT alters sebum secretion rates in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis
           before and after treatment.

      The researchers hypothesize that PDT will be efficacious in the treatment of seborrheic
      dermatitis.

    <description>The treatment will consist of split-face comparisons of no application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) vs ALA application to either half of the face. Prior to ALA application, the face will be swabbed for microbiome analysis. After the ALA application, the subjects will incubate with the ALA on their face per the standard PDT protocol used at UC Davis Dermatology clinic for facial PDT treatments. The side of the face being treated will remain the same during all treatments.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>For the placebo, Demo Levulan Kerastick, which contains no active ingredient and is enclosed in same cardboard sleeve and cap, will be applied to the other side of the face to mimic the surface of the ALA application stick. After the placebo application, the subjects will incubate with the placebo on their face per the standard PDT protocol used at UC Davis Dermatology clinic for facial PDT treatments. The side of the face being treated will remain the same during all treatments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects 18 years or older with seborrheic dermatitis of the face will be
             included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are taking systemic corticosteroids (at doses of prednisone greater than
             or equal to 5 mg daily), antibiotics (PO, IM or IV) or using topical anti- fungals,
             steroids, antibiotics, permethrin, or calcineurin inhibitors within 2 weeks prior to
             the study will be excluded.

          -  The exclusion criteria will also include the presence of other untreated inflammatory
             conditions (such as lupus, atopic dermatitis, or psoriasis) or untreated malignancies
             on the face (including skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell
             carcinoma and melanoma).

          -  Any subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study
             medication or a history of photosensitivity due to conditions such as lupus
             erythematosus and porphyria will be excluded.

          -  Subjects who have had photodynamic therapy (PDT) to the face for any reason within the
             past year will be excluded as well.

          -  Adults unable to consent, individuals under the age of 18, pregnant or breastfeeding
             women and prisoners will be excluded from the study.
