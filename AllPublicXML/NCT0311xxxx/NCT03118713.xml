  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the renal protective effect of ipragliflozin
      in combination with metformin on the percent change of UACR from baseline to 24 weeks against
      glimepiride in combination with metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with
      albuminuria. The secondary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and impact
      on quality of life (QoL) of ipragliflozin in combination with metformin against glimepiride
      in combination with metformin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with albuminuria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study that will compare ipragliflozin/metformin with
      glimepiride/metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with albuminuria.

      The study will include screening and 24-week treatment period. Subjects entering the study
      have been on a stable dose of at least 1000 mg/day metformin monotherapy for at least 8 weeks
      (56 days) prior to Visit 1. For randomization, subject will be stratified by the site and the
      administration of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (angiotensin receptor blockers and/or
      angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors) at Visit 2. Subjects will be centrally randomized
      to either ipragliflozin/metformin group or glimepiride/metformin group and receive 24-week
      treatment by each group
