  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) surgery results in greater resolution of type 2 diabetes than
      all other bariatric surgical procedures, and it is hypothesized that this procedure has
      specific beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis beyond weight loss alone. The BPD
      procedure is performed in more than 150 patients/year by surgeons at the Division of Obesity
      and Metabolic Disorders, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, School of Medicine, in
      Rome, Italy. The purpose of this study is to provide a better understanding of the effect of
      the BPD bariatric surgical procedure on insulin action and pancreatic beta cell function. It
      is hypothesized that weight loss achieved with BPD surgery will have greater effects on
      insulin sensitivity and beta cell function than weight loss induced by Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGB).

    <description>In Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery a small gastric pouch is created and connected to a segment of jejunum. Bowel continuity is restored by reconnecting the &quot;Roux&quot; limb and the biliopancreatic limb approximately ~75-150 cm distal to the gastrojejunostomy. Therefore, ingested food bypasses most of the stomach, the entire duodenum, and a short segment of the jejunum.</description>

    <description>In Biliopancreatic Diversion Surgery a horizontal gastrectomy is conducted leaving a portion of the stomach, which is connected to the small intestine, ~250 cm from the ileocecal valve and the biliopancreatic limb is connected to the ileum, ~50 cm from the ileocecal valve. Digestive secretions from the biliopancreatic limb mix in the common channel, where ingested food is also delivered by the alimentary limb.</description>
